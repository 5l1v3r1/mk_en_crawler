NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias and newly elected Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu start a new round of negotiations Wednesday (May 26th) to reunify the divided island, after a two-month break for presidential elections in the Turkish-dominated north. On Tuesday, UN Special Envoy for Cyprus Alexander Downer said that a deal is within reach. "There is no doubt that a Cypriot solution is doable," Downer told reporters. "It is not beyond their grasp," he added. (Reuters, CNA - 25/05/10)

SPLIT, Croatia -- Meeting with his Croatian counterpart Ivo Sanader on Friday (16 July), Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano said the situation in the Balkans would improve with the election of Boris Tadic as president of Serbia. Regional progress would be impossible without stability in Serbia, he added. Tadic beat extreme nationalist Tomislav Nikolic in a run-off election on 27 June. Nano also stressed the importance of integration into the EU and NATO. He and Sanader discussed ways to establish closer bilateral economic links and efforts to join NATO and the EU.

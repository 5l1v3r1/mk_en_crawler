STRASBOURG, France -- Politicians from Greece, Turkey and divided Cyprus are in the final hours of their effort to bring peace and reunification to the Mediterranean island after three decades of division. Any issues that remain by the end of Wednesday (31 March) will be settled by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. His plan will then be put to referendums in the two communities in fewer than three weeks. EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen expressed optimism regarding the progress of negotiations. He attended the negotiations under way in Switzerland, but went back to Strasbourg on Tuesday to brief the European Commission on developments. (AP - 31/03/04; CNA, Anadolu Agency, NTV - 30/03/04)

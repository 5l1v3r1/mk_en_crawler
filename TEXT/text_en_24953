BELGRADE, Serbia -- Full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal does not necessarily mean former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic's arrest and extradition, Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt told the daily Vecernje Novosti on Saturday (January 31st). Serbia first needs to achieve full co-operation, which will lead to complete success -- Mladic's capture -- regardless of whether this happens soon or at a later time, Bildt said. He also reaffirmed there will be no additional conditions for Serbia's EU accession, including recognition of Kosovo's independence. Sweden assumes the rotating EU presidency in July.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Court proceedings in the trial against former Macedonian Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski and former security official Johan Tarculovski wrapped up at the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague on Thursday (May 8th). In an unusual move, the pair asked to address the court, thanking participants for their fairness and urging the judges to acquit them of all charges. Boskovski and Tarculovski are accused of war crimes committed against ethnic Albanians during a two-day police raid on the village of Ljuboten in August 2001.
Also on Thursday, the tribunal announced that the trial against Momcilo Perisic, the former chief of staff of the Yugoslav Army, begins on July 24th. He will be tried for war crimes and crimes against humanity. (Makfax, A1 TV, Focus, Fena - 08/05/08)

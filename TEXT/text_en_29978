BUCHAREST, Romania -- The cabinet initiated accountability procedures Monday (April 18th) regarding the social code law and the wage cap in education, a process that approves measures without a vote by parliament. The process does however open the cabinet to no-confidence motions. Though this is an emergency procedure applied in exceptional situations, Prime Minister Emil Boc has used this technique for the approval of 14 laws in the past two years. The opposition alliance Social-Liberal Union (USL) will appeal the move before the Constitutional Court and submit a criminal complaint against Boc.

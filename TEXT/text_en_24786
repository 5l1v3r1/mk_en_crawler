PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Montenegro will hold extraordinary general elections on March 29th, the Podgorica-based newspaper Vijesti reported on Sunday (January 4th), quoting sources. According to the newspaper, the government will convene at an extraordinary session on January 20th to discuss the issue. Sources from the government coalition confirmed it has scheduled a meeting for Monday to decide on the extraordinary session. Both the Democratic Party of Socialists and the Social Democratic Party proposed the initiative. Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic hinted last month about the possibility of early elections in the spring. The current government's mandate expires in 2010, but a 2007 agreement set late 2009 as the date for the next elections. (Vijesti, RTS - 04/01/09)

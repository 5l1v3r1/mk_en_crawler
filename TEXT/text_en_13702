SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Five senior officials in the specialised police unit fighting organised crime resigned on Thursday (20 October), according to the interior ministry. The five blame problems with the new laws regulating the ministry and an inability to work with Iliya Iliev, the ministry's new secretary general. While some media reports praised the efforts of the five officials, others note the resignations follow strong criticism from Interior Minister Rumen Petkov regarding the wave of unsolved murders of organised crime lords, most of them occurring in downtown areas during business hours.

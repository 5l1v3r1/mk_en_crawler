ATHENS, Greece -- Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos arrived in Athens on Wednesday (17 August) to be briefed about Sunday's crash of a Cypriot plane, which killed all 121 people aboard. Afterwards, Papadopoulos said he was completely satisfied with the actions of Greek authorities before, during and after the crash.
Citing unnamed defence ministry sources, state-run NET television reported on Wednesday that someone on board may have made a last, desperate attempt to save the Helios Airways 737 before it crashed into a mountainside. The pilots of two Greek Air Force F-16 jets scrambled to fly alongside the aircraft say someone in the cockpit took control of the plane as it flew in a gradually descending holding pattern, apparently on autopilot, near the Athens airport. That person then banked away from Athens, lowering the plane first to 2,000 feet and then climbing back to 7,000 feet before the plane apparently ran out of fuel and crashed. (ANA, AP - 17/08/05)

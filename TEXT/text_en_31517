ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatian President Stipe Mesic said Saturday (19 April) that the country should not rush regular general elections, and that they should be scheduled for the spring of 2004. Several weeks ago, state authorities implied general elections could take place late this year. Mesic said that the main task of the government is to adopt a budget for 2004, and that parallel election procedures could interfere with the normal budget planning. The president also said a parliamentary vote in the fall could create problems for the successful completion of the tourist season. (HINA - 19/04/03)

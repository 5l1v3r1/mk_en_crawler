Corruption is still rampant across the globe, Transparency International said Wednesday (20 October) as it released its latest survey on corruption perceptions. 
"Corruption in large-scale public projects is a daunting obstacle to sustainable development, and results in a major loss of public funds needed for education, healthcare and poverty alleviation, both in developed and developing countries," Peter Eigen, the chairman of the Berlin-based anti-corruption watchdog, said at a press conference in London. 
The group's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) 2004 shows that 106 out of the surveyed 146 countries score less than 5 out of a possible score of 10. Sixty countries -- including Romania, Macedonia, Serbia-Montenegro and Albania -- score less than 3 out of 10, indicating rampant corruption, the group said in a press release. 
Among those countries, Romania stands highest with a score of 2.9, which puts it in 87th place along with the Dominican Republic and Iran. With a score of 2.7 each, Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro both rank 97th in the CPI along with Algeria, Lebanon and Nicaragua. Albania, at 2.5, shares the 108th position with Argentina, Libya and the Palestinian Authority. 
"If we hope to reach the Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of people living in extreme poverty by 2015, governments need to seriously tackle corruption in public contracting," said Eigen. His group estimates that at least $400 billion is lost worldwide every year due to bribery in government procurement. 
Following the survey's release, Romanian Justice Minister Cristian Diaconescu said Bucharest viewed it as a signal that it must step up its efforts. 
While scoring better, all other SEE countries -- except for Cyprus (5.4) -- are in the group of 106 with scores below 5. 
With a score of 4.3, Greece ranks 49th, alongside Surinam. Bulgaria's score of 4.1 puts it in 54th place, together with Mauritius and Namibia. Bulgaria is listed among a group of countries, including Spain, Mexico, Colombia, that have made "significant changes for the better" in fighting corruption over the past eight years. 
Croatia is in 67th position, with Peru, Poland, Sri Lanka; each received a score of 3.5. With a score of 3.2, Turkey is 77th, along with Benin, Egypt, Mali and Morocco. Bosnia and Herzegovina got a score of 3.1 and 82nd position in the CPI, alongside Madagascar. 
The CPI is a poll of polls, reflecting the perceptions of resident and non-resident business people and country analysts. This year's index is based on 18 surveys conducted by 12 independent institutions between 2002 and 2004.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament appointed an ombudsman, endorsing the nomination of Ginyo Ganev at its Wednesday (13 April) session, after more than a year of delay and two failed attempts. Ganev's candidacy -- raised by the opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party -- was endorsed after the ruling coalition extended its support. Ganev is a former deputy parliament speaker.

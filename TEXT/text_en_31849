VARNA, Bulgaria -- Deputy Defence Minister Ivo Ivanov said on Monday (31 March) that the country will deploy a chemical unit to the Persian Gulf this month, probably in mid-April. It would likely take up position in a country neighbouring Iraq.
In other news Monday, Bulgaria's ruling coalition and the state privatisation agency decided to suspend talks on the sale of the large tobacco holding, Bulgartabac. The government had selected Tobacco Capital Partners as the preferred buyer in the tender, which was launched last year. But cabinet members say the buyer failed to submit acceptable bank guarantees.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, leader of the ruling VMRO-DPMNE, wrapped up a two-day meeting on Saturday (16 September) with the leaders of opposition parties in parliament. The Democratic Union of Integration's (DUI) Ali Ahmeti, however, refused to attend. Speaking to local media afterwards, Gruevski voiced about his absence but noted that Abduladi Vejseli, the chairman of DUI's coalition ally, the Party of Democratic Prosperity (PDP), participated and demonstrated a constructive approach. The DUI-PDP coalition is boycotting parliament due to VMRO-DPMNE's decision to exclude DUI from the new government. (A1 TV, Vecer, Utrinski Vesnik - 16/09/06)

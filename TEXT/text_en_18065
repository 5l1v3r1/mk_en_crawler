BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of the Novi Pazar regional court, Camil Hubic, announced on Sunday (March 18th) that an investigative judge ordered 30 days in detention for four men arrested during police raids on an alleged training camp for Wahhabi extremists last week. They are suspected of plotting actions against Serbia's constitutional order and security.

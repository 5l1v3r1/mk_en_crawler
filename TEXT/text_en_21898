BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic warned on Saturday (November 22nd) that Serbia will react strongly to any attempt by Albanian separatists from Kosovo to threaten border security. He was referring to reports of possible attempts by "terrorist groups of Albanians separatists" to breach security along the administrative border and raid Serbia. This information comes at a time "when Serbia is winning diplomatic battles at the UN General Assembly and after the announcement that UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will adopt Serbia's demands [on the EU's EULEX mission in Kosovo]," Dacic said during a tour of several checkpoints at the border.
In other news Saturday, former Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku said his young country will soon be establishing its own armed forces to ensure domestic security. Ceku, who also once led the Kosovo Liberation Army, told Palma Plus television that these forces will be "something between an army and police".

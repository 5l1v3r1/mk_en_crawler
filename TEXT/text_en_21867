BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Translating Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) 1,300-page Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU into all 22 official EU languages may end up delaying the ceremony, BiH Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj said on Friday (April 18th) in Brussels. "If the agreement is not signed on April 29th, the document will be signed in Brussels on May 26th, after the final completion of the translation procedure," Alkalaj told the SRNA by phone after a meeting with European Commission officials. Slovenia, current holder of the rotating EU presidency, is spear-heading the effort. (Dnevni Avaz, Fena, RTRS, SRNA - 18/04/08)

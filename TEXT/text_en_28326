PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), junior partner in the ruling coalition, announced on Saturday (October 16th) it is leaving the coalition, effective Monday, withdrawing, "in other words, from the Kosovo government" the party said. It has one deputy prime minister and five ministers in the cabinet. The LDK remains committed to contributing to democratic processes in the country, the party said in a statement. If a caretaker government cannot be formed within eight days, then snap elections will have to be held within 45 days. Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci responded by saying that LDK has triggered an institutional crisis that requires an emergency solution. 
The move came a day after acting President and Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi announced that early parliamentary elections will take place on February 13th. The prospect of snap elections has loomed since President Fatmir Sejdiu resigned last month. (B92, RTS, Tanjug, Reuters, DPA, AFP, CNN - 16/10/10)

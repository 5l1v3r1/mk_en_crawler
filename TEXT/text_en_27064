BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Turkey's chief negotiator with the EU, Egemen Bagis, warned on Thursday (December 3rd) against any new sanctions from Brussels over Ankara's row with Cyprus, saying such a move would affect public support for the EU integration process. At a meeting hosted by the European Policy Centre in Brussels, Bagis criticised sanctions already imposed by the EU. "We cannot deal with eight negotiation chapters because of a decision the EU made in 2006. We cannot close the remaining others," he pointed out. Three years ago, EU leaders agreed to freeze eight of the 35 negotiating chapters in Turkey's EU accession talks because Ankara refused to fully implement a trade pact, which expands the Turkish-EU customs union to include Cyprus. Bagis reiterated that Turkey will open its ports and airports to Greek Cypriots as soon as the EU fulfils its pledge to ease the isolation of Turkish Cypriots.

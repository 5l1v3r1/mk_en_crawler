BELGRADE, Serbia -- In comments Thursday (October 25th), Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said his country is ready to defend Serb rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) with the same determination it is demonstrating to maintain Kosovo as part of Serbia. "Preserving Kosovo and Republika Srpska (RS) are now the most important goals of our state and national policy," Kostunica said. 
At issue is High Representative to BiH Miroslav Lajcak's decision a week ago to change laws on the Council of Ministers and the BiH parliament. Kostunica agrees with RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, who says Lajcak's move breached the Dayton Peace Accord and targeted the interests of Serbs in BiH.
Lajcak responded by saying that Kostunica "knows â¦ that what he is stating is not true". Adding to the tensions, the Serbian Socialist Party issued a statement Thursday calling on Bosnian Serbs to declare independence if Kosovo secedes from Serbia, following the final status talks that are scheduled to end on December 10th.

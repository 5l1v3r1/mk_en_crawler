TIRANA, Albania -- Wrapping up a four-day visit to Tirana on Friday (21 October), IMF mission chief Istvan Szekely called on the new Albanian government to fight corruption and enhance governance. He said the Fund is satisfied with Albania's efforts to preserve low inflation and a stable growth rate, but wants to see intensified efforts at upgrading fiscal institutions, increasing the tax collection rate and improving the business climate.
While in the Albanian capital, the mission held its first meeting with the Democratic Party-led cabinet of Prime Minister Sali Berisha. Talks focused on the Albanian performance under the three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility programme worth $42.7m, which is set to expire in November, as well as on preparations for a new agreement.

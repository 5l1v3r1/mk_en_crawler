ATHENS, Greece -- The police evacuated the finance ministry on Thursday (August 5th) after receiving a bomb threat. The incident happened just before Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou was expected to hold a press conference on the results of the EU/IMF inspection. After searching the building following an anonymous tip, the police found no explosive device. Earlier in the day, the EU and IMF said that Greece has made considerable progress in implementing the austerity measures, but warned the country still faces "important challenges and risks".

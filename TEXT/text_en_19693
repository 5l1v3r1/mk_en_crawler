SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonian and Greek negotiators met in Ohrid on Monday (January 21st) in a bid to settle the long-running dispute over the official name of Macedonia. UN special envoy to the talks, Matthew Nimetz, described it as the best meeting so far, as both sides demonstrated a willingness to address the issue. "I think that we are definitely making progress," he said, adding that a solution seemed to be within reach. Athens accuses its neighbour of attempting to steal its history and heritage and of making claims regarding the Greek province of Macedonia. The next round of talks will be held in Greece in two weeks. (Ekathimerini, Vecer - 22/01/08; Xinhua, Makfax, AFP, RIA Novosti, ANA-MPA, Nafthemporiki - 21/01/08)

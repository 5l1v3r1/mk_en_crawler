ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said Tuesday (26 October) that reform of the country's judiciary would be completed by 2007, when the country expects to wrap up accession talks with the EU. The judiciary has been strongly criticised for slowness and bias. On Tuesday, Supreme Court President Ivica Crnic complained that courts ruled on 1.5 million cases in 2003, only to be burdened by 1.7 million new cases. 
In other news Tuesday, Zagreb announced that Croatian and Bulgarian police have agreed to join efforts to solve the most serious criminal cases. They will accelerate information exchanges with an eye to strengthening the fight against organised crime, illegal migration and trafficking. (AFP, HINA, BTA - 26/10/04)

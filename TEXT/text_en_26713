THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- UN war crimes tribunal prosecutor Peter McCloskey on Monday (September 7th) demanded life sentences be handed down against seven Bosnian Serbs -- former senior members of the army and the police -- charged with war crimes committed in Srebrenica in 1995. McCloskey made the request during his closing arguments of the three-year-long trial. The defendants are former chief of the Bosnian Serb General Staff's Security Service, Ljubisa Beara, Lieutenant Colonel Vujadin Popovic and the deputy commander of the special police at the Bosnian Serb Interior Ministry, Ljubomir Borovcanin. Along with the members of the Zvornik brigade â Lieutenant Colonel Vinko Pandurevic and Lieutenant Drago Nikolic -- they are suspected of organising an attack against Srebrenica in 1995 aimed at destroying part of the Muslim community there. The five, charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity, as well as genocide, have pleaded not guilty. The chief of the army operation, Radivoje Miletic and deputy commander Milan Gvero, who are charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity, entered the same plea. (AFP, AP, ANP - 07/09/09)

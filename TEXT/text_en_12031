LUXEMBOURG -- The EU will not launch accession talks with Croatia until fugitive General Ante Gotovina is arrested and brought to The Hague, Luxembourg Prime Minister Claude Juncker said in a statement Monday (14 March). Luxembourg currently holds the EU's rotating presidency. Juncker says the EU foreign ministers will be discussing the matter Tuesday and Wednesday, and will announce a final decision prior to Thursday, when the talks are scheduled to begin. The EU has praised Zagreb's decision to freeze Gotovina's assets, but said the move did not go far enough to satisfy demands for co-operation with the tribunal. Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader still insists the accession talks will start on time. (Reuters, AFP, Vecernji list - 15/03/05; AFP, HINA - 14/03/05)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Greece has denied plans to block Croatia's EU accession talks over Zagreb's recognition of a Macedonian national minority and the autocephaly of the Macedonian Orthodox Church, Split-based newspaper Slobodna Dalmacija reported on Friday (January 30th). On Thursday, the daily reported Greece has threatened to block the justice chapter in Croatia's EU accession talks over a definition containing the term Macedonian minority in accompanying documents.
Separately Friday, the Zagreb daily Jutarnji List reported that The Netherlands plans to block Croatia's EU accession over its level of co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal. Chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz recently described Croatia's co-operation as inadequate, for failing to supply documents on war crimes cases related to 1995's Operation Storm. The Croatian Army offensive eliminated the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina and killed hundreds of Serb civilians.
In other news, Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said on Saturday her country intends to refer the case of Turkish actor Attila Olgac to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. Last month, Olgac told a TV show in Turkey that he shot dead a 19-year-old prisoner of war in cold blood, and then nine other Greek Cypriots in 1974, while serving in Cyprus during Turkey's military intervention in the island. Bakoyannis says Greece will work in co-operation with Cyprus, and within the framework of the UN and the EU, to help shed light on the issue of missing persons in Cyprus.

ATHENS, Greece -- Truck owners parked hundreds of vehicles along major highways on Monday (September 13th) to protest government plans to open their sector to greater competition. The action caused long queues at gas stations across the country, as motorists feared they may face another fuel shortage similar to the one in July, when a similar protest was held. Back then, the government intervened, requiring fuel truckers to end the protest. Since that remains in force, drivers cannot actually declare a strike. Their union said they will hold daily protests instead.
Meanwhile, state railway workers launch a 24-hour strike Tuesday against planned salary and staff cuts in their sector. Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Monday he sympathises with the protestors. "Of course we don't want violence and we need ... to keep this dialogue going so that people feel that we're working together to solve this problem," Papandreou told a conference in Oslo hosted by the IMF and the International Labour Organisation.

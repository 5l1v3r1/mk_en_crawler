NEW YORK, United States -- Turkish and Greek Cypriot leaders held their first round of talks Thursday (19 February) and will meet again Friday for negotiations on reuniting their island by 1 May. That is the date on which Cyprus will enter the EU, with or without its northern part. Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash and his Greek Cypriot counterpart, President Tassos Papadopoulos, have agreed to hammer out a deal by 22 March. If they fail, Turkish and Greek officials will join the talks. If that does not succeed, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan is to fill in the blanks before the agreement goes before a referendum on the island.
Annan's special representative for Cyprus, Alvaro de Soto, described Thursday's session as constructive. Denktash says the Turkish part of the island does not want to see large number of Greek Cypriots resettling in the north. He also proposed that losses Turkish Cypriots incurred between 1963 and 1974 should be compensated and that the Turkish military should remain on the island until Turkey joins the EU. Papadopoulos says those who migrated from Turkey to northern Cyprus should not be allowed to vote in the referendum. (AP - 20/02/04; Anadolu Agency, NTV, TRT 2, CyBC TV, CNA - 19/02/04)

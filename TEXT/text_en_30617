PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Authorities have launched a diplomatic offensive underscoring the importance of recognising Kosovo's independence. Prime Minister Hashim Thaci is participating in the UN Conference on the Least Developed Countries in Istanbul, where he met on Monday (May 9th) with a number of representatives of countries that have not recognised Kosovo as a state. 
Foreign Minister Enver Hoxhaj is visiting the United Kingdom in an effort "to co-ordinate the steps between the two countries [to] increase the number of recognitions", while Deputy Prime Minister Behgjet Pacolli travels this week to Africa where he expects word of two more recognitions.
Meanwhile, media reported that the lobbying strategy has been handed over to President Atifete Jahjaga, after being drafted by several Kosovo ambassadors in co-operation with Hoxhaj. (Koha Ditore, Zeri, Kosova Sot, Express - 10/05/11)

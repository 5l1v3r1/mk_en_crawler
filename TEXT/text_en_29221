BELGRADE, Serbia -- The war crimes prosecutor's office will not appeal a London court's decision to free former Bosnia and Herzegovina presidency member Ejup Ganic. War Crimes Prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic explained on Wednesday (August 4th) that Ganic had already been released and success of such a motion would not be certain. He added possible new proceedings would be expensive. The prosecutor's office will keep investigating the case, he said. (RTS, Tanjug - 04/08/10)

ATHENS, Greece -- Riot police clashed with protesting truckers on Friday (September 24th) after the demonstrators tried to prevent workers from unloading ferryboats at the port of Piraeus. About 150 truck drivers, who gathered at the port in the morning, tried to stop the goods-laden trucks from leaving the ferries, throwing rocks at police who used tear gas to disperse them. No injuries or arrests were reported. Labour unions in the sector announced on Friday they rejected a compromise suggested by the government and said they will continue protests that began on September 13th. Truckers are unhappy with a law passed by parliament on Wednesday that will open their sector to competition. (AP, AFP - 24/09/10)

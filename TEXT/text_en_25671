SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Ambassadors of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC)'s Steering Board say they are concerned by the worsening financial situation in the Federation of BiH (FBiH). In a statement Monday (February 22nd), they described the stand-by arrangement reached between the IMF and BiH authorities as the most viable way to limit the effect of the global economic crisis on BiH. PIC ambassadors urged the FBiH to implement necessary public spending reforms or risk losing the next tranche under the 1.2 billion-euro IMF programme, and budgetary assistance from the European Commission and the World Bank.

TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Socialist Party (SP) is planning a big rally Friday (April 4th) in Tirana's main square to demonstrate support for Albania's NATO bid. SP leader Edi Rama invited the public to it, saying it is to celebrate a hoped-for membership invitation from NATO.
At the same time, the SP will also use the rally to underscore its opposition to the government of Prime Minister Sali Berisha, Rama said. (Shekulli, Shqip, GazetaShqiptare, BBC Albanian - 01/04/08; BalkanWeb, Voice of America - 31/03/08)

MADRID, Spain -- European Commission Vice President Margot Wallstrom said on Friday (October 27th) that concerns over a big labour migration wave from Bulgaria and Romania after their EU accession in January are unfounded. Wallstrom, who is the European Commissioner in charge of institutional relations and communication strategy, was speaking to reporters in Madrid after a conference on understanding public opinion. She reiterated that the flow of new workers in past years was slow and moderate. She noted, however, that EU rules allow certain member states to impose interim restrictions if they wish.

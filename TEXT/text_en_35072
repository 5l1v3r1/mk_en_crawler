ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan praised his country's improved relations with Greece in a televised interview Thursday (26 February), saying he hopes this trend will continue. He cited in particular an agreement on a moratorium on summer military exercises in the Aegean. For years, the dispute over air control and territorial rights in this area had been a major obstacle to bilateral relations.

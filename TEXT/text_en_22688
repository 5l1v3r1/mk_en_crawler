SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov criticised embattled Interior Minister Rumen Petkov on Sunday (April 6th) about recent scandals at the ministry. Still, Parvanov said he remains convinced that Petkov can implement reforms. In his first comment on revelations suggesting high-ranking officials, including Petkov, had links with shadowy businessmen, Parvanov put most of the blame on former senior police officials, who "did not behave as deserving their ranks".

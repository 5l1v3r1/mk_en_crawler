ATHENS, Greece -- Police clashed with about 100 young extremists during a large student demonstration in downtown Athens on Thursday (8 March). The rioters, most wearing masks, burned a guard post near Parliament, destroyed two ATMs and pelted a luxury hotel with stones. The police responded by firing tear gas and arresting 40 demonstrators. Ten police officers were slightly injured. Government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos condemned the attack on the monument as "sacrilege". The riots broke out at the end of the regular weekly protest by thousands of college students against the government's reforms of the system of higher education. (AFP - 08/03/07)

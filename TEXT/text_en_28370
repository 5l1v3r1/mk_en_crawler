PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Political representatives of the Serb community in eastern Kosovo published a joint list of 30 candidates Tuesday (November 16th) for the December 12th snap elections. Partesh Mayor and chairman of the Independent Democratic Party Nenad Cvetkovic confirmed that his party's candidates will run with the Independent Liberal Party of Kosovo, whose leader, Slobodan Petrovic, criticised Belgrade for urging Kosovo Serbs to boycott the vote. The Serbian community has ten reserved seats in Kosovo's 120-seat parliament. 
Separately, the Albanian government is urging Kosovo Serbs to participate, in order to "be active in politics and decision making". Foreign Minister Edmond Haxhinasto delivered that message during a meeting Monday with Serbian Ambassador to Tirana Miroljub Zaric.

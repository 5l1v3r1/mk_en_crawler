ANKARA, Turkey -- Two more military officers were charged on Sunday (February 28th) as part of a series of arrests linked to an alleged plot -- dating from 2003 -- to topple the government. The latest detentions bring the number of arrests to 35. They came hours after thousands of demonstrators gathered in Istanbul to support the crackdown and mark the 13th anniversary of the so-called February 28th coup, when the army ousted an Islamist-led government. Demonstrators chanted "Never again". (AFP, Anadolu news agency, AP, Hurriyet - 28/02/10)

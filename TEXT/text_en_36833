THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The prosecutor's office at the UN war crimes tribunal has criticised NATO peacekeepers for failing to arrest former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. Charged with genocide, he has been on the run for the past eight years. NATO insists it is doing all it can to arrest Bosnia and Herzegovina's war crimes suspects. But prosecutors say Karadzic has been able to remain free partly because NATO has not acted on intelligence provided to it. (BBC News - 13/07/04)

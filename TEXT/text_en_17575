NIS, Serbia -- Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic and Bulgarian counterpart Georgi Petkanov opened a Bulgarian consulate in the Serbian town of Nis on Thursday (December 21st). Petkanov explained it would facilitate the transit of people between the two countries since, as an EU member, Bulgaria must impose visas for Serbian citizens starting in January. Petkanov stressed that they would be free of charge and said most groups would benefit from eased visa rules, especially members of the business community, students and tourists. Stojkovic said he hoped Serbia would be included in the Schengen "white list" next year, leading to liberalised visa arrangements with EU member countries. (B92, Focus, News.bg - 21/12/06)

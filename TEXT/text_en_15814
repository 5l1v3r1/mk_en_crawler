SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The country's Helsinki Committee for Human Rights criticised a draft law on police Monday (19 June), saying the bill fails to conform to international standards. The NGO urged the interior ministry to take a more active role in the process.
In other news, the chairman of State Electoral Commission, Jovan Josifovski, threatened to resign after colleagues refused to accept his proposal for the exact way in which parties, particularly the main opposition VMRO-DPMNE, would be represented on the ballot. The panel has been quarrelling over the issue for three days. (Dnevnik, Utrinski Vesnik - 20/06/06; Makfax - 19/06/06)

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative to BiH Paddy Ashdown told Republika Srpska (RS) leaders Tuesday (15 March) that without the implementation of crucial police reform, the EU would be closed to BiH. During his visit to Banja Luka, Ashdown reiterated that he would not impose solutions and said any decision on police restructuring should be made by the BiH legislatures, including the RS Parliament. 
Also Tuesday, the BiH Court imposed a provisional travel ban on former Federation of BiH Deputy Defence Minister Hasan Cengic, now a member of the BiH Parliament's House of Peoples. Cengic was charged with abuse of office for actions he allegedly took in 1996. (Dnevni avaz, Nezavisne novine - 16/03/05; OHR Sources, Fena, RTRS, PBS BiH, Fena, NTV Hayat - 15/03/05)

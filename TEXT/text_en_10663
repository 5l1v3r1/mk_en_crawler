THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) will set up a three-member trial chamber to decide whether to transfer the trial of two Croatian generals to Croatia, the UN said Wednesday (8 September). The two -- Rahim Ademi and Mirko Norac -- were indicted for war crimes allegedly committed during a 1993 military operation in an area inhabited by ethnic Serbs. 
In other news, Croatian and Bulgarian interior ministry officials met in Zagreb Wednesday and agreed to launch joint efforts against organised crime. The visit followed last weekâ€™s announcement by Bulgarian police that they were searching for 12 Croatians allegedly involved in the murders of several organised crime figures.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica will back Democratic Party leader and incumbent Boris Tadic in the second round of presidential elections February 3rd, Blic newspaper reports in Wednesday's (January 23rd) edition. Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) reportedly demanded that Tadic oppose the arrival of any EU mission to Kosovo without a new UN Security Council resolution, while Tadic insisted that the DSS clearly back the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. A source says the two parties have reached an agreement in principle, with more negotiations expected.
The DSS supported Velimir Ilic in the first round of elections Sunday. He was third with 7% of the vote. In the second round, Tadic faces the deputy leader of the ultranationalist Serb Radical Party, Tomislav Nikolic, who came in first. (Blic, Vecernje Novosti - 23/01/08; Beta - 22/01/08)

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The government formally submitted its strategy and action plan to fight corruption and organised crime to the European Commission (EC) on Thursday (August 5th). The EC will provide its evaluation of the documents in the autumn. The head of the EC delegation in Podgorica, Leopold Maurer, said that fight against these phenomena is of crucial importance when meeting the political criteria for EU membership. Several NGOs, however, criticised the government for not considering their suggestions on the strategy, and for drafting the action plan without their participation. EU experts said earlier that the draft version of the strategy lacks goals, deadlines and monitoring mechanisms. (Portal Analitika, Pcnen, RTCG, Radio Free Europe - 05/08/10)

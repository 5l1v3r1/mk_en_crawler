SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) announced on Wednesday (June 24th) plans to invest 250m euros in BiH this year to help fight the global economic crisis. Up to 100m euros of this will be earmarked for the financial sector. The remainder will be used for agriculture, industry and public sector projects, including transport, energy and municipal infrastructure. BiH is seeking a 1.2 billion-euro stand-by loan from the IMF. It reportedly will not be approved this month as the Federation of BiH failed to cut its social and welfare budget by 10%, as required.

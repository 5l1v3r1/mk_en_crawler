PRISTINA, Kosovo -- NATO diplomats back KFOR's decision to freeze relations with the Kosovo Security Force (KSF) after members of the newly established force carried weapons during a ceremony last week. NATO spokesperson James Appathurai said on Monday (March 8th) that some individuals contradicted KFOR instructions and suggestions, which sent the wrong political signal.

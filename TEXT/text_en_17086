TIRANA, Albania -- The left-wing opposition criticised on Monday (1 May) President Alfred Moisiu's reported sealing of three laws -- on legislative procedures, fighting corruption, and imposition of a moratorium on speedboats -- which were passed by parliament last week. At a news conference, the secretary general of the opposition Socialist Party, Pandeli Majko, said his party views the three measures, submitted by the Democratic Party-led government, as unconstitutional. They were adopted by parliament when opposition lawmakers were not present. (Albanian News - 02/05/06)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte kicked off a four-day visit to Serbia on Monday (June 4th), reiterating a call for full co-operation and the immediate arrest and extradition of remaining fugitives to The Hague. She began by holding talks with Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and Special Prosecutor for war crimes Vladimir Vukcevic. Local media reports say del Ponte stressed that five fugitives are believed to be hiding on Serbian territory and their arrest is Belgrade's responsibility. Next week, del Ponte will submit her regular report regarding co-operation to the UN Security Council. The report is a key factor in determining whether the EU resumes Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with Serbia. 
In other news, an investigation begins Tuesday into an apparent mass grave in Raska, southern Serbia. The site, an abandoned pit, allegedly contains remains of over 350 Kosovo Albanian victims, whose bodies may have been moved from Kosovo in June 1999. (B92, Beta - 05/06/07; Tanjug, DPA - 04/06/07)

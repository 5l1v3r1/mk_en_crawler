ZAGREB, Croatia -- The foreign ministers of Albania, Croatia and Macedonia issued a joint statement Tuesday (March 4th) ahead of NATO's upcoming summit in Bucharest, arguing that their membership in the Alliance will boost stability in Southeast Europe. The three countries are hoping to be invited to join during the Pact's summit in early April. Albania's Lulzim Basha, Croatia's Gordan Jandrokovic and Macedonia's Antonio Milososki said they believe expansion will also benefit NATO's capabilities in Southeast Europe.

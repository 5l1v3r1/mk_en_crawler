PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The province's Central Electoral Commission (CEC) announced on Saturday (November 3rd) that Serb parties and candidates cannot pull out of the November 17th parliamentary and local elections. The CEC's comment came in response to a request last week by six Serb parties and coalitions to be removed from the rolls. The CEC says the deadline for such requests was October 4th. Belgrade has urged Serbs in Kosovo to boycott the elections, insisting the requirements for a transparent vote have not been met. (Balkanweb, RTK, Telegrafi - 03/11/07)

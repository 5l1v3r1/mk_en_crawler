ANKARA, Turkey -- Vandals threw stones at a Christian church in the northern Turkish town of Samsun on Sunday (January 28th). A few windows were broken but no one inside was hurt, said Mehmet Orhan Picakcilar, the local priest. He said the real damage done by such incidents is to Turkey's international image.

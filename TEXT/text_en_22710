ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatian lawmakers passed on Wednesday (July 9th) a bill to fight discrimination despite vociferous Catholic Church criticism. It passed with the votes of 117 out of 153 legislators present. The bill comes from Croatia's efforts to align its legislation with that of the EU, which it hopes to join by 2010. 
The Catholic Church, as well as Orthodox and Islamic religious circles, opposed the sections of the legislation that denounce discrimination based on "sexual identity, expression and orientation". (AFP, HRT, Javno.com - 09/07/08)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said on Thursday (December 6th) that Serbia will use all means -- except force -- to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity, should Kosovo Albanians unilaterally proclaim independence. Jeremic and other ministers from Serbia's Democratic Party, which is led by President Boris Tadic, have continually excluded the possibility of armed conflict. Yet Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and officials from his Serbian Democratic Party continue to use sharper rhetoric. On Thursday, Kostunica reiterated his accusation that NATO wants to create a puppet state in Kosovo. One of Kostunica's advisers, Aleksandar Simic, said on Wednesday that force would be among the "legal means" open to Belgrade to protect its interests.
On Thursday, the EU member of the international troika mediating the matter, Wolfgang Ischinger, demanded a retraction from Simic, saying "it is inadmissible and intolerable that even before the troika report is out, one of the parties expresses itself in such a way."

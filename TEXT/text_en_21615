PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A total of 650 KFOR troops with the Operational Reserve Force Battalion from Germany and Austria began their deployments on Sunday (October 26th) in northern Kosovo. The troops will remain there until November 17th. KFOR announced on Saturday that the deployment in the Serb-dominated region is not meant to address any particular situation. The German-Austrian battalion will conduct operations in coming weeks as part of routine exercises, according to KFOR.
In other news, the UN envoy in talks between Pristina and Belgrade, Andrew Ladley, has proposed the "administrative partition" of northern Kosovo. In an article Monday, the Pristina-based daily Koha Ditore reported that Ladley met with Kosovo leaders Friday to brief them about his proposal. They reportedly refused to let him present it and ended the meeting unilaterally. Ladley has been working to draft new agreements between Pristina and Belgrade that would enable implementation of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's plan to reconfigure UNMIK and deploy the EU mission, EULEX.

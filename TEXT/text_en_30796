STRASBOURG, France -- European Parliament (EP) member from Bulgaria Kristian Vigenin is the new EP rapporteur for Macedonia, media in Macedonia reported on Monday (April 4th). Vigenin replaces Slovenian Zoran Thaler who resigned last month amid a corruption scandal. Thaler and two other EP members -- Romania's Adrian Severin and Austria's Ernst Strasser -- were the targets of an expose by the British daily Sunday Times. (MIA, Makfax, Sitel, Kanal 5 - 04/04/11)

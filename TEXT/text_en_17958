SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The predominantly ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), a partner in the tripartite ruling coalition, confirmed on Tuesday (February 20th) that it would approach the Constitutional Court over a new law restricting expatriate voting. Leader Ahmed Dogan said that MRF would ask the court to review the constitutionality of provisions in the new law on European Parliament (EP) elections. The clauses in question limit voting to Bulgarian citizens who have lived in Bulgaria or another EU member state in the past three months. 
MRF, which relies heavily on the votes of ethnic Turks who left Bulgaria for Turkey during the 1980s, rejects the bill as discriminatory. However, MRF deputies have agreed to return to Parliament for the time being, following a walkout last week. (Sega - 21/02/07; BNR, Mediapool - 20/02/07)

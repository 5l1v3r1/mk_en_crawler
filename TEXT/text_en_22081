BELGRADE, Serbia -- Lawmakers began debating a judicial reform package Wednesday (November 19th) that includes over 300 amendments aimed at making the courts more efficient. Among the main changes would be formation of new basic courts to replace municipal courts and of high courts to replace district courts, as well as formation of appeals, high and cassation courts. In its progress report published in early November, the European Commission (EC) said one of Serbia's biggest weaknesses remains the judicial system, as well as the fight against corruption and organised crime. The EC said political control of the judiciary remains considerable, while mechanisms for appointing magistrates and for accountability must become more transparent.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- As promised, President Georgi Parvanov on Wednesday (April 15th) returned controversial electoral legislation to parliament for reconsideration. Lawmakers adopted the amendments, which increased the electoral threshold for coalitions to 8% from the current 4% for all parties, on Monday. But since the Bulgarian Socialist Party, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, and the Order, Law and Justice Party, a formation that recently gained power, have no plans to amend the measure, it will become law. The president may return legislation for reconsideration only once, which means Parvanov will have to sign the bill eventually regardless of his views.

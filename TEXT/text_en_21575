SALZBURG, Austria -- Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic said on Sunday (July 27th) that authorities in Belgrade have the political will to capture former Bosnian Serb army commander Ratko Mladic but lack information on his whereabouts at the moment. "The apprehension of General Ratko Mladic ... is just a technical question, and the arrest of Radovan Karadzic proves that this is true," Cvetkovic told a conference of government leaders from Southeast Europe in Salzburg. The conference in Salzburg brought together leaders from the Balkans to discuss regional issues including climate change, energy policy, regional transport and infrastructure.

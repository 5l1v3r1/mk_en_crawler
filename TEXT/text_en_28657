BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police have searched five locations while investigating the financial network supporting former Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic. Bruno Vekaric, spokesperson for the Serbian war crimes prosecutor's office, said on Monday (September 13th) that several people and companies have been investigated. The operation, conducted on Friday, also targeted Mladic's former head of security, Branislav Puhalo. Mladic has been on the run since the UN tribunal charged him in 1995 with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.

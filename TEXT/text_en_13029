BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Romanian Parliament's chamber of deputies on Monday (27 February) approved for the second time a crucial anti-corruption measure proposed by the government. The bill now moves to the senate for passage. The measure was resubmitted at the request of President Traian Basescu, after it was unexpectedly defeated in the senate due to a high number of supporters missing the vote. Both Basescu and Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu want parliament to pass it by 6 March, when an EU mission visits Romania to assess judicial reforms. (Nine o'clock - 28/02/06)

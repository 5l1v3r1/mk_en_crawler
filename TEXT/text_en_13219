BRIJUNI, Croatia -- The interior ministers of the Western Balkan states -- Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia and Serbia Montenegro -- adopted Friday (23 September) a regional strategy against economic and organised crime. Also signing onto the document was the UNMIK deputy special representative for police and justice in Kosovo, Jean Dussourd. The strategy, part of an EU-sponsored project on fighting crime in the region, was endorsed at a meeting on the Croatian island of Brijuni. It envisages measures for improving financial investigation, witness protection mechanisms, crime analyses, the use of special investigative means and cross-border co-operation.

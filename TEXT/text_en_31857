NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greek Cypriot government spokesman Kypros Chrysostomides said on Monday (31 March) that his government opposes any proposal to hold negotiations on the disputed island outside the UN framework. His comment was in response to a suggestion by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan for a conference to be attended by the three guarantor powers of Cyprus' independence: Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom. Chrysostomides said "for the time being it is clearly a Turkish proposal, which has not had any response from any state." (CNA - 31/03/03)

ANKARA, Turkey -- The two main opposition parties, the Republican People's Party and the Nationalist Action Party, refused to participate in a meeting with the government Monday (August 10th), to discuss granting more rights to the Kurdish minority. This is part of beefed up efforts by the government to reconcile with the Kurds ahead of Saturday's 25th anniversary of the start of the Kurdish insurgency Saturday. The two opposition parties say the government is preparing to make concessions to the Kurds, which they say could result in further ethnic division. (Zaman, AP - 10/08/09)

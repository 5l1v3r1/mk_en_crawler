ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic was on hand Sunday (March 16th) for the opening of a second synagogue in Zagreb. Relations between Croatia and Israel have warmed since Mesic became president in 2000. His predecessor, Franjo Tudjman, refused to acknowledge Croatia's role in the murder of thousands of Jews during World War II, affecting contacts between the two countries. According to official figures, 576 Jews live in Croatia, which has a population of 4.4 million. Jewish community leaders, however, say their number is around 2,500. (HRT, AFP - 16/03/08)

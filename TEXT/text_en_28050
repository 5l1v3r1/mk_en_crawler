ATHENS, Greece -- Workers at the Piraeus port launched a general strike Wednesday (June 23rd) against harsh austerity measures and planned pension and social security reforms. The action began despite a court order late Tuesday that declared it illegal. Hundreds of passengers, including tourists travelling to the Cycladic Islands, one of the top tourist destinations in the country, were left stranded. Ferry operators criticise the strike, arguing it wracks up huge losses to the country's ailing economy. Workers in other sectors -- including the railways, local administration and hospitals -- are striking too. (SKAI, AP - 23/06/10)

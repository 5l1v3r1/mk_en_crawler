ATHENS, Greece -- Public transport workers are staging a five-hour walkout Wednesday (September 8th) to protest cost-cutting measures in the sector, including job cuts. Railway and suburban rail workers will repeat the action Thursday. All public transport in Athens will stop, as will buses and other transportation between towns and villages. Flights will not be affected. (Kathimerini, To Vima, Ta Nea - 08/09/10; AFP - 07/09/10)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania's Parliament ratified Tuesday (17 May) the Accession Treaty with the EU that was sealed on 25 April in Luxembourg. The document, endorsed by Romania a week after Bulgaria ratified its treaty, envisages that the two countries would enter the EU on 1 January 2007. The parliaments of the 25 EU member states must also ratify the treaties to officially allow Romania and Bulgaria to join the bloc.

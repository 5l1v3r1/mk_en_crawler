SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Boris Trajkovski has publicly called for re-structuring of the Lions, a special police unit that the international community wants to see transformed or disbanded. Members of the unit have been involved in repeated incidents in the crisis regions; critics say their provocative behaviour threatens the fragile ethnic peace. Talking to reporters in Skopje on Saturday (12 October), Trajkovski said that while he did not question the professionalism of most Lions, the security situation in the country has changed, requiring the restructuring.
In other news, Trajkovski met Friday with the Greek Foreign Ministry's Director for Balkan Issues, Ambassador Aleksandros Malas. During the session, Malas reiterated Athens'support for Macedonia and its efforts to integrate into the EU and NATO. (Makedonsko radio, BBC, A1 TV - 12/10/02; Makfaks, A1 TV - 11/10/02)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- KFOR Commander General Erhard Buehler told NATO's Military Committee on Thursday (January 27th) that the overall situation in Kosovo is stable and secure. He said KFOR is co-operating with EULEX and the Kosovo Police to achieve their joint objectives. As for borders, he said the demarcation with Macedonia has been concluded and monitoring responsibilities have been transferred successfully from KFOR to the Kosovo Police. Border demarcation with Montenegro may end this summer, said Buehler, adding that KFOR is and will remain responsible for the administrative line with Serbia. Since the situation in Kosovo has improved and Kosovo Police have increased capacities, KFOR has managed to downsize as planned, the general added. (KLAN Kosova, KTV, Telegrafi - 27/01/11)

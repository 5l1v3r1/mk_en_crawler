SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The number of people living near the poverty line has drastically increased from 9 per cent seven years ago to 25 per cent now. The figure surfaced during a conference on poverty reduction Friday (13 December), organised by the World Bank. Addressing participants, Finance Minister Petar Gosev said that stimulating small businesses, securing easier access to bank loans and eliminating corruption would be the government's chief weapons in the fight against poverty.

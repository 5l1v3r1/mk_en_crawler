ROME, Italy -- Italy's support is crucial to prospects for Albania's Stabilisation and Association process, Foreign Minister Ilir Meta said following a meeting Monday (23 December) with his Italian counterpart Roberto Antonione. Meta noted that Italy's support was even more important in light of the fact that it will take over the EU presidency from Greece during the second half of 2003. For his part, Antonione said Tirana plays a special role in preserving stability in the Balkans, as there are sizable Albanian communities in several countries in the region. (ATA, BBC - 23/12/02)

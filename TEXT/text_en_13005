LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said Tuesday (31 May) that the Alliance anticipates closer co-operation with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia-Montenegro, assuming the two countries fulfil their international obligations. "We are holding out the prospect of enhanced co-operation with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia-Montenegro -- provided they meet certain conditions, notably full co-operation with The Hague," de Hoop Scheffer said at the NATO Parliamentary Assembly session in Ljubljana. Noting that the Alliance is working closely with the three Adriatic Charter states -- Albania, Croatia and Macedonia -- he stressed that NATO "remains committed to helping all the countries of Southeast Europe to follow in Slovenia's footsteps" and achieving Euro-Atlantic integration.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- US Ambassador to Serbia-Montengro Michael Polt said Wednesday (12 April) that it is too early to make assumptions about the future status of Kosovo. Independence, he explained, is one of several options at this time. Polt urged the province's ethnic Albanians and Serbs to respect each other's rights as well as basic human rights and freedoms.
Martti Ahtisaari, the UN mediator in the talks, was in Brussels Wednesday to brief the European Commission on the matter. He said concrete negotiations on status would be arranged only after the technical ones are completed. 
Visiting Moscow on Wednesday, Albanian Foreign Minister Besnik Mustafaj said the status issue should be resolved by the end of the year. The solution must ensure stability and security in the region and guarantee equal rights to all residents, he added.

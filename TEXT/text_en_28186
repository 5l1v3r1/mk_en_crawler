ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor announced at a press conference Monday (April 19th) that the cabinet will completely abolish the temporary crisis tax on income as of November 1st, two months ahead of schedule. This refers to the additional rate of 4% on taxable income above 820 euros. Last month, the government decided to abolish another crisis tax, a 2% tax levied on those with taxable income of between 415 and 820 euros effective July 1st. Kosor says the cabinet plans to reduce spending by cutting public administration and public companies staff by 5% before the end of the year. Remaining employees will not be receiving Christmas bonuses. Moreover, the cabinet will be cutting so-called privileged pensions and reduce the number of job categories that qualify for such pensions, such as war veterans.

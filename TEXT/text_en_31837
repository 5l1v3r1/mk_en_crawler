BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- The US administration warned that it might suspend financial aid if Yugoslavia continues to demonstrate sluggish progress in co-operating with the UN war crimes tribunal. US Ambassador-at-large for War Crimes Issues Pierre-Richard Prosper says he will personally visit Belgrade to exert pressure on local authorities. The warning follows Belgrade's failure to extradite former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic promptly after his term in office ended earlier this week.
Prosper also criticised Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia for lack of co-operation. The Croatian embassy in Washington responded Wednesday with a statement saying Zagreb will use Prosper's visit in late January to discuss the indictment of retired Gen Janko Bobetko.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The Hague tribunal's Appeals Chamber announced on Friday (October 17th) it has approved former Bosnian Serb leader Momcilo Krajisnik's request to call his former ally Radovan Karadzic as a witness in the appeal of his war crimes sentence. "The hearing [of Karadzic] will take place in the course of an evidentiary hearing on November 3rd and 5th," a court statement said. Krajisnik is appealing a sentence of 27 years in prison for persecution and other crimes committed against non-Serbs during the war in BiH in 1992. He won acquittal on genocide charges.

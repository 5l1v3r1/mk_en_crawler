NEW YORK, United States -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu welcomed on Thursday (September 23rd) a UN report that described as "clearly unlawful" an Israeli-led raid on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla that left nine Turkish people dead in late May. "'From our perspective, it was a crime that was not just directed against Turkey, but against the entire international community," Davutoglu told the Anadolu news agency. He is in New York, attending a UN summit. "We hope that Israel will come to understand international law and behave accordingly," he added. The investigative 56-page report, published by a UN panel of three international lawyers Wednesday, concluded that the Israeli interception of the Mavi Marmara, the ship that led the flotilla, violated international law. It added that similar incidents might be repeated if no major changes in policies towards Gaza take place. Israel has rejected the document's conclusions as "biased and partisan".

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- As expected Thursday (January 20th), parliament members passed a confidence vote requested by the cabinet regarding its overall policy. The motion was in response to the political crisis sparked by controversial leaked tapes of conversations among government officials, including Prime Minister Boyko Borisov. A total of 140 members of parliament voted in favour of the confidence vote, well more than the required half of the 214 representatives. Supporting the government were the minority ruling GERB, the nationalist party Attack and several independent lawmakers. Opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party and Movement for Rights and Freedoms lawmakers voted against, while members of the Blue Coalition abstained. (Dnevnik, bTV, BNT - 20/01/11)

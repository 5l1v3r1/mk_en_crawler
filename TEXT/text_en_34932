THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Wesley Clark, the US general who commanded NATO forces during the conflict in Kosovo, told reporters Tuesday (16 December) that he found Slobodan Milosevic stubborn and essentially unchanged. "I saw no change in his demeanour, his stubbornness, his petulance," Clark said at the end of two days of closed-door testimony in The Hague. As for cross-examination by the former Yugoslav president, Clark said "It was a typical Milosevic performance. It was grandiose in effort, misplaced, in some ways overly personal." Clark and Milosevic met for a total of more than 100 hours during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and prior to the Kosovo conflict. Portions of Clark's testimony will be released to the public Friday. (AP, Reuters, AFP, B92 - 16/12/03)

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague handed down sentences Thursday (September 27th) in the notorious case involving the "Vukovar Three", in which three former Yugoslav People's Army officers were charged with the 1991 massacre of more than 260 Croats and other non-Serbs on a farm in Vukovar. Former Serb commander Mile Mrksic got 20 years in prison, while subordinate Veselin Sljivancanin got five years for aiding the crime. The third defendant, Miroslav Radic, was acquitted. 
The judges decided that although Mrksic had not ordered the massacre, his actions had allowed local defence troops and paramilitaries to kill the victims. The court dropped five counts of crimes against humanity against Mrksic because the victims, who had first sought shelter in a hospital, were prisoners of war, not civilians. Hague tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte joined the Croatian government in criticising the sentences as too lenient. Prosecutors had sought life sentences for all three defendants.
In other news Thursday, the appeals chamber of the UN war crimes tribunal upheld verdicts reached in the 2005 trial of three former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). The judges agreed with the lower court's decision to acquit Fatmir Limaj, a former senior KLA commander, and Isak Musliu, a KLA fighter, of all charges of murder and torture of prisoners. The 13-year sentence of a third defendant was upheld. Prosecutors had appealed the verdicts citing procedural errors. Serbian officials had characterised the initial rulings as a "disgrace".

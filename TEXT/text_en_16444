SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The main ethnic Albanian opposition coalition in Macedonia, the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI)-Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDP), said on Monday (11 September) that they would agree to meet with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski. DUI leader Ali Ahmeti said the parties insist that the meeting be held in the village of Sipkovica, which for most Albanians symbolises the start of democratic processes in Macedonia and recognition of their rights. DUI and PDP have strongly protested their exclusion from the new government led by Gruevski's VMRO-DPMNE. (Vecer, Dnevnik - 12/09/06; A1 TV, Telma TV - 11/09/06)

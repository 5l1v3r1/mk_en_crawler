ATHENS, Greece -- The Greek Orthodox Church has adopted a series of reforms in the wake of scandals that tarnished its image in recent months. The 102-member governing council voted Saturday (19 February) to approve a set of measures proposed by the church's leader, Archbishop Christodoulos. A special board composed of religious leaders and representatives of secular authorities and organizations would be established to look into reports of trial fixing, embezzlement and sexual misconduct by senior clergy. In his opening address at the forum Archbishop Christodoulos asked the Greek people for forgiveness and characterized the crisis as "grave". 
In other news, Greek prosecutors announced Friday that they have pressed criminal charges against the first of eight judges currently under investigation for bribery. The prosecution says examinations of the judge's bank accounts have revealed suspicious payments of around 32,000 euros over the past two months. (ANA, Kathimerini, AP, Reuters - 19/02/05)

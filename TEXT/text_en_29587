BUCHAREST, Romania -- The ruling coalition of the Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) and the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians on Monday (May 30th) restored its majority in the Senate after independent Ion Toma moved to the group of the National Union for the Progress of Romania, which supports the coalition. Earlier in the day, Senator Serban Radulescu announced he is leaving PDL's parliamentary group, thus causing the ruling coalition to lose its majority. After Toma's move, the ruling coalition will have 69 of 137 senators. The opposition Social Democratic Party and the National Liberal Party have a total of 68 senators, but Catalin Voicu is currently under arrest for corruption charges, which essentially means the group has 67 votes.

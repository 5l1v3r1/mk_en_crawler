ANKARA, Turkey -- Police say a bomb planted on an electric bike caused the explosion near a bus station in Istanbul early Thursday (May 26th). Eight people, including one police officer, were injured in the blast, which happened during the busy morning commute. Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, said in a campaign speech in central Anatolia ahead of the June 12th parliamentary elections that the attack bears the style of a "terror organisation".

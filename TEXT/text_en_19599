ISTANBUL, Turkey -- The United States urged Turkey on Saturday (September 22nd) to drop plans for energy co-operation with Iran. Reuben Jeffery, US undersecretary of state for economic, energy and agricultural affairs, said at an energy conference in Istanbul that since Turkey has no shortage of natural gas, it should "develop energy relations with countries that are politically stable and responsible to the international community". He suggested Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan as alternatives. 
Two days earlier, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would maintain its relationship with Iran, its second biggest gas supplier. Ankara currently plans to invest $3.5 billion in gas production in Iran. (Hurriyet, Turkish daily news - 24/09/07; Reuters - 22/09/07)

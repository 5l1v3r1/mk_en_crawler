ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday (21 August) praised the organisers of the Istanbul Formula One round for staging a premier world sporting event. "I believe we can hold our heads high. There may be small problems but these shortcomings will be overcome next year and we will be even more successful," he said, referring to complaints about major traffic jams on the way to the new circuit. Some 90,000 fans attended Sunday's race, which was won by Finnish driver Kimi Raikkonen. (Reuters - 20/08/05)

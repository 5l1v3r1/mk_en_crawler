SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The vetting of candidates for ministerial posts would be done by parliamentary commissions, rather than the Office of High Representative (OHR), according to proposed changes adopted by the BiH Council of Ministers (CoM) on Thursday (14 September). The measures will be forwarded to parliament for debate and approval. Candidates for ministerial and other public offices would be obliged to submit data about their background to the election commission and the Investigation and Protection Agency. The proposed changes would be in line with the process of transferring authority from the OHR to local institutions. 
In other news, a two-day regional conference opened in Sarajevo on Friday. It is focusing on boosting regional co-operation and exchanging experiences in EU-related reform efforts. (Fena, RTRS, UPI, AFP - 14/09/06)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- On Thursday (24 July), the IMF released a working papercontaining a review of corporate development in the 1990s and comparing the performance of surviving old companies and new ones. The report says the business sector was strengthened by the entry of private capital and by cost-cutting policies. It cited completion of the privatisation process as one of the remaining challenges, and proposed a set of measures including non-tolerance of debts, improved bank lending practices and mechanisms to strengthen private ownership. An IMF team is currently in Macedonia for a regular review under the $27m stand-by arrangement with the Fund. (IMF Web site, MIA - 24/07/03)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The ruling coalition on Tuesday (May 24th) failed to attract enough votes in the Deputies Chamber to pass an important law regarding the restructuring of the Interior Ministry. This, despite the fact the government has a comfortable majority in this chamber. The bill was not rejected however, because less than the necessary majority of lawmakers voted against it. Therefore, the law might come up for consideration again in the autumn. 
The cabinet decided late last year to restructure the finance and interior ministries by laying off nearly 10,000 public servants in 2011. This is part of the public sector reform agreed to with the IMF. (Evenimentul Zilei, Cotidianul, Adevarul - 25/05/11; Realitatea - 24/05/11)

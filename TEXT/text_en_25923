BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) has unblocked 82.6m euros Bulgaria is to receive under the PHARE programme, according to an announcement made during a cabinet meeting Wednesday (November 18th). After reimbursements Bulgaria must make, the actual sum will be 64m euros. The EC has also lifted a measure blocking 323m euros under the programme, though again, not all this money will be received. Bulgaria began losing access to money it was due after irregularities surfaced within its payment agencies. The EC says these issues have not been fully addressed and urges Sofia to work harder to eliminate weaknesses in its system or face the prospect of losing access to more money, due to the expiration of the PHARE programme. Missing deadlines has already led to the loss of 220m euros. (Sega, Trud, 24 Chasa, Dnevnik - 19/11/09; AP, Standart, AFP, Focus - 18/11/09)

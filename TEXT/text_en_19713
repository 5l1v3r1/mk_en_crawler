SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The House of Representatives formally appointed the state level government of Prime Minister Nikola Spiric on Wednesday (February 20th), with all ministers and deputy ministers taking their oaths of office after the vote. Spiric resigned last November to protest changes presented by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak aimed at facilitating executive decision making. The six-party ruling coalition nominated Spiric again after it managed to agree on new voting rules in parliament and in the Council of Ministers. It also agreed on key police reforms. 
At its session Wednesday, the lower house also approved the draft police reform law in the first reading. Adopting the package will enable BiH to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. The lower house also approved the 2008 draft budget law.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The judges hearing Bosnia and Herzegovina's genocide case against Serbia-Montenegro at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Tuesday (9 May) began deliberations after hearing the arguments of both countries. Experts see this as the court's most complicated case, one that could have repercussions for years. It is also the first instance in which a whole country is being prosecuted for genocide. The judges must first decide whether they have the jurisdiction to rule in the case, as Serbia-Montenegro insists it was not a member of the UN when the atrocities took place. If the ICJ decides to proceed with the case, it could be months before a verdict is reached. Croatia has also filed a genocide suit against Serbia-Montenegro, which has not yet been heard.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Security forces killed two members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) during a security operation in the eastern province of Mus, Governor Erdogan Bektas said on Sunday (May 24th). The fighting took place near the town of Malazgirt, in an effort to determine whether the PKK was responsible for a rocket attack on a police station in Malazgirt last year that killed one officer and wounded three others, the governor said.
Also Sunday, an explosion in the southeastern city of Hakkari wounded at least one policeman, media reported. The blast occurred in front of an administrative building.
In other news Sunday, the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) called for ending army operations against the PKK and for a peaceful solution to the Kurdish issue during a rally in Istanbul. "A solution does not come with deaths," DTP deputy leader Emine Ayna told the crowd. (Zaman, Sabah, Radikal - 25/05/09; Anadolu news agency, Hurriyet, AFP - 24/05/09)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament resumes work Monday (October 1st) after its summer recess with an opening speech by President Abdullah Gul. Bills vetoed by former President Ahmet Necdet Sezer -- such as the Foundations Law, the Law on the Higher Education Board, the Public Administration Law, the Oil Law, the Law on the Court of Accounts and the Ombudsman Law -- will be given urgent attention. Another hot topic is the new draft constitution submitted by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). (Zaman, Sabah, Hurriyet - 01/10/07)

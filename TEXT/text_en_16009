SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Presidency Chairman Sulejman Tihic affirmed on Monday (17 April) that the creation of a single defence structure in BiH and membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace programme are strategic goals of the country. His comment followed a ceremony marking the Day of the BiH Armed Forces' 2nd Rangers Regiment, held at the Rajlovac barracks near Sarajevo. Tihic said BiH already boasts a capable military that participates in international peacekeeping operations, adding that BiH's modernised and integrated army guarantees domestic stability and will lead to accession into Euro-Atlantic structures.

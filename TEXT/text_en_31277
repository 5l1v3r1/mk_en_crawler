BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic announced on Tuesday (March 1st) that coalition partners have reached an agreement on a government reshuffle. The number of portfolios will be cut by five to 20, he said, though the cabinet will consist of more than 20 members. Mladjan Dinkic, leader of the junior coalition partner G17 Plus and former economy minister, confirmed that a deal has been struck. He said his party will head five ministries instead of the current six. According to him, the National Investment Plan (NIP) Ministry will merge with the Economy Ministry. Former NIP minister Verica Kalanovic already resigned, while the G17 Plus is expected to nominate new candidates for the economy and health ministers' posts. (Tanjug, Beta, RTS, B92 - 01/03/11)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- OSCE's chairman-in-office, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy, visited Pristina on Tuesday (19 October) and called for Kosovo Serbs to participate in Saturday's parliamentary elections. "Participation in the elections is the democratic way to make clear one's political stance and to ensure protection of the interests of one's community," Passy said. Following talks with UNMIK and Kosovo officials, Passy urged local politicians to reach out to the electorate ahead of the vote. 
Also on Tuesday, the OSCE Mission to Kosovo said a total of 33 nomination lists were submitted for the 120 seats in parliament. Twenty-two were from parties and the rest from coalitions, associations and independent candidates. Of these, two Serb entities have registered to run.

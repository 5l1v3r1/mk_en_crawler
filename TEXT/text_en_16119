SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Council of Ministers decided Thursday (15 June) to establish the so-called Sarajevo Commission, which has been source of political trouble in the country in the past couple of months. The commission is tasked with investigating crimes allegedly committed against Serbs, Croats, Bosniaks, Jews and others in Sarajevo between 1992 and 1995. Ivica Marinovic was appointed as Commission chairman. The creation of the commission was requested by Serbian representatives in parliament, who claimed there were serious atrocities against the Serbs in Sarajevo during the war. (Fena, PBS - 15/06/06)

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Montenegro officially became an associate member of the EU on Saturday (May 1st), when the country's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the bloc took effect. Podgorica submitted its EU membership application in December and hopes for candidate status in the beginning of 2011, which would enable it to begin talks on full-fledged membership. Enforcing the SAA allows Montenegro to participate in the work of the Council for Stabilisation and Association and attend its next meeting in June. (Beta, B92, Xinhua, RTCG - 01/05/10)

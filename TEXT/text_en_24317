TIRANA, Albania -- Italian authorities on Sunday (May 10th) sent home 170 Albanians who spent four days in the port city of Trieste because of visa problems. The group of self-proclaimed "students" found themselves barred from entering Italy, the first stop in a planned Mediterranean trip, after the Hungarian Embassy in Tirana declared their Schengen visas invalid, only days after it had issued them. Investigators say this may have been a human trafficking scheme, as only 87 of the students were enrolled in universities. (Shekulli, Top Channel, Ora News, Klan - 10/05/09)

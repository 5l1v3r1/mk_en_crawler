Are evaluations planned? Which stakeholders, if any, have been involved/consulted in the design of this strategy? 
The National Strategy for Development of SMEs was the basis for preparation of the Program of Measures and Activities for Promotion of Entrepreneurship and Creation of Competitiveness of the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in the Republic of Macedonia (2003-2007) (the Program), see 16_Annex_02. The Program was adopted at the session of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, held on 23.01.2003. The Program refers to a 4-year period, and basically, is a plan of activities for implementation of the objectives envisaged in the Strategy and the European Charter for Small Enterprises. The program focuses on 5 main areas/priorities:   Creation of institutional infrastructure for promotion of entrepreneurship and competitiveness;   Building of a favourable economic environment and degree of economic freedoms, in accordance with the current development stage of economy – legislation and conditions for start up and performing business activity;   Promotion of entrepreneurship and non-financial forms for support of entrepreneurship;    Financial forms of support for the entrepreneurship development;   Program for creation of competitiveness. The Program determines specific projects (that should provide financial and non-financial support for SMEs), which would be co-financed by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, and refer to the abovementioned areas of activities. On the basis of this Program, the Government adopts annual financial programs, which regulate the purpose of funds for SME support ("Official Gazette of RM" N. 46/03 and 12/04). The projects regulated in these programs are realized through the Agency for Promotion of Entrepreneurship, which develops the projects that are realized through the network of regional centres by awarding tenders. These funds are provided annually in the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, and present a clear signal to the donors on the gravity of the Government’s commitment to support SMEs. The first Annual Financial Program for entrepreneurship support and stimulating of foreign direct investments was adopted at the Government’s session on 30.06. 2003, the second Programme for 2004 was adopted on 01.03.2004, while the 2005 Program is under preparation. The Ministry of Economy has developed a monitoring mechanism for the Program.  The key findings on the situation in 2004 are as follows: 1.  Priority 1.   Creation of institutional infrastructure for promotion of entrepreneurship and competitiveness   The National Entrepreneurship and Competitiveness Council for was established;   Technical assistance financed by EU was provided to strengthen the capacity of the SME Department within the Ministry of Economy;   The Agency for Promotion of Entrepreneurship (APE) was established according to the provisions of the Law on establishing the Agency for Promotion of Entrepreneurship of the Republic of Macedonia ("Official Gazette of RM" N. 60/03);   APE cooperates on regular basis with the regional and local organisations for entrepreneurship promotion via financing of their projects;   The development of the network of centers for business support to entrepreneurs on local level with the USAID financial support is starting.  It is expected that the capacity of these centers will be strengthened with the transfer of competencies of the local self government units, after completion of the local elections in March 2005;   The increase of the number of the business incubators is enabled by signing Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Economy and SINTEF for support of one project for young entrepreneurs in establishing IT incubators;    The Euro Info Correspondence Center was established with the support of the project financed by EU;   The consultancy network is used in the implementation of projects of regional NEPA, ESA and PREDA centers.   2.  Priority 2.  Building of a favourable economic environment and level of economic freedoms, in accordance with the current development stage of economy – legislation and conditions for start up and performing economic activity   The adopted Company Law simplifies the existing conditions for company registration.  Two bylaws are set to be enacted with this Law that in the future will regulate the functioning of the one-stop-shop.   A list has been prepared for the whole legislation in force that need to be revised and amended in order to simplify the conditions and procedures of SME registration and functioning. 3. Priority 3. Entrepreneurship promotion and non-financial forms for support of entrepreneurship   Chambers (Union of Independent Chambers of Commerce) and other associations are established that would stimulate the process of business matching and SMEs associating;    Ministry of Economy and European Agency for Reconstruction are negotiating to launch a project on business portals for export oriented SMEs;   The preparations on introducing the voucher system are underway.  The concept of the system will be implemented during 2005 according to the obligations deriving from the Charter.   4.   Priority 4.

Priority 5. Program for creation of competitiveness   Implementation of IT programme for entrepreneurship support is realised through four centres of technology transfer with GTZ support;   Vertical connection of the enterprises following the concept of clustering is being realized by the five clusters financed by USAID  The basic quantitative indicators for evaluation of the success of the Program are: the increase of the volume of private investments in the SME sector, the number of new entrepreneurs, the number of supported and successful projects, the number of created and sustained jobs, and the effects on the increase of export. Apart of the aforementioned quantitative indicators, the results of the entire process of raising the entrepreneurship and business culture will also be evaluated, as contribution to the overall improvement of the level of development of the country. Such evaluation of the Program is planned during 2005. Furthermore, the Government adopted an Action Plan for European Partnership, with a special part dedicated to implementation of SME priorities. Besides the Ministry of Economy, other state institutions were involved when drafting the Program such as:   Macedonian Chamber of Commerce;  Artisans Associations;   Regional centres and Entrepreneurship Promotion Agencies;  NGOs;   Representatives of foreign donors (SEED, USAID, World Bank, EBRD, EAR, UNDP);  Private consultants;  Entrepreneurs.

6. Is there a specific legal framework for cooperatives, mutualities and foundations? Please explain. 
In the Republic of Macedonia, there is a special legal framework for cooperatives, mutualities and foundations. The Law on Cooperatives ("Official Gazette of RM" No. 54/02) regulates the conditions, manner and procedure for establishment, registration, activities, supervision and cessation of cooperatives. This is a general law, which refers to all cooperatives, except in the case of banking and insurance, as well as operations mentioned in the Law that prohibit the establishment of cooperatives. The Law on Civil Associations and Foundations ("Official Gazette of RM" No. 31/98) regulates the manner and conditions, as well as the procedure for establishment, registration, activities and cessation of civic associations and foundations. The new draft Law on Civil Associations and Foundations is in the process of public debate and it is expected soon to be adopted.  The new Law will enable approximation of the national legislation with the EU acquis in terms of broadening the possible frames of associating.   
7. Is there a format for accounting? Please explain. 
The framework for accounting is regulated by the Company Law and the Rulebook on Accounting Standards, which introduces the international accounting standards of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) as accounting standards applied in the Republic of Macedonia ("Official Gazette of RM" No. 94/04).  The above mention standards are being harmonized with the current standards, as per IACS decision to supplement, amend, or adopt the aforementioned standards.  In addition, special balance schemes are prescribed in the Republic of Macedonia for large and medium sized companies, as well as shortened balance schemes for small entities (Rulebook on prescribing of the form and contents of balance schemes, “Official Gazette of RM” No. 23/99). According to the Company Law, the Minister of Finance enacts bylaws prescribing the form and content of the balance schemes that are also mandatory for the EU member states.  These bylaws are driven from the 4 (78/660) and 7 Directive (83/349), as well as the EU Directive 86/635 (banks accounts) and EU Directive 91/674 (insurance companies accounts). For more details on the issue please read the answer of the question from the chapter 05_II_A_6.

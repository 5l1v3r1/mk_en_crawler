BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Thousands of people on Saturday (10 June) signed a petition to ban the activities of the ultranationalist Radical Party. According to organisers, some 15,000 people -- 5,000 in Belgrade alone -- backed the motion by the pro-democracy G17 Plus party. Dozens of NGOs, human rights activists and intellectuals have backed the initiative. G17 Plus says the Radicals "spread hatred". (AP - 11/06/06; AFP - 10/06/06)

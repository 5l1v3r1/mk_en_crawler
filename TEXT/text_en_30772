TIRANA, Albania -- Albanians went to the polls on Sunday (May 8th) to vote for mayors and local government officials in elections largely seen as a test of the country's stability. A total of 3.1 million people will cast their ballots for members of the municipal councils and mayors of 308 municipalities. The vote, which was preceded by a campaign marred by harsh rhetoric and violent incidents, will be closely monitored by 5,000 local and international observers.

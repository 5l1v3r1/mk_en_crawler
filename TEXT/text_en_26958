PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A EULEX-run court sentenced Kosovo lawmaker Rrustem Mustafa and two other Kosovo Albanians on Friday (October 2nd) in connection with the murders and torture of civilians during the 1998-1999 conflict. All three former Albanian rebels were initially sentenced by a UN-run court in 2003, but Kosovo's Supreme Court ordered a new trial in 2005. Mustafa, known as "Remi", is deputy chairman of the ruling Democratic Party. He was sentenced to four years in prison Friday. The others got three and six years, respectively.

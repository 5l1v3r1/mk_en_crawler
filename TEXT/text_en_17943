ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan plans to announce whether he will run for president on Wednesday (April 18th), ending several weeks of speculation. Speaking to reporters Sunday, he rejected concerns expressed last week by outgoing president Ahmet Necdet Sezer, who suggested that if Erdogan becomes his successor, secularism in Turkey would be in jeopardy. Erdogan insisted Sezer's opinion is not shared by the majority of Turks and noted that in his four years as prime minister, the economy has steadily improved. On Saturday, over 200,000 people gathered in Ankara to protest his potential candidacy. (Financial Times, Sabah, Zaman - 16/04/07)

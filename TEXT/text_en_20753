ANKARA, Turkey -- Military prosecutors have indicted eight soldiers who were captured and then released by Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) guerrillas last fall. The soldiers were captured on October 21st and were freed on November 10th. The guerrillas killed 12 soldiers and injured 13 in the same attack. In the indictment released on Monday (January 7th), prosecutors -- in part -- charged the eight with failing to obey a direct order. Prosecutors say that if the soldiers had fought on, there would have been fewer casualties. (UPI - 07/01/08)

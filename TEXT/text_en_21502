BUCHAREST, Romania -- Defence Minister Teodor Melescanu said Romania may withdraw its 500 troops deployed in Iraq between 2010 and 2011. "No decision on the possible withdrawal of our forces from Iraq will be made without preliminary consultations with our allies," Melescanu told AFP on Friday (August 22nd). He wants to see the withdrawal of international forces from Iraq once the country's army and security forces can assume tasks currently handled by coalition forces. (AFP, Ziare.com - 22/08/08)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu says Romania probably would withdraw a battalion from Iraq's Dhikar province in November. He explained on Wednesday (30 August), that the decision follows Iraq's announcement that in 45 or 60 days at the most, the army will be able to take over control of the province. Romania still would have more than 5,600 peacekeepers in Iraq. 
In other news, Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos reiterated Madrid's full support for Romania's scheduled entry in the EU on 1 January. He is in Bucharest to attend a meeting of the country's diplomatic corps. (Rompres - 30/08/06)

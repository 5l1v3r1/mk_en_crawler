NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat met on Thursday (September 10th) to discuss reunification of the divided island for the first time since the month-long summer recess in August. The focus this time was government and distribution of power, including "the election of the president and vice-president of the ... united republic," said UN envoy Alexander Downer. Talks resumed a week later than planned because Turkish Cypriots refused to allow Greek Cypriot Orthodox pilgrims to attend a church service in the north. (AP, DPA - 10/09/09)

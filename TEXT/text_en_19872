SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The prosecutor's office pressed charges Thursday (March 20th) against Hristo Lachev, CEO of Bulgartabac Holding, the largest state-owned tobacco company. Lachev is charged with tax evasion, and is being investigated for embezzlement. According to the indictment, he has evaded paying taxes totalling about 65,000 euros, which would mean that he has not declared income of about 0.5m euros. Bulgartabac Holding is poised to undergo privatisation shortly. (Dnevnik, 24 Chasa, Sega - 21/03/08; bTV, BTA, News.bg - 20/03/08)

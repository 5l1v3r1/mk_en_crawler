According to the Belgrade Tourism Organisation, most visitors come to the Serbian capital from neighbouring countries, but the number of those from the US, Italy, Germany, Greece, Scandinavia and France is growing. 
"Walk as much as you can, spend time drinking coffee on Knez Mihailova Street, visit the galleries and cultural programmes, and hang out with the locals, who are wonderful hosts," recommends tour agent Jasna Dimitrijevic.

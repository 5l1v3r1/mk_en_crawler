ANKARA, Turkey -- Nabi Sensoy, the Turkish ambassador to the United States, was recalled for consultations on Thursday (October 11th), after a committee of the US House of Representatives approved a resolution that describes the WWI-era mass killings of Armenians in Turkey as genocide. The foreign ministry says Sensoy will remain in Ankara for about a week before returning to Washington. 
NTV television is reporting that Turkish naval commander Metin Atac has cancelled a planned trip to the United States to protest the genocide resolution, while Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is considering whether to cancel a trip there next month. In uncharacteristically strong language, President Abdullah Gul also criticised the vote and warned it could harm bilateral relations. (Zaman, Sabah - 12/10/07; NTV, AFP, AP - 11/10/07)

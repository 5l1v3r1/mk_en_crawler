ZAGREB, Croatia -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn urged authorities to ensure implementation of the government action plan for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, during a meeting Wednesday (11 May) with Croatian President Stipe Mesic. The arrest and extradition of fugitive Ante Gotovina would enable the launch of delayed EU accession talks, Rehn said.
Also Wednesday, it was announced that Prime Minister Ivo Sanader would address parliament on 18 May, speaking about plans by Hague tribunal prosecutors to expand the indictment against two Croatian generals, Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac. Other names are to be added to the indictment. (HRT - 12/05/05; HINA - 11/05/05)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A bomb hoax forced police to empty Sarajevo's landmark UNITIC towers Saturday (12 November). The twin 20-story buildings are home to the offices of a number of international agencies, including the World Bank, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the OSCE. An unknown caller told police that a bomb had been planted on the premises. The buildings were reopened shortly before midnight on Saturday when officers established that the threat was a false alarm. (Reuters - 12/11/05)

TIRANA, Albania -- Landline telephone telecommunications are monopolised and competition is needed to lower prices, the Electronic and Postal Communications Authority announced on Monday (March 7th). The number of users dropped last year, while the distribution of landline telephony covers only 10% of the country, compared to 40% in the region, the authority said. Yet mobile services remain most expensive in the region, it noted. Meanwhile, internet service in Albania remains a luxury as prices are six times higher than in Croatia and three times higher than in Serbia. Only 13% of families have internet in their homes.

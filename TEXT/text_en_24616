BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU could grant 500m euros to help Bulgaria cope with the impact of the global financial crisis, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Thursday (March 5th) during a meeting with Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev. During his visit to Brussels, Stanishev also met with EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs and EU Commissioner for Monetary Affairs Joaquin Almunia. During his meeting with Piebalgs, Stanishev insisted the EU should continue to compensate Bulgaria for decommissioning four units at the Kozloduy nuclear plant, in light of the enormous losses the country suffered during the January natural-gas crisis.
In other news Thursday, as expected, parliament rejected proposed constitutional amendments that would have allowed two or more elections on the same day. The National Movement for Stability and Progress, a member of the ruling coalition, wanted both Bulgarian and European Parliament elections scheduled for the same day, as they fall within three months of each other. But its fellow coalition members, the Bulgarian Socialist Party and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, opposed the idea.

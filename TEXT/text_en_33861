ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Sunday (16 November) that it is crucial for Turkey to make significant progress in its EU integration efforts over the next six months. He acknowledged a delay in implementing EU-related reforms but pledged important progress would occur shortly.
In related developments, EU Enlargement Commissioner Gunter Verheugen said the Union wants Turkey as a member. Since the 11 September terrorist attacks, he said, significant progress has been made to reverse initial opposition to Turkey's accession. (Anadolu Agency, TRT 2 - 16/11/03)

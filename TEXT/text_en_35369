THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal ruled Monday (19 April) that the massacre of more than 7,000 Muslims in Srebrenica in 1995 was a case of genocide. Legal experts described the decision as one of historic significance with implications for other trials, including that of Slobodan Milosevic. The court also decided that to prove a charge of aiding and abetting genocide, prosecutors only need to demonstrate that the defendant had knowledge of plans to "destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group". According to the ruling, the defendant need not have himself committed such acts. The ruling came in the case of General Radislav Krstic, who commanded the Serb forces that overran Srebrenica. The judges overturned his genocide conviction, found him guilty of aiding and abetting genocide and reduced his prison sentence.
In other news, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) government decided Monday to guarantee the release on bail of five Bosnian Croats who surrendered to the war crimes tribunal earlier this month. They are former senior officials of the Croat community in BiH. (OHR Sources, The New York Times - 20/04/04; AP, AFP, PBS BiH, Fena - 19/04/04)

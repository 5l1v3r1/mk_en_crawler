MUNICH, Germany -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, making an official visit to Germany, met on Friday (February 8th) with Chancellor Angela Merkel who reiterated her Christian Democratic Union's support for a "privileged partnership" between Turkey and the EU. Erdogan rejected that alternative to full EU membership on Saturday."We don't like this idea at all," he told an international security conference in Munich. He added that under the rules, which have long been approved by the EU, Turkey is in the accession process. He said it would be unfair to offer privileged partnership at this point, as it would amount to changing the rules in the middle of the game.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- During his visit to Sofia on Tuesday (8 June), Scotland Yard Commissioner Sir John Stevens urged Bulgarian authorities to persist with efforts to fight corruption in public administration. Stevens said the country has made strong progress in the field. During his meeting with Interior Ministry Chief Secretary Boyko Borissov, however, Stevens cautioned that organised crime remains a problem in Sofia, as well as in Bucharest, Romania.

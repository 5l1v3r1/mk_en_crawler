SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government has adopted a joint declaration, along with Croatia and Hungary, recognising Kosovo's independence, according to an official statement Wednesday (March 19th). As the status quo can no longer be maintained, the three countries have no other choice but to recognise Kosovo, the declaration reads. It describes the case as unique, suggesting it should not be used as a precedent by other breakaway regions seeking independence. The three countries say they hope good neighbourly relations with Serbia can be sustained. (News.bg, Dnevnik - 19/03/08)

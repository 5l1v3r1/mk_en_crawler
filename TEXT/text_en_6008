In March, SETimes launched its 2011 Facebook photo contest. 
Many of the entries focused on scenic sites in the Balkans, including ancient villages, meadows and mountains, and idyllic beaches. Others presented the daily life of people in the region. 
 Facebook users then voted on their favourite entries. With 500 votes tallied, we present the top three choices. Congratulations! 
First place -- Slavica Panova Second place (tie) -- Mima L

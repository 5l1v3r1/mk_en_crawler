SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Economy and Energy Minister Rumen Ovcharov said on Wednesday (November 1st) that Bulgaria would have to cut exports of electricity to countries in the Balkans due to the forced decommissioning of two reactors at the Kozloduy nuclear plant. They are being shut down at the EU's insistence, ahead of accession in January. Strained relations between Russia and Ukraine, which supplies coal to Bulgaria, are also complicating the situation. Ovcharov said a large plant in Varna has been affected, forcing Bulgarian authorities to cut exports to avoid blackouts at home. (Sega - 02/11/06; Focus, Novinite, bTV, AFX - 01/11/06)

PARIS, France -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn urged Serbia on Thursday (April 23rd) not to lose momentum in implementing EU-related reforms despite the global economic crisis. Speaking in Strasbourg, Rehn said that he and EU Commissioner for Monetary Affairs Joaquin Almunia are closely working on how to modify part of the EU's pre-accession assistance into a budget aid package to help Serbia mitigate the impact of the crisis. Still, he underlined the government should not allow a setback in key judicial and structural reforms. He also said reforms in the visa liberalisation process are proceeding at a good pace. Serbia hopes to be put on the so-called Schengen White List for visa-free travel to the EU as of 2010. (RTS, Tanjug - 23/04/09)

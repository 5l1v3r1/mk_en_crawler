BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The government of Republika Srpska announced on Thursday (27 January) that it has extended a rewards programme for war crimes suspects who surrender voluntarily. The programme, which includes a one-time payment of 25,000 euros plus a monthly allowance and other bonuses to suspects' families, was originally set to end in December, but will be extended until June. UN prosecutors and international officials have questioned the ethics of the programme.

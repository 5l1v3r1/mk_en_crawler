ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prosecutors in the town of Osijek announced on Thursday (January 20th) they will not seek the extradition of war veteran Tihomir Purda, as there are no grounds for opening a criminal investigation against him. Purda, who fought in the eastern town of Vukovar, was detained earlier this month at the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, based on a Serbian arrest warrant. Authorities in Belgrade suspect him of involvement in war crimes committed against Serbs in Vukovar early in the war. Serbia has said that it will seek his extradition if Croatia does not.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Thursday (November 11th) that open debate is necessary for the integration of Turkish immigrants in European countries, including Austria. His statement came amid a diplomatic row between Ankara and Vienna after Turkish Ambassador to Austria Kadri Ecved Tezcan said recently that Turks living in Austria are often accused of creating ghettos and are treated "like a virus". His remarks spurred sharp reaction by Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann and the foreign ministry. (AFP, Hurriyet - 11/11/10)

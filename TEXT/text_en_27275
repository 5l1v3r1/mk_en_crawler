ZAGREB, Croatia -- About 400 students from Zagreb University's faculties of Philosophy and Political Sciences staged a protest outside the Ministry of Science, Education and Sports on Tuesday (December 1st), demanding free education. They blocked the entrances, preventing employees from leaving. Police had to remove students who refused to budge. Students at the Faculty of Philosophy have now decided to boycott all lectures, as they did in the spring. (HRT, HINA, Nova TV - 01/12/09)

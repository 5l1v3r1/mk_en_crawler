BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI) issued a report Monday (9 December) on major measures taken this year to stop the spread of international terrorism. The SRI launched joint projects with the intelligence services of NATO members following last year's 11 September terror attacks against the United States. SRI says it took actions against individuals and groups with suspected ties to Islamic fundamentalist groups, including the al-Qaeda terrorist network.
In other news, Prime Minister Adrian Nastase presented to parliament Monday a bill for adoption of a new labour code, which he says should reduce unemployment.

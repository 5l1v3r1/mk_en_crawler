TIRANA, Albania -- A group of ten political parties from both ends of the political spectrum have joined forces to prevent electoral reforms proposed by the two biggest parties, the Democratic Party (DP) and the Socialist Party (SP). At a roundtable Thursday (February 28th), the small parties blamed the DP and the SP for delays in the process and said the SP and the DP have formed an alliance to exclude small parties from participating in the preparations. Neritan Ceka, leader of the Democratic Alliance Party, stressed the small parties would not allow the big ones to impose their beliefs on them.

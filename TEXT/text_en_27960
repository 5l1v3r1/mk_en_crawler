THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Wednesday (May 19th) rejected an appeal by former Macedonian security official Johan Tarculovski. He was given a 12-year sentence for a police attack on the Albanian-populated village of Ljuboten, near Skopje, during the 2001 conflict between Macedonia's security forces and Albanian guerrillas. Tarculovski appealed the sentence in August 2008. The court also rejected an appeal by prosecutors seeking to overturn the 2008 acquittal of former Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski, stemming from the same attack. The rulings are final.

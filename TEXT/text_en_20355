ANKARA, Turkey -- The government formally asked parliament Monday (October 15th) to authorise military operations against terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) bases on Iraqi territory. The request is expected to pass on Wednesday, requiring only a simple majority. The motion would cover more than one operation over the course of the next year, but does not specify any timetable beyond that. 
Again on Monday, senior Iraqi and US officials urged Ankara to refrain from military action against targets in Iraq, amid concerns for stability. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki said he is prepared to hold urgent talks with Turkey's leaders to defuse the crisis. Iraqi Vice-President Tareq al-Hashemi is visiting Ankara Tuesday, as is Syrian President Bashar Assad.

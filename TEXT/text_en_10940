BUCHAREST, Romania -- A total of 456 Uzbek refugees arrived in the western Romanian town of Timisoara on Friday (29 July). The government announced on Thursday a decision to house the refugees, who fled Uzbekistan after outbreaks of violence in May. The Uzbeks spent the last two months in a UN-sponsored camp in neighbouring Kyrgyzstan. They will remain in Romania for about six months and then be sheltered by other countries. The UN, the US and the British presidency of the EU have praised Romania's gesture. (Rompres - 30/07/05)

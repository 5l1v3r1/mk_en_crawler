SKOPJE, Macedonia â Kosovo Minister for Returns Slavisa Petkovic, the Serb representative in the province's cabinet, says Belgrade has the exclusive mandate for conducting negotiations on border demarcation between Serbia-Montenegro and Macedonia. In an interview with the Skopje-based A1 TV, broadcast Friday (25 March), Petkovic said the UN resolution on Kosovo did not provide such a mandate to the province's interim government, but rather to the authorities of Serbia-Montenegro. He also noted the lack of a ministry for foreign or interior affairs within the provincial government that could assume responsibility for demarcation. The issue has been blocked for years because the provisional authorities in Pristina refuse to recognise a previous agreement between Skopje and Belgrade. (A1 TV - 25/03/05)

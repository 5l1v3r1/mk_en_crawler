ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is sending a delegation to Syria on Thursday (April 28th) as part of efforts to contribute to reforms there. "We don't want an authoritarian, totalitarian regime" in Syria, Erdogan said. "We hope the process of democratisation will be rapidly pursued. Our representatives will present some of our preparations," he said late Wednesday. 
Meanwhile, US Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David Cohen expressed concern Wednesday over Turkey's growing commercial ties with Iran. His comment followed a two-day visit to Ankara, where he met with government officials and bankers. Cohen urged Turkish banks not to deal with blacklisted Iranian financial institutions, warning them to guard against Iran exploiting and abusing financial ties to support its nuclear proliferation efforts.

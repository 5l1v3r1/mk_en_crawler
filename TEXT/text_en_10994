BRUSSELS, Belgium -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown reiterated on Wednesday (29 June) that the EU would start Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with BiH only if the country implements required reforms. His comment followed a meeting in Brussels with EU security chief Javier Solana. According to Ashdown, Solana reaffirmed the EU's commitment to BiH but again emphasised that it is up to BiH authorities, particularly those in Republika Srpska, to fulfil the requirements. Later Wednesday, Ashdown visited London for talks with British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw. (OHR Sources, Fena - 29/06/05)

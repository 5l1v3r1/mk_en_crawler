ZAGREB, Croatia -- The EU will allocate nearly 3.5 billion euros to Croatia in the first two years of the country's membership, local media reported on Sunday (November 8th), citing a financial proposal drafted by the European Commission. The estimates are based on the assumption that Croatia will join the EU in 2012. The major part of these funds will be directed at securing cohesion for growth and employment and encouraging competitiveness. The other major recipient of the EU funds will be the agricultural sector. Croatia, in turn, is expected to contribute 1.2 billion euros to the EU budget in the first two years of membership.

POIANA BRASOV, Romania -- Defence Minister Ioan Mircea Pascu and his Russian counterpart, Sergey Ivanov, held talks Thursday (14 October) after the NATO summit in Poiana Brasov, and agreed to resume bilateral co-operation in the area of military industry. Ivanov said Moscow does not oppose projects to modernise Soviet-made military products in order to meet NATO standards. Romania became a NATO member earlier this year. Similar topics were discussed in a separate meeting between Ivanov and his Bulgarian counterpart, Nikolay Svinarov, in Poiana Brasov. (Sega - 15/10/04; Nine o'clock, Rompres, Mediapool - 14/10/04)

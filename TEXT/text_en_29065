PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Authorities in Kosovo have vowed to respond by force to any provocation from illegal Serb parallel structures in northern Kosovo. The reaction Tuesday (September 7th) from the interior ministry came a day after senior Serbian internal affairs officials agreed at a meeting in Zvecan -- near Mitrovica -- to intensify patrols and possibly stage attacks against Kosovo special police units if they appear in the north. "If we become a target of any attack we will respond with the same language," Kosovo Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi said on Tuesday. He added that the Kosovo Police, EULEX, and KFOR have the capacity to maintain security, law and order. 
Meanwhile, the Association of Serb Municipalities in Kosovo adopted a declaration in Zvecan on Tuesday in defence of Kosovo as an integral part of Serbia. The document states that Kosovo Serbs are citizens of Serbia and voices concern about the possibility of replacing status talks between Pristina and Belgrade with talks on technical issues. According to the declaration, any such shift in Serbia's policy would mean accepting the Athisaari Plan. (Koha.Net, RTK, Kosovapress, Beta, B92, Zeri - 07/09/10)

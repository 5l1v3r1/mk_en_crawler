TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Fatos Nano criticised the work of two members of his cabinet -- Minister of Education Luan Memushi and Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Engjell Bejtaj, in comments Monday (24 January). Nano said Memushi's mandate has been marked by a low level of teaching at state-run schools, as well as lack of transparency in tenders organised by the ministry for preparation of schoolbooks. Nano also expressed dissatisfaction with the work of Labour Minister Bejtaj, who he said has failed to achieve any positive results. 
In other news, a court in Vlora sentenced 11 smugglers to prison terms ranging between nine and 25 years for the deaths of at least 19 illegal immigrants who drowned when their boat sank in the Adriatic a year ago. Two senior police officials were sacked in the course of the ensuing investigation. 
Meanwhile, police say eight people were killed in an accident that occurred during a heavy snowstorm. Many roads across the country have been closed because of the blizzard. (Albanian News - 25/01/05; AFP - 24/01/05)

ROME, Italy -- Greece and Italy agreed Turkey should start talks with the EU in 2004, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis announced Friday (6 December) after meeting with his Italian counterpart Silvio Berlusconi. They agreed that Turkey still had to meet some political criteria before being eligible to start accession talks. According to Simitis, a decision to give Turkey a date to start talks may be taken as early as at the summit in Thessaloniki in June 2003. Turkey's ruling party leader Recep Tayip Erdogan has said that a date beyond 2003 is unacceptable.

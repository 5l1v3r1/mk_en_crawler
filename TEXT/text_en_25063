BELGRADE, Serbia -- Several hundred students marched in downtown Belgrade on Friday (November 27th), blocking traffic in the capital to protest changes to the education system that will tighten enrolment criteria and reduce funding for scholarships. Friday's protest lasted two hours and disrupted the afternoon commute. The students warned of more protests in the future unless the government agrees to negotiate. On Saturday, Education Minister Zarko Obradovic said the cabinet has agreed to fulfil most of the students' demands and urged them to focus on their studies instead of protests.

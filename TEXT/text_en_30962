ANKARA, Turkey -- Thousands of women gathered in the streets of several cities across Turkey on International Women's Day, Tuesday (March 8th), to protest murders and torture against them in the country. About 2,000 women rallied in downtown Ankara, demanding stricter laws against the perpetrators of the so-called "honour" killings. Several hundred women gathered at Taksim Square in Istanbul with that same message. (Hurriyet - 09/03/11; CNN Turk, Cumhurriyet - 08/03/11)

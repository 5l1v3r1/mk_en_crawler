PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Twenty-three Serb families reportedly have decided to leave the Kosovo town of Obilic, following last week's murder of a family whose home was then torched. The refugees accuse KFOR and UNMIK of failing to guarantee their safety. Belgrade's Kosovo co-ordinator, Nebojsa Covic, urged the families to stay, saying leaving is exactly what the murderers want them to do. The UN Security Council has condemned the crime, saying it runs counter to the multiethnicity of the province. (B92, Tanjug, BBC, Beta - 08/06/03)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Zagreb weekly Globus quoted Franjo Turek, the former chief of the Croatian counterintelligence service, as saying that fugitive General Ante Gotovina was involved in drugs and arms smuggling before he went into hiding in 2001. In an article published Wednesday (11 August), Turek contends that the general was a member of a group of former senior officers who tried to sell 600kg of cocaine. The shipment was intercepted in Rijeka in 1999. Three retired generals were investigated at the time, but none were charged. Gotovina has been indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal for his alleged role in the slaying of Serb civilians during a military operation in 1995. (AFP - 11/08/04)

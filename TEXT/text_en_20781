BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU foreign ministers begin a two-day meeting in Portugal on Friday (September 7th) to discuss a host of issues, including a joint stand on the future of Kosovo. There are fears that if the current round of talks between Belgrade and Pristina ends in failure and Kosovo declares independence unilaterally, some EU members would recognise the independent state while others would not. This would prevent the launching of the EU's most ambitious mission to date -- the takeover of UN functions in Kosovo. EU security chief Javier Solana says Kosovo is a European problem and must be tackled by the Europeans. 
On Thursday, Belgrade and Pristina authorities received official invitations to the next meeting with the international troika on Kosovo. Reportedly, the Serbian delegation will meet with troika members in London on September 18th, followed by the Kosovo Albanian team the next day.

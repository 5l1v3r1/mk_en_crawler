ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Abdullah Gul on Friday (January 16th) urged visiting UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to play a more active role in boosting the ongoing Cyprus reunification talks. In separate meetings with Ban, the two Turkish leaders said they wish to see a solution before the EU parliamentary elections in June. Ban stressed that Cyprus is a priority for the UN. He also met with Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat, who was visiting Ankara. 
Meanwhile Friday, UN special envoy for Cyprus Alexander Downer said a peace deal is possible on the divided island but warned it would not be easy. "Nobody should underestimate how hard it is after so many years. But there is a real possibility of reaching a settlement here," Downer said.
In related news, British Minister for Europe Caroline Flint has said her country expects Turkey to fulfil its obligations towards Cyprus under its EU accession process. Addressing the House of Commons during a debate on Cyprus, she noted the important role Turkey can play in the reunification process.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- French General Xavier Bout de Marnhac took command of KFOR on Friday (August 31st), replacing Lieutenant General Roland Kather. De Marnhac, who served as deputy commander of KFOR in 2005, is the third French officer to assume KFOR's command. 
French Defence Minister Herve Morin, who attended the change of command ceremony in Pristina, called on the EU and NATO to be united in their stances on Kosovo. "We have less than 120 days to find a solution which would be acceptable to the whole international community and to the Kosovo community as well, and as it seems, this will not be easy," he said.

TIRANA, Albania -- The government has adopted a draft law against financing international terrorism, according to media reports at the end of last week. It would allow the free exchange of information between Albania and other countries on sources of financing. The law would also impose stringent measures, including the freezing of bank accounts and the seizure of property. Parliament will likely consider the document soon. (ATA - 11/07/04)

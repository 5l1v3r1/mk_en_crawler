TIRANA, Albania -- Defence Minister Pandeli Majko announced on Saturday (9 August) that he would not participate in the upcoming regional security conference in Montenegro. He is protesting Serbia's move to accept a constitution that describes Kosovo as part of Serbian territory. Majko said he fears this might lead to another destabilisation in the Balkans and might ultimately leave Serbia-Montenegro, Kosovo and Albania out of European structures. (ATA - 09/08/03)

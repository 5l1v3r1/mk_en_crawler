ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia on Friday (July 18th) dismissed The Hague tribunal's claims that it is obstructing the trial against retired generals Ante Gotovina, Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac, who currently face allegations of committing war crimes during a 1995 Croatian offensive known as Operation Storm. In June, the prosecution asked the trial chamber to issue a binding order for the delivery of documentation and diaries related to the activities of the Croatian special police during Operation Storm in 1995. Croatian Ambassador to Holland Frane Krinc said that the request is "unnecessary and unfounded", and that Zagreb is co-operating fully with The Hague tribunal. (B92, Tanjug, Hina - 19/07/08)

ATHENS, Greece -- President Karolos Papoulias on Monday (October 5th) gave socialist PASOK party leader George Papandreou a mandate to form a new government. This happened after PASOK won a convincing victory in Sunday's snap general elections, attracting 44.92 % of the vote and an absolute majority of 160 mandates in the 300-seated parliament. Under the constitution, Papandreou now has three days to name his team, which means that the new government must take an oath on Wednesday. "Our big victory shows the hope of the people and their wish for significant reforms," Papandreou said. "We have to unite our forces because we have serious responsibilities lying ahead," Papandreou said upon entering the presidential building. Papoulias, in his turn, urged Papandreou to keep his promises for deep change and reforms in the country. Meanwhile, incumbent Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis handed over his resignation to Papoulias on Monday. Karamanlis left the presidency without making any statements for the media. Earlier, he reassured that he will remain "in the first lines of New Democracy and its parliamentary group." "I will support the decisions taken by the party, as well as the leader who will be elected within the frames of a democratic procedure," Karamanlis said. New Democracy suffered a serious loss at Sunday's vote scoring its lowest result so far -- only 33.48% of the public support and as little as 91 seats in parliament.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU progress report on Bulgaria and Romania will warn both countries that they risking losing large amounts of European aid, Reuters reported on Thursday (11 May). The news agency, which obtained a copy of the draft report, said Bulgaria and Romania had so far failed to set up payment agencies for EU farm subsidies and that Sofia was not yet ready to disburse the EU's regional aid. The European Commission (EC) says payments to both countries would be suspended until these problems are fixed. Romania has reduced the "areas of serious concern" to four from 14 and Bulgaria to six from 16 since the EC's last report of October 2005. The official version of the new report will be unveiled on Tuesday, after EC members approve it. (Nine o'clock, Dnevnik - 12/05/06; Reuters, Focus, Mediafax - 11/05/06)

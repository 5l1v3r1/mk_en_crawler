BELGRADE, Serbia -- Representatives of the EU, the OSCE and the Council of Europe on Monday (March 29th) voiced their willingness to help Serbia in its decentralisation process. At the opening of a two-day conference in the Serbian parliament, President Boris Tadic said that decentralisation is one of the main challenges facing Serbia and therefore necessitates the involvement of all institutions. According to Tadic, accelerating the process should help maintain stability and enhance economic development. The head of the EU delegation to Serbia, Vincent Degert, praised Serbia's intention to implement decentralisation-related reforms. (Beta, B92, RTS, Tanjug - 29/03/10)

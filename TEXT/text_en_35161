ZAGREB, Croatia -- The OSCE mission to Croatia issued two reports Tuesday (22 June), saying the country could handle war crimes cases transferred from The Hague, if additional reforms were implemented. The reports were based on statistical information and on the results of the monitoring of individual war crime cases heard by local courts. The OSCE mission head, Ambassador Peter Semneby, noted significant progress has been made, both in terms of government commitment and public acceptance of war crimes prosecution.

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Talks on the final text of the constitutional charter of the future state of Serbia and Montenegro ended in another deadlock Monday (11 November). Major stumbling blocks remain, including the jurisdiction of the courts. After the session, Yugoslavia's Dragoljub Micunovic, one of three co-chairmen of the Constitutional Commission, said that the sides agreed that the co-chairmen should spend the next ten days trying to overcome differences. But fellow commission member Dragan Kujovic of Montenegro says that the disagreement seems only to have deepened. (Tanjug, B92 Radio and TV - 11/11/02)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The international organisation Greenpeace has joined the legal activities launched by Bulgarian ecological associations against the government's project to build a second nuclear power plant. On Monday (15 November), the Bulgarian Supreme Administrative Court is expected to rule on Greenpeace's request to be included in the case filed by the domestic group Ekoglasnost. It contests a May decision by the Council of Ministers, claiming it was made in violation of the Law on Safe Use of Nuclear Energy. (Mediapool, Bulgarian National Radio - 15/11/04)

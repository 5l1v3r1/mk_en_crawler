ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Turkish security forces have captured 12 more people in connection with attacks on the Masonic Lodge in Istanbul, local TV channel NTV reported on Friday (19 March). The suspects are believed to have close ties to Engin Vural, one of the perpetrators of the attack that took place on 23 October 2002. Officials say the new suspects belong to a local group that has ideology similar to that of al-Qaeda and are believed to have been waiting for instructions to launch a new attack, possibly in Istanbul.
On Saturday, Istanbul's Gendarmerie broke up an 18-member network that reportedly smuggled people of Arab origin abroad with fake passports. A total of 15 fake passports, seals and stamps were confiscated during the operation. (Anadolu Agency, TRT 2 - 20/03/04; NTV - 19/03/04)

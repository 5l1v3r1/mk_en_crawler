BUCHAREST, Romania -- On Tuesday (25 November), Prime Minister and leader of the ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) Adrian Nastase welcomed a statement by President Ion Iliescu suggesting he plans to return to the PSD presidency after his presidential term expires next year. "Definitely, the position of party chairman is somehow a natural one for President Iliescu, since he is the one who created this party and contributed to its evolution," Nastase commented on local television.
Also Tuesday, Romania officially became a member of Europol, following the signing of a bilateral co-operation agreement between Minister of Administration and Interior Ioan Rus and Europol chief Juergen Storbeck. (Mediafax, BBC - 25/11/03)

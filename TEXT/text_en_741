 Bulgaria pulled in 28.6m euros in tourism revenues during the first quarter of 2006 -- approximately 4m euros more than during the same period last year. Overnight stays by foreign tourists accounted for 17.4m euros out of the total figure. Around 47 per cent of the revenues came from visits to Sofia, while the rest were from winter resorts. According to analysts at the Bulgarian National Bank, the figures were disappointing, as they are not enough to make a significant dent in the country's widening current account deficit.

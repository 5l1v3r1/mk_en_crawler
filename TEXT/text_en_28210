LONDON, United Kingdom -- A court in London will decide on July 27th whether to extradite former Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) presidency member Ejup Ganic to Serbia, the Belgrade-based Beta news agency reported on Wednesday (July 14th). Extradition hearings started on July 5th. Ganic was arrested at London's Heathrow Airport on March 1st, based on a warrant issued by Belgrade. Serbia wants him in connection with a May 1992 attack in Sarajevo against a Yugoslav National Army convoy, which left more than 40 soldiers dead. Ganic denies the charges, claiming they are politically motivated. (Beta, B92, Politika - 14/07/10)

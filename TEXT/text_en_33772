ATHENS, Greece -- Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, head of the Athens Organising Committee for the 2004 Olympics, said Wednesday (26 November) that officials are planning a global tour of the Olympic flame. In all, 3,600 people will carry the torch over a distance of more than 77,000 km. The flame will first head to Australia, then Asia and Africa before crossing the Atlantic to the Americas. It will make its final journey through Europe before returning to the stadium in Athens on 13 August. Foreign Minister George Papandreou described the relay as a symbol of peace.

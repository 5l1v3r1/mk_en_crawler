ANKARA, Turkey -- US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visited Greece and Turkey on Tuesday (25 April) as part of a European tour. In Athens she met with Greek counterpart Dora Bakoyannis to discuss Iran's nuclear programme. Bakoyannis, whose country is currently a member of the UN Security Council, expressed support for the US policy of pressing Iran to end its uranium enrichment operations, but indicated that, in her view, the time is not right for a new UN resolution. They also discussed Cyprus and Kosovo.
In Ankara, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul raised the issue of Kurdish militants using Iraqi territory to launch attacks on Turkey. Rice promised that Washington will share information with Ankara and could revive the tripartite co-operation among the United States, Turkey, and Iraq on this issue as soon as a cabinet is formed in Baghdad. Rice travels on to Sofia on Wednesday. (The New York Times, AP, Turks.US - 26/04/06; ANA, ERT, AP - 25/04/06)

VIENNA, Austria -- A report presented on Monday (3 July) by the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, Miklos Haraszti, acknowledged progress in Kosovo's media sector but called for more work in some areas. These include providing broadcast services for minority communities and improving the economic situation of domestic broadcasters. According to the document, the legal framework regulating the media sector in the province has improved significantly due to adoption of crucial laws such as a law on broadcasting. The report also noted that editorial flaws -- seen during and after the March 2004 ethnic riots -- have been corrected. (OSCE Web site - 03/07/06)

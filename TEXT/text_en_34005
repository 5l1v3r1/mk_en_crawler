BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's Election Commission verified Friday (31 October) the list of nominees who will run in the 16 November presidential elections. The candidates include Dragan S. Tomic, nominated by the Socialist National Party, Dragoljub Micunovic from the Democratic Opposition of Serbia, Marijan Risticevic from the National Rural Party, Radoslav Avlijas, nominated by the Democratic Homeland Party, Tomislav Nikolic from the Serbian Radical Party and Velimir Ilic, nominated by the New Serbia Party. Out of these, Micunovic and Nikolic are considered the front-runners. This would be the third attempt to elect a president. Attempts in September and December of last year failed due to low turnout.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia on Thursday (16 December) returned to Kosovo the remains of 44 ethnic Albanians who were murdered during the 1999 conflict and then reburied in Batajnica near Belgrade. Relatives of the victims and Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj attended the handover at a UN checkpoint. The prime minister promised that his government would work actively to determine the fate of more than 3,000 people listed as still missing from the conflict. The remains of nearly 900 ethnic Albanians have been discovered in several mass graves in Serbia, but only 350 have been identified and returned to their families. In all, 529 Serbs and 203 people of other ethnic backgrounds are among the missing. (BBC, AFP - 16/12/04)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government on Tuesday (4 May) rejected recent criticism by the human rights group Amnesty International regarding the state of Romania's psychiatric hospitals. The government admitted the country has problems in the field, but insisted that most of the report's conclusions are erroneous. There are concerns the findings could affect Romania's chances to accede to the EU in 2007. (Mediafax - 04/05/04)

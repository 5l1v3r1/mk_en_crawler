TIRANA, Albania -- Former President Rexhep Meidani will run in the race for head of the ruling Socialist Party (SP) after all, according to local press reports Tuesday (25 November). His main competitors are Tirana Mayor Edi Rama and Prime Minster Fatos Nano. Last week, Meidani said he was quitting the race to avoid involvement in the rift between the government and the party leadership. SP Secretary General Gramoz Ruci says Meidani never formally withdrew his candidacy. (Albanian Daily News - 25/11/03)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The leaders of the three parties that represent the ethnic Albanian minority in Macedonia -- Democratic Party of Albanians, Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) and the Party of Democratic Prosperity (PDP) will meet on Thursday (April 12th) to discuss their common concerns. Relations between the PDP and the DUI have been souring steadily. The PDP says its parliamentary coalition with DUI has only resulted in isolation. (Vecer - 10/04/07; A1 TV - 09/04/07)

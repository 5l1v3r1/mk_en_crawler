SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Turkish electricity company TEAS announced on Tuesday (22 April) that it has suspended purchases of electricity from Bulgaria. It accused the government in Sofia of failing to meet its obligations under an international agreement that linked the exports of electricity to the construction of two major projects in Bulgaria by Turkish firms. Sofia argues that it froze the Upper Arda cascade and the Maritsa Highway because the Turkish contractor, Ceylan, went into bankruptcy proceedings. The exports of electricity are reported to be worth $150m annually. Bulgarian Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg and others said talks would continue.

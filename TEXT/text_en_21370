ANKARA, Turkey -- Police on Wednesday (July 30th) arrested nine people in connection with Sunday's twin bomb attacks in Istanbul. Local media reports say police gave no details on the suspects or their possible motive. Two bombs exploded minutes apart on a crowded Istanbul street Sunday night, killing 17, including five children, and injuring more than 150. "They intentionally targeted innocent people without discriminating between men and women, elderly and children," said President Abdullah Gul, who visited the scene Wednesday. While officials implicate the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the group denies any involvement.
In other news Wednesday, Turkey's General Staff announced that security forces captured five PKK members in a mountainous area of the southeast province of Sirnak. Troops also seized a number of weapons and 20kg of explosives. (Hurriyet, Anadolu news agency, Zaman, Turkish Press, Sabah, AFP, Reuters, BBC - 30/07/08)

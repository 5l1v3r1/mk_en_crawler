NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has appointed veteran German diplomat Joachim Rucker, 55, as the next chief of UNMIK, according to a statement Monday (14 August). He succeeds Soren Jessen-Petersen of Denmark who resigned in June. Rucker has been serving as acting chief and was head of UNMIK's economic reconstruction department. 
In other news Monday, Kosovo police assumed control of the province's borders with Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro -- replacing the international force that had been in charge of border control since 1999. Local police also took over the airport in Pristina. The UN decision to transfer authority is viewed as recognition of the professionalism demonstrated by Kosovo's new police force.

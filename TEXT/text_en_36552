BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian government is trying to come up with a law on protecting witnesses. A working group of government and private lawyers will hold its first meeting on Saturday (8 May) and will include representatives of the justice, finance and internal affairs ministries, as well as the Belgrade School of Law.
Meanwhile, Slobodan Milivojevic, the lawyer representing Milorad "Legija" Lukovic, says his client wants "to tell it all" about the March 2003 assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. Lukovic, the alleged mastermind of the murder, surrendered to police Sunday. (B92, Tanjug - 06/05/04)

TIRANA, Albania -- A USAID-funded poll suggests that corruption in Albania has grown over the past year. Released on Thursday (April 30th), the survey was conducted by the Institute for Development and Research Alternatives (IDRA). More than half of respondents said corruption has increased and is mainly present among ministers, lawmakers, customs officials and doctors. Religious leaders, the president, media, teachers and the military were seen as the least corrupt, while the media was cited as the strongest institution that fights corruption. The survey found a marked improvement in perceptions of Albania's justice system.

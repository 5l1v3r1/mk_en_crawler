TETOVO, Macedonia -- The opposition Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) has finally decided to end its boycott and return to parliament, the DPA central board announced on Tuesday (31 January). The party has been refusing to participate since last April, protesting what it says were some manipulated results in the last local elections. The decision to resume participation followed a meeting earlier this week between DPA leaders and US Ambassador to Macedonia Gillian Milovanovic.
In other news, the United States has donated 14 military vehicles to the Macedonian Army. Officials say it is part of a programme for bilateral co-operation. (Macedonian Government Web site - 01/02/06; A1 TV - 31/01/06)

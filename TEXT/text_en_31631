ANKARA, Turkey -- IMF First Deputy Managing Director Anne Krueger arrived in Turkey on Wednesday (15 January) to review the economic recovery programme, drafted by the new government. She suggested that the Fund might approve additional financial aid to Turkey, should war break out in neighbouring Iraq. Turkish officials have serious concerns that such a conflict might have disastrous consequences for the economy. Krueger also met with officials from the ministry of finance and the central bank to review the $16 billion stand-by arrangement between Turkey and the IMF.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ordered Turkey to pay 11,000 euros in fines for discriminating against a Kurdish judge, media reported on Monday (November 10th). In 1997, Turkey's Higher Board of Judges and Prosecutors disciplined Judge Mehmet Emin Albayrak for reading and watching pro-Kurdish media, which authorities frequently closed down for allegedly supporting the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party. The board decided to relocate Albayrak, the harshest penalty short of dismissal, saying exposure to such media could affect his objectivity. The ECHR ruled there was no evidence of that.

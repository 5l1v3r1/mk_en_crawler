BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic said on Friday (April 18th) that if he had to choose between Kosovo and EU membership, he would choose the integrity of the country. During an interview with the Belgrade-based weekly magazine Standard, he stressed that Serbia does not face such a choice, as "there are countries in the EU that would never recognise Kosovo's independence." Tadic says that when he goes before the UN Security Council on Monday, he will tell members that no one has the right to prevent Serbia from defending its integrity, nor threaten the country's European integration.

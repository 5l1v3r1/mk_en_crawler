TIRANA, Albania -- The main opposition Socialist Party (SP) holds a razor thin lead of 41% of the votes in Sunday's parliamentary elections, according to results published early Tuesday (June 30th) by the USAID-sponsored project ECAandKRIK and the Central Election Commission. The ruling Democratic Party (DP) has 40%, with about 73% of the votes counted. However, as a result of a regional proportional system being used for the first time, the DP is ahead in terms of parliamentary seats: 69 compared to 65 for the SP. Authorities are also using new counting technology that makes the process more transparent but slower, thus delaying final results.
On Monday, international observers gave a generally positive assessment of the election process, but noted some problems persist and must be addressed in the future. "There is tangible progress; however, there is still more to be done," said OSCE special co-ordinator for the election Wolfgang Grossruck, (ECA & KRIK, CEC, Shekulli, Top Channel, Ora News, Top News - 30/06/09; Top Channel, Shekulli, Klan, Alsat, Deutsche Welle - 29/06/09)

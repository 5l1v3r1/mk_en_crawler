ANKARA, Turkey -- Polls are open Sunday (3 November) for an election that could bring major changes to Turkey's political landscape. The ruling three-party coalition of Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit is expected to lose, after two years of crippling economic crisis. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) leads in the polls, despite widespread suspicions that it secretly espouses an Islamist cause. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the founder and current AKP leader, is ineligible for the post of prime minister because of a 1999 prison sentence for inciting religious hatred. These elections will decide 550 seats in the Turkish assembly.
In other news, Turkish Chief of Staff Gen Hilmi Ozkok is to visit Washington on Monday to meet with senior US officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Colin Powell. They will discuss military co-operation and, according to some reports, a possible military operation in Iraq. (CNN, BBC, Reuters, AP, AFP - 03/11/02; Anadolu agency, Milliyet - 02/11/02)

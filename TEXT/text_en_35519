BRUSSELS, Belgium -- At a press conference Monday (9 February), NATO spokesman Robert Pszczel said it is still premature to discuss a concrete date on which Macedonia would be invited to join the Alliance. Pszczel noted that the preliminary findings of a NATO team that recently visited the country were positive. However, much remains to be done, especially in terms of economic, political and judicial reforms, Pszczel said.
Also Monday, a former member of the rebel group National Liberation Army surrendered to Macedonian police. Sait Rushiti was sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder, but had managed to elude authorities since the summer.
In other news, two explosions rocked the Macedonian city of Bitola late Sunday, one in a furniture shop, the other outside a mosque. No casualties were reported. (Utrinski Vesnik, Dnevnik - 10/02/04; MIA, A1 TV - 09/02/04)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government dismissed the Serbian consul general to the United States, Slobodan Nenadovic, on Wednesday (July 2nd) amid evidence that the Serbian embassy issued an illegal document to allow an attempted-murder suspect to flee the United States. The move comes a week after Belgrade relieved its vice consul of his duties over the same affair. 
Serbian authorities say they have launched a nationwide manhunt for the suspect, Miladin Kovacevic, a 20-year-old Binghamton University basketball player. In May, he allegedly nearly beat a fellow student to death after a row in a bar in New York. US Ambassador to Belgrade Cameron Munter has asked Serbian authorities to extradite Kovacevic to New York to stand trial. (B92, Beta, New York Times - 02/07/08)

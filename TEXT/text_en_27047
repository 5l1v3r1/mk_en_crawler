BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic has held talks with the head of the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina, Nenad Canak, to discuss proposals regarding the statue governing the province. A draft of the statute is currently under discussion, but has been held up by disagreements over how much autonomy Vojvodina should retain. According to Canak, he and the prime minister agreed on solutions which would prevent the province's autonomy from being undermined. Cvetkovic, meanwhile, said that his cabinet would agree to the suggestions made by Canak's party, and that he expects majority support in parliament for the statute. (B92, Politika)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski on Wednesday (5 November) received parliament's approval to make sweeping changes in his cabinet. Lawmakers voted to replace the ministers of finance, justice, the economy, and transport and communications one year after the new government took office. Crvenkovski did not explain the move, apart from citing the need to accelerate structural reforms. He told lawmakers that Macedonia is more secure, stable, and prosperous than it had been 12 months ago, but called for improved relations between the majority Macedonians and the ethnic Albanian minority. The major opposition party VMRO-DPMNE refused to participate in the vote, claiming the reshuffle was only cosmetic. Opposition lawmakers also criticised the government for the country's high unemployment rate and what they described as a stagnant economy. (AFP, MIA - 05/11/03)

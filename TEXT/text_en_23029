ZAGREB, Croatia -- Dusan Miljus, a longtime crime journalist for the Zagreb-based daily Jutarnji List, was beaten by attackers Tuesday (June 3rd.) Two unidentified men jumped Miljus, 47, outside his home in Zagreb and beat him with baseball bats. The journalist suffered a concussion and broken arm. Miljus has been identifying people linked to weapons trafficking between the EU and the former Yugoslavia. He received a number of anonymous threats earlier this year that he reported to police. An obituary with his name and photograph appeared last week in the daily Vecernji List, which later apologised and described it as a "procedural mistake".

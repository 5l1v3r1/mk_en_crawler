SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The three parties in the ruling coalition plan to discuss structural changes to the government in two weeks, the government's press office said on Friday (April 25th). Leaders of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, the Movements for Rights of Freedoms, and the National Movement for Stability and Progress will talk about the second stage of a reshuffle and other reforms, most likely at the agency level, after parliament approved personnel changes in the cabinet last week. The effort seeks to reduce government inefficiency and corruption. (Sega, Dnevnik - 26/04/08; Darik, bTV, Mediapool - 25/04/08)

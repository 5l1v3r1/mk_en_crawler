PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Disagreements among members of the Central Election Commission (CEC) led to a delay in announcing the final results of a re-count in the Gjilan/Gnjilane municipality on Monday (January 11th). Eight members supported the results of the re-count, which declared the Democratic Party (PDK) candidate the winner by a slight margin, while the head of the commission abstained, effectively blocking the proceedings. Democratic League (LDK) representatives had requested a re-vote in Gjilan/Gnjilane instead of a re-count. Two other municipalities, Prizren and Lipjan/Lipljane, require re-votes, due to significant violations in voting on November 15th and December 13th.

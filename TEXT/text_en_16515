SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Raffi Gregorian, political adviser at NATO HQ in Sarajevo, said on Monday (10 April) that BiH is not yet fully co-operating with The Hague tribunal. Gregorian was speaking at a roundtable co-organised by the Centre for Security Studies, the NATO HQ and EUFOR in Sarajevo. He noted that while the latest information does not suggest fugitives Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic are on BiH territory, implementation of obligations to The Hague include firm action against support networks and the submission of required documents to The Hague.
Also Monday, EUFOR soldiers searched the premises of the Autoprijevoz urban transport company, as well as buses and passengers at the central bus station in Banja Luka. A spokesman described it as a routine check of documents and unrelated to war crimes support networks. (Nezavisne novine - 11/04/06; Fena, RTRS, NTV Hayat - 10/04/06)

MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- One of the former Yugoslavia's most famous landmarks reopens Friday (23 July), ten years after it was destroyed by war. The 16th-century bridge at Mostar was blown up during fighting between the city's Muslims and Croats in 1993. More than $13m has been spent restoring it and surrounding buildings. Dignitaries from across Europe were invited to the opening ceremony. Spanning the Neretva River, the Stari Most (Old Bridge) was reconstructed using the same methods and materials used by the original Turkish architects nearly 500 years ago. (BBC News - 23/07/04)

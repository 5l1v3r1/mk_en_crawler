WASHINGTON, United States -- Bulgarian Interior Ministry Chief Secretary Boyko Borissov and US Secret Services Director W. Ralph Basham vowed on Thursday (10 March) to further boost co-operation between their agencies. Both officials agreed that relations between the two secret services so far have been solid. They also agreed to organise a computer course for Bulgarian and US specialists at the end of March, aimed at better tracking computer fraud. Borissov, who wrapped up a ten-day visit to the United States, awarded Basham a medal for his personal contribution to the strengthening of relations between the two agencies.

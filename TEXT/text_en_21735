SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Sarajevo County prosecutors questioned Federation of BiH Prime Minister Nedzad Brankovic on Thursday (July 24th) regarding corruption and the possible misappropriation of funds in the energy sector. "The prosecution is just doing its job, and it is my obligation to tell it all I know," Brankovic said before he entered the prosecution office. The probe of Brankovic, Energy Minister Vahid Heco and 11 other state officials began in April. Investigators suspect them of favouring certain investors and attempting to award them lucrative contracts, while bypassing procurement-related requirements. (Nezavisne Novine - 25/07/08)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic announced on Tuesday (November 9th) that police have arrested 22 people across the country suspected of misappropriating fuel from petrol stations. He added that 15 of the Naftne Industrije Srbije (NIS) pumps have been blocked. Investigators say the suspects, with the aid of officials, tampered with the machines so they don't show the actual amount of fuel pumped, resulting in illegal gains totalling more than 2m euros.

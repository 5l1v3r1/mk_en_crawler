SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnia and Herzegovina's ambassador to Yugoslavia, Zeljko Komsic, says he plans to resign, following the defeat of his Social Democratic Party in elections earlier this month. He pledged to hand in his resignation as soon as the new state bodies are in place. Komsic said the incoming officials would likely adopt new policies and appoint their own personnel to implement them. He added that he is unwilling to pursue a policy with which he disagrees. Bosnian Foreign Ministry spokesman Amer Kapetanovic said the ministry has no official comment. (Dnevni avaz, B92 - 12/10/02)

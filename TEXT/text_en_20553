SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The two largest Croat parties in BiH, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the HDZ 1990, have submitted a new proposal on police reform. In a statement Wednesday (October 10th), the Office of the High Representative (OHR) welcomed the initiative and said the document had been sent to the European Commission for evaluation.
This is the third proposal tabled: one was from the OHR and the other was drafted by BiH Bosniak presidency member Haris Silajdzic and Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik. The Silajdzic-Dodik accord was rejected both by the OHR for failing to meet all EC requirements, and by the other political parties. Lajcak has set a deadline for Monday to resolve the matter.

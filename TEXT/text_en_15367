VIENNA, Austria -- EU foreign ministers gathered in Austria at the weekend to discuss ways to revive the European Constitution. In a decision that could delay and make the accession of new members more difficult, the ministers postponed the decision on the European charter by one year. Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said enlargement would be put on hold until Europe has restructured its institutions. French European Affairs Minister Catherine Colonna made a similar statement, but indicated that an exception might be made for Croatia. Slovenia's Dimitrij Rupel pledged that Zagreb would join the EU with or without a new EU Constitution. (AFP, Reuters - 28/05/06)

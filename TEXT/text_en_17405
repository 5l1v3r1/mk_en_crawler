PARIS, France -- The new State Minister for European Affairs, Jean-Pierre Jouyet, says France will not agree to full EU membership for Turkey. In an interview Tuesday (May 22nd) with RTL radio, Jouyet said France would propose instead a privileged partnership with the country. This will be a chief topic when new President Nicolas Sarkozy makes his first official visit to Brussels on Wednesday. 
Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi defended Turkey's EU prospects Monday. "Personally, I am sure that Turkey belongs to Europe," he said, conceding, however, that membership would take a great deal of effort. (NTV, Turkishpress.com, AFP, Xinhua - 22/05/07)

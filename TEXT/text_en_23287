PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon appealed for the last time Monday (June 29th) for Serbian officers to return to their jobs with the Kosovo police, ahead of Tuesday's deadline. Earlier, the Kosovo police said that if the 250 suspended officers do not meet the deadline, their jobs will be considered vacancies and open to new recruits from the Serb community. Most of the officers walked off their jobs to protest Kosovo's declaration of independence in February 2008. They were on paid suspension until May 15th. Since then, around 50 police officers have returned to work. (Express, Koha Ditore - 30/06/09; B92, Tanjug - 29/06/09)

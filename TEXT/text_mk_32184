LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- The International Trust Fund for Demining and Mine Victims Assistance (ITF) said Wednesday (9 October) that some 4,000 square kilometres of minefields remain in Southeast Europe, and kill an average of seven people every month. It will take at least until 2010 to tackle this problem, the ITF said in a statement. The fund, set up by Slovenia in 1998, has received some $100m in donations. The money has been spent clearing 31 million square metres of minefields and assisting some 680 landmine victims. The ITF has launched mine removal operations in Albania, BiH, Croatia, Macedonia, and Yugoslavia and has established collaborative projects in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. (AFP - 09/10/02)

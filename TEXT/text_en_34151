SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg said Wednesday (16 July) that he plans to sack four ministers in his 19-member cabinet. The reshuffle is widely viewed as an attempt to counter plunging government popularity. Saxe-Coburg told reporters that Social Policy Minister Lidia Shuleva, who is also a deputy prime minister, would replace Nikolai Vassilev as economy minister. Vassilev, meanwhile, would become minister of transport. Transport and Communications Minister Plamen Petrov, Education Minister Vladimir Atanasov, Health Care Minister Bozhidar Finkov and Minister Without Portfolio Nezhdet Mollov would leave. It would be the first cabinet reshuffle since the current government took power two years ago.
Also Wednesday, Vassilev is to meet with a business delegation led by US Deputy Secretary of Commerce Samuel W Bodman. They will discuss opportunities to develop trade and investment co-operation and stimulate economic growth. (Trud, 24 Chassa, Reuters - 16/07/03; BTA, BNT - 15/07/03)

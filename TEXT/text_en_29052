ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in Istanbul on Friday (August 6th) annulled the 102 arrest warrants issued last month for retired and active duty officers charged with plotting to topple the government. The court accepted a request lodged by lawyers of the suspects to cancel the warrants, but did not provide arguments for its decision. The annulment comes days after the Supreme Military Council blocked the promotion of some of those accused. A total of 196 people were indicted in July. 
Prosecutors say the plot, allegedly hatched in 2003, envisioned a systematic spreading of social chaos via various armed operations, including assassinations of prominent religious leaders, journalists and academicians, as well as bombings at key mosques. The resulting chaos would have set the stage for a military intervention. (AFP, Anadolu news agency, Al Jazeera, BBC - 06/08/10)

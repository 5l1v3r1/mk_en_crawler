ZAGREB, Croatia -- Experts say counterfeited currency will become a more serious problem for Croatia next year, when the euro becomes the official currency in neighbouring Slovenia. Zagreb hosted an international conference Thursday (October 12th) on measures to protect euro banknotes from falsification. Participants agreed that only close regional co-operation would help fight the problem. They also praised Croatian institutions â particularly the central bank -- for their efforts to prevent currency forgery. (HINA - 12/10/06)

TIRANA, Albania -- Albanian General Staff Chief General Pellumb Qazimi said on Tuesday (1 November) that the military is scrapping its fleet of old MiG aircraft, following several accidents that claimed the lives of 35 pilots. Albania plans to replace the aircraft with multipurpose helicopters that meet NATO standards.
In other news, the government is reportedly taking steps to boost efforts at tracking illegal migration and monitoring suspicious activities by foreigners.

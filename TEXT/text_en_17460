SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev indicated on Tuesday (June 26th) there may be personnel and structural changes in the cabinet next week, after a meeting of the tripartite ruling coalition's leaders. Earlier this month, Stanishev accepted the resignations of Justice Minister Georgi Petkanov and Economy Minister Rumen Ovcharov, in the wake of a major corruption scandal involving the state-run Bulgartabac tobacco holding and the Sofia district heating distributor Toplofikatsiya. Replacements for three deputy ministers must also be chosen. (BNR, Mediapool, Darik - 26/06/07)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The foreign ministry announced on Tuesday (August 18th) that it has sent a protest note to Albania's charge d'affaires in Belgrade over recent statements by Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha. He was quoted on Saturday as saying that the national unity of Albanians should be among the priorities of all politicians in Albania and Kosovo. "There should be no customs administration between the two countries. We should by no means allow Albania and Kosovo to view each other as foreign countries," Berisha said in a televised interview. 
The Serbian Foreign Ministry strongly condemned the "provocative statement" which, according to Belgrade, violates Serbia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. (Beta, RTS, Blic, B92 - 18/08/09)

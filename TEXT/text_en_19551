ZAGREB, Croatia -- Accession negotiations between the EU and Croatia are proceeding normally, Vincent Degert, head of the European Commission's delegation in Croatia, said on Monday (September 24th) after a meeting with Portugal's Ambassador to Croatia, Luis Barreiros. Portugal currently holds the rotating EU presidency. Degert stressed that the recent report on justice and home affairs applied mostly to existing EU members rather than addressing Croatia's readiness to open negotiations in that chapter of the acquis. So far, Croatia has opened 12 of the 33 chapters of the acquis and provisionally closed two. (Poslovni Dnevnik - 25/09/07; Vecernji list, HRT, HINA - 24/09/07)

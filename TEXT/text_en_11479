BUCHAREST, Romania -- Three Romanian journalists and their American-Iraqi translator have been released after two months in captivity in Iraq, Romanian President Traian Basescu announced Sunday (22 May). The abductors of Marie Jeanne Ion, Sorin Miscoci, Ovidiu Ohanesian and Mohamad Munaf reportedly decided to set them free in response to calls by influential Saudi preacher Salman al-Odeh and Muslims in Romania. The terrorists threatened to kill the hostages by 27 April unless Romania's 800 soldiers left Iraq. Bucharest refused to heed their calls.

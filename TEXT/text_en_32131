ZAGREB, Croatia -- Former Croatian Army Chief of Staff Janko Bobetko was hospitalised Thursday (14 November) after he received personal assurances from Prime Minister Ivica Racan that he would not be served with an indictment from the UN war crimes tribunal. The 83-year-old retired general, who is wanted for crimes against humanity, has suffered several heart attacks and is battling diabetes. The government has forwarded a medical report on his condition to a local court, which must now decide whether he is fit to travel to The Hague. Bobetko has refused to surrender to the international court and has not recognised its jurisdiction. Officials in Zagreb are expecting the tribunal to send doctors to verify the general's medical condition. The government has come under fire from the West for its reluctance to extradite him.

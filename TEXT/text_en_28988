PODGORICA, Montenegro -- European Integration Minister Gordana Djurovic and European Commission (EC) Head of Delegation in Podgorica, Leopold Maurer, signed a financing agreement Monday (November 8th) worth 28.6m euros, under the instrument for pre-accession assistance's 2010 national programme. After the ceremony, they agreed that the EU's support is essential for democratic and economic reforms in Montenegro. Funds from the 2010 programme will be used to strengthen institutional capacities in the judiciary, police, local governance and transportation. Part of the funding will also go for projects in the field of environmental protection, as well as social programmes, health care and the financial sector. 
On Tuesday, the EC will release its progress reports on EU aspirants, including Montenegro. The document is expected to recommend granting EU candidate status to Podgorica, though Maurer commented on Monday that the country still has a lot of work to do before starting accession talks.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO's new Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday (August 3rd) that KFOR could be significantly reduced to a small reaction force or even completely withdrawn by the time his four-year term ends. While stressing there is no need to hurry, he predicted circumstances will be favourable enough for KFOR to leave in the foreseeable future. In June, NATO defence ministers endorsed a plan for a phased reduction of the Alliance's 14,000-strong peacekeeping force, citing the improved security situation in Kosovo. KFOR could downsize to a 10,000-strong force by January 2010 and ultimately to about 2,500 troops over the next two years. (Tanjug, RTS, DPA, AP - 03/08/09)

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- As expected, Bosnian Serb prosecutors filed charges Sunday (10 November) against Milan Prica, director of the Orao defence company, technical department deputy chief Teodosije Kecman and marketing head Gordan Santrac. The three executives are accused of illegal production and trade in arms and explosives, as well as forging or destroying official documents. A magistrate says a fourth suspect will be charged, but provided no other details. The move came after local authorities, acting on a request from the United States and SFOR, uncovered a transaction in which Orao supplied aircraft spare parts to Iraq using a Yugoslav firm as an intermediary.

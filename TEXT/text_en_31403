SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Interior Minister Hari Kostov confirmed Tuesday (28 January) that the government has decided to dissolve the elite police unit known as the Lions and transfer some members into a special anti-terrorism unit to be formed at the interior ministry. The transfer of 409 out of the 1,200 Lions with regular labour contracts with the government would start immediately. But there will be no amnesty for those who planned or committed crimes in the crisis areas during the 2001 conflict, stressed Kostov. The decision to disband the Lions follows months of pressure from the international community. (Utrinski Vesnik, Vest - 29/01/03; A1 TV, MIA - 28/01/03)

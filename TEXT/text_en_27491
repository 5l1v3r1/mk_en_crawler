BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Emil Boc submitted a proposal Monday (September 27th) to President Traian Basescu for replacing Vasile Blaga as interior minister. The nominee is Traian Igas, a Basescu confidante and leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's caucus in the Senate. Under current procedures, only the consent of the president is required as parliament does not vote on new ministers. Blaga resigned on Monday after a protest by about 6,000 police officers Friday. The rally prompted both Basescu and Prime Minister Emil Boc to ask the interior ministry to withdraw the officers. Commenting on his decision to resign, Blaga said the protest had dishonoured him. 
Police union leaders, meanwhile, announced on Monday they plan to stage street protests starting October 7th until both the president and the prime minister resign. Marin Gruia, president of the police union, told a press conference that last week's spontaneous policemen's protest was not illegal, as the Bucharest mayor allowed it, and it was not intended to lead to Blaga's resignation.

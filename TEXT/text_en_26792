SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian said in an interview with Sarajevo-based daily Nezavisne Novine on Sunday (September 6th) that no progress has been made in terms of BiH's political situation. He warned that the chances of BiH joining the EU and NATO are slim and that the transition of the Office of the High Representative (OHR) to the Office of the EU's Special Representative will likely be delayed again. Gregorian stressed that resolving the state property issue must be a priority for authorities and politicians. The decision to close the OHR lies with the Peace Implementation Council (PIC), but only if the country fulfils five established objectives and two conditions. Political directors of the PIC Steering Board meet next in November. (Nezavisne Novine, BHRT, Pincom.info, RTRS - 06/09/09)

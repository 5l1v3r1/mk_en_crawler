SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Central Bank Governor Peter Nicholl met with representatives of the Statistical Office of the European Communities to discuss the possible launch of a new European Commission (EC) assistance programme for statistical services in BiH. According to Nicholl, future EC aid should focus on collection of new economic data. The continued lack of reliable statistical data was described as a major problem in the latest EC report on BiH's performance under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, released in late March. The country was urged to work on harmonising the entities' statistical methods and establishing a single statistical system by year's end. (CCBH press release, Onasa - 30/04/03)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Belgrade-based newspaper Blic quoted EU special envoy to Kosovo Pieter Feith as saying on Wednesday (March 12th) that there is no time limit to his mandate in Kosovo and that he will stay there until the status plan is completely implemented. He added that he would remain until Kosovo becomes a member of the EU. 
In an interview with another daily in Serbia, Vecernje Novosti, Feith discussed the EU civil mission in Kosovo, known as EULEX. "We are not coming to Kosovo to create a NATO state," he said.
In other news Wednesday, police in western Kosovo arrested a Serb national suspected of war crimes committed in 1999. Momcilo Jovanovic, 48, was spotted among a dozen Serb nationals who came to the village of Vitomirica to visit the graves of their relatives and see whether they could build new houses on the ruins of old ones that had been destroyed.

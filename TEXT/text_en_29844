TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha nominated Bujar Nishani for the post of interior minister on Wednesday (April 20th). If decreed by the president, Nishani would return to the office he ran back in 2009. The post of justice minister is still vacant. Berisha also needs to find a replacement for Ferdinand Xhaferri, who stepped down as culture minister, to run for mayor of Durres. (Lajmifundit, NOA, News 24 - 20/04/11)

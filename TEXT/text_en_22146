THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The Hague war crimes tribunal on Friday (October 17th) rejected former Serbian Defence Minister Dragoljub Ojdanic's request for temporary release on health grounds. The court ruled that the defendant has not provided "serious and convincing" evidence to justify his release. Ojdanic, a former commander of the Yugoslav Army, allegedly war committed crimes in Kosovo in 1999. He is facing trial along with former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic, former Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic and former army and police generals Nebojsa Pavkovic, Vladimir Lazarevic and Sreten Lukic for the deportation, murder and persecution of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo in the first half of 1999.

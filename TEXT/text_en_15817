In other news, about 20,000 Macedonians have applied for Bulgarian citizenship, as Bulgaria moves closer to membership in the EU, international media reported Thursday. Another 20,000 have already received their new passports, which allow them to travel to most of Europe without visas. Observers expect demand for the Bulgarian passports to grow if Europe opens its labour markets to Bulgarian citizens when the country joins the EU.

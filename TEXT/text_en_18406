TIRANA, Albania -- The main opposition Socialist Party has decided not to participate in the January 20th municipal elections. The party issued a statement Monday (December 11th) that described the current electoral process as far from democratic and said that the ruling Democratic Party (DP)-led coalition had hindered political dialogue. 
Later Monday, Ilir Meta, leader the Socialist Movement for Integration, said his party would boycott what he called as a "farce" of an electoral process. The Central Election Commission confirms that none of the left-wing opposition parties met the Sunday evening registration deadline. (Albanian News, Dnevnik - 12/12/06)

TIRANA, Albania -- The Legality Movement Party (LMP) demanded help Monday (14 October) from the OSCE mission in Tirana. LMP chairman Eqrem Spahia urged the organisation to become more active in electoral reforms. He said the LMP opposes those who want to review the OSCE status in Albania; Spahia says the party considers the OSCE's presence indispensable. He adds that the leaders of the major opposition Democratic Party and the ruling Socialist Party are trying to hinder political pluralism in the country. (ATA - 14/10/02)

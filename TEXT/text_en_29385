ANKARA, Turkey -- Chief of General Staff General Ilker Basbug vowed on Sunday (May 2nd) to "smash" Kurdish rebels after five Turkish soldiers were killed in attacks staged by the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in the last couple of days. "If you think that these attacks will dash Turkish armed forces in their fight against terrorism, you are seriously wrong," Basbug told a press conference in Ankara. Four soldiers died in an attack Friday staged by the PKK in Tunceli province. Seven were injured. Also Friday, a soldier was killed after stepping on a mine believed to have been planted by the PKK in the town of Cukurca, in Hakkari province. (AFP, Hurriyet - 02/05/10)

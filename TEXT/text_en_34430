TIRANA, Albania -- The government and the European Commission signed two agreements Thursday (16 October) on co-operation under CARDS 2003. The first is the CARDS 2003 National Programme, which will assist the country in finalising the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. The programme will extend grants to help deal with the challenges of pre-accession, especially reforms in the judicial system and law enforcement. The second agreement, the CARDS Regional Programme, seeks to boost co-operation among Balkan countries. (Albanian News, ATA, BBC - 16/10/03)

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in his latest report on the work of the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) on Wednesday (June 4th) that he sees a chance to resolve the long-standing Cyprus issue. Efforts to resolve the dispute between the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities on the island resumed in late March after a landmark agreement between Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat and new Cypriot President Demetris Christofias. In his report, Ban urged the two to implement what they had agreed on. He suggests renewing the mandate of the UNFICYP for six months. (Cyprus Mail, Famagusta Gazette - 05/06/08; CNA - 04/06/08)

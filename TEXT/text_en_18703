BUCHAREST, Romania -- Some 64 senators from opposition parties filed a no confidence motion Thursday (February 8th) against Justice Minister Monica Macovei. Submitted to the Senate's permanent bureau, it will be discussed next Tuesday. The opposition says she "failed to sketch even one fundamental idea" about reforming the justice system. Macovei has had several public disputes with judges from the Superior Council of Magistrates, most of them opposition members. 
Also Thursday, the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies adopted a joint declaration asking President Traian Basescu to publicly withdrawal statements critical of Parliament.In one particularly controversial case, he said "politicians only make laws that serve criminals, and not the public interest".

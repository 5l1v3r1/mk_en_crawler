BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) police searched two houses in Banja Luka and Laktasi on Sunday (25 September), reportedly to apprehend Ljuban Ecim, the ex-deputy chief of the RS State Security department and Radovan Karadzic's former logistics officer. Local media reported that members of the EUFOR Multinational Task Force Northwest assisted in the operation, which started before dawn and lasted five hours. An RS police spokesman said that while no one was detained, information seized during the operation would be "helpful" in future efforts by the RS government to fully co-operate with The Hague tribunal.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The junior government coalition ally, the National Movement for Stability and Progress (NDSV), said on Tuesday (July 1st) it supports most of the ideas proposed by the ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) to change the electoral system. The key component is a threefold increase of the state subsidy for political parties in a bid to make campaign financing more transparent. The NDSV also agreed that parties will need to register local organisations in at least two-thirds of electoral districts, a move that would virtually eliminate marginal parties. The NDSV, however, remained vague on a proposal to elect a limited number of MPs -- possibly 30 out of 240 -- through a majority vote. (Sega, Dnevnik, Trud - 02/07/08)

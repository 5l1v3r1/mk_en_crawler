SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Ambassador to the EU Osman Topcagic is downplaying fears about a request by the Netherlands and France to introduce a monitoring mechanism covering the visa-free regime for BiH and Albania. He says Bosnian citizens have nothing to fear as no abuses have been reported so far. In an interview with the Nezavisne Novine daily on Monday (February 7th), Topcagic stressed the importance of respecting the rules related to visa liberalisation. Citizens of BiH and Albania have been free to travel without visas in the Schengen Zone since mid-December. (RTRS, Nezavisne Novine - 07/02/11)

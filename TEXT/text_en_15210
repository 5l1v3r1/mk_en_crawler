ANKARA, Turkey -- Prosecutors have indicted 175 people for organising or taking part in violent riots in southeast Turkey. The violence spread quickly in March following the funerals of 14 Kurdish militants. Charges include violation of laws on demonstrations, orchestrating riots and membership in an armed group. The suspects could be sentenced to between three years and life in prison if convicted. (AFP - 28/04/06)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- In an interview for A1 TV on Sunday (30 November), Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski denied speculation that he would run for president in the 2004 election. He reiterated that he is committed to the work of the government and described the rumours, which surfaced during his trip to United States last week, as "pure speculation". In regard to those talks in Washington, Crvenkovski stressed he had received full US support for the country's efforts towards Euro-Atlantic integration.
On Monday, Macedonia will release the official results of the national census conducted last year. OSCE Ambassador to Macedonia Craig Jenness told Radio Free Europe it would not dramatically affect the security situation.
On Friday meanwhile, 28 Peace Corps volunteers from the United States officially began two-year missions in Macedonia. (Utrinski Vesnik, Dnevnik, Vest - 01/12/03; A1 TV, MIA - 30/11/03; MIA - 28/11/03)

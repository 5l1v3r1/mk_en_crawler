PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Former President Momir Bulatovic told a court in Podgorica on Friday (November 12th) that deportation of Bosniak civilians from Montenegro in 1992 was not a mistake by individuals. He was testifying at the trial of nine former police officers charged with crimes against civilians for handing over 79 Bosniaks to Bosnian Serbs. Most of the Muslims, who escaped to Montenegro during the 1992-1995 conflict, died at the hands of the Serbs. Bulatovic said that state authorities were familiar with actions of the police, aimed at preventing terrorism. He gave the court documents that he says proved the defendants' innocence.

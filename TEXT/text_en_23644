NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The two Cypriot communities are committed to discussing the difficult property issue during ongoing direct reunification talks "within the framework of the UN principles", Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat pledged on Monday (January 26th). The property issue, which Talat described as the "hardest chapter", will undergo discussion at his next round of talks with Cypriot President Demetris Christofias on Wednesday. The two sides recently wrapped up discussions of the administration and power-sharing chapter.
In related news Monday, Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis expressed hope the ongoing talks will achieve a settlement that will "terminate the Turkish occupation" and reunify the island as a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation with a single sovereignty. She was speaking before the European Policy Centre in Brussels. (Anadolu news agency, Hurriyet, CNA, Financial Mirror, In.news - 26/01/09)

ANKARA, Turkey -- A Turkish man has been arrested for spreading the Zotob worm, which hit the computer networks of several major news organisations in the United States earlier this month. Atilla Ekici, 21, was detained in Adana on Thursday (25 August). He is accused of paying a Moroccan hacker, Farid Essebar, 18, to create the Trojan that takes control mostly of Windows 2000-run systems. 
In other news, Turkish forces killed four Kurdish guerrillas in the southeastern Batman province, the authorities reported Friday. One militant was captured, but up to 16 fighters managed to escape. (AP, Reuters, Washington Post - 27/08/05)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic says he is satisfied with a high-level BiH-EU meeting held at the weekend within the framework of the UN General Assembly in New York. He said the most positive result of all was the EU's confirmation that BiH would no longer be treated as a matter of external but internal EU politics, and that bilateral dialogue would be entrusted to an enlargement commissioner.

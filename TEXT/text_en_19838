NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The International Crisis Group (ICG) on Monday (August 20th) urged Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos to step down. A new report by the group describes him as hindering efforts to resolve issues on the divided island. In order for progress to take place, Papadopoulos must follow the example of former Turkish Cypriot president Rauf Denktash and clear the way for a new leader, the NGO said.
In an interview Tuesday, current Turkish Cypriot president Mehmet Ali Talat told the Daily Telegraph that Cyprus might remain divided forever if the "poisonous wound" separating Turks from Greek is not quickly healed. (CNA, Daily Telegraph, The London Greek news - 21/08/07; ANA-MPA - 20/08/07)

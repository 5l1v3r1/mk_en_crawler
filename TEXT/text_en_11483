SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg announced personnel changes in the cabinet Monday (21 February). According to a deal struck with coalition partners, Economy Minister Lidia Shuleva will leave her post, as will Agriculture Minister Mehmed Dikme, Energy Minister Milko Kovachev and Culture Minister Bozhidar Abrashev. Kovachev, however, will remain in government, taking over as economy minister. The shuffle follows criticism over failed efforts to privatise the tobacco industry and a no-confidence motion by the opposition.
In other news, three minor Bulgarian parties confirmed on Sunday that they will form a coalition to run in the next parliamentary elections. The Bulgarian Agricultural National Union-People's Union, the Union of Free Democrats and the nationalist VMRO are apparently ruling out support for Saxe-Coburg's ruling NMS-II party.

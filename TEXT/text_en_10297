SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The ruling Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM) elected Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski as its new party leader at an extraordinary congress Thursday (25 November). In the second round of voting, 391 of 657 delegates voted for Buckovski, and 265 for the other party deputy head, Radmila Sekerinska. Hari Kostov resigned as prime minister a week ago over disagreements with the Democratic Union for Integration, the junior member of the governing coalition. President Branko Crvenkovski is expected to call Buckovski on Friday and give him the formal mandate to form the new cabinet. (Macedonian Radio, Makfax, news.bg - 26/11/04; MIA, A1 TV - 25/11/04)

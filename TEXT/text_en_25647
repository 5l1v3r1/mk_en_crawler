STRASBOURG, France -- Doris Pack, a member of the European Parliament (EP) delegation for Southeast Europe, has drawn up a report urging the EP to voice concern over the unstable political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and its limited progress toward EU integration, media reported on Monday (March 22nd). The document condemns "nationalistic rhetoric" undermining the inter-ethnic reconciliation process and the functioning of state institutions. Pack urges Republika Srpska (RS) to continue participating in negotiations on state property and to refrain from obstructing decisions by the Office of the High Representative. In Banja Luka, RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik fired back, saying Western diplomats should stop interfering in the country's affairs. 
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen and the 28 NATO permanent representatives were set to visit BiH on Tuesday to meet domestic leaders and members of the international community. (Fena, RTRS - 23/03/10; Dnevni Avaz, BHRT, Fena, Srna, EUobserver - 22/03/10)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis said Tuesday (3 December) that his country stands ready to help the United States if it comes to using force to disarm Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. He mentioned use of airspace and facilities, but said it would be difficult to persuade the Turkish people to accept any substantial US ground forces. Yakis spoke after talks with British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw. US Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and Undersecretary of State Marc Grossman, meanwhile, held talks with Turkish Prime Minister Abdullah Gul and others. Wolfowitz said afterwards that concerns about "the political, economic and security impact on Turkey" of a conflict in Iraq would be best addressed if the country took part in planning from the very start.

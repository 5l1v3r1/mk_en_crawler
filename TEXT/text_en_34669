ANKARA, Turkey -- Civil servants withdrew from negotiations with the government Thursday (21 August) over salary increases. Confederation of Public Workers' Trade Unions Chairman Sami Evren called the talks "useless" after a second meeting on the issue with State Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ali Sahin. Evren said the government failed to come up with an acceptable proposal. Sahin maintains that the government would make sure that the 2004 state budget includes higher salaries for civil servants, but did not mention exact figures.

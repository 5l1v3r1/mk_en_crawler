ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor reiterated on Friday (March 11th) that she would call elections only after the government completes the country's EU accession talks. Croatia hopes to wrap those up by June. Thousands of Croats have been demonstrating in Zagreb and other cities since February, insisting on Kosor's resignation and early elections. They accuse the government of inability to govern the country and corruption. 
Meanwhile, President Ivo Josipovic held several meetings on Friday with leaders of parties represented in parliament to discuss the political situation. Josipovic said he understands the protestors because people are "undergoing a bad period, unemployment, low pay and poverty." (HRT, Nacional, Novi List, Index.hr - 11/03/11)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- President Fatmir Sejdiu again warned on Tuesday (June 26th) against delays in the Kosovo status process. "We expect that after several attempts made in the UN Security Council, a common language to be found for the new resolution on Kosovo [independence] will pass," he told a delegation of German Bundestag members. "This would be the best solution because it would open the way for further development of Kosovo," he added. 
Meanwhile, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer reiterated during a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow that the Kosovo status problem must be resolved on the basis of UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan. He has urged Russia not to veto a new Security Council resolution based on that roadmap. (RTK, RFE, Telegrafi, KosovaLive, B92, Reuters, Tanjug - 26/06/07)

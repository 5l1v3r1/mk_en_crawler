BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The trial of eight Serbs accused of committing war crimes during fighting for control of the Croatian town of Vukovar starts Tuesday (9 March) in Belgrade. A special prosecutor charged them last year with murdering Croat prisoners at a Vukovar hospital. An estimated 200 patients were executed by Serb militiamen and Yugoslav troops in November 1991. One of the eight defendants died in Belgrade on Monday from injuries he suffered during a suicide attempt two months ago. The UN tribunal has already charged three senior officers in connection with the atrocities. (AP, AFP - 08/03/04)

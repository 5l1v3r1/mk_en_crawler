SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament will not be debating the country's constitutional name, Parliament Speaker Ljubco Jordanovski said on Thursday (27 October), in response to a question from the Macedonian Information Agency. He said it is not the exclusive right of this generation of politicians to decide the question. Greece has long challenged its neighbour's use of the name "Macedonia", alleging it is historically inaccurate and implies wider territorial ambitions. Jordanovski, however, said every country has the right to choose its own constitutional name. (MIA - 27/10/05)

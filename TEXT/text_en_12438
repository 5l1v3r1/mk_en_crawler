SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Council of Europe's Group of States Against Corruption (GRECO) submitted its report Thursday (7 April) to the Macedonian government on the level of corruption in the country. Overall, GRECO was satisfied with the cabinet's latest measures against corruption, including the adoption of a national anti-corruption strategy, the granting to courts the right to suspend public procurement if corruption allegations surface, and adoption of a law on protecting witnesses. GRECO advised the cabinet to issue corruption reports more regularly and to reduce the number of public officials entitled to immunity from prosecution. (Macedonian government Web site - 07/04/05)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica on Wednesday (23 February) flatly rejected a Montenegrin plan for a split between the two republics, calling it "a serious breach" of the 2003 accord that set up the current loose union. The Montenegrin leaders had suggested a confederation of independent states that would share a common foreign and defence policy and little else. Serbian President Boris Tadic said the Montenegrin plan should be studied carefully, but warned that the two republics would find it easier to join the EU if they retained their current union.

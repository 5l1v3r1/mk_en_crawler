BELGRADE, Serbia -- Lawmakers will start debating Vojvodina's draft statute and a bill on transferring powers to the province on November 24th, Parliament Speaker Slavica Djukic-Dejanovic said on Monday (November 16th). Leaders of the caucuses have agreed to interrupt the current parliamentary session and call an extraordinary one in order to discuss the legislation. The parliament of Vojvodina has already supported harmonisation of the statute -- passed more than a year ago -- with the bill. (Beta, B92, Medjunarodni Radio Srbija, Tanjug - 16/11/09)

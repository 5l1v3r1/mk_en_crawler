WASHINGTON, United States -- The Senate voted unanimously Thursday (8 May) to endorse Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia as the newest members of NATO. "These nations will make NATO stronger, and we need that strength for all the work that lies ahead," President George W Bush said, urging other members of the Alliance to ratify the accession accords of the seven countries. Romanian Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana, who spoke afterwards on behalf of all candidates, pledged allegiance to NATO's values and urged that the doors of the Alliance should be left open to others in the Balkans, particularly Albania, Croatia and Macedonia. Full membership for the seven is expected next May. (Sega, Dnevnik, Trud - 09/05/03; Reuters, AFP, AP, CNN, bTV, BTA, Rompres - 08/05/03)

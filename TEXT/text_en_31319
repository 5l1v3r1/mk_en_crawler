TIRANA, Albania -- Heavy rain and storms are pounding northern Albania, prompting residents to leave their homes as a precaution. Emergency centres reported on Tuesday (November 30th) that high levels of water have forced evacuations in Shkodra but the situation remains under control. Rural roads have been damaged, while some villages are experiencing power cuts as a result of damaged distribution networks. Northern Albania has been flooded several times this year due to water coming from hydro-plant collectors. (Balkan Web, Top Channel, BBC, Shekulli - 30/11/10)

THE HAGUE, the Netherlands -- A medical report released by the UN war crimes tribunal Thursday (May 21st) said that while the health of Serb war crimes indictee Jovica Stanisic has improved, he is still unable to stand trial. A neurologist who examined him says Stanisic still has trouble standing and walking. The former Serb security chief and his deputy, Franko Simatovic, face charges of training, arming and directing paramilitary units that killed or persecuted non-Serbs during the 1992-1995 Balkan conflicts. Their trial began in April 2007 but came to a halt a year ago over Stanisic's medical problems. Judges had hoped to resume the proceedings next week.
In other news Thursday, after hours of negotiation, Serbian police managed to disarm and arrest a man carrying two hand grenades who threatened to blow himself up at the presidency building in Belgrade. President Boris Tadic was not inside the building early on, but reportedly went to his office later in the afternoon. (Beta, B92 - 22/05/09; Tanjug, B92, Beta, Reuters - 21/05/09)

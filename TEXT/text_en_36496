DEBAR, Macedonia -- Macedonian and Albanian border police held a joint exercise on Monday (10 May) in the border town of Debar. The drill was part of a project to strengthen border control and fight organised crime, sponsored by the Danish government and launched a month ago. Macedonian Army experts are participating, as the military retains much of the responsibility for border control.
In other news, Macedonian Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski is in Bucharest meeting with senior officials. The focus of the visit is on exchanging experiences related to the army reform process as well as on joint participation in peacekeeping missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. (Makfax - 10/05/04)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX police officers used tear gas Saturday (April 25th) to disperse Serbs who tried to prevent Albanians in Serb-dominated northern Mitrovica from rebuilding their houses in the Brdjani district. The homes were destroyed during the 1999 conflict. Serbs oppose the return of Albanians and have vowed to hold daily protests until the issue is resolved. "This project should be stopped once and for all because the return of Albanians in northern Mitrovica destabilises the situation," Nebojsa Minic, a Serb representative, told UNMIK, KFOR and EULEX officials.

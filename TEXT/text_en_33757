TIRANA, Albania -- Albania's major opposition Democratic Party (DP) said Thursday (27 November) that it is ready to boycott the parliament again if the parliamentary crisis is not resolved. Presently, the cabinet is functioning without two ministers, a situation which DP calls unconstitutional. DP earlier blocked the work of the parliament by walking out in protest of a controversial decision by the ruling Socialist Party. Parliament Speaker Servet Pellumbi said that blocking the work of the parliament is detrimental and would not solve the problems. (ATA, BBC - 27/11/03)

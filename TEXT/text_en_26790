TIRANA, Albania -- An earthquake rattled northeast Albania late Sunday, measuring 5.4 on the Richter scale. Its epicentre was a village in the Dibra region, near the border with Macedonia, about 100km northeast of Tirana. Residents of both Macedonia and Kosovo felt it as well. More than 50 smaller quakes followed, with the last recorded at about 6 am. Though media reports suggest that about 1,000 houses in the municipality of Peshkopia were damaged, no injuries have been reported. Prime Minister Sali Berisha plans to visit the area Monday.

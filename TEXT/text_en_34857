WASHINGTON, United States -- The IMF Executive Board completed the fifth review of Turkey's stand-by agreement late Friday (1 August) and decided to release $476m out of an $18 billion credit package. The loan was to have been granted in June, but the IMF delayed payment because of concerns that the government was lagging behind with economic reforms. The Fund also agreed to reschedule some of Turkey's debt payments, shifting them to 2005-2006 from 2004-2005. (Anadolu Agency, NTV, AFP - 02/08/03; Dow Jones, AFP, IMF - 01/08/03)

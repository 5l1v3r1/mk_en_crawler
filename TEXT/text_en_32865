SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Boris Trajkovski met Friday (29 November) with leaders of the ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic Union for Integration, to discuss the demarcation of Macedonia's border with Yugoslavia. Trajkovski, Musa Xhaferi, Agron Buxhaku and Teuta Arifi agreed that border demarcation should not be linked to the issue of Kosovo's final status. Trajkovski assured the Albanian politicians that the problems of ethnic Albanians living in the border regions would be resolved in parallel with the delineation process. (Dnevnik - 02/12/02)

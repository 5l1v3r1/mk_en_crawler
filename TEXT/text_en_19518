PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci have dismissed Serbia's proposal to partition Kosovo along ethnic lines. At a joint news conference Tuesday (March 25th) in Pristina, Thaci said the idea was "unacceptable". Sejdiu agreed, reiterating that Kosovo is "an integral and unique country".
The plan, submitted to UNMIK by Serbian Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic, aims at the "functional separation of Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo". Only Serbs would be allowed to control the police, judiciary and customs services in parts of Kosovo where Serbs are a majority. Without comment, UNMIK forwarded the plan to UN headquarters for analysis.
Separately, Sejdiu and Thaci vowed that Kosovo will fulfil its obligations regarding the border demarcation process with Macedonia, in line with former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's blueprint. They also expressed hope that Macedonia would recognise Kosovo soon. (Telegrafi, RTK, Reuters, Xinhua, Makfax - 25/03/08)

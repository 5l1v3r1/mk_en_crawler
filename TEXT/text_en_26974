ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told a conference of Turkish ambassadors Monday (January 4th) that the country needs a new and stronger foreign policy. "A new world is emerging and along with it, new requirements are being born. And we need to develop a systematic and a strategic vision which would meet those requirements," he said. Davutoglu stressed that Turkish diplomacy should reflect a country that will join the EU by 2023 and will become one of the world's ten most developed economies. He added that Turkey's focus is on the EU accession process, and that no compromise will be allowed in its integration process. He also announced that Turkey will open 26 more diplomatic missions abroad this year. (Zaman - 05/01/10; Hurriyet, World Bulletin - 04/01/10)

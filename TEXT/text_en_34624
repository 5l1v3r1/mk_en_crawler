BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The OSCE strongly condemns recent acts of violence in southern Serbia, said Maurizio Massari, the head of the OSCE mission in Belgrade. "I want to express our strongest and unequivocal condemnation and opposition to these acts," Massari said on Monday (25 August). He insisted, however, that the violence would not stand in the way of building democracy and creating a multiethnic society. (B92, BBC, Tanjug, Fonet - 25/08/03)

ATHENS, Greece -- Police announced on Sunday (August 16th) the rescue of ten illegal immigrants who spent a month locked in a shipping container in Athens. While in captivity, the immigrants were allegedly tortured, and their captors demanded they pay another 4,000 euros in exchange for freedom. Most of the migrants were Pakistani nationals, but there were also Somalis and a Syrian. Police say they had arrived in Greece via Turkey and were herded into the container located in the industrial suburb of Aspropyrgos. Six people have been arrested for human trafficking.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU leaders decided on Friday (December 17th) to officially offer Montenegro EU candidate status. The European Commission (EC) recommended the move in early November, but at the same time, cited some key areas that required attention on the path to full-fledged EU membership. They include strengthening the rule of law, reforming the judiciary and the electoral system and tackling organised crime and corruption. Friday's news boosted speculation that Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic may be stepping down soon. Media are reporting he was waiting for candidate status before resigning, possibly this month, and may be succeeded by Finance Minister Igor Luksic.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic says that partitioning Kosovo would be the only viable long-term solution. In an interview with the Pristina-based newspaper Zeri on Sunday (May 15th), he said that Serb-dominated parts of Kosovo should be acceded to Serbia, while the Albanian-populated part should be allowed to secede. The minister stressed that this is his personal opinion, adding "while Pristina could declare independence, then also Serbs in the north could declare independence without consulting Pristina." As for ongoing negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina, he was quoted as saying that with "a sterile dialogue like this, years and decades will pass without results". (RTS, Beta, Zeri - 15/05/11)

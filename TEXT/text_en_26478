PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A panel composed of EULEX and Kosovo Supreme Court judges dropped war crime charges against Miroslav Vuckovic of Mitrovica on Thursday (October 8th). He was first arrested in August 1999 for committing crimes against civilians. He spent five years in detention before being released provisionally to await trial. A series of trials ensued. His lawyer, Miro Delevic, said on Thursday that the UNMIK District Court convicted Vuckovic three times, and the Kosovo Supreme Court returned the case for review twice before dropping all charges Thursday.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- State and government leaders of all Southeast European (SEE) countries have strongly condemned the terror attacks in London that killed dozens of people and wounded hundreds more Thursday (7 July). Official statements issued by Ankara, Athens, Belgrade, Bucharest, Sarajevo, Skopje, Sofia, Tirana and Zagreb all criticised the attacks on innocent citizens and expressed deep condolences to the families of the victims. They also reaffirmed their determination to assist in the fight against terrorism. Several countries announced increased security measures, including Greece, which also offered to send officers skilled in counterterrorism to Britain. The personnel were trained in connection with the Athens Olympics last summer. (Albanian President Web site, Fena, bTV, HRT, ANA, A1 TV, Rompres, NTV, RTS - 07/07/05)

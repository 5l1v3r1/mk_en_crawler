NEW YORK, United States -- Kosovo will likely be the focus of Wednesday's (December 13th) UN Security Council session, at which UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker presents his regular three-month report on the situation in the province. The head of the Serbian government's special co-ordination centre for Kosovo and Metohija, Sanda Raskovic Ivic, will also address the session. 
On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters in Berlin that Kosovo would be the top priority when Germany assumes the rotating EU presidency in January. She added that Germany would seek to help Kosovo, but also will aim to secure the continuing democratic development of Serbia and the region.

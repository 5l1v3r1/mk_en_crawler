SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The tripartite presidency finally approved a law Wednesday (5 July) on the organisation of BiH armed forces, regulating the military's size, structure and location, in accordance with a plan drafted by the BiH government and NATO advisers. The move came four days after the deadline for ratification. High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling and other Western officials had warned that further delays would jeopardise BiH's NATO integration bid. (PBS BiH, RTRS - 05/07/06)

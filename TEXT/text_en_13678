BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic -- who also is chairman of the national council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal -- said at the weekend that the tribunal will likely allow former Yugoslav Army General Pavle Strugar to travel to Podgorica to undergo surgery. Strugar's family has submitted a formal request to war crimes chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte, and a decision is expected soon. Prior to the start of his trial in late 2003, Strugar spent time at a Belgrade military hospital recovering from an undisclosed illness. He is accused of war crimes stemming from the Dubrovnik siege in 1991-1992.
In other news, a former Kosovo Liberation Army member, Anton Lekaj, pleaded not guilty to charges of war crimes as his trial opened Friday before a Belgrade court. Lekaj, 25, is charged with the kidnapping, torture, rape and murder of Kosovo Gypsies in June 1999. (Blic - 21/11/05; Tanjug - 18/11/05)

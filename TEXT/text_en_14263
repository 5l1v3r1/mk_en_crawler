PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Montenegrin Parliament Speaker Ranko Krivokapic announced on Monday (13 February) that he has scheduled a 25 February emergency session of the legislature to discuss the planned independence referendum. The session is being called at the request of the ruling coalition. Later Monday, the opposition criticised the idea, citing the ongoing political negotiations regarding the terms of the referendum. Parliamentary debate was initially planned for 7 February but postponed at the request of EU envoy Miroslav Lajcak. He returns to Podgorica on Wednesday. (Mina, Tanjug - 13/02/06)

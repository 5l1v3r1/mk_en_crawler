PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX deputy head of mission Andy Sparkes said on Thursday (April 28th) there is "some kind of interethnic co-operation" among criminals. "I am against crime, but I am in favour of interethnic co-operation," Sparkes said in northern Mitrovica where he launched an anti-drug campaign. He also responded to criticism earlier this week from Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi, who accused EULEX of inefficiency in the Serb-dominated north. "Because of the political circumstances, every action by EULEX in Kosovo North is being politicised, and our efforts are misinterpreted. The truth is that we are here to help the rule of law," Sparkes said. (Zeri, Koha Ditore, Epoka e Re, Kosova Sot - 29/04/11)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament voted on Monday (November 16th) to remove the five-pointed red star from the country's coat of arms. The move was approved by a vote of 80 to 18. The star has been part of the coat of arms for over 60 years. Officials say removing it signals that Macedonia is breaking all ties with its communist past. (MIA, Makfax, A1, Sitel, BNT - 16/11/09)

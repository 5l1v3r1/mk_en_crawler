BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said on Tuesday (March 6th) that he has given up plans to restructure the cabinet since it is neither a political nor administrative priority. According to Tariceanu, the idea was originally floated by the ruling Democratic Party (PD). However, he said, the PD itself has agreed the country should focus on other issues, such as elections for the European Parliament. He added that some restructuring occurred when the number of state secretaries was cut and it would continue via projects aimed at the ministries' decentralisation.

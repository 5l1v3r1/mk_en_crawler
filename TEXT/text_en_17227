SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The tripartite Presidency's Serb member, Chairman Nebojsa Radmanovic, said on Tuesday (December 26th) that he and his Bosniak and Croat counterparts have not yet agreed on a BiH prime minister-designate. He suggested that Nikola Spiric of the Serb Union of Independent Social Democrats is the current frontrunner. Radmanovic said the presidency is unwilling to tap a candidate until the main parties in parliament agree on forming a stable majority in the BiH House of Representatives. (RTRS, Srna - 26/12/06)

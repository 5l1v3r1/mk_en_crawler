SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) on Thursday (7 October) praised Republika Srpska's (RS) decision to transfer over 600 wartime documents to the UN war crimes tribunal. OHR spokesman in Banja Luka Ljiljana Radetic said the move indicates the political will exists for increased co-operation, but added the OHR is awaiting more concrete steps, such as the arrest and transfer of at least one war crimes indictee. 
Also Thursday, SFOR troops raided a hotel in Vlasenica, RS in an apparent search for war crimes suspects or related documents. Neither SFOR nor the Bosnian Serb police would elaborate. 
In other news, Sarajevo police have sped up preparations for Saturday's World Cup qualifier between BiH and Serbia-Montenegro. Police have now added mobile phones and umbrellas to their list of banned items, following earlier soccer-related violence. (FENA, PBS, AP, AFP - 07/10/04)

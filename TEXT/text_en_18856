ANKARA, Turkey -- The country's main opposition party has contested a constitutional amendment that provides for direct election of the president by the people. The Republican People's filed a petition with the country's Constitutional Court on Tuesday (June 5th) citing procedural violations in the adoption of the changes. The party claims that one of the amendments received less than the required two-thirds of the vote. It also accused the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) of violating the secrecy of the ballot. The court could take several weeks to study the case. The AKP plans to hold a referendum on the constitutional changes together with general elections on July 22nd.
In other news Tuesday, Turkey's chief negotiator with the EU, Ali Babacan, insisted there has been no slow down in negotiations with the Union during Germany's term as president, and said the country hopes to launch negotiations on the energy chapter by year's end. Addressing a conference on energy policy in Istanbul, Babacan also warned that Turkey might be relegated to the status of "a Third World country" unless it applies EU standards of democracy.

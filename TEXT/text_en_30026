ANKARA, Turkey -- Lawmakers approved on Thursday (March 24th) a government decision that allows Turkey to join NATO's operation aimed at enforcing a UN weapons embargo in Libya. Turkey will join the naval mission with four frigates, a submarine and a support ship. Hundreds protested the deployment outside the parliament building and the US Embassy in Ankara, chanting anti-NATO slogans. The protestors also opposed a visit by NATO's top military commander, US Admiral James Stavridis, who met with military officials in Ankara on Thursday. 
On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu reiterated Turkey's stance that operations in Libya should be limited to protecting civilians, enforcing the weapons embargo and no-fly zone, and providing humanitarian aid. NATO agreed late Thursday to take over the task of enforcing a no-fly zone in Libya after days of difficult negotiations among members. (Zaman, Radikal - 25/03/11; Hurriyet - 24/03/11)

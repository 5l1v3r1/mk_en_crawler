TIRANA, Albania -- Representatives of the two main parties in the country, the ruling Socialist Party and the opposition Democratic Party, will meet on Monday (27 September) within the bipartisan electoral commission. This will be the second round of talks between the two parties on the new structure of the commission, which has become deadlocked in its work. The panel was established to draft electoral reforms and prepare for the conduct of free and fair general elections in 2005. (ATA - 26/09/04)

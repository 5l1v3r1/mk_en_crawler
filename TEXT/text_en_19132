BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU on Thursday (November 30th) opened negotiations on visa and re-admission agreements with the Western Balkan countries. In his address to delegations representing Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini said the countries could expect eased visa regimes by the end of next year, as they have demonstrated the political determination to fulfil all visa-related EU recommendations. At the same time, he urged them to make documents more secure and to issue biometric passports. (Pobjeda - 01/12/06; A1 TV, RTRS, Tanjug, DPA - 30/11/06)

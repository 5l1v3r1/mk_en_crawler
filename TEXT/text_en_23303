ANKARA, Turkey -- The terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has suffered heavy losses in the series of air strikes by Turkish jets since December 16th, Turkey's General Staff said on Friday (December 26th). "Turkish armed forces' air strikes on PKK targets in northern Iraq have put serious pressure on the organisation," said General Metin Gurak, head of the General Staff's communication department. "The region [of northern Iraq] is no longer a safe haven for PKK members," he added. Following the air strikes, a growing number of PKK members have fled from the organisation, Gurak said.

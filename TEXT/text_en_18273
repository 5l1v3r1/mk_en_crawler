BUCHAREST, Romania -- During a speech to the Senate on Wednesday (March 14th), Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu urged the country's parliament to quickly pass a draft law that would establish an anti-corruption agency, the National Integrity Agency (ANI). Tariceanu stressed that the measure was one of the commitments undertaken by Romania when it joined the EU in January. The ANI's role would be to monitor politicians' wealth.
In other news Wednesday, the former head of the Interior Ministry's General Anti-Corruption Department (DGA), Marian Santion, publicly accused Minister Vasile Blaga of exerting pressure on him and the DGA. Santion, who resigned last week citing personal reasons, went before the DGA strategic committee and said Blaga and other ministry officials had pressed the DGA to halt several internal corruption probes. Blaga denied the accusation. (Ziua, Nine o'clock - 15/03/07; Romanian government website, Mediafax, Rompres, AFP, Reuters - 14/03/07)

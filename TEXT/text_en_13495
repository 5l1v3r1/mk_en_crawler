TIRANA, Albania -- The justice ministry has asked Turkey to extradite convicted Albanian crime boss Alfred Shkurti, also known as "Aldo Bare", who was arrested in Ankara on Saturday (25 March). Shkurti, described as the leader of one of the most notorious crime gangs in Albania and the Balkans, was arrested with a false Macedonian passport after a police raid in one of Ankara's residential districts. Linked to more than 15 murders and several hijackings, as well as to drug trafficking and grave desecration, Shkurti was sentenced in absentia in 2001 to a total of 32 years in prison.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Ljubo Jurcic has ended his membership in the main opposition Croatian Democratic Union (SDP) and plans to form a new party, local media reported on Thursday (May 26th). He will present his party's programme in June and plans to run in the parliamentary elections at the end of the year. The SDP remains the favourite in that vote, despite a recent upturn in support for its main opponent, the senior ruling Croatian Democratic Union. (Vjesnik, Nacional, Index.hr - 26/05/11)

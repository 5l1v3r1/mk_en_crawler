ZAGREB, Croatia -- Retired football superstar Diego Maradona impressed football fans when he scored several goals in a charity match in Croatia on Thursday (16 June). It was one of only a handful of times he has agreed to return to the pitch since his retirement in 1997. He was joined by former Croatian and international stars Zvonimir Boban and Davor Suker and former Wimbledon champions Goran Ivanisevic and Boris Becker, among others. Proceeds from the match go to an orphanage in Novi Vinodolski. (Reuters, AP - 16/05/05)

REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- A massive cloud of dangerous ash from an Icelandic volcano moved southward Saturday (April 17th), forcing many countries in the Balkans to close their airspace amid fears that the ash could get sucked into the planes' engines, causing them to cut out. Romania, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, most of Croatia and the northern part of Bulgaria closed their airspace to flights. The unprecedented shutdown left thousands of passengers stranded. Although some airports in the region continued to operate, many flights to and from central and Western Europe were cancelled as airports there closed. Forecasts suggest the cloud of ash will persist and impact flight through Monday. (HINA, Tanjug, DPA, AFP, BNT - 17/04/10)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC), which met in Brussels on Monday (November 19th), decided to extend the mandate of the EU Police Mission (EUPM) in BiH by two years, until December 31st, 2009. The GAERC said the EUPM's presence would be necessary until BiH establishes an interethnic state-level police force. The EUPM was first deployed in BiH in 2003, taking over duties from the UN's International Police Task Force. (Nezavisne Novine, Fena, RTRS - 20/11/07)

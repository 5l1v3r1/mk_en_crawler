NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat are "making good progress" on the issue of power sharing, UN Special Envoy for Cyprus Alexander Downer said after the two leaders met on Tuesday (November 11th). Power sharing is one of several key issues on the agenda in ongoing reunification talks, along with security guarantees and property arrangements. "It is unrealistic to expect to solve all these problems overnight after so many years. Nevertheless, there are a number of areas of convergence," Downer noted. Christofias and Talat will meet again on Thursday.
On Tuesday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on the international community to support the process in Cyprus. Both Cypriot leaders are demonstrating very strong political desire to find an acceptable solution, Ban told a news conference at UN headquarters in New York. The process has so far been encouraging, he said. (CNA, Famagusta Gazette, Anadolu news agency, Hurriyet - 11/11/08)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The European Parliament's (EP) Committee for Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs will discuss a report next week assessing whether BiH has met conditions required to scrap visa requirements for its citizens. The panel meets on September 2nd, EP rapporteur on visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans, Tanja Fajon, told the Fena news agency Monday (August 23rd). She noted that one of the last key conditions for visa liberalisation has not been met yet: the appointment of a new head of the Anti-Corruption Agency. Last week, BiH's Council of Ministers met another essential requirement by approving a rule book of the state-level police co-ordination directorate. (Fena, BHRT - 23/08/10)

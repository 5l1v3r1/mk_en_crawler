PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Harri Holkeri says time is running out for the leaders of Kosovo to decide on sending a delegation to the first round of direct talks with Serbia-Montenegro in Vienna on 14 October. But the door remains open, he told reporters Thursday (9 October), after the ethnic Albanian parties in parliament refused to vote on giving local leaders a mandate to participate in the negotiations. Parliament has until the weekend to reconsider.
In Brussels, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana warned there would be "very serious consequences" for Kosovo's relations with the EU if the ethnic Albanian majority does not send a delegation to Vienna. (AFP, B92, Serbian Radio, BBC - 09/10/03)

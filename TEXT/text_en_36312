BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia should apprehend and hand over war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic, the new US ambassador to Belgrade, Michael Polt, said Tuesday (25 May). He insisted that the international community would continue to demand that Mladic be brought to justice. Polt added that the country owes this arrest to its citizens, whom he says are being held hostage by the issue.
In other news Tuesday, it was announced that Serbia's special prosecutor has charged 11 former servicemen with war crimes in connection with the 1991 Vukovar massacre. Their case will likely be linked to the trial of six others who face the same charges. Prosecutors credit help from both The Hague and the Croatian government. (B92, Tanjug, Reuters - 25/05/04)

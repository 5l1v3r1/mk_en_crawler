SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- An IMF mission is expected to arrive in BiH in early June to discuss measures related to the implementation of the country's mid-term development strategy. The BiH government recently completed the document, drafted with the help of the international community. It lays out BiH's economic and social priorities through 2007. World Bank Executive Director Ad Melkert says the Bank will initiate a donor conference in September to raise funds earmarked for the strategy.
In other news, the international community's Principal Deputy High Representative to BiH, Donald Hays, warned Sunday (23 May) that poor veterinary control in BiH poses a health risk, as evidenced by recent outbreaks of Q-Fever and brucellosis. Hays called for urgent efforts to harmonise the veterinary system with EU standards and to improve control measures. (Nezavisne novine - 24/05/04; Fena, PBS BiH - 23/05/04; PBS BiH - 22/05/04)

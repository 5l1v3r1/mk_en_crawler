NEW YORK, United States -- French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner urged the EU to adopt a unified stance if it is going to recognise Kosovo's independence. "It is time for the EU to take a decision," Kouchner said in New York on Tuesday (February 12th). He suggested this could happen on February 18th when the EU foreign ministers meet to discuss the province's status. 
The same day, European Affairs Secretary Jean-Pierre Jouyet said the EU should give Serbia very clear accession prospects to alleviate tension regarding Kosovo. Serbia's EU integration is the only way to guarantee regional stability, he said.

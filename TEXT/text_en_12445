BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic said Monday (10 January) that constructive dialogue is the best approach to resolving tensions in southern Serbia. His comment followed a meeting with representatives of the ethnic Albanian community in Presevo. The meeting was called after Serbian border guards shot and killed a teenager who was trying to illegally cross the border into Macedonia at the weekend. Separately, Serbia-Montenegro's Human and Minority Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic and the Serbian government's Co-ordinator for Southern Serbia Nebojsa Covic visited Bujanovac on Monday to call for dialogue. The major Albanian parties in the Presevo municipal assembly have renewed calls for demilitarising the region in the wake of the shooting. (Danas - 11/01/05; Tanjug, B92, Beta - 10/01/05)

ANKARA, Turkey -- The foreign ministry urged members of a US congressional committee Monday (March 1st) not to recognise the killing of Armenians in the Ottoman empire during World War I as "genocide". In a statement, the ministry said that the so-called "Armenian genocide" resolution will harm relations between Ankara and Washington and would hamper the process of normalising relations between Turkey and Armenia. The House Foreign Affairs Committee is due to discuss and vote on the resolution Thursday. (Reuters, Press TV, UPI, Xinhua, AP - 01/03/10)

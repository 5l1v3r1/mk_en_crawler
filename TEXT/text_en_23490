PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The young country has made progress in terms of respecting minority rights, according to the US-based Project on Ethnic Relations (PER) organisation. At a discussion of "Minority Communities' Integration" in Pristina Wednesday (June 24th), PER President Livia Plaks said that since the new constitution was implemented and new laws were passed, she has noticed significant progress in terms of minority rights. Plaks also praised the decentralisation process and the transfer of competencies from the central to the local level.
International Civilian Representative Pieter Feith told discussion participants that Kosovo's main challenge in regards to minorities remains the integration of the Serb minority. Feith added that the creation of new municipalities with Serb majorities and the November 15th local elections represent a good opportunity for Serbs to assume responsibility for protecting community rights.

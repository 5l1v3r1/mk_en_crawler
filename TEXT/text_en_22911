BUCHAREST, Romania -- Party of Social Democracy (PSD) leader Adrian Nastase said on Saturday (May 3rd) that he is ready to run for president in the 2009 presidential elections unless his party finds a better candidate. "I will accept to run against Traian Basescu. He must not get a second mandate. He has done enough harm as it is," Nastase said. 
Nastase served as prime minister between 2000 and 2004. (Gandul, Ziua Iasi - 05/05/08; Mediafax - 03/05/08)

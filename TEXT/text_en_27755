TIRANA, Albania -- Without debate and with only the votes of the ruling Democratic Party majority, parliament on Thursday (September 23rd) approved the appointment of Bashkim Dedja as the new chairman of the country's Constitutional Court. President Bamir Topi nominated him for the post Tuesday. Dedja became a member of the court only four months ago, due to a vacancy. (Sot, Shqip - 24/09/10; Shekulli, Balkanweb, MIA - 23/09/10)

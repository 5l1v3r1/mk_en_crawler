BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic said on Wednesday (December 23rd) that the Vojvodina Hungarians' Union's (SVM) decision to oppose the 2010 budget does not automatically mean early elections. During a visit to Novi Sad, he admitted that the SVM's move was a betrayal to the ruling coalition, but insisted that the government still enjoys a stable majority in parliament. Tadic stressed that early elections are the last thing Serbia needs right now as they would further delay economic reforms, EU integration and the fight against crime. The SVM, part of the ruling coalition, withdrew its support for the budget, insisting there was not enough money in it for capital investments in Vojvodina. The budget squeaked through Monday, with the support of two independent lawmakers and one ethnic Albanian member of parliament proving pivotal.
Separately Wednesday, Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic told the RTS that he was surprised by the SVM's decision to oppose the budget, adding that serious talks are required. Parliament Speaker Slavica Djukic-Dejanovic echoed Tadic's view saying the ruling coalition is stable and there is no reason to call early elections. (B92, Beta, Tanjug, RTS - 23/12/09)

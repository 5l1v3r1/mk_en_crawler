ANKARA, Turkey -- Six security guards were killed and at least 12 persons injured when an explosion caused two train cars to overturn in the Turkish Bingol province on Saturday (2 July), authorities said. A second train that was sent to help the victims came under small arms fire, they added. The attack has been blamed on terrorists from the banned Kurdistan Workers Party. Soldiers later defused another bomb on the same track. 
In a separate incident, three Turkish police officers were injured by an explosion in Diyarbakir on Friday. They went to inspect a suspicious package which apparently contained a remotely controlled bomb. (VoA - 03/07/05; AFP, Reuters - 02/07/05; TurkishPress.com)

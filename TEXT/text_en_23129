SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Police conducted simultaneous raids Tuesday (April 1st) on the homes of two men who served as bodyguards to wartime Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic. Zeljko Maljukan and Dusko Mihajlovic live in Pale, a Bosnian Serb wartime stronghold, east of Sarajevo. They are believed to be part of the network that supports the war crimes indictee. A week ago, BiH police and EUFOR searched the homes of Karadzic's wife and children.
In other news Tuesday, Montenegrin police raided the home of Karadzic's brother, Luka, in the central Montenegrin town of Niksic. They also briefly detained Karadzic's nephew, Dragan and some of his friends in the house. The family's lawyer said police explained they were looking for drugs, but the family believes they were looking for the fugitive.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Appeals Chamber at the BiH court on Tuesday (May 5th) ruled that Mirko Pekez and Milorad Savic should spend 14 and 21 years in prison, respectively, for war crimes against Bosniak civilians in 1992. It found them guilty of killing 23 Bosniaks -- most of them women, children and elderly people -- from the villages of Ljoljica and Cerkazovica in the Jajce municipality. Pekez and Savic received initial sentences of 29 and 21 years in prison last April. (Blic, Beta, Dnevni Avaz - 05/05/09)

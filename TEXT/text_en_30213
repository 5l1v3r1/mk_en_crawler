ATHENS, Greece -- About 500 immigrants and other demonstrators gathered in front of City Hall in Athens on Monday (May 16th) to protest racist attacks against immigrants over the past days. Last week, about 25 people were admitted to hospital after a nationalist protest in which a group of youth attacked immigrants in the streets. The violence broke out after a deadly attack against a man in downtown Athens, which witnesses blamed on a group of immigrants. (Imerisia, SKAI, ERT - 16/05/11)

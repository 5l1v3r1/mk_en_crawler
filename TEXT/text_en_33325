KARDJALI, Bulgaria -- Development and Public Works Minister Valentin Tserovski says Makaza Pass, a new Bulgarian-Greek border checkpoint, will open in 2007 when Bulgaria joins the EU. He spoke Friday (6 June), during a ceremony marking the start of construction on the Podkova-Makaza road, linking the southern village of Podkova to the border crossing. The construction project, part of the Bulgarian-Greek Cross-Border Co-operation Programme, should be completed in 2005. The EU's PHARE programme has provided 14.6m euros for the project; the Bulgarian government has allocated another 3.9m euros. (Dnevnik, BTA - 06/06/03)

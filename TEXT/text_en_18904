PARIS, France -- Bulgaria and Romania will seek to ease tensions with Russia over plans for a US military presence in the two Balkan states, regional news agencies quoted Romanian Defence Minister Teodor Melescanu as saying Monday (June 4th).The minister, who was in Paris to participate in the 53rd Assembly of the Western European Union, said the two Balkan neighbours have decided to follow a common approach in ties with Moscow, citing an offer for joint military drills as a possible way to reduce tension.
The countries will initiate a dialogue with Moscow in order to explain that the US presence will not jeopardise Russia's security, but rather will increase stability and security in Southeast Europe, Melescanu was quoted as saying. He also expressed regret over a weekend statement by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who warned that Moscow might target European cities with nuclear missiles, if the US installs a missile defence shield over Eastern Europe. Some have interpreted Putin's statement as an indirect reference to US bases in the two former Soviet satellites, now members of NATO and the EU.

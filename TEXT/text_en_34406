ZAGREB, Croatia -- The OSCE mission to Zagreb said Sunday (19 October) that it will deploy significantly fewer monitors for next month's general elections than in previous years. For the first time, OSCE observers will not fan out to polling stations across the country, rather, they will monitor the vote from OSCE offices in Zagreb and other towns. Spokesman Alessandro Fracassetti says the decision reflects "a certain faith in the voting process and election monitoring by domestic organisations". Croatian President Stipe Mesic is expected to sign an order Monday setting the date for parliamentary elections. The ruling coalition has decided on 23 November. (HINA, BBC - 19/10/03)

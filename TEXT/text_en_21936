PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The Montenegrin prosecution has indicted six former Yugoslav National Army (JNA) reservists for war crimes committed at the Morinj camp in 1991-1992, media reported on Friday (August 15th). The six allegedly ordered and committed torture and inhumane acts against 169 Croatian prisoners of war and civilians at the camp between October 1991 and August 1992. The prosecution called for the detention of suspects Mladen Govedarica, Zlatko Tarle, Spiro Lucic, Ivo Menzalin, Boro Gligic and Ivo Gojnic "due to the seriousness of the criminal acts and the severe consequences of this war crime". Montenegrin and Croatian courts cooperated in the investigation, interviewing over 170 witnesses. (B92, Beta, Hina, RTCG - 15/08/08)

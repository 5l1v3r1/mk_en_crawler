MOSCOW, Russia -- The Russian Prosecutor's Office confirmed the detention of Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect Dragan Zelenovic on Tuesday (30 August), and said he is awaiting extradition. According to the announcement, cited by Russian media, Zelenovic was detained in the western Siberian region of Khanty-Mansiask on 25 August, on an international arrest warrant from The Hague tribunal. Officials have not said whether Zelenovic would be transferred to The Hague -- where he faces charges of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws on customs of war in Foca in 1992-1993 -- or elsewhere. The confirmation of the Bosnian Serb paramilitary commander's arrest followed a week of speculation. (Nezavisne novine - 31/08/05; Fena, Tanjug, Itar-Tass - 30/08/05)

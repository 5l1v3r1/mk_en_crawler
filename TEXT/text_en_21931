BUCHAREST, Romania -- Members of the healthcare workers' trade union, the Sanitas Federation, say they will protest in Bucharest on November 4th and launch a general strike on November 20th unless they receive a 50% wage hike. They made their announcement on Tuesday (October 21st) after Health Minister Eugen Nicolaescu missed a scheduled meeting with the federation's representatives to discuss demands. Sanitas President Marius Petcu said neither Nicolaescu nor any state secretary attended the meeting, although the minister himself initiated it. (Mediafax, Ziare, Realitatea TV - 21/10/08)

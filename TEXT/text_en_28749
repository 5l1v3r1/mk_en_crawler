SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Court of BiH has decided to release former Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Gojko Klickovic on bail, his lawyer announced on Saturday (April 10th). Klickovic is accused of war crimes committed in Bosanska Krupa during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. His attorney explained that the court has accepted a relative's house as collateral in exchange for Klickovic's release until trial. In 2006, Klickovic was arrested in Belgrade based on a warrant issued by Interpol. He was handed over to BiH in 2007. (BHRT, Dnevnik.ba, Dnevni Avaz, Onasa - 11/04/10; Vecernje Novosti - 10/04/10)

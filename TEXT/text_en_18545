OSLO, Norway -- Police have arrested a Bosnian Muslim suspected of committing war crimes during the 1992-1995 conflict. Officials refused to identify him, but say he would be charged with assault, rape and illegal detention at a prison camp for Serbs. The suspect, who served in a Croat militia unit, could face up to 21 years in prison if convicted. He arrived in Norway with his family in 1993 and became a Norwegian citizen in 2001. 
 In other news, UN appeals judges at The Hague on Wednesday reversed the conviction of a Bosnian Serb army general Vidoje Blagojevic. The judges ruled he should have been acquitted of the genocide charge because his original trial found he had not known of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre and only provided logistical support. Originally found guilty in 2005 on charges of war crimes and complicity in genocide, his sentence was reduced from 18 to 15 years for his role in the massacre.(The New York Times, BBC, Beta, Tanjug, Nezavisne Novine - 09/05/07; UPI, Fena, RTRS, PBS, AP, UPI, DPA - 08/05/07)

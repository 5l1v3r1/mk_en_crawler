ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on Tuesday (November 2nd) that his government wants general elections held in the second week of June 2011. He noted the decision not to hold the elections in July or August was made to stimulate voter turnout. Traditionally, elections in the country are held on Sundays, making June 12th the most likely date. The final say rests with the High Electoral Board. (AP, Anadolu news agency, Hurriyet - 02/11/10)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Interior Minister Marijan Mlinaric reportedly will be replaced in two weeks, according to government sources cited by the local media Wednesday (29 June). The same sources suggest that the most likely successor would be current counterintelligence chief Tomislav Karamarko, who would also become deputy prime minister in charge of national security. Mlinaric has struggled with health problems, but the media says the shuffle may have more to do with the failure to locate war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina.

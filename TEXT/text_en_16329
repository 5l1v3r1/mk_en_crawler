BELGRADE, Serbia -- Deputy Chief Prosecutor Milorad Cvijovic has rejected a request by junior government partner G17 Plus to ban the Serb Radical Party (SRS), deciding there is no legal basis for the move, G17 Plus announced on Thursday (10 August). In its statement, G17 Plus vowed to continue fighting against radicalism in Serbia. The party claims public statements by SRS officials spread religious and ethnic intolerance, which is prohibited by the constitution. (Politika - 11/08/06; RTS - 10/08/06)

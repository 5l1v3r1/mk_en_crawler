ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis and his Albanian counterpart Fatos Nano agreed Wednesday (5 May) on the establishment of a joint commission on the Cam issue. The Cams are ethnic Albanians living in Greece who were accused of collaborating with the Nazis during World War II and were expatriated from the country, their property confiscated. Their heirs are now demanding compensation from Greece. (Shekulli, Zeri I Popullit - 06/05/04; ATA - 05/05/04)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) --Republika Srpska (RS) police detained former Economy Minister Milan Bogicevic on Wednesday (May 27th) in Zvornik. He will appear before a special prosecutor for questioning about a contract between the Bosanski Brod Oil Refinery and the British company Vitol. Police also arrested former refinery director Ilija Drpa, who concluded the unprofitable deal back in 2003 without government approval. In 2004, then-High Representative Paddy Ashdown removed Bogicevic from his post as RS's minister of economy, energy and development and from other public and party positions he held. Ashdown said he obstructed implementation of the peace process. (Fena, Srna, BHRT, Pincom, Nezavisne Novine, BTA - 27/05/09)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Leaders of Turkey's main opposition party, the People's Republican Party (CHP), visited Brussels on Tuesday (September 23rd) where they vowed to support Ankara's efforts to join the EU, despite serious disagreements over the secular system and freedom of expression. The CHP leaders rejected accusations by the ruling Justice and Development Party that its members refuse to co-operate in efforts to bring the country closer to the EU. "Since the beginning of this government in 2002, we have supported practically all initiatives of this government, the reform packages, constitutional amendments, and legal amendments in the direction of EU membership," Onur Oymen, deputy CHP leader, told a press conference. He acknowledged, however, that his party is worried by some important omissions in the national programme. (Turkish Daily News - 24/09/08; Reuters - 23/09/08)

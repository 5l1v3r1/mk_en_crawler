SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Kosovo's declaration of independence will be a "precedent" for Serbs and Croats in BiH, warned the Serb member of the Bosnian presidency, Nebojsa Radmanovic, on Saturday (February 16th). The same day, Socialist Party of Serbia leader Ivica Dacic said that if Kosovo declares independence without UN Security Council approval, Serbia will call on the Republika Srpska (RS) parliament to declare independence as well. 
On Friday, the Bosniak member of the presidency, Haris Silajdzic, said the whole region is "in a period of instability". He suggested that if the EU recognises Kosovo's independence, mass protests are expected to be organised in RS with demands for independence of the Serbian community in Bosnia. According to Silajdzic, former Muslim and Croat refugees who have returned to their homes in RS will be "the most threatened part of the population" if tension and violence escalates. Earlier on Friday, the police in BiH announced that security forces are ready to prevent any incidents. (Dnevni Avaz, Fena, BHRT, AFP, Tanjug - 16/02/08; AFP, Dnevni Avaz - 15/02/08)

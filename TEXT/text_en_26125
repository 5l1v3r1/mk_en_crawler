BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic confirmed on Sunday (August 16th) that a draft document on co-operation between Serbian police and EULEX has been completed. He stressed that it is in Serbia's best interest to guarantee peace in Kosovo and to stop organised crime, terrorism, drugs and arms smuggling. Pristina-based daily Koha Ditore reported on Saturday that the protocol contains provisions on police co-operation and exchanges of information related to the fight against organised and cross-border crime, as well as other illegal activities. While EULEX officials have not ruled out signing the agreement, the Kosovo government has said the EU mission has no mandate to sign international agreements and that it has not been informed of any possible deal with Serbia.

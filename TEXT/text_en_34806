BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro's Supreme Defence Council announced Thursday (7 August) that it has decided to remove 16 senior army officers, most of them holding the rank of general. The move was seen by local media as an attempt to break away from the army's past. Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic said it was necessary to put a team of young reformers in charge of the military. He went on to add that the move would not damage the country's national security.
In other news, US Secretary of State Colin Powell welcomed Serbia's offer to send troops to Iraq. "I think it shows a responsible attitude on the part of the Serbian leadership that they want to be involved in stabilisation and peacekeeping operations in the world," he said. Powell cautioned, however, that no decision has been made and that the United States has yet to study its needs. (Reuters, AFP - 07/08/03)

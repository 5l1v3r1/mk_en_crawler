NEW YORK, United States -- Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte told the UN Security Council on Thursday (9 October) that she is not entirely satisfied with the co-operation she is receiving from Serbia-Montenegro, Republika Srpska and Croatia. She said authorities in Serbia and the Serb entity in Bosnia and Herzegovina have failed to arrest top war crimes suspects Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic and have withheld important information relevant to Slobodan Milosevic's trial. Referring to Croatia, del Ponte noted that most of her requests for material from the country's archives had been handled properly. She criticised the government however for failing to hand over retired General Ante Gotovina, wanted for the murder of 150 Serbs during the 1991-1995 war. (AFP - 09/10/03)

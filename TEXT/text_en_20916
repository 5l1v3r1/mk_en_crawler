BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) vowed on Wednesday (March 5th) to boost development in the Western Balkans via visa relief and more investment, in an effort to guarantee stability. It is in everyone's interest to continue reforms, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said, as the EC's interim progress report on countries in the region was presented. According to the document, the EU intends to lift its visa regime with Serbia, Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, to boost regional co-operation projects, and to strengthen relations in the fields of science, culture and ecology. Brussels intends to allocate almost 800m euros for these purposes if countries in the region demonstrate progress in the Euro-integration process.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament on Tuesday (20 April) approved a report by Ombudsman Ante Klaric for 2003. According to the report, the number of citizens' claims last year increased by 50 per cent, a figure which Klaric says could be partly explained by the higher number of visits which ombudsman representatives made to different counties and districts. He also identified, as a key institutional problem, the failure to adequately address requests for the reconstruction of houses of displaced people in war-ravaged areas. Klaric called on the government to live up to its earlier promises by lifting a deadline for submitting requests and by resolving issues concerning ownership of flats in the region.

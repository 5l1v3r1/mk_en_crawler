BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian Interior Minister Vasile Blaga disclosed details Friday (11 November) on the amended contract with Germany's EADS for upgrading and modernising the country's borders. According to Blaga, the value of the EADS contract was modified from the initial 650m euros to 524.5m euros. The decrease resulted from the elimination of overlapping EU-financed programmes. At the same time, new infrastructure projects have been added, including construction of a headquarters building for border police. Romania will become the EU's longest borderline after it joins the bloc, and the European Commission has repeatedly called for boosting border security. (Rompres - 11/11/05)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Finance Minister Zoran Stavreski says the salaries of some government officials, including Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, will be cut to lower the deficit and avoid Europe's debt crisis. According to an announcement late Thursday (June 10th), Gruevski's salary and the wages of ministers and deputy ministers will be reduced by 10% this year or next. Furthermore, plans to build 100 sports venues and buildings across the country have been put on ice, the money being redirected to health care and pensions. According to Stavreski, the cuts amount to 3.2% of the 2010 budget. Macedonia's public debt stands at 2.5% of its GDP. (Sitel, AP, MIA - 11/06/10)

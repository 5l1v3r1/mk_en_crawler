PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX has decided to stop Serbian officials from making unannounced visits to Kosovo ahead of the May 30th local elections in the Serb-dominated north. The EU Rule of Law Mission has instructed Kosovo police to stop escorts of Serbian officials and verify whether the visits are authorised. EULEX spokesperson Karin Limdal said on Tuesday (May 25th) that Belgrade has also been informed of the change. On Tuesday, Kosovo Police Director Behar Selimi accused EULEX of allowing Serbian officials to campaign in northern Mitrovica, saying he twice contacted EULEX but received no response. One high profile visitor was former Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, who campaigned in northern Kosovo on Sunday. (Zeri, Kosova Sot, Epoka e Re, Koha Ditore - 26/05/10)

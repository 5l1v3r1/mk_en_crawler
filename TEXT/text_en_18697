CHISINAU, Moldova -- The government appealed to the EU and the international community on Wednesday (March 7th) to use their influence to stop what Chisinau sees as an unfair campaign by neighbouring Romania to offer citizenship to Moldovans of Romanian descent. Moldovan authorities say they consider this a threat to national security. Bucharest recently announced that some 800,000 Moldovans -- around 20% of the population -- had applied for citizenship in the new EU member state.
In other news, former Romanian Culture Minister Mona Musca announced her resignation from Parliament on Wednesday. A Bucharest court on Tuesday upheld an earlier finding by the council studying the Securitate archives, which determined she collaborated with the former security service.

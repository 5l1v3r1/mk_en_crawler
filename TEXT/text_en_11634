ATHENS, Greece -- The country will lower its budget deficit to within the Eurozone limit by the end of 2006, despite serious problems with public finances, Economy and Finance Minister Giorgos Alogoskoufis said Wednesday (19 January) upon returning from a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels. He acknowledged, however, that despite ambitious measures to reduce spending, the public deficit would probably again exceed the Eurozone limit of 3 per cent this year. (Kathimerini - 20/01/05)

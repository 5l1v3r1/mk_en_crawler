SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The President of the State Election Commission (DIK), Aleksandar Novakovski, resigned on Wednesday (February 23rd) saying he is protecting his credibility and the commission's. Novakovski was elected at the post in December 2008 following a proposal by the opposition SDSM. Sitel TV says he has resigned under pressure from the opposition, prompting the ruling VMRO-DPMNE to say that the SDSM is afraid of snap elections and is trying to undermine institutions.
Separately Wednesday, the SDSM said its members will not return to parliament until their demands are met, including the unfreezing of A1 TV assets. Reacting to Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski's call for early elections, the opposition party said that Gruevski has demonstrated he is unwilling to meet preconditions for resuming political dialogue.

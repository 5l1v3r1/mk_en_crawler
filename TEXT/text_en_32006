SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- An SFOR spokesman announced Saturday (19 October) that investigators have found evidence of unreported arms exports by Orao, a Bosnian Serb company. Yves Vanier refused to go into details, but said more information will be made available soon. In September, the US government warned Bosnian authorities that there were reports of secret shipments of military equipment from Republika Srpska (RS) to Iraq. Information from US intelligence services suggested a local factory was supplying spare parts for military aircraft, and that technical staff from Bosnia and Herzegovina may have traveled to Iraq to help with installation. The RS government denied the allegations, and said its own inquiry had turned up no evidence of wrongdoing. SFOR came up with the latest information during what it described as a regular and periodic inspection of Orao, as part of the effort to ensure compliance with the Dayton peace accords.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Police seized more than 240kg of heroin Monday (November 19th) at the Kapikule crossing point on the border between Turkey and Bulgaria. The drugs, apparently destined for Germany, were hidden in a truck carrying chemical products. The driver and three others were arrested. Turkey is a key drug trafficking route from Asia to Europe. In February, 565kg of heroin, the most ever seized by Turkish border officials, was confiscated at Kapikule. 
In other news Monday, the Kurdish regional government in northern Iraq banned journalists from visiting terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party bases in the region. Local authorities accused the media of "provoking and accelerating the crisis with Turkey". (Zaman - 20/11/07; Anadolu news agency, AFP, Sabah, Hurriyet, Reuters, Press TV, Guardian, NTV - 19/11/07)

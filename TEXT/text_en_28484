BELGRADE, Serbia -- Lawmakers adopted a declaration Thursday (October 14th) condemning crimes committed against Serbs during the conflicts of the 1990s. The document was approved by 133 of the representatives in the 250-seat parliament. Lawmakers from the Serbian Radical Party, Democratic Party of Serbia, New Serbia and Serbian Progressive Party did not vote. The resolution condemns crimes against Serbs during the armed conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Kosovo and calls on the parliaments of other countries, especially former Yugoslav republics, to condemn crimes and express respect for Serb victims. The resolution also voices "regret and solidarity" with victims of the 1999 NATO air strikes against Serbia. (Tanjug, Beta, FoNet, Blic - 14/10/10)

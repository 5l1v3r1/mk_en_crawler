BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Argentina extradited a Bosnian Serb man, who is among the UN war crimes tribunal's most wanted suspects, to The Hague on Monday (20 February). Milan Lukic was arrested in August after spending more than five years on the run. He is charged with forming a paramilitary group in 1992 and committing atrocities against Muslims in the Visegrad area. A separate court has sentenced him to 20 years in prison for the murder of 16 Muslim civilians who were abducted from a bus in 1992. (Nezavisne novine - 21/02/06; AP, BBC, RFE - 20/02/06)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The state prosecution office is investigating 133 cases of election violations which will likely be completed by the end of the month. Chief Prosecutor Ismet Kabashi said on Tuesday (January 18th) that these cases are a priority. A large number of irregularities reported on December 12th's Election Day prompted the Central Election Commission to re-count most of the ballots amid concerns about violations at the counting centres. Soon after, the commission decided to repeat elections in five municipalities. The last is in Mitrovica on Sunday. (RFE, Telegrafi, Kohavision, Klan Kosova - 18/01/11)

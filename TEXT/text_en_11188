BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The EU security chief Javier Solana again called for dialogue between Belgrade and Kosovo, as well as for Kosovo Serbs' participation in provincial institutions. In a statement quoted by local media Saturday (29 January), Solana said dialogue and co-operation were necessary in order for progress to occur in key areas such as decentralisation and refugee return. 
In related news, US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Friday that Washington's stance on Kosovo coincides with that of the international community. Specifically, implementation of internationally set standards must take place before discussions on Kosovo's final status can start, Boucher said, adding that it is too early for such talks. 
Meanwhile, the head of the Serbian Centre for Kosovo, Nebojsa Covic, has said Belgrade would like to resume talks on practical issues with the Kosovo government. He suggested resuming the working group meetings on missing persons and energy. (AFP, Beta, Tanjug - 29/01/05; B92, Beta - 28/01/05)

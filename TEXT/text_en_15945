SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Central Election Commission (CEC) released further results Wednesday (October 18th) from the October 1st general elections, which -- if not contested by candidates -- would be considered as final. The CEC confirmed that the tripartite presidency would consist of Haris Silajdzic from the Party for BiH (SBiH) as the Bosniak member, Zeljko Komsic from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) as the Croat one, and Nebojsa Radmanovic from the Union of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) as the Serb one. The Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA), SBiH, SDP and SNSD dominate the BiH Parliament House of Representatives. SDA and SBiH also control more than half the seats in the Federation of BiH House of Representatives, while the SNSD is one seat short of an absolute majority in the Republika Srpska Assembly.

ATHENS, Greece -- Greek conservative Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis presented his new government's programme to parliament on Friday (September 28th), and vowed to speed up reforms. Priority areas include improving public finances, overhauling the higher education system, implementing pension reforms and creating a land registry. He stressed the need to boost environmental protection, in the wake of fires that ravaged the country last month. Parliament is now debating the programme and will hold a vote of confidence Sunday night. (AFP, AP, ANA-MPA, ERT, Kathimerini, MIA - 29/09/07)

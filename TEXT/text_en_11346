SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The plan to transition authority from the Office of the High Representative to BiH institutions will be announced on Tuesday (31 May), High Representative Paddy Ashdown said in an interview with BHT1 on Thursday. Ashdown said the matter would be a priority for the duration of his mandate. As a result of the transitioning, local institutions will have greater political responsibilities. 
Also Thursday, the head of the EC delegation to BiH, Michael Humphreys, reiterated that the EU will not back down from its principles regarding police reform in BiH. Humphreys noted that establishing an efficient, transparent and professional police force is a requirement for EU membership. A reluctant RS Parliament has scheduled an extraordinary session to discuss the subject Monday. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 27/05/05; NTV Hayat, RTRS, PBS BiH - 26/05/05)

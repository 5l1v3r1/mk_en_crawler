BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Croatian Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul said Tuesday (12 October) he is confident the country would get an exact date for the launch of EU accession talks when the European Council meets in December. Zuzul and European Integration Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic are in Brussels for talks with EU commissioners. Zuzul dismissed fears that a report by Hague tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte would impede Croatia's accession process. Del Ponte maintains the country is not doing enough to co-operate with the tribunal. (Vjesnik, Vecernji List - 13/10/04; HINA, HRT - 12/10/04)

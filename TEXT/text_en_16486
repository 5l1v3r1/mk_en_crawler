ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament endorsed in its first reading Wednesday (October 11th) constitutional changes that would lower the minimum age of deputies from 30 to 25 years. The parliamentary process will likely be completed this week, and the draft will then be submitted to President Ahmet Necdet Sezer. Supporters say the initiative would encourage the election of more young people. (Hurriyet, Zaman, Anadolu Agency - 11/10/06)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Burak Ozugergin on Wednesday (March 24th) said his country still rejects international sanctions against Iran's nuclear programme. "There is still an opportunity ahead of us and we believe that this opportunity should be used effectively. Not less, but more diplomacy [is needed]," Ozugergin said. Last week, US Assistant Secretary of State Philip Gordon said that Turkey, a NATO member, should support the sanctions, or face possible consequences.

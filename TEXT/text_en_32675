SKOPJE, Macedonia -- On Saturday (21 December) in Skopje, Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski and his Albanian counterpart, Pandeli Majko, signed a Memorandum of Understanding on bilateral military co-operation. They also discussed a plan to hold regular meetings between experts, armed forces commanders, and the chiefs of staff of the two countries. Prospects for NATO membership were also on the agenda.
On Friday, meanwhile, Albania and Greece opened a third border crossing - one that had been closed since the beginning of World War II. Its re-opening is more symbolic than practical, as it is not expected to reduce huge lines that form at the border. (ATA, MIA, Kathimerini, BBC - 21/12/02)

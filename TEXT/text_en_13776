ATHENS, Greece -- Police on Monday (19 December) freed 96 Asians who had been held hostage by human smugglers. The would-be-immigrants were taken from Turkey to a warehouse in the town of Kapandriti, 60km north of Athens, where they were locked up. The smugglers then sought ransoms of between 4,000 and 6,000 euros for the release of each of them. Five suspects were arrested. (AFP - 19/12/05)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Hungarian President Laszlo Solyom said on Friday (March 13th) Romanian aviation authorities cancelled his airplane's landing permit ahead of his scheduled visit to Romania. Solyom planned to visit the western region of Transylvania, where over 1 million ethnic Hungarians live, on Sunday (March 15th), the national day of Hungary. But the Romanian cancellation forced him to change his itinerary: travelling to Transylvania on Saturday by car, where he met representatives of the ethnic Hungarian community, and then returning to Hungary the same day. Hungarian Foreign Minister Kinga Goncz called Bucharest's decision "an unfriendly move" and said the foreign ministry had yet to receive a satisfactory explanation. Romania's foreign ministry had previously expressed concern over Solyom's visit to Transylvania.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The new parliament elected VMRO-DPMNE deputy Ljubisa Georgievski as speaker on Tuesday (1 August). Members of the opposition ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) left the hall prior to the vote, angry that VMRO-DPMNE had not invited the party to be part of the new government. Georgievski is a prominent theatre and film director and a former Macedonian ambassador to Bulgaria.
In other news, Prime Minister designate Nikola Gruevski, leader of the VMRO-DPMNE, met on Monday with Vesna Janevska, deputy chairwoman of the minor rightist party VMRO-NP. According to media reports, they discussed VMRO-NP's support for a minority government led by Gruevski. Coalition agreements with other parties already have secured a majority of 65 votes in the 120-member legislature. (Vecer - 01/08/06; MRT, A1 TV, Makfax, Telma TV - 31/07/06)

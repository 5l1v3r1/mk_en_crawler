BUCHAREST, Romania -- The ruling Social Democrat Party (PSD) will not announce its candidate for mayor of Bucharest until late December or early January, says Dan Ioan Popescu, the leader of the local Bucharest PSD branch. He said Monday (14 July) that the candidate would likely be "a former cabinet member, still involved in the administration, and under 45". The incumbent mayor, Traian Basescu, who is also leader of the opposition Democratic Party, is expected to seek a second term. (Rompres, Nine o'Clock - 15/07/03)

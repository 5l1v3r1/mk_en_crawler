VIENNA, Austria -- UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari was back in Vienna on Friday (January 26th) to brief the members of the International Contact Group on his plan for the future of Kosovo. Quoting unnamed diplomatic sources, international media are reporting that the blueprint provides for limited sovereignty for the province, as well as significant autonomy for its Serb minority. The government in Pristina would be able to seek admission in international organisations and run Kosovo under the supervision of an EU official. 
The plan would reportedly allow members of the Serb minority to hold dual Kosovo and Serbian citizenships and to receive financing from Belgrade, if it is channelled through the government in Pristina. Serbs would enjoy far reaching autonomy in their areas and have significant control over local police. An international police force would treat the protection of the Serb minority and its cultural and religious monuments as a special priority.
After briefing the group, Ahtisaari will present his plan to officials in Belgrade and Pristina on February 2nd. The UN Security Council is expected to vote on it before the middle of the year. (Focus - 26/01/07; Financial Times, Reuters, AP, AFP, KosovaLive, Tanjug - 25/01/07)

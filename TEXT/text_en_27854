ANKARA, Turkey -- Hundreds of people rallied outside a prison in the outskirts of Istanbul on Monday (August 23rd) demanding the release of pro-secular politicians accused of involvement in a plot to topple the pro-Islamic government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The demonstrators, mostly members of the leftist Workers' Party, gathered at the prison where hundreds of secularists, including their party's leader Dogu Perincek, are detained. They also criticised a referendum on constitutional amendments scheduled for September 12th. The government says the reforms aim to harmonise the constitution with EU legislation, but opponents argue that its actual goal is to boost the ruling Justice and Development Party's control over the judiciary and undermine Turkey's secular principles.

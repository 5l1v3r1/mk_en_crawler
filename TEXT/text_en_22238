WASHINGTON, United States -- Outgoing Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic admitted on Sunday (April 13th) that it would be difficult to prevent Kosovo from joining the IMF, given the distribution of votes among countries that have already recognised its independence. Djelic, who is participating in the spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington, reiterated that Serbia will never recognise Kosovo's independence and will do everything in its power to prevent its membership in international organisations.

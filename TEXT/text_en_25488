ATHENS, Greece -- Greek farmers eased protests on Saturday (January 23rd) as the blockades of some 20 roads across the country were lifted but another 14 remained, including the one at the Kulata-Promahon border with Bulgaria. On Friday, Prime Minister George Papandreou urged an end to the action. The protesters are demanding secure subsidies, guaranteed buy-out prices of their produce, lower production costs and freeze of their bank credits. Papandreou, whose government is in severe financial crisis, told the farmers he will stay with current austerity measures. The blockades only eased after Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov met the protesters at the border and told them he will inform the EU of their demands. Bulgaria wants a 10m-euro compensation for losses suffered because of the protest. (DPA - 23/01/10; Reuters, bTV - 22/01/10)

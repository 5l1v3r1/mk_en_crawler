ATHENS, Greece -- The government fails to protect Iraqi immigrants looking for asylum in Greece, the NGO Human Rights Watch said in a report Wednesday (November 26th). "Greece systematically rounds up and detains Iraqi asylum seekers and other migrants in dirty, overcrowded conditions and forcibly and secretly expels them to Turkey," the 121-page document says. According to the organisation, most Iraqis entering the EU through Greece must claim asylum there. "Greece denies protection to vulnerable people and abuses them in detention. Until Greece cleans up its act, EU states shouldn't send asylum seekers back there," Bill Frelick, refugee police director at Human Rights Watch and the author of the report, said. According to Frelick, police sometimes "mislead" immigrants about their right to seek asylum in Greece.
Also Wednesday, a government commission approved measures aimed at improving local prison conditions. Justice Minister Sotirios Hatzigakis welcomed the move, which will reduce the number of prisoners in detention facilities and will include prison hospitals in the national healthcare system. The move followed an 18-day hunger strike by thousands of prisoners earlier this month. It ended after the government agreed to release 5,500 inmates by April, to alleviate prison overcrowding.

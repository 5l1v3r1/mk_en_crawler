PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Four Kosovo Serbs accused of producing fake evidence in a case involving organ trafficking were released on Friday (February 26th) by a EULEX judge who cited insufficient evidence. Kosovo police arrested the group in June and charged them with trying to buy fake evidence that could be used to accuse the former Kosovo Liberation Army of organ trafficking during the 1998-1999 conflict. Two of the suspects are believed to have been members of Serbia's secret service. (Lajm, Epoka e Re - 01/03/10; RTK, Telegrafi - 28/02/10)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Hundreds of angry taxi drivers blocked downtown Sofia for almost an entire day Friday (February 9th), protesting the murder of one of their colleagues. It was the second such murder since the beginning of the year. The drivers then joined a rally commemorating the eighth anniversary of the arrest of five Bulgarian medics in Libya. Over 25,000 people gathered to demonstrate their solidarity. (24 Chasa, Standart - 10/02/07; Mediapool, News.bg, BNT, bTV, BBC, AP - 09/02/07)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- UN Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte announced Tuesday (22 October) that the first war crimes indictment against a former ethnic Albanian rebel in Kosovo will be issued by year's end. Charges will be filed against two other ethnic Albanians sometime in 2003. She said investigators had intended to complete the three cases by the end of 2002 but encountered difficulties persuading Kosovars to testify in court and confirm statements they had made earlier. Del Ponte, in Pristina for talks with international officials and KFOR commanders, would not name any suspects. Addressing reporters in Sarajevo later, she voiced frustration with Yugoslavia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, accusing the respective governments of becoming less willing to co-operate with the court. She singled out Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica, saying he alone was blocking the arrest of Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic. (AP, AFP, SRNA, B92, Tanjug - 22/10/02)

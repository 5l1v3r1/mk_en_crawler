PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The economy ministry on Monday (January 4th) instructed officials at a bauxite mine near Niksic to remove striking miners from the shaft but set no deadline for the measure. Economy Minister Branko Vujovic says conditions are a health hazard. About 80 miners went underground a week ago to protest the fact they haven't been paid in four months. They also insist on monthly payment of wages and benefits under their collective labour agreement, as well as guarantees that production at the mine would continue. Some of the miners have been transferred to hospital due to health problems. Eight of them started a hunger strike in hospital Monday. President Filip Vujanovic is urging the protesters to end their strike, get out of the mine and continue negotiations with the government. (Beta, B92, Radio Antena M, RTCG - 04/01/10)

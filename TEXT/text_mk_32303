TIRANA, Albania -- At the request of UNMIK, the Albanian government approved a decision Wednesday (2 October) to close the Kosovo diplomatic office in Tirana. Foreign Minister Ilir Meta said local authorities in Kosovo fully support the decision in view of the new political situation. Kosovo Albanians established the office in exile in 1993, to co-ordinate relations between Kosovo Albanians and Albanian authorities against the Serb authority in Kosovo. This followed a 1991 decision by the Albanian Parliament to recognise Kosovo as an independent state.
Also Wednesday, Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano met with the new OSCE chief in Albania, Osmo Lipponen. Nano said that the role of the OSCE mission should be reviewed, given new institutional realities in Albania. (HINA, ATA - 02/10/02)

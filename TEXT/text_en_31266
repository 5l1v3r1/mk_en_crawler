SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The opposition led by the SDSM said on Tuesday (March 1st) it will boycott early elections if the government calls them without meeting their demands. SDSM official Gjorgi Orovcanec said the opposition will return to parliament once their requests are met. The opposition still believes that snap elections are the only way out of the current situation. However, it has set several conditions for holding the early vote, most importantly unfreezing A1 TV's bank accounts. (Makfax, Alsat M, Kanal 5, Sitel - 01/03/11)

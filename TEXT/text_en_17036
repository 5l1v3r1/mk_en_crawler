SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A Libyan citizen was arrested in Sofia on Tuesday (2 May) for allegedly using a videocamera to tape police as they searched a suspicious briefcase in the capital. Interior Minister Rumen Petkov told reporters that police were called to the scene after members of the public noticed the briefcase, which turned out to be empty. Petkov said it might have been a planned ruse, intended to assess the response of Bulgarian security services. (Novinar - 03/05/06; bTV - 02/05/06)

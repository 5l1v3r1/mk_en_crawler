LONDON, United Kingdom -- A group of Albanians and Romanians was arrested in London over the weekend for allegedly planning to kidnap former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham, better known as "Posh Spice." Officials say the five men and two women planned to seek a 5m euro ransom for Beckham, the wife of English football team captain David Beckham. The men are to appear before a judge Monday (4 November) for an arraignment on an unrelated robbery charge involving Sotheby's and jewels worth 90,000 euros.

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- The foreign ministry says Slovenia may prevent Croatia from closing its competition chapter in EU accession negotiations over the Nova Ljubljanska Banka (NLB). Ministry spokesman Milan Balazic explained on Thursday (June 10th) that the NLB is not allowed to operate in Croatia, which Balazic says impedes the free movement of capital. The central bank blocked access until the former Ljubljanska Banka (LB) settles its debts to Croatian citizens. The NLB was established as a separate entity as a result of a 1994 decision by the Slovenian parliament, while all unsettled liabilities remained with the LB. Croatia has not yet opened that competition chapter. (Poslovni Dnevnik, HRT, STA, Nova TV - 10/06/10)

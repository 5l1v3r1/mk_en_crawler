TIRANA, Albania -- The US Helsinki Commission has urged authorities in Albania to meet international standards in Sunday's (May 8th) local elections. In a report on its website Thursday, members of the commission call on authorities to take all measures to secure a process in line with OSCE standards. Voters need to know that their vote is respected, the report states, stressing that the country has the chance for a democratic process after two decades of elections that have not met required standards. The report also expresses concern over violence that has marred the campaign. In the latest example, the car of opposition Socialist Party candidate Astrit Cengu was torched in a village near Kukes, northeast Albania. Cengu was nearby and suffered minor injuries.

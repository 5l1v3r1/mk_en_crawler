BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission may launch legal action against Greece and four other EU member states that failed to meet a deadline for incorporating two EU anti-discrimination directives into their national legislation, the daily Kathimerini reported Tuesday (20 July). The directives aim to ban discrimination on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, age, disability, religion and sexual orientation. The five EU countries -- Austria, Finland, Germany, Greece and Luxembourg -- were due to adopt them by the end of last year. They now have two months to explain the delay. After that, the issue would be referred to the EU court. (Kathimerini - 20/07/04)

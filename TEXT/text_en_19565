SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Local media reports Wednesday (December 26th) suggest Macedonia is nearly doubling its contingent in the US-led Multinational Force in Iraq. Another 36 professional troops and officers from the Second Mechanised Infantry Brigade are leaving for a six-month mission in Iraq after the New Year holidays. They are to help the 44 Macedonian troops who are already there in guarding a coalition forces base. Macedonia joined the Multinational Force in Iraq in June 2003. (A1, Makfax - 26/12/07)

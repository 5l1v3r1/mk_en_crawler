ZAGREB, Croatia -- Justice Minister Ivan Simonovic asked foreign donors Tuesday (April 28th) to help the country finance projects aimed at reforming the judiciary, a key precondition for eventual EU accession. Presenting projects worth about 42m euros through 2012, Simonovic asked the donors to help reduce the number of local courts by 40%, cut the number of court cases and improve prison conditions. Separately, Slovenia has recently blocked Croatia's EU bid over an ongoing border dispute. (HINA, Reuters - 28/04/09)

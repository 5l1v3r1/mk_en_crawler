LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel said on Wednesday (16 November) that the government would seek international arbitration to settle the long-running dispute with Croatia over the former Ljubljanska Banka's debt to Croatian depositors. Rupel told parliament's foreign policy commission that the debt problem, as well as all other outstanding issues with Croatia, would be discussed at a special meeting to be held soon between the prime ministers of the two former Yugoslav republics. Other issues include the bilateral border dispute and the status of the Krsko nuclear power plant. (Novi list - 17/11/05; HRT - 16/11/05)

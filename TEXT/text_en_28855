BUCHAREST, Romania -- The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) on Thursday (July 8th) urged Romanian authorities to take long-term measures to protect people and natural assets from floods, as the swollen Danube River threatens to overflow its banks. The WWF says the bad weather is likely to continue and authorities need to find long-term solutions to deal with flooding. "WWF is calling for closer consideration to be given to measures that restore the natural capacity of the Danube floodplain to retain floodwaters," Orieta Hulea, regional co-ordinator of the WWF, said. Since June 21st, Romania has been battered by storms and flooding that have killed 25 people and forced 16,500 from their homes. (AFP, Adevarul, Evenimentul Zilei - 08/07/10)

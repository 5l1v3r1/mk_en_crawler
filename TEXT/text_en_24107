TIRANA, Albania -- The United States on Tuesday (December 16th) welcomed parliament's decision to postpone by a week a vote on a new lustration bill. It requires all candidates for official posts to be investigated for past co-operation with the communist-era secret services. The US Embassy says the postponement allows time for public debate as the measure "raises serious constitutional and legal concerns". The embassy statement also suggested holding international consultations to meet international standards. (Shekulli, Shqip, Tema - 17/12/08; Klan, Top Channel - 16/12/08)

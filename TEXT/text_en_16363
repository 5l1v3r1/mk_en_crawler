SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- European Commission (EC) spokesman in Sarajevo Frane Maroevic cautioned on Wednesday (12 July) that the EC is dissatisfied with the progress of reforms in BiH, especially crucial police reform. The EC is to submit its next assessment report on the country's progress in the Stabilisation and Association process by the end of September. Maroevic warned it could be quite negative, unless "dramatic progress" is made in the coming months. 
In other news, BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic announced on Wednesday that bilateral talks would begin next week between the EC and the Western Balkan countries, aimed at relaxing the EU visa regime. Terzic says Brussels has made clear that it considers police reform a key condition for visa liberalisation. (Nezavisne novine - 13/07/06; RTRS, PBS BiH, NTV Hayat - 12/07/06)

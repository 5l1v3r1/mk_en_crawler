LONDON, United Kingdom -- Former BiH presidency member Ejup Ganic was arrested at London's Heathrow airport based on an arrest warrant issued by Belgrade, Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic announced on Monday (March 1st). Ganic was detained while trying to leave the UK. He will remain in custody until a hearing on March 29th. Serbia plans to request his extradition. Ganic is wanted in connection with an attack in Sarajevo against a column of the Yugoslav National Army in May 1992, which left more than 40 soldiers dead. The convoy was apparently leaving Sarajevo at the time. (Beta, Fena, BHRT, RTRS, BBC, Reuters - 01/03/10)

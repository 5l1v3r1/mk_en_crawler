Every August in the small Croatian town of Sinj, riders don 18th century garb to compete in a nearly three-century old tournament popularly known as a Sinjska Alka. This unique equestrian event is more than a tourist attraction. For many Croats, it symbolises heroism, love for the homeland, and the struggle for freedom. 
As the country prepares for EU membership, this and other examples of Croatia's national heritage take on a new significance. Speaking at the event, President Ivo Josipovic pledged that the country will "affirm its identity and culture" and make a recognisable contribution to the European tapestry.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Sunday (19 December) that the UN plan for the reunification of Cyprus remains a valid solution to a problem that has strained Ankara's relations with Europe for 30 years. He expressed hope that intensive efforts will take place to implement the plan's provisions by 3 October 2005, when the EU is set to open accession talks with Turkey.
On Monday, French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier said the accession negotiations would be long and difficult, as Turkey would be asked to address a number of issues, including Cyprus. Meanwhile, Dutch Foreign Minister Bernard Bot, whose country holds the EU rotating presidency, is rejecting calls for a European referendum on Turkey's membership, saying the idea is like moving "the goalposts in the middle of a match". 
In other news, the trial of Metin Kaplan opens in Ankara late Monday. He is accused of masterminding a plot to crash an aircraft into the memorial to Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. (AFP - 20/12/04; AFP - 19/12/04)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The international community is condemning Tuesday's (15 March) attack against Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova. In what is now being described as an assassination attempt, a bomb went off near Rugova's motorcade as he was travelling to a meeting with EU security chief Javier Solana. The president was unhurt. In separate statements, UNMIK, the OSCE and the Council of Europe expressed outrage, saying it was directed against democratic institutions in the province at a very sensitive time. Belgrade and Tirana also condemned the attack. While in Pristina, meanwhile, Solana called for the swift formation of a new interim government in the wake of Ramush Haradinaj's resignation as prime minister last week.

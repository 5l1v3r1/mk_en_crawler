BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania will negotiate the terms of its entry into the EU with only the current 15 member states, according to foreign ministry spokesman Cosmin Dobran. Tuesday's (22 July) comment was in response to a suggestion by Hungary that the ten countries set to join the Union next year should also be included in accession talks with Romania and Bulgaria.
In other news, Bulgaria and the European Commission (EC) signed the 4th financial agreement under the EU's SAPARD programme on Wednesday. The EC will grant 56.1m euros for agricultural and road development projects by the end of 2006. (BTA - 23/07/02; Rompres, BBC - 22/07/03)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev said on Thursday (April 12th) that the European Commission is satisfied with the government's report on progress in fighting crime and corruption and has urged Bulgaria to continue its efforts. Next week, he added, the government plans to launch a campaign on utilising the financing from EU structural funds. Between 2007 and 2013, Bulgaria is entitled to draw up to 11 billion euros in funding.
In other news, the Varna District Court rejected on Thursday a request from Turkmenistan to extradite Annadurdy Khajiev, a Turkmen dissident who fled to Bulgaria in 2001. The country also revoked a temporary detention order and freed Khajiev, ruling there was insufficient evidence to support claims that he stole some 29.7m euros while deputy governor of the central bank.

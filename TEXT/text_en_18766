STRASBOURG, France -- Council of Europe (CoE) Secretary General Terry Davis and his counterpart from the OSCE, Marc Perrin de Brichambaut, issued a joint statement Monday (January 8th), calling on Albania's political parties to resume dialogue aimed at resolving the longstanding electoral crisis. They welcomed an initiative by President Alfred Moisiu to convene a new roundtable of main parties to hammer out an agreement on election issues and lead to municipal vote this winter. ''The Albanian people have the right to free and fair elections, untainted by irregularities and fraud," the statement said. The CoE is sending a mission to Albania on Wednesday. 
Moisiu, meanwhile, confirmed that he is ready to set a new date for the local elections, as preparations cannot be completed by the originally scheduled date of January 20th. (Albanian News - 09/01/07; CoE website, OSCE website, Albanian President website - 08/01/07)

NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has urged the "timely conclusion" of the Kosovo status talks, saying that Kosovo and its people need "clarity on their future". A report by Ban to the UN Security Council -- on developments in the province between November and February -- was published on the UN website Tuesday (March 13th). He emphasised the need for a sustainable solution that would guarantee stability and peaceful co-existence of all communities. 
On Tuesday, meanwhile, UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari rejected Russia's calls for continued negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina. He says prolonging negotiations would only worsen the situation. The EU on Tuesday backed Ahtisaari's decision to send his blueprint to the Security Council, as did the US State Department.

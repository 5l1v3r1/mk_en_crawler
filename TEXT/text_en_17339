PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The EU scolded Montenegro for its decision to seal the so-called Article 98 agreement with the US, which protects US citizens from proceedings before the International Criminal Court. The EU ambassadors to Podgorica expressed their disapproval during a meeting Thursday (May 24th) within the Enhanced Permanent Dialogue (EPD), which reviews progress the country has made in the EU-reform agenda. The ambassadors said that by supporting Article 98, Podgorica has stepped back from EU values. (Vijesti - 25/05/07; MINA, Focus - 24/05/07)

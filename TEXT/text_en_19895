ATLANTA, United States -- Veselin Vidacak and Ugljesa Pantic, two Bosnian Serbs who lied about their service in the infamous Zvornik Brigade when they applied for immigrant status, told an immigration court Monday (November 19th) that they will stop fighting their deportation. The two men were arrested last December in North Carolina and have been held in federal detention centres ever since. The Zvornik Brigade was responsible for the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, the largest mass murder in Europe since WWII. (AP - 19/11/07)

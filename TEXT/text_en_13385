SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament adopted a package of constitutional amendments -- aimed at reforming the judicial sector -- in the third and final reading Thursday (30 March). The changes were passed with 184 votes in favour, 35 votes against and one abstention. The amendments, related to the country's EU accession process, envision the transfer of 90 per cent of criminal cases from the investigator's offices to law enforcement agencies, which should reduce bureaucracy and resolve ongoing cases more quickly.

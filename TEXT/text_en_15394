SKOPJE, Macedonia -- VMRO-DPMNE leader Nikola Gruevski officially received the mandate to form new government from President Branko Crvenkovski on Friday (28 July). He now has 20 days to submit his proposed cabinet to parliament. Gruevski told Crvenkovski that his priorities would be the fight against corruption and organised crime, improvement of the economic situation and higher living standards. 
Meanwhile, talks on forming a government continue. On Thursday, US Ambassador to Macedonia Gillian Milovanovic issued a statement emphasising that what is most important now is the future of the country, not the future of individual political parties. Recent tensions surrounding the coalition talks are part of the normal democratic process, common to all countries, she said. (Vecer, Danas - 28/07/06; A1 TV, Makfax - 27/07/06)

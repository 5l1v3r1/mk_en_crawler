BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO is not creating its own state and has no hidden agenda regarding Kosovo, Alliance spokeswoman Carmen Romero said on Tuesday (August 21st). She added that NATO would support any solution that results from the new 120 days of negotiations that just began between Belgrade and Pristina. Several Serbian officials, including most recently Interior Minister Dragan Jocic, have accused NATO of engaging in a state-building project. (Tanjug, Telegrafi, B92 - 21/08/07)

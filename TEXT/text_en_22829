BELGRADE, Serbia -- A court in Belgrade on Tuesday (October 7th) released from custody a former diplomat who allegedly helped a Serbian college basketball player flee the United States, where he is charged with beating a fellow student into a coma. Authorities suspected Igor Milosevic, Serbia's former vice-consul to New York, of issuing a temporary passport to Miladin Kovacevic that allowed him to leave the United States in June. Police arrested Milosevic on September 2nd when authorities began investigating his alleged abuse of power. (AFP, B92, Tanjug - 07/10/08)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The leaders of Bulgaria's main right-wing parties -- the United Democratic Forces (UDF)'s Plamen Yurukov and the Democrats for Strong Bulgaria (DSB)'s Ivan Kostov -- made a joint appeal Thursday (July 26th) to the two parties' local organisations to work together at the local elections, and eventually prepare joint election campaigns. Kostov said that an alliance between UDF, DSB and the agricultural parties could become the second strongest political power in Sofia. He has suggested that a common right-wing candidate in the Sofia mayoral elections could at least reach a run-off against incumbent Boyko Borisov.

BERLIN, Germany -- Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told the national public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk on Sunday (January 27th) that most of the EU members states are preparing to recognise Kosovo independence very soon, implying that Germany is as well. Steinmeier added Germany "has no illusions, knowing that a negotiated settlement it hoped for cannot be reached". Also Sunday, former Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic denied reports that quoted him as saying that Podgorica will recognise Kosovo's independence. The Sarajevo-based NTV Hayat TV quoted him as saying "We want to become part of the EU and we should honour its decisions. Naturally, Montenegro does not have the role of a leader as far as the Kosovo status issue is concerned. But in the end, we will recognise the independence of Kosovo just like other regional countries will." Later, he said his comment had been misinterpreted.

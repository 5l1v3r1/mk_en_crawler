THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal released two former Croatian generals Thursday (2 December) until the start of their trials. Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac are charged with expulsion of the Serb population of Krajina and the murder of at least 150 Serbs in 1995. Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said in an interview for national television that the provisional release of the two indictees demonstrates his government's good co-operation with the tribunal. 
In other news, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus said Thursday that he expects several war crimes suspects now living in Serbia to appear soon before the UN court in The Hague. He acknowledged his country's international isolation and described the lack of war crimes co-operation as "a burden" slowing Serbia's accession to the EU. (AFP, Reuters, HINA, HRT - 02/12/04)

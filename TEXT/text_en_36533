SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Foreign Minister Solomon Passy returned on Saturday (8 May) from New York, where he met with Libyan leader Moammar Kadhafi's son, Saif al-Islam Kadhafi. Passy said Kadhafi assured him that it is too early to draw conclusions about the trial of six Bulgarian medics, sentenced to death late last week for spreading the HIV virus to hundreds of children in a Libyan hospital. The international community condemned the sentence.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor on Thursday (January 20th) singled out about a dozen public sector investment projects that are to be launched in the first quarter of this year, part of an investment cycle that is expected to boost the economy and enable it to rebound faster from the recession. The largest project in Kosor's list is construction of a new terminal at the Zagreb airport, which will cost about 203m euros. Other notable projects include reconstruction and extension of the Omisalj oil storage terminal and building the Ombla underground hydro power plant. (HRT, Hina, tportal.hr - 20/01/11)

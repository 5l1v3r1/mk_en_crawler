STRASBOURG, France -- Peter Schieder, the president of the Council of Europe (CoE) Parliamentary Assembly, said Monday (21 June) that Serbia-Montenegro is falling behind in its commitments to the CoE. He put special emphasis on the presidential elections now under way, saying the vote would be essential to determining the country's future direction.
Meanwhile, Democratic Party leader Boris Tadic met with ranking EU officials in Brussels on Monday. The EU stressed that although Tadic is a presidential candidate, the meeting did not focus on Sunday's run-off election. The Union said it is being careful not to get involved in the process, though it hopes a pro-EU candidate wins.
In other news, General Nebojsa Pavkovic, the Milosevic-era Yugoslav Army chief of staff, said Monday he would not turn himself over to the war crimes tribunal in The Hague. He is among several former top police and army officials who insist on being tried in Serbia. (B92, Beta, Tanjug - 21/06/04)

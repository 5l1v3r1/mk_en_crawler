ATHENS, Greece -- The army announced on Thursday (June 3rd) it plans to reduce its number of troops serving in KFOR and in pirate-fighting operations off Somalia. The cost-cutting move is expected to save Greece about 23m euros. General Staff spokesman Colonel Nikos Bonoras tells AFP that of the 657 Greek troops currently deployed in Kosovo, more than 600 will gradually leave, starting in November. At the same time, a Greek frigate that just rotated out of a NATO squadron in Somali waters will not be replaced. (AFP - 03/06/10)

WASHINGTON, United States -- Serbia and the United States share a common strategic interest -- the creation of peaceful and prosperous Balkans integrated in the EU -- but differ over Kosovo, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic told reporters on Friday (July 27th) after a meeting with US Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice in Washington. He added, however, that Belgrade and Washington have resumed top level dialogue and said this is key to eventually settling Kosovo's status. Rice urged Serbia to co-operate with the international community in efforts to settle the issue. (B92, Voice of America, Makfax - 28/07/07 Reuters, AP, Beta, RTS - 27/07/07)

BERLIN, Germany -- A government spokesman announced on Wednesday (21 May) that Germany has decided to extend the mandate of its peacekeepers in Kosovo, due to expire on 11 June. The decision must be ratified by parliament before that date. Berlin has 3,700 soldiers in the Serbian province, mostly deployed around Prizren.
In other news, UNMIK chief Michael Steiner visited NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday and said it is too early to start talks about Kosovo's final status. He signaled that the international community is determined to complete work on priorities set earlier this year. (AFP - 21/05/03)

PARIS, France -- Turkey should be offered privileged partnership instead of full EU membership status, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday (January 30th) at a conference dubbed "Lets Build Our Future Together", organised by France's ruling Union for a Popular Movement Party. French President Nicolas Sarkozy was also on hand and reiterated his stance against Turkey's EU accession. "I would like to be viewed as a friend of Turkey, but nevertheless I must say that Turkey cannot have a place in the EU because it is in Asia Minor," Sarkozy said.
Also Wednesday, Turkey's foreign minister and chief EU negotiator, Ali Babacan, said his country is aiming to become a first-class democracy that observes the Copenhagen criteria regarding human rights and civil freedoms. He reiterated that Turkey's goal is to become a full-fledged EU member. (Trend, Financial Times, ITAR-TASS, Zaman - 30/01/08)

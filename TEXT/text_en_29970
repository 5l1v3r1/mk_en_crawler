BELGRADE, Serbia - The defence ministry said in a statement Friday (February 25th) that none of its current or former military staff had been involved in events under way in Libya. The statement followed some Arab and Maltese media reports that Serbian pilots and ground crews had taken part in bombing those protesting Muammar Gadaffi's regime in Tripoli and Benghazi.

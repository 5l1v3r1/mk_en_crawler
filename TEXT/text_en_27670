BUCHAREST, Romania -- The National Anti-Corruption Agency announced on Tuesday (April 27th) that it filed corruption charges against lawmaker Serban Mihailescu, a former cabinet minister in Adrian Nastase's government between 2000 and 2004. According to the indictment, Mihailescu received nine hunting guns from a subordinate in 2002, but never got the necessary permits. Mihailescu was first charged in May 2006. But in April 2008, the Supreme Cassation Court returned the case to prosecutors arguing that Mihailescu had immunity as a member of parliament. In July 2008, the chief prosecutors asked parliament to approve the start of an investigation, a request that was approved in June 2009.

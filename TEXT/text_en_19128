WASHINGTON, United States -- The EU and the United States (US) on Monday (April 30th) jointly urged the UN Security Council to adopt a new resolution on Kosovo, based on UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan, in a timely manner. According to a White House press release, issued after the EU-US summit in Washington, the EU and the US view the Kosovo status issue as the most urgent one in the Western Balkans. 
On Monday, the Pristina daily Koha Ditore published an interview with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who said that the Union expects the Security Council to approve a new resolution on Kosovo this spring.
Separately, the Serbian state news agency Tanjug reports that the next session of the six-nation Contact Group for Kosovo -- which includes Russia -- would be held in London on Thursday. The session was postponed last week, following the death of former Russian President Boris Yeltsin. (White House press release, Beta, RTS, Tanjug, Koha Ditore - 30/04/07)

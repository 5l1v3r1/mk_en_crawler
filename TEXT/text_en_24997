TIRANA, Albania -- The congress of the Socialist Party (SP) adopted a resolution Saturday (August 29th) stating its refusal to recognise the results of the June 28th parliamentary elections, due to irregularities. SP leader Edi Rama said early elections are needed for Albania to emerge from what he described as a political crisis, and warned that SP members in parliament will boycott institutions until further notice.

ATHENS, Greece -- The foreign ministers of Greece and Albania said Wednesday (8 September) that the violence in several Greek cities following a soccer game last Saturday should not damage bilateral relations. Greek fans attacked Albanian immigrants who had gone out into the streets to celebrate their country's victory in a World Cup qualifier against Greece. One Albanian was stabbed to death and several others were injured. (AFP - 08/09/04)

BONN, Germany -- The head of the European Parliament's committee for Southeast Europe, Doris Pack, repeated a call Tuesday (14 March) for Serbia to do everything possible to arrest and hand over top war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic to The Hague tribunal. Pack, speaking on Radio Deutsche Welle, said that the death of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic increases the pressure on Belgrade regarding war crimes co-operation. 
Also Wednesday, NATO and EU troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina searched the home and business of a suspected supporter of indictee Radovan Karadzic. NATO identified the suspect as Nemanja Vasic, of the town of Prnjavor. Troops were looking for information about the network helping the Bosnian Serb wartime political leader evade capture.

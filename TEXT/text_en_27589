BELGRADE, Serbia -- The European Commission (EC) will send a questionnaire to Serbia next month in order to assess the compatibility of the country's legislation with the acquis communautaire, EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele told the daily Politika on Tuesday (October 26th). The questionnaire will contain about 4,000 questions, but Fuele believes the government is prepared, as most of the issues were covered in prior progress reports. Fuele also suggested that should the process go smoothly, the EC will be ready with a draft opinion on Serbia's readiness to acquire EU candidate status in the second half of 2011.

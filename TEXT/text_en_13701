SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The state and entity prime ministers, along with other top government officials, are to meet in Mostar on Tuesday (23 August) in another bid to reach an agreement on crucial police reform. On Monday, the European Commission Delegation to BiH issued a statement reiterating expectations that a political agreement on the reform concept would be reached by the end of September, so that BiH could begin Stabilisation and Association negotiations with the EU this year. Separately Monday, Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Pero Bukejlovic said he hoped a compromise could be reached.
In other news Monday, the BiH State Court ordered controversial Bosnian Serb businessman Momcilo Mandic to remain in custody at least until 16 September. He was arrested in Montenegro and extradited to BiH last week. The former RS justice minister faces charges of embezzlement, money laundering and organised crime and is suspected of supporting fugitive Radovan Karadzic.

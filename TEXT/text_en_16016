SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A month of campaigning ahead of the 22 October presidential elections officially began on Tuesday (19 September), with seven candidates vying for the post. Polls suggest the top three contenders are incumbent Georgi Parvanov, right-wing nominee Nedelcho Beronov and Attack coalition leader Volen Siderov.
In other news, the minor nationalist party VMRO, a partner in the parliamentary Bulgarian People's Union, asked the chief prosecutor's office to investigate the activities of a pro-Macedonian formation, OMO Ilinden-Pirin. VMRO says OMO Ilinden-Pirin is "buying" the signatures of people in poor Roma settlements in the Blagoevgrad region, in an effort to boost its petition drive for legitimate party status.

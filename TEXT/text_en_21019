ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader on Monday (March 3rd) rejected being forced to choose between EU membership and Croatia's protected environmental fishing zone (ZERP) in the Adriatic. Speaking at a public event, Sanader said the real question is whether Croatia can protect its national interests while obtaining EU membership. He says it can and said he expects all remaining issues to be resolved. Italy and Slovenia oppose the establishment of the ZERP. Croatia has invited the two countries to talks, but so far only Slovenia has agreed to attend. (HRT, Vecernji List - 03/03/08)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prosecutors will issue international arrest warrants for the wife and son of former dictator Slobodan Milosevic, top officials in Belgrade announced on Thursday (June 14th). Justice Minister Dusan Petrovic said Mirijana Markovic and Marko Milosevic will be indicted for running a cigarette smuggling ring in the 1990s. Both are believed to be hiding in Russia. Slobodan Radovanovic, the special prosecutor for war crimes, said earlier this week that the Milosevics made millions of dollars smuggling cigarettes into Yugoslavia while it was under an international embargo. 
In other news Thursday, Serbian authorities extradited to Skopje a Macedonian tycoon wanted there for financial fraud and money laundering. Metodija Smilenski was arrested in Belgrade a year ago but has fought extradition. (The Independent - 15/06/07; AP, Tanjug, B92, Makfax, MIA, MRT AP - 14/06/07)

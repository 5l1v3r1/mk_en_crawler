For several years in a row, Romania had one of the highest inflation rates in the region, with prices rising nearly every week. More recently, inflation has been dropping, and 2005 will mark the first year in which it has been kept to a single digit. 
However, enthusiasm over this economic success has been partly clouded by suggestions that the rate will not be as low as originally predicted. 
"It is possible that the rate of inflation in 2005 will be 7.5 per cent instead of 7 per cent," Romanian National Bank Governor Mugur Isarescu said in a TV appearance. Some IMF estimates anticipate an 8.2 per cent rate for this year -- significantly higher than the government's targeted 6 per cent. 
 Recent price increases in some sectors, particularly fuels and public utilities, are seen as the main force driving the higher-than-expected inflation rate. The price of natural gas has increased four times since January. Electricity is now 10 per cent more expensive than at the beginning of this year. 
 Currency reform has also played a role. On 1 July, the Romanian leu (ROL) dropped four zeros. Nicknamed "the heavy leu", the new currency (RON) led some retailers to round prices upward. In one Bucharest store, for instance, bread that used to cost 5,300 ROL now goes for 0.55 RON. At a local supermarket, customers must fork out 17 RON for meat that used to cost 165,000 ROL per kg. 
 Some observers believe the overall impact of the new currency should be negligible. "It was a technical procedure, less complicated than adopting the euro in some countries of the EU," economist Daniel Daianu told the daily Averea. But others suspect the currency change will have an inflationary effect. A study by the Oxford Business Group concludes it is "very probable" that prices will go up after adopting the heavy leu, though only for a limited period of time. 
Inflation was a major economic issue immediately after the fall of the former communist regime, when it shot up to 170 per cent in 1991, 210 per cent in 1992 and 256 per cent in 1993. The rate began to fall in 1998, dropping to 15 per cent by 2003 and only 3.8 per cent during the first five months of this year. For 2006, authorities hope to limit inflation to no more than 6 per cent to 6.5 per cent, with the longer-term aim of reaching 4.5 per cent -- a rate closer to that of other countries in Europe.

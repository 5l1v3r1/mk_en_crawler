ATHENS, Greece -- Police announced on Thursday (September 2nd) they have found a cache of weapons believed to have been looted from army depots in 1997 during a time of public unrest in neighbouring Albania. Four automatic rifles, three machine guns, 14 grenades, and more than 18,000 bullets were found buried in a border area. A huge amount of weapons, ammunition and explosive devices were looted from army depots in 1997, when Albanians, enraged over losing their life savings in bogus pyramid investment schemes, stormed army barracks.

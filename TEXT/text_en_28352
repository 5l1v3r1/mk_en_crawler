BELGRADE, Serbia -- UN war crimes tribunal Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz said on Thursday (May 13th) he is cautiously optimistic about the arrest of Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic. Visiting Belgrade, he said he had no reason to believe Mladic has fled Serbia, and urged he authorities to beef up their search. Brammertz also announced plans to streamline the indictment against Mladic to only 11 of the initial 15 counts, which would make for a speedier trial once he is captured. Brammertz is in Belgrade to assess the level of co-operation with The Hague tribunal. Serbia hopes that a positive report would convince the EU Council to finally allow member states to begin ratifying its Stabilisation and Association Agreement.

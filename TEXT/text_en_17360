BELGRADE, Serbia -- Russia reportedly has rejected the fourth version of a UN Security Council resolution on Kosovo circulated by the United States, United Kingdom and France on Thursday (June 28th). The new version is said to include text clarifying that Kosovo is a unique case, never to be treated as a precedent. Russia has argued that Kosovo's independence could fuel separatist movements elsewhere. (Kohajone, Blic, Danas, Politika - 29/06/07; Beta, Tanjug, AFP, RTRS, RTK, Telegrafi - 28/06/07)

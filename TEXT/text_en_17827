SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Justice Minister Mihajlo Manevski said on Thursday (February 22nd) that Macedonia has prepared a draft law that would regulate virtually every issue related to co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague. Officials hope the tribunal will eventually transfer four specific cases to Macedonia for prosecution. 
The transfer of cases was the focus of a visit to The Hague by a delegation from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Tribunal spokesperson Refik Hodzic described the two-day talks as very productive. (Vecer - 23/02/07; MIA, Makfax, A1 TV, RTRS - 22/02/07)

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou said on Monday (July 20th) his government will continue blocking the energy negotiation chapter in Turkey's EU accession talks, as long as Ankara opposes Nicosia's oil exploration projects in the Mediterranean Sea. "We cannot lift the veto when Ankara tries to impede an EU member state from using its own energy sources," he told reporters. He urged Turkey to stop behaving like "a neighbourhood bully", and instead act "like a modern state aiming to join the EU". If Turkey adopts a constructive approach, Cyprus will have no reason to object, he added.
Separately on Monday, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Cemil Cicek said Ankara will never abandon its guarantor rights in Cyprus, even after the two Cypriot communities reach a reunification deal. He was visiting the Turkish Cypriot part of Nicosia for celebrations marking the 35th anniversary of the 1974 Turkish military intervention in Cyprus, which followed a Greek Cypriot military coup. Ankara received guarantor status, along with Greece and the UK, under the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee, which granted Cyprus independence from the UK.

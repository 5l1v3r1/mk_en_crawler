ZAGREB, Croatia -- President-elect Ivo Josipovic voiced regret Monday (February 15th) that Serbian President Boris Tadic will not attend his inauguration ceremony Thursday, saying: "I have stretched my hand, and I would have liked if he had accepted it." Tadic has repeatedly said he will not attend the ceremony if Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu is there. In an interview with the Associated Press, Josipovic said he will work to strengthen Croatia's relations with Serbia and other Balkan countries. He also vowed to tackle corruption and speed up reforms needed for Croatia's EU integration. (B92, Beta, AP - 15/02/10)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Kosovo Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni told EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele on Tuesday (May 4th) that Kosovo will participate in the EU-Western Balkans summit in Sarajevo only as an equal partner with other participants. Hyseni delivered the same message to French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner in Paris. The subject is delicate, because Serbia refused to attend a regional summit in March that Kosovo representatives attended, saying participation implied recognition of Kosovo's independence. Hyseni also discussed potential visa-free travel for Kosovo citizens and possible scenarios after the International Court of Justice rules on the legality of Kosovo's independence.

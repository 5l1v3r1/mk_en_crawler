TIRANA, Albania -- The director of the construction inspectorate at Tirana's City Hall was shot early Monday (April 4th) in the centre of the capital. Ardit Kaja was wounded in the leg by two people on a motorbike. Tirana mayor and opposition Socialist Party leader Edi Rama immediately implicated the Socialist Movement for Integration, as Kaja reportedly had ordered the removal of SMI election posters several days ago. Monday's attack comes amid the heated start of campaigning for the May 8th local elections. Two candidates of the ruling Democratic Party came under fire-arms attack last week.

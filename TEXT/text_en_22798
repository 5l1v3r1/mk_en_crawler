ANKARA, Turkey -- The first open hearing in the trial for the murder of Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink opened in Istanbul on Monday (July 7th). The court will hear from the 19 suspects who face charges of plotting Dink's murder. A gunman shot the editor-in-chief of the Turkish-Armenian weekly Agos on January 19th 2007 outside the newspaper's office. The previous five court sessions were closed to the press and observers, as the alleged gunman Ogun Samast was under 18. Outside the courthouse, a group of demonstrators protested against the trial's slowness and insisted that justice be served. The trial began in July 2007.
In other news, a forest fire killed two women on Monday (July 7th) in the southern province of Mersin, Turkish media reported. The blaze broke out in a forest but rapidly spread to residential areas, killing the two and injuring several other villagers in the Gulnar district.

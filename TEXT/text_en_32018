BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR troops seized eight tonnes of ammunition during a raid at a private warehouse in Republika Srpska (RS) early Thursday (21 November). An SFOR spokesman told reporters it consisted largely of mortar shells and rifle ammunition. No arrests were made.
Also on Thursday, High Representative Paddy Ashdown called for international oversight of the Bosnian investigation into exports of military hardware to Iraq. "I deeply regret that it appears that the RS authorities have not yet treated this matter with the seriousness it deserves," Ashdown told a session of the Peace Implementation Council's steering board in Brussels. The board told BiH Presidency chairman Mirko Sarovic and RS Prime Minister Mladen Ivanic that the RS government's provisional report on the case was "inadequate".

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Representatives of the major political parties are to meet with cabinet members Friday (October 17th) in an attempt to resolve the crisis triggered by public servants' demands for salary hikes. The meeting comes two days after the Constitutional Court upheld a draft law granting teachers a 50% wage hike. The government had challenged the bill, saying it failed to indicate how to fund the raises. Labour Minister Mariana Campeanu said the starting point for Friday's discussions would be the existing legislation on public servants' salaries. Discussions between government officials and representatives of trade and employers' unions have so far failed to bring about an agreement.

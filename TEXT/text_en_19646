BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik suggested on Tuesday (January 22nd) that the BiH Army be disbanded, leaving it a demilitarised state whose long-term security would be guaranteed by a small international presence. "The current BiH military is a caricature," Dodik said. He added that the costs of maintaining the state-level army are much higher than projected and said the annual 300m-euro army budget could be better spent on social and development projects. Bosniak and Croat political parties rejected the idea, calling it politically irresponsible. They dismissed his proposal to disband the army as unacceptable.

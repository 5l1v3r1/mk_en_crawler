ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said on Monday (June 2nd) that he plans to open a public debate on the Druzba Adria oil pipeline project. Sanader conceded that while his ruling Croatian Democratic Union opposed the project in the past, the current situation means Croatia can no longer secure cheap energy. The project would provide Russian oil to Croatia via a pipeline passing through Belarus, Ukraine, Slovakia, Hungary and Croatia. There would also be an option to ship oil through Croatian ports to Western Europe and the United States, providing a wealth of transit fees for Croatia. The biggest concern over the project is environmental, as the Jadran basin, where the pipeline will end, already faces a pollution threat. Critics say a new pipeline would only exacerbate the situation. (Vecernji List, Monitor - 02/06/08)

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Montenegro's unionists announced on Wednesday (24 May) that they will challenge the results of last Sunday's independence referendum and seek a rerun in dozens of polling stations. Predrag Bulatovic, the leader of the pro-Serbia opposition, said that six people were listed in two voter lists and that the lists included individuals who were ineligible to vote because they lived outside Montenegro or had previously voted in Serbia or Bosnia and Herzegovina. The referendum commission will have until Friday to examine complaints. If these are rejected, the results will become official on Sunday. The EU envoy for the independence poll, Miroslav Lajcak, has expressed disappointment with opposition tactics.
In other news, Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic now says he will put off resigning until after the results are official. He had previously planned to step down and hold the last Council of Ministers meeting Thursday. (Politika - 25/05/06; Reuters, AFP, AP, UPI, Tanjug, Beta, RTS - 24/05/06)

ANKARA, Turkey -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Wednesday (4 May) that Turkey must continue with the dynamic reforms it achieved last year in its efforts to achieve EU democratic standards. The German leader, a strong supporter of the Turkish bid for EU membership, said Ankara must do more to improve the treatment of women and religious minorities, as well as to ensure freedom of speech. He reassured Turkish leaders that the results of an upcoming French referendum on the new EU Constitution would not affect their country's progress towards membership. The chancellor also reminded his hosts that Ankara must extend a trade agreement with the EU to Cyprus, a country Turkey has not recognised. (Bloomberg, AFP, BBC, NTV, TurkishPress.com - 04/05/05)

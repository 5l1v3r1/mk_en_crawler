BELGRADE, Serbia -- An estimated 10,000 workers gathered in downtown Belgrade on Wednesday (April 29th) to protest the government's austerity plan, a condition for Serbia to receive 3 billion euros in assistance from the IMF. The Association of Independent Trade Unions and several other smaller unions organised the demonstration. They accuse the government of developing a poor anti-crisis strategy that contains insufficient stimuli to boost the real economy and employment. The government did not talk to demonstrators, and Labour Minister Rasim Ljajic admitted he has no optimistic message for Friday's Labour Day observance. (Blic - 30/04/09; B92, Beta - 29/04/09)

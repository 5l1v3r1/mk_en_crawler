ANKARA, Turkey -- In a rare show of unity, lawmakers voted Thursday in favour of a package of legislation that would address a number of EU concerns. A provision requiring jail terms for those who speak of separatism was abolished. Parliament allowed private radio and TV stations to broadcast programming in Kurdish and granted parents the right to give their children Kurdish names. Another measure restricts the army's influence over the media by removing the military's seat on a special board that monitors newspapers, radio and TV. Lawmakers did not adopt a provision allowing international observers to monitor elections, arguing the government had already signed international agreements to that effect. Parliament also formally ratified a Council of Europe convention banning capital punishment.
The new legislation was adopted a day ahead of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's departure for the EU Summit in Greece. Turkey wants to start accession talks with the Union as soon as possible. (Hurriyet, Milliyet - 20/06/03; Reuters, AFP, Anadolu Agency, NTV, TRT 2 - 19/06/03)

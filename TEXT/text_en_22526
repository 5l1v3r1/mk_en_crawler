BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu on Wednesday (April 9th) expressed concern over the recent death of a Romanian national who had staged a hunger strike in a Polish prison. Claudiu Daniel Crulic was arrested in December, suspected of robbing a judge in Poland. While in custody, Crulic insisted he was innocent and launched a hunger strike to protest his arrest. His family says he sent numerous letters to the Romanian consulate asking for help. Crulic died on January 18th, four days after a local court ruled he be force fed. Tariceanu is awaiting a report on the matter. "I've seen how embassies and consulates of other countries get involved to protect the interests and rights of their citizens. I expect Romanian embassies ... to have the same attitude," he said. (Realitatia, Rompres, Mediafax - 09/04/08)

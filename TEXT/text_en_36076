BUCHAREST, Romania -- Defence Minister Ioan Mircea Pascu said Saturday (20 March) that the country is ready to deploy a company of its strategic reserve battalion to Kosovo if needed. He rejected any possibility of Romanian troops withdrawing from international missions there or in Iraq. The decision to deploy additional troops will come from the North Atlantic Council.
In other news, Romanian President Ion Iliescu will visit Israel on Monday. Last year, Bucharest denied that the World War II regime of Ion Antonescu had participated in the Holocaust, but later conceded that 250,000 Romanian Jews had been deported to concentration camps.

TIRANA, Albania -- About 150,000 voters will be granted the chance to vote for the first time in the upcoming May 8th local elections. A European Council project has been raising awareness among 18 year olds' about eligibility and voting methods, VoA reported on Thursday (April 28th). Most students say that they will participate in the vote, a project survey reveals. The European Council project reached 384 schools offering classes on democracy and the right to vote, along with the voting procedure itself. The awareness campaign aims to inform new voters on rights for individual voting, thus avoiding group or family voting, one of the most criticised practices from previous elections.

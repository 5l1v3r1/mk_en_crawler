TIRANA, Albania -- The cultivation of marijuana has dropped to half its 2009 level, police announced on Thursday (August 12th). Authorities destroyed about 20,500 plants in the first seven months of 2010, says Sokol Selfollari, head of the state police's anti-drug unit. Villages in Gjirokastra and Shkodra continue to dominate in terms of growing marijuana. Fighting illegal drugs is one of the conditions Albania must meet before it benefits from the EU's visa liberalisation process. (Alsat, Telegrafi, Klan - 12/08/10)

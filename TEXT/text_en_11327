BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A Serbian government spokesman has admitted for the first time that authorities are trying to contact supporters of Ratko Mladic in a bid to persuade him to surrender, the International Herald Tribune reported Thursday (23 June). The admission came following numerous media reports in recent weeks. R. Nicholas Burns, the US undersecretary of state for political affairs, told the newspaper that Serbian authorities seem genuinely committed to arresting the Bosnian Serb general.
In other news, Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic said Wednesday that the government had not decided to dump the model of indictees' voluntary surrender to the UN tribunal. Earlier this week, Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus announced that all war crimes indictees would be arrested and extradited, since the "voluntary surrender" model was no longer working.

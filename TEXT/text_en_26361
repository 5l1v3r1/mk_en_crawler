STRASBOURG, France -- Several thousand Kurds protested in Strasbourg on Saturday (October 10th) demanding the release of jailed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdulah Ocalan, who is serving a life sentence in a Turkish prison. The protest was organised by French-based Kurdish associations, but was also attended by members of the Kurdish communities in Germany, Switzerland and other European countries. The PKK considered a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the EU and the United States. (AFP, MIA - 10/10/09)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In his first major step as High Representative in BiH, Miroslav Lajcak ordered the dismissal Tuesday (July 10th) of a senior Bosnian Serb police commander and the suspension of 36 officers suspected of involvement in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. Lajcak also ordered authorities to seize the passports of 93 officials under investigation for war crimes or for helping war crimes fugitives evade justice. Lajcak said he fired Dragomir Andan, deputy director of the Bosnian Serb police, to prevent him from using his position to help fugitives. Lajcak also announced that he imposed amendments to legislation that would make it more difficult for war crimes suspects to escape to neighbouring countries. A number of police officers will be investigated on charges of providing false testimony at war crimes trials in BiH and elsewhere. 
In other news, at least 30,000 people were expected to attend ceremonies Wednesday marking the 12th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre. Funerals are being held for 465 more victims whose remains were found in mass graves in the Srebrenica area.

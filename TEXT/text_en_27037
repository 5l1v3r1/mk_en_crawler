TIRANA, Albania -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn says the June general elections were the best ever held in modern Albania, local media reported on Wednesday (September 2nd). However, during his speech to the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee, he noted irregularities persist, and that he is awaiting a report from the OSCE's monitoring mission. Opposition Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama has sent a letter to President Bamir Topi listing a number of alleged irregularities. The SP may boycott next week's new parliament session over them.
As for the visa liberalisation process, Rehn said both Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina must meet set requirements in order for the European Commission to consider authorising visa-free travel next year. (Ora News, Shekulli, Top Channel, VOA - 02/09/09)

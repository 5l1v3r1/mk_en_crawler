TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu insisted Monday (24 November) that Prime Minister Fatos Nano appoint two cabinet ministers to posts which have been vacant for months. Moisiu said he considered the absence of two ministers to be unconstitutional. Following rejection of his nominees, Nano elevated two deputy ministers to the posts on a temporary basis. Moisiu has been severely criticised for failing to resolve the matter. (Albanian Daily News, ATA - 24/11/03)

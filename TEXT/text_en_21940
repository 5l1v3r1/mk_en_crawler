BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic said on Tuesday (October 21st) that Serbia wants "the historic conflict in Kosovo to be resolved with compromise and in peace". He stressed the international presence in Kosovo "must not jeopardise the vital interests of Serbs and Albanians living in the province". He added Serbia has no "issues" with the EU's mission in Kosovo, EULEX, provided it meets certain conditions: operates under a UN mandate, does not apply former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan viewing Kosovo as an independent state and is neutral regarding Kosovo's status. Tadic reiterated Serbia would not recognise Kosovo's independence and would defend its interests legally. "Meanwhile, we will secure our EU membership. No one in Europe is conditioning Serbia with recognition of Kosovo's independence." (FoNet, Beta, B92 - 21/10/08)

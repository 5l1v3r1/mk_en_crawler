THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic lodged an appeal Wednesday (March 10th) against the UN war crimes tribunal's refusal to delay his trial. Karadzic is now asking the appeals chamber to postpone his trial until June 17th, which he says would give his team the time it needs to prepare his defence. After other delays, he made an opening statement earlier this month but asked the court to wait until June to hear from the prosecution's first witnesses. The hearing has been adjourned pending the appeals procedure. (Dnevni Avaz, Fena, Tanjug - 10/03/10)

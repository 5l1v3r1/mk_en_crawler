TIRANA, Albania -- Police in the town of Gjirokastra arrested four suspected drug traffickers Monday (December 8th) in connection with 101kg of marijuana found earlier in an abandoned car near the Kakavija crossing at the Albanian-Greek border. Drug trafficking from Albania to Greece has increased since Tirana extended the moratorium on motorboats along the Albanian coast to fight Italy-bound trafficking.
In other news Monday, Albania marked the anniversary of the establishment of the 1990 student movement, which led to the collapse of the communist regime. Prime Minister Sali Berisha delivered a speech to thousands of students and youth gathered to celebrate the anniversary, which coincided with the National Day of Youth.

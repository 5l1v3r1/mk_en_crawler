ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament began the second and final round of debate on a constitutional reform package tabled by the ruling Justice and Development Party on Sunday (May 2nd). The round is expected to end on Thursday. The first round ended with all 30 amendments passed. The main opposition Republican People's Party, the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy party and the smaller opposition Democratic Leftist Party are refusing to attend these sessions, saying the amendments strip power from the courts. If each article in the package gets more than 330 votes in the second reading, the whole package will be subject to a public referendum. (Vatan, Hurriyet, Milliyet - 03/05/10; Reuters - 02/05/10)

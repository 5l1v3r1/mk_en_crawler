ATHENS, Greece -- Two motorcycle police officers were killed and two others were seriously injured on Tuesday (March 1st) in a shootout with suspects they were chasing. It happened in Athens as the suspects, in a stolen car, allegedly opened fire with a handgun and an automatic rifle. The car was later found deserted. Public Order Minister Christos Papoutsis said authorities cannot say at the moment whether the shooting was related to local terror groups. Initial investigations suggest either that or organised crime, he said. (NET TV, ANA-MPA, ERT, Nafthemporiki - 01/03/11)

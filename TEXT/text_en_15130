PODGORICA, Montenegro -- President Filip Vujanovic announced on Wednesday (30 August) that Montenegro has decided to end the draft and create instead a fully professional army. This is in line with efforts to meet NATO's Partnership for Peace programme membership requirements. General Jovan Lakcevic, chief of staff of the Montenegrin armed forces, said all conscripted soldiers will be discharged within a week. The country's new army will consist of 340 officers, 900 non-commissioned officers, 900 soldiers, and 260 civilians. Another 800 soldiers will be hired later.

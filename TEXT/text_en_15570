BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Bosniak caucus in the Republika Srpska (RS) Council of Peoples decided on Monday (24 July) not to pursue a "protection mechanism" that could have hampered the privatisation of Telekom Srpske. RS Parliament Speaker Igor Radojicic announced the move after a session of a joint commission of the RS Assembly and the Council. 
The caucus had raised objections to the privatisation process, saying it endangered the job security of Bosniak employees. RS deputies, however, accused their Bosniak counterparts of seeking to block the sale in order to benefit telcos in the Federation of BiH. (Nezavisne novine - 25/07/06; PBS BiH - 24/07/06)

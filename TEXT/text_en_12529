ANKARA, Turkey -- The European Commission's ambassador to Turkey, Hansjorg Kretschmer, said in a media interview Friday (6 May) that the country has a long way to go before it meets all criteria for EU membership. In particular, Kretschmer cited human rights protection, freedom of expression, and religious and women's rights as areas in need of improvement. He also reiterated that to start accession talks with the EU on 3 October as scheduled, Turkey must fulfil two obligations: adopt a new penal code and seal an enlarged customs union protocol with the EU.
On Sunday meanwhile, Italian Foreign Minister Gianfranco Fini was quoted in an interview as saying there is no link between France's possible rejection of the proposed EU Constitution and eventual Turkish membership in the Union. France holds a referendum on the constitution later this month. (Financial Times - 08/05/05; NTV - 06/05/05)

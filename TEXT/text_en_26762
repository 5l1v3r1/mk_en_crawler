TIRANA, Albania -- The Albanian Academy of Science has said the definitions of Albanians by their colleagues in Macedonia are not correct and are rather tendentious. The statement came after The Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts (MANU) published last month its first encyclopaedia, in which Albanians were described as "mountain people" and a nation descended in Macedonia together with the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century. In a reaction on Monday (October 5th), the Albanian academy estimated these views as nationalist.
"We understand that each historian has the right to have their own views, however incorrect facts and absurdities are intolerable for the Academy of Science," the Albanian institution said in a letter which claimed it had not commented the book earlier since it was waiting for an original copy of the Encyclopaedia. The publication has sparked reactions among Albanians in Macedonia, Tirana, and Kosovo as well as of the British and the US Embassies in Skopje. After a wave of criticism, the MANU decided to amend controversial texts. (Gazeta Shqiptare, Panorama - 06/10/09; Balkan Web - 05/10/09)

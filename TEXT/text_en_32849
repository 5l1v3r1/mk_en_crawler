BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- UNMIK head Michael Steiner spoke against the request of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic Sunday (2 February) to NATO to allow Serbian security forces to return to Kosovo. Djindjic's proposal was prompted by reports that KFOR is planning to reduce its troops. Steiner asserted that the UN Security Council resolution on Kosovo allows only UNMIK and KFOR to operate in the province and explicitly prohibits the entry of any other armies. It foresees the return of only a limited number of Serbian or Yugoslav forces. (Tanjug, B92, FoNet, BBC - 02/02/03)

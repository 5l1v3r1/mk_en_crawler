SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Deputy High Representative Ivan Busniak on Wednesday (October 24th) sent clarifications to the Republika Srpska (RS) government regarding High Representative Miroslav Lajcak's latest set of measures aimed at strengthening and facilitating the performance of state-level institutions. Busniak says the explanations prove that none of the measures violate the Dayton Peace Accord, as RS officials had complained. Last Friday, Lajcak announced changes in a number of laws related to the Council of Ministers and the BiH parliament that simplify decision-making mechanisms, making them less dependent on the number of officials actually attending sessions.

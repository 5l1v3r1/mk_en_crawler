ANKARA, Turkey -- Justice Minister Cemil Cicek on Sunday (February 25th) criticised the release of eight terror suspects connected to the Kurdistan Workers Party who were being held in France. A court decided on Friday to free eight of the 15 people -- 14 Turks and one Australian citizen -- arrested in a major security sweep near Paris region earlier this month. All of them -- of Kurdish origin -- are prohibited from leaving Paris until proceedings are under way. Cicek says releasing the eight suggests a lack of sufficient co-operation from Europe in combating terrorism. 
In other news, Ankara media reported that Turkish authorities detained two more people at the weekend, in connection with the murder last month of Turkish Armenian journalist Hrant Dink. They were arrested in the Black Sea city of Trabzon, home of the six other suspects in the case. (Zaman, Focus - 26/02/07; AFP, NTV - 23/02/07)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Russia's envoy to BiH admitted on Wednesday (16 March) that a Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect may have hidden in Russia for years under a fake name before surrendering to the UN tribunal a few days ago. Ambassador Alexander Grishchenko said Gojko Jankovic could have entered Russia illegally, given what he described as lax visa regulations. He also revealed that the top international representative to BiH, Paddy Ashdown, has requested a meeting to discuss Jankovic's case. The admission came following a report in The Guardian, which said several war crimes indictees might be hiding in Russia. Thursday's Dnevni avaz reported that another fugitive, Dragan Zelenovic, has been in Russia and occasionally in Belarus. (Dnevni avaz - 17/03/05; AP, Fena - 16/03/05)

TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Socialistic Party launched campaign preparations Saturday (5 April) for the local elections this autumn. At a national meeting, party leader and Prime Minister Fatos Nano presented the government plan for fiscal decentralisation in 2004, calling it "the European future of the local government". The reform aims to provide more financial independence, including ownership transfer rights, to the newly elected local governors. In addition it will determine tax revenues distribution and fund transfers from central to local budgets. (Shekulli - 06/04/03, ATA- 05/04/03)

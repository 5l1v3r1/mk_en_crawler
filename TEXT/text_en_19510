SKOPJE, Belgrade -- Tetovo police discovered 18 hand-held rocket launcher missiles and 33 gunpowder charges on Thursday (November 22nd), Macedonian media reported on Friday. A police spokesperson said the munitions were discovered close to the village of Prsce, near Tetovo. This is where Xhavid Morina, a former Kosovo Liberation Army commander who escaped from the Dubrava prison last August, was killed a few weeks ago. It is also the same area where police performed the massive operation "Mountain Storm" two weeks ago, during which six members of an Albanian armed criminal gang were killed and a dozen others were arrested. Police said "enough weapons to arm 650 men" were seized in that operation. (Tanjug, B92 - 24/11/07; Makfax, A1 - 23/11/07)

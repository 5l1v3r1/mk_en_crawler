BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko met on Thursday (February 11th) in Banja Luka with Bosnian Serb political leaders about the ongoing political stalemate and issues related to state and military property. He warned that parties that backed the new law on referendums in Republika Srpska (RS) will be held responsible for its consequences. Inzko said that in light of the situation in BiH, any referendum could be considered a provocation and could endanger the basic principles of the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement, as well as international law.

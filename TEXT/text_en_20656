SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A key witness in the trial against former Bosnian Muslim army commander Rasim Delic says Mujahideen units that fought in the Bosnian conflict were controlled and commanded by al-Qaeda. Bahraini-born Ali Ahmed Ali HamadÂ¸ who is serving a 12-year sentence in BiH for carrying out a bomb attack, said the Army of BiH was in close contact with the Mujahideen fighters. "We received orders only from our Mujahideen chiefs but this does not mean that we acted on our own, rather in coordination with the Bosnian Army, after our officers agreed," he told the court.
Delic, whose trial started on July 9th, is accused of allowing the Mujahideen under his authority to murder, torture and rape Serb and Croat prisoners and civilians. A three-day hearing in the case started Friday (September 7th) at the BiH war crimes chamber. Judges from the UN war crimes tribunal flew to Sarajevo for the proceedings, marking the first time such a hearing has been conducted outside The Hague.

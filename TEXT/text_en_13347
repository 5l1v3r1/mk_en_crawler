PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Florence Hartmann, spokeswoman for the UN tribunal's prosecution, said on Friday (26 August) that following the example of the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Serbia-Montenegro Army should call on top indictees Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic to surrender. Hartmann told local Montenegrin IN TV that such a move would represent direct support for federal authorities' efforts to implement its international obligations.
In other news, neither Hague prosecutors nor Moscow are confirming reports that Bosnian Serb war crimes indictee Dragan Zelenovic was detained in Russia last week. He is charged with crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war for his alleged role in the detention, torture and sexual assault, including rape, of Bosnian Muslim women and girls in the town of Foca in 1992-1993.

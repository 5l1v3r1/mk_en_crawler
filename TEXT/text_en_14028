THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte presents her new report assessing the individual former Yugoslav republics' level of co-operation Thursday (15 December). During a news conference Wednesday, her adviser, Anton Nikiforov, said the document would again be critical of Serbia-Montenegro for failing to arrest and extradite the remaining indictees, including Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic. Nikiforov also cited a lack of full co-operation regarding access to documents. Serbia-Montenegro's national council for co-operation with the war crimes tribunal was scheduled to meet on Thursday to determine how to get Mladic's original military file to Hague prosecutors.
In other news, prosecutors announced that two senior Serbian judicial officials -- Supreme Court judge Ljubomir Vuckovic and Deputy Special Prosecutor Milan Radovanovic -- have been charged in connection with organised crime. At issue was the case against notorious mafia boss Zoran Jotic. (Danas - 15/12/05; Beta, RTS - 14/12/05)

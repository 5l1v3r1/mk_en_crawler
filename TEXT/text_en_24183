BELGRADE, Serbia -- War crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic told members of Belgrade's Jewish community Monday (April 13th) that Serbia will request the extradition of Peter Egner from the United States. Egner, 87, allegedly committed genocide and war crimes against civilians, mostly Jews, in Belgrade during World War II. Prosecutors say that as a Gestapo officer in 1941 and 1942, Egner established and worked in several concentration camps in Belgrade and participated in the executions of civilians, including women and children.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Opposition representatives said on Sunday (January 11th) that the quality of life has not improved in Kosovo over the past year, despite claims to that effect by the government. Berim Remosaj, of the Democratic League of Dardania, said corruption levels, high unemployment rates, nepotism and other problems are clear indicators of the economic situation. Ibrahim Makolli of the Alliance for a New Kosovo said the government lacked both vision and a programme. "The situation is the same as it was," he said. The government cited in its own defence the declaration of independence, international recognition, the paving of 600km of roads and investments in northern Mitrovica.
In other news Sunday, Kosovo Security Force (KSF) Commander General Sylejman Selimi said building the KSF in compliance with NATO standards and making it operational in the first half of this year are the main challenges ahead. If successful, "this force will be capable of performing operations outside Kosovo as long as NATO asks for this," Selimi said. The KSF is expected to appoint its command structure and recruit new members this month. (Zeri, Koha Ditore, Telegrafi - 12/01/09; RTK, Express - 11/09/01)

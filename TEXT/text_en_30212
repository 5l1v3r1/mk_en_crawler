ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Hundreds of Kurds gathered in Istanbul and southeast Turkey on Monday (May 16th) to protest the army's killing of 12 Kurdish rebels last week. Kurdish politician Hasip Kaplan said several bodies have been found in the mountainous regions of the Sirnak province. Previously, the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party accused the ruling Justice and Development Party of trying to secure more votes in the June 12th parliamentary elections through these actions.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Outgoing Croatian President Stipe Mesic said on Friday (January 8th) that Serbia should stop nourishing "unrealistic dreams" that Kosovo could return to its territory. He also urged Belgrade to stop calling on the Serb minority in the young country to boycott state institutions and elections. "It would be good to stop suggesting Kosovo citizens of Serb nationality refuse co-operation ... and in that way, deprive themselves of the right to decide the way they live," Mesic said in a speech to parliament in Pristina. "It would be good to stop stirring up unrealistic dreams that it is not over yet," Mesic added. He was making his last visit before his term ends in mid- February. Tadic said Mesic's comments harm relations with Serbia and provide an unnecessary burden to his successor. (MIA - 09/01/10; AFP - 08/01/10)

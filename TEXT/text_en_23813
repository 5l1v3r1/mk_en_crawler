ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, who leads the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), said on Tuesday (May 19th) he has not yet decided whether to run for president later this year. He was responding to media speculation that he plans to run, in light of the HDZ's strong showing in Sunday's local elections. It made solid inroads in areas dominated by its major rival, the opposition Social Democratic Party. Sanader says no final decision on HDZ's candidate is likely until September, allowing time for discussion over the summer. (HINA, HRT - 19/05/09)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica officially nominated Ivana Dulic-Markovic, of the junior government partner G17 Plus, as deputy prime minister Monday (19 June). She has been serving as agriculture minister. The post of deputy prime minister has been vacant since May, when Miroljub Labus resigned over the EU's freezing of Stablisation and Association Agreement talks with Serbia, due to insufficient war crimes co-operation.

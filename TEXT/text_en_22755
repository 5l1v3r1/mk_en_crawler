NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders will decide on July 25th whether to move to direct reunification talks, Greek Cypriot President Demetris Christofias said on Tuesday (July 8th) at a press conference in Nicosia. During a meeting at the end of this month, Christofias and his Turkish Cypriot counterpart, Mehmet Ali Talat, will make the final assessment of the preparatory teams' work. Both sides favour a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation, but there is still disagreement over governance, sovereignty, property and other issues.
On Tuesday, Christofias met with the Council of Europe's (COE) commissioner for human rights, Thomas Hammarberg, who was also planning to meet Talat and representatives of several NGOs.

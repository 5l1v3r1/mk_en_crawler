SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The country's Agency for Nuclear Regulation (ANR) said on Tuesday (October 10th) that inspectors have determined a major incident was avoided at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant. At the weekend, plant managers announced that a radioactive leak had been discovered inside the 1,000-megawatt sixth reactor. They reassured the public that there was no danger. ANR chief Sergey Tsochev says that if the problem had been discovered even a few days later or the leak was bigger, the situation would have been far more serious. (Monitor, Sega - 11/10/06)

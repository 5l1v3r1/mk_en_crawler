NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas said Friday (6 February) that he would travel to New York for renewed talks on the reunification of Cyprus. He noted that this would be a preliminary meeting and that no decision has been made on whether actual negotiations would begin. Denktas said he would write to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to lay out his objections to some of the conditions for resumption of talks. Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul also indicated that Ankara was not satisfied with certain procedural issues and has asked the United States to help iron out the differences with the UN. Greek Cypriot leaders announced Saturday that they, too, would be sending a delegation to New York. (AFP - 07/02/04; AP, AFP, Reuters - 06/02/04)

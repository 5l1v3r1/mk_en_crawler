SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The deadline for Macedonia's ruling coalition partners -- the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia and the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) -- to agree on a controversial draft law on administrative division expires Monday (12 July). Unless an agreement is reached and the draft law is adopted at the government's session today, the local elections scheduled for this autumn will likely be postponed by six months.
On Saturday meanwhile, DUI leader Ali Ahmeti met with Albanian President Alfred Moisiu to discuss decentralisation and other issues. They agreed that full implementation of the Ohrid Peace Agreement is a key factor for stability. (Makfax - 12/07/04)

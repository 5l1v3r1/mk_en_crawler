BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso said Wednesday (15 June) that the commission would be very precise and demanding in the future analyses of Bulgaria and Romania's progress in meeting membership criteria. In an interview with France's 3 TV, Barroso said the EC hopes it would be able to confirm progress in both countries' accession processes and that they would enter the EU in January 2007, as scheduled. He did not, however, rule out the activation of a safeguard clause that would postpone entry by one year, should any commitments go unmet. 
Barroso also said Wednesday that the EU should adhere to its commitments to Turkey. Ahead of a crucial summit of EU leaders in Brussels that opens Thursday, the EC president stressed that the Union could review its capacity to expand but should keep promises already made.

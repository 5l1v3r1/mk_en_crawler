PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci on Wednesday (July 22nd) sent a letter to EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon about reports that the mission is holding talks with Serbia on judicial matters, including police and customs. "I have not seen the drafts of these [meeting] minutes and I have not been officially informed by the EULEX mission that such discussions are taking place," the letter said. Kuci also insisted that Kosovo be completely informed of any such discussions between EULEX and Serbia. Later on Wednesday, Kuci met with de Kermabon who assured him no negotiations have taken place.
Separately Wednesday, EULEX officially transferred its anti-terrorism responsibilities to the Kosovo Police counterterrorism unit. (Zeri, Koha Ditore, Kosova Sot - 23/07/09; RTK, Kohavision - 22/07/09)

MITROVICA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The worst clash between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo in over a year left at least two Albanians dead and several injured Wednesday (17 March) in the ethnically divided city of Mitrovica. Shootings were still being reported two hours after UN police and NATO peacekeepers moved in, using teargas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters and setting up a roadblock on the bridge separating the two communities.Tensions flared after two Albanian boys drowned in the Ibar after allegedly being hounded by Serbs. A third child is still missing.
In a separate incident near Pristina, several hundred Serbs set a car ablaze and threw stones at UN police in KFOR in a riot that erupted after Serb teenager was shot and wounded late Monday. The protesters also blocked the main road between Pristina and Skopje, demanding an investigation and the reinstatement of checkpoints near the village. The 19-year-old victim, Jovica Imvic, was rushed to hospital with gunshot wounds. The government of Serbia-Montenegro has filed a formal protest with the UN Security Council in New York.

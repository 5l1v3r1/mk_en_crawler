2. Please provide a short description highlighting the current energy situation including the organisation of the sector. Do current energy prices reflect the costs (electricity, gas, heat, coal, oil)? Please give an overview of main energy prices and compare them with their costs. How has the privatisation process developed in the sector and what are the perspectives (please provide information per sub-sector)? Is the organisation of collection of (energy) statistics satisfactory in order to reply to reporting requirements of the EU in the energy (sub)sectors? 
Energy Situation The energy balance of the Republic of Macedonia includes electricity, natural gas, liquid fuels, solid fuels and geothermal energy. The average total consumption of energy in the Republic of Macedonia on an annual level is around 120.000 . Within the primary energy consumption, crude oil participates with 30%, coal with 51,6%, natural gas with 3%, and the remaining around 15% are hydro energy, fire-wood and geothermal energy. The total consumption of energy is provided by around 60% of domestic production and 40% from import. The basic energy infrastructure in the Republic of Macedonia includes the following: electricity power system, coal mines, gas pipeline system, an oil refinery, oil pipeline, thermal and geothermal systems. The total installed capacity for electricity production is 1.485 MW, with annual production of around 6 billion kWh, 1.000 MW of which are from thermal power plants with annual production of 5 billion kWh (excluding TEP "Negotino"), and 480 MW are from hydro power plants with annual production of around 1 billion kWh. In the Republic of Macedonia there are no oil deposits. All crude oil originates from import and is transported from Thessaloniki (Greece) to the refinery in Skopje (Macedonia) through an oil pipeline with capacity of 2,5 billion tonnes per year. The average annual consumption of oil derivatives is approximately 800.000 tonnes. Coal used in the Republic of Macedonia is lignite (heating value of 6.500-8.000 kJ/kg, with 0,5-1,5% contents of sulphur and 8-25% of ashes). The largest coal mines are part of thermo electricity plants and that coal is used for electricity production (around 7 million tonnes per year), and around 200.000 tonnes per year of coal from other smaller mines is used for satisfying the needs of industrial consumers and households. Gas pipeline system of the Republic of Macedonia has capacity of 800 million m per year. The main transmission gas pipeline is around 98 km long, stretching from the border with the Republic of Bulgaria to Skopje. So far, the main gas pipeline branches to the cities have been built with length of 26 km and the distribution gas network with length of 31,5 km.  Currently, in the Republic of Macedonia five district heating systems are operational with total capacity of 600 MW, powered by heavy oil, natural gas and lignite. Currently, around 50.000 households are connected to these heating systems. The geothermal energy participates with about 0,3% in the total consumption of energy. Activities and organisation Pursuant to the Energy Law (“Official Gazette of RM“ No 47/97, 40/99, 98/00, 94/02 and 38/03), see 14_Annex_01, the following activities are related to this area: (1) production, transmission and distribution of electricity, (2) production and processing of coal, (3) production, processing and transport of oil and oil derivates, (4) production, processing and distribution of natural gas, (5) production, transport and distribution of thermal and geothermal energy, (6) production of other types of energy, (7) transit of energy and energy sources and (8) trade of energy and energy sources. In the context of sub point (6), exploitation of solar energy, wind power and energy obtained from biomass is considered as production and exploitation of other types of energy. Supply of energy and energy sources is defined as delivery or sale of energy or energy sources to the consumers. These activities can be performed by domestic and foreign legal and natural entities, based on a licence issued by the Energy Regulatory Commission, in a procedure which is to be regulated with a special regulation in the first quarter of 2005. Activities referred to in sub points (1), (4) and (5) above are activities of public interest and for these activities public enterprises may be established. Public enterprises under (1) and (2) are founded by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, and public enterprises for production, transport and distribution of thermal and geothermal energy may also be founded by municipalities or the city of Skopje. According to the Law on State Administrative Bodies Organization and Performance (“Official Gazette of RM” No 58/00 and 44/02), energy field related issues are performed by the Ministry of Economy. In that context, as a corresponding public administration body from the energy field, a Sector for Energy and Mineral Raw Materials is established in the Ministry, with a Unit for Electricity Power System and Investments, and a Unit for Fossil Fuels and Energy Efficiency. Bodies within the Ministry of Economy, as Bureau for Metrology, State Inspectorate for Technical Inspection, and State Market Inspectorate, as well as independent ones, as Standardization Institute and Accreditation Institute, have corresponding competencies in the energy field. The Sector for Energy and Mineral Raw Materials, within the Ministry of Economy, works on energy-related matters pertaining to: 1.  Preparation of laws, secondary legislation and other regulations, and monitoring of their enforcement; 2.  Preparation and adoption of strategic development documentation; 3. Investment activities; 4.  Transformation of the public (state) sector; 5.  Participation in, and coordination of, international projects in the country and abroad; 6.  Preparation of energy balances and monitoring of their realisation; 7.  Monitoring of energy supply and activities in the energy field by following the variations of prices, operating conditions and economical and financial operations of the public utilities, and by proposing appropriate measures; 8.  Bilateral and multilateral international cooperation and implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union; and 9.  Other modes of cooperation with state administration bodies, other organisations and institutions. Pursuant to the Energy Law, in June 2003 the Energy Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Macedonia was founded. The Energy Regulatory Commission is independent in its operations and decision-making within the framework of authorities determined by the Law. The five members of the Energy Regulatory Commission are appointed and relieved of duty by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, upon a proposal of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. The operation of the Energy Regulatory Commission is financed from own sources of funds provided through collection of fees from the total income of energy-related operators and from collection of charges for the issued licenses. Except in cases when confidential information or business secrets are being discussed, the sessions of the Energy Regulatory Commission are public, and its decisions are published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia. According to the Energy Law, the Energy Regulatory Commission, among other things, performs the following important tasks:   Ensures reliable, continued and high quality supply of energy;   Promotes the competition at the energy market;   Prescribes conditions of supply of individual types of energy;   Prescribes pricing methodologies of individual types of energy;   Prescribes tariff systems of individual types of energy;   Brings decisions on prices of individual types of energy, according to the Methodology of Pricing, tariff systems of individual types of energy and other legal regulations;   Issues, modify and withdraw licences and follows licence execution of individual activities in the energy area;   Prescribes rules for connection to energy networks;   Promotes protection of the energy consumers' rights;   Initiates adoption of laws and other regulations from the field of energy;   Participates in resolving of disputes and proposes measures on disputes;   Submits proposals to competent authorities for undertaking measures, according to their competencies and in a procedure prescribed by law, against the entities perform their activities contrary to this Law.  Within the Economic Chamber of Macedonia, an Energy Board is established, which organises public debates in regards to legal and development documents related to interests of the companies. Prices and costs of energy According to the Methodology on Pricing of Individual Types of Energy (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 43/98 and 08/01), see 14_Annex_07, prices are established and controlled for the following energy types:  Electricity;  Natural gas;  Thermal energy;  Geothermal energy; and  Oil derivatives. Basic elements of pricing of the above-stated energies, according to the Methodology, are as follows: 1. Normalised costs  depreciation  insurance   day-to-day maintenance, overhauls and maintenance services   expenses for materials, energy, spare parts and consumables  gross salaries   services of others except production services for regular maintenance   concessions for exploitation of natural resources; 1.  Taxes and charges in connection with the financial results from the company operations; 2.  Other levies; and 3.  Profit, set at a level of 8% of the permanent value of the fixed assets and the permanent working assets. Control of the energy prices is generally performed once in 6 months. Price of energy can be changed if within a period of three months a change of costs occurs (normalised costs, taxes, charges and other levies) higher or lower than 5% of the current price. If an extreme change of the controlled costs occurs, the pricing control may be performed in shorter periods, i.e. within 15 workdays. Change of prices is initiated by energy companies. The Energy Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Macedonia (RCE) establishes the prices of oil derivatives every 14 days, taking into account the elements of the Methodology in Annex D of the Agreement on purchase of the Oil Refinery JSC OKTA Skopje. A proposal on changing the price of oil derivatives, according to the Methodology, is submitted by the Oil Refinery JSC OKTA Skopje to the Energy Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Macedonia. Calculation of the price of oil derivatives is performed on a basis of the average price of the BRENT crude oil according to "Platt’s Crude Oil Marketwire", including the costs for purchase, transport and company profit and the average exchange rate of MKD/USD of acquisition of the foreign currency in the previous 14-day controlled period. Thus, during the establishment and control of the oil derivatives' prices, the changes of real costs are taken into consideration, and therefore the prices for production and retail sale of oil derivatives approved by the Energy Regulatory Commission fully cover the expenses. The current retail price of the geothermal water of 30,35 Euro cents per cubic metre is fully covering the expenses. The average retail price of the thermal energy of 41,59 Euro cents per cubic metre in the remote heating is fully covering the expenses. The existing average retail price of electricity is 3,9 Euro cents per kWh and this price does not completely cover the expenses. The calculated average cost price for 1 kWh is 4,48 Euro cents. The price of natural gas is formed by JSC Makpetrol as a sole entity which manages the gas pipeline at the moment and that price is covering the expenses (for more details, please refer to answers to questions 14_II_B). The Energy Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Macedonia currently prepares a new tariff system on electricity, which shall be adopted in the first quarter of 2005. At the same time, there is ongoing work on preparation of methodology and tariff systems for natural gas, thermal and geothermal energy. The base model for establishment and control of prices of energy sources has an incentive based approach - by setting the highest level of revenues or profit, or the highest level of prices. Such an approach will enable:   Stimulation for improvement of efficiency;   Possibility of reducing the investment risk with setting the price path for the course of several years; and   Stimulation for presenting the real costs of the company. Electricity sector:  The electricity sector, since recently has been characterised with the dominant position of the vertically integrated company Joint Stock Company Electric Power Company of Macedonia for Production, Transmission and Distribution of Electricity in state ownership, which performed all basic and supporting activities of the supply of all consumers in the electricity system. Only an insignificant number of independent producers, which are part of certain industrial facilities and of some public enterprises for water management, were excluded. In December 2000 (“Official Gazette of RM” No 80/00) a court re-registration was made of the former Public Enterprise Electric Power Company of Macedonia (EPCM) into a Joint Stock Company (JSC) in state ownership, which enabled the process of its future transformation (restructuring and privatisation). In 2001, the administrative and expert basis was consolidated for starting this process, through preparation of the Project Terms of References (ToR), then, establishment of the Government Advisory Committee (the Committee) and the Steering Committee of the project, and selection of international expert advisor (the Consultant) of the Government in the process of restructuring and privatisation of JSC - EPCM. In 2002, in cooperation with JSC - EPCM, the Consultant - a consortium of eight companies led by "Meinl Bank" from Austria, prepared a Due Diligence or the operations of JSC - EPCM, which served as a basis of the database used in further modelling and directing of the restructuring and privatisation of this company. In 2003, in cooperation with many expert teams, the Consultant has prepared and the Government has adopted the following: (1) a Model on restructuring of the JSC - EPCM, and (2) a Plan on implementation of the restructuring of the JSC - EPCM. In March 2004, Law on Transformation of the Joint Stock Company Electric Power Company of Macedonia for Production, Transmission and Distribution of Electricity in State Ownership (“Official Gazette of RM” No 19/04), see 14_Annex_02, was adopted, which stipulates separation of this joint stock company in state ownership into two new companies: Joint Stock Company MEPSO for Transmission of Electricity and Operation of the Electrical Power System, which will remain in state ownership, and Joint Stock Company Electric Power Company of Macedonia for Production, Distribution and Supply of Electricity, (new), which could later enter into privatisation process upon decision and according to strategy adopted by the Government. According to this Law, the privatisation can be done: (1) dominantly, to a private strategic investor, and only in a transparent procedure on a public tender with pre-qualification phase; and (2) in a minority part - which means in a part which will not breach the managing rights of the private investor, to an international financial institutions, with direct agreement. In September 2004, the Government brought a Decision on separation of the JSC - EPCM with establishing the new companies in accordance with the abovementioned Law. On that basis, JSC - EPCM performed a legal procedure of separation which finished with closure of the existing vertically integrated joint stock company and registration of two new joint stock companies in state ownership on 31.12.2004. This means that since 01.01.2005, in the electricity sector of the Republic of Macedonia operate two completely independent companies, namely: (1) JSC - EPCM (new), for Production, Distribution and Supply of Electricity, and (2) JSC MEPSO, for Transmission of Electricity and Operation of the Electrical Power System . At the same time, a new technical, commercial and financial Due Diligence of JSC - EPCM (new) (the new company - without the transmission system) was performed, which will be updated regularly in the future. During 2005, the procedure of privatisation of JSC - EPCM (new) will be prepared - the Government will prepare and adopt a strategy on the assets and the percentage of shares which will be offered to the investor, the entire tender documentation will be prepared and its realisation will begin. In 2001 the common interest for cooperation between the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development from London (EBRD) in the transformation of the JSC - EPCM was acknowledged. In the recent period, many contacts were made, as well as suggestions and negotiations, which resulted in signing an Agreement in October 2004 on conditional, delayed purchase of stocks of JSC - EPCM in total amount of no more than 45 million EUR. During the forthcoming future privatisation of this Company or of certain parts thereof, EBOR will purchase minority shares of stocks in the parts that will be dominantly privatised by the strategic private investor. Then, the stocks will become ownership of the Bank, according to the conditions which will be accepted during the process of selection of the strategic investor and according to a discrete decision of the Bank in regards to the amount of the share and the parts JSC - EPCM of which stocks will be purchased. The payment will be performed in separate amounts (instalments) in the period between the signing of the Agreement and the realisation of the privatisation transaction. Every payment is conditioned by meeting certain previously determined achievements (milestones) of a certain segment of the reforms in the energy field, as an obligation of the Government in regards to the Athens Memorandum and the establishment of a regional energy market in Southeast Europe. The main conditions included into the milestones are the following: 1.  Adopting a Law that will regulate the restructuring and privatisation of JSC - EPCM, compliant to the corresponding EU Directives and Athens Memoranda; 2.  Separation of JSC - EPCM into two newly-registered companies, which will include founding of one independent transmission system operator, and accounting unbundling between the production and distribution, in accordance with the Directive 2003/54/EC; 3.  Adopting new primary legislation on electricity market, which will include regulation of the market by the Energy Regulatory Commission, in regards to liberalisation and competition; 4.  Implementation of the reforms anticipated in (1) and (3) above, and of the Plan for restructuring of JSC - EPCM; 5.  Determining the percentage which has been approved by EBRD as its participation in the privatisation and approval by the Bank of the Privatisation Strategy and pre-qualification criteria. 6.  Conclusion of a pre-qualification round resulting in at least two Investors being pre-qualified for the Privatisation of JSC - EPCM; and 7.  At least one pre-qualified Investor formally advises EBRD of serious interest in EBRD being a shareholder in JSC - EPCM and its agreement to enter into shareholder arrangements with EBRD.  Some of these conditions were fulfilled during 2004, after the establishment of the Energy Regulatory Commission and adoption of the Law on Transformation of JSC - EPCM The rest of the conditions, like the restructuring of JSC - EPCM, the new tariff system, the new Energy Law, successful management of the privatisation process etc., are planned to be completed during the year 2005. The whole process between the signing of the Agreement and the privatisation transaction has to last no more than 24 months. 
Gas supply sector Currently, the natural gas sector is built only around the transmission pipeline from the border with Bulgaria to Skopje. Only few industry facilities on the territory where this pipeline passes are connected to the pipeline. There is an ongoing procedure for determining the ownership rights to the gas pipeline among the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and JSC Makpetrol, and consecutive creation of institutional and legislative environment for operation of the system in compliance with the Directive 2003/55/EC. Furthermore, staged transposition and implementation of certain provisions from the Law of Energy and from secondary legislation will be put into practice. The same applies to harmonisation of provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty, the Energy Transit Protocol and the Athens Memoranda. District heating and geothermal sector Production, distribution and supply of thermal energy for heating are mainly done in Skopje and, to some extent, in Bitola. The fuel used is heavy oil and natural gas. Production and supply is performed by privately-owned companies. The owner of the distribution networks is the Privatisation Agency of the Republic of Macedonia, and they are leased to private operators. The district heating sector is completely private-owned. Geothermal energy is used for agricultural purposes (heating of greenhouses) in Vinica, Koani, Gevgelija and Strumica. In Koani it is also used for heating of some premises in the urban area. Exploitation, distribution and supply to the consumers in Koani are performed by a public enterprise. The other systems are run by privately-owned companies. The coal sector Coal (lignite) is mostly (around 98,5%) used as a primary fuel for production of electricity in the existing thermal power plants in Bitola and Oslomej. Exploitation and transport of this lignite are treated as part of the production process and are entirely a responsibility of the JSC - EPCM. The production of the industrial coal is privatised. The oil sector The Oil Refinery JSC OKTA Skopje has a dominant position, especially in production, transport and wholesale, and also performs a supply of oil derivatives in the Republic of Macedonia. Besides this company, JSC Makpetrol has a strategic position on the market of derivatives, too. Both companies are dominantly privately-owned. By signing the Agreement on purchase of shares and on concession in 1999 between the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and the JSC EL.P.ET. Balkanike (controlled by Hellenic Petroleum SA and Meton-Etep S.A.) as a Strategic Investor, 54,19% of the shares of Oil Refinery JSC OKTA Skopje were sold, and thus the Strategic Investor became a dominant owner of the Oil Refinery JSC OKTA - Skopje. With additional purchase of shares, this percentage increased to today's level of around 69,46%. With the selling of the Oil Refinery, and taking into account that the distribution of oil derivatives in the Republic of Macedonia is privately-owned, the oil sector is dominantly privatised. The idea for building a crude oil refinery dates from 1970's, as a result of the economic development in that period, with a purpose to cover the increased needs of the market in Macedonia, southern Serbia and Kosovo and to create a strong base for the petrochemical industry in Macedonia. The idea was realised in 1982. The Oil Refinery has installed capacity of 2.500.000 tonnes per year (56.610 BPSD). The following products are part of the product range: liquid gas, oil, regular and unleaded petrol, diesel fuels, heating fuel, oils and other derivatives. The Oil Refinery JSC OKTA consists of the required work units such as: department of electricity, water, oxygen and compressed air, quality control, storage and delivery, research and development department, fire department, etc. The Oil Refinery JSC OKTA has a quality and experienced staff, which is up to European and world standards. At the same time, the development projects are compatible with the new process technologies and adaptable to ones used in the EU. The research and development activity is aimed towards:   Enrichment of the range of products within the existing oil processing technology;   Improving the quality of the products and meeting the standards for protection of the environment;   Optimisation of the process of oil processing; and   Protection of the equipment from corrosion. Hellenic Petroleum is currently the largest industrial and commercial corporation in the region, with intensive investments in several new sectors. The basic activities of the corporation are: refinement of crude oil and production of oil derivatives, chemical and petrochemical products; trade and distribution of oil derivatives and petrochemical products; construction and operation of pipelines; research and development of new technologies; production, trade and marketing of other types of energy. The development strategy of Oil Refinery JSC OKTA stems from the need of further rational use of the installed capacity, its reconstruction and enlargement in the course of deepening the process of oil processing, reduction of rand man of heavy oil and production of higher quality products. Structure of the capital of JSC OKTA: Shares bought by employees 9,29% Subscribed shares with discount 3,43% Pension and Disability Insurance Fund of Macedonia 4,21% EL.P.ET. Balkanike 69,46% Privatisation Agency of the Republic of Macedonia 13,61% After the construction of the oil pipeline Thessaloniki-Skopje, when all pre-conditions for better exploitation of the installed capacity for processing of crude oil were met, JSC OKTA focused on development and improvement of trade and distribution of oil derivatives in Kosovo and Southern Serbia. Since 2002, Oil Refinery JSC OKTA Skopje commenced preparations on construction of product transmission line OKTA-Skopje-Serbia and Montenegro (Kosovo), which will provide fast, inexpensive and reliable transportation of the needed types and quantities of oil derivatives for the market of Kosovo. The product transmission line OKTA-Skopje-Serbia and Montenegro (Kosovo) will provide flow of 65 m/h of oil derivatives, directly to the existing storage facilities in Kosovo. Oil Refinery JSC OKTA Skopje also plans to commence construction of a second product transmission line towards Southern Serbia, and thus to became a serious player on that market, too. 
The realised production and sale of oil derivatives by Oil Refinery JSC OKTA Skopje in 2003 and in the period between 1.01.2004 and 30.09.2004 is: Derivative type Quantities of oil derivatives produced by JSC OKTA in 2003 (in tonnes) Quantities of oil derivatives sold by JSC OKTA to JSC Makpetrol in 2003 (in tonnes) Quantities of oil derivatives sold by JSC OKTA to others in 2003 (in tonnes)

Except for the Oil Refinery JSC OKTA Skopje, which has a primary activity of processing crude oil and production of derivatives, in the domain of oil derivatives import and retail market supply the private trade company JSC Makpetrol holds a notable position, having its own distribution network of around 120 petrol stations. 
The realised production and sale of oil derivatives and natural gas by JSC Makpetrol in 2003 is: Derivative type Quantities of oil derivatives obtained from JSC OKTA in 2003 (in tonnes) Quantities of oil derivatives (in tonnes) and natural gas (in 10

JSC Makpetrol did not export any energy sources in year 2003. 
Collecting and processing of statistical data The collection of statistical data in the energy area is organised on a satisfactory level and the State Statistics Office has an intention to respond fully to EU requests for information about the energy sub-sectors. The grouping of statistical data was made in the pilot-project between EUROSTAT and the State Statistics Office in 1999 and 2000, which provided harmonisation of the statistics in the energy area in the countries of Southeast Europe. The harmonisation of the energy statistics was made according to international recommendations by UN, EUROSTAT and IEA. They are fully compliant to the annual energy questionnaires which are common for these institutions, and comprise of 5 segments: (1) electricity and heat; (2) coal; (3) oil and oil derivatives; (4) natural gas; and (5) renewables and waste materials. The data on consumption of energy by sub-sectors is grouped according to the recommendations of EUROSTAT on the energy balance. 
3. Please provide information on your energy strategy documents (energy policy, energy saving or policies in sub-sectors) and legislation on energy matters. If possible the strategy documents and legislation relating to government policy for the energy sector should be provided (in one of the official EU languages). A short summary of the reports and legislative acts would be appreciated. Both for reports and legislative acts, your country is invited to specify which report/act of legislation corresponds with which EU strategy or EU legal act (please provide this information for all questions related to energy). What is the general assessment on their (non-)compatibility with energy strategies and legislation of the EU? 
There are many documents related to the Energy Sector of the Republic of Macedonia (concerning development, strategy and legislative). Some of them have been adopted, and some of them are in preparation phase, as follows. According to the Energy Law (“Official Gazette of RM“ No 47/97, 40/99, 98/00, 94/02 and 38/03), see 14_Annex_01, and for the purpose of development of the energy sector in the Republic of Macedonia, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia shall prepare a Strategy on Long-term Development of the Energy Sector in the Republic of Macedonia, which is a responsibility of the Ministry of Economy. Funds for preparation of the Strategy are provided from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia and from other sources. The Strategy should include relevant research in the area of resources, a number of scenarios on economic development and corresponding forecast on the energy requirements. Furthermore, the most important, the Strategy should also include analyses on the potential facilities and a prioritization of facilities which should be built in the corresponding period. The analyses should be done from the technical, financial and other points of view, then considering required funds and financial plan for their acquiring, organizational structure, environmental concerns, etc. Up to this date, the Strategy on Development of the Energy Sector is still not completed. However, other documents are prepared, namely studies, analyses, development plans and other documents related to the energy sector, especially in the electricity sector. In 1997 a National Strategy on Economic Development was prepared, part of which referred to the overall directions on development opportunities of the energy sector of the Republic of Macedonia in the future period. In 2000 (with technical and financial support of USAID) a Strategy on Development of the Energy Sector of Macedonia was prepared. Because of its ampleness and completeness, it was accepted as a potential plan on development of the Electricity Sector of the Republic of Macedonia. This Plan includes descriptions of the characteristics of the existing energy infrastructure, parameters of the potential electricity sources, estimated increase of electricity consumption and scenarios on possible development of the Electricity Sector. For the purpose of planning the electrical power system of the Republic of Macedonia, a Study on least-cost development until 2020 was prepared. The Study includes a prediction of the growth of electricity consumption in the Republic of Macedonia for the period until 2020 (three scenarios), analysis of the existing power production facilities and of potential production facilities, research on optimal development plan of the production part of the power system with least operating and investment costs. In 2001 the Joint Stock Company Electric Power Company of Macedonia (JSC – EPCM) prepared a development plan on building, rehabilitation and modernization of the production, transmission, and distribution facilities for the period until 2015, which includes restructuring the electricity sector of the Republic of Macedonia, projection of the electricity needs, production capacities of the existing production facilities, building of new production facilities, new mining facilities, rehabilitation and modernization of the existing production facilities, building, rehabilitation and modernization of the power network, development of the energy management system (EMS) and telecommunications in the power system, structure and time schedule of the funds necessary for building and rehabilitation of the power facilities until 2015 and financial sources of support for the development plan until 2015. In 2004 the World Bank prepared an Energy Policy Paper of the Republic of Macedonia which contains forecast of the electricity needs and possibilities of their fulfilment until 2009, investments in the electricity sector, energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, development of the power market, restructuring of the JSC – EPCM, the sector of gas, the sector of oil, etc.  In 1999, in compliance with the Energy Law, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia established a Programme on efficient energy use in the Republic of Macedonia until 2020, see 14_Annex_10. The Programme identifies the possibilities of more efficient energy use in Macedonia and establishes a base of efficient energy use policy. Additionally, it contains informational and educational activities on increasing the energy efficiency, measures for stimulating increased energy efficiency, legislative and other measures for increasing the energy efficiency, activities on fulfilling obligations from international agreements concerning increased energy efficiency. In October 2004 the Government accepted a Strategy on energy efficiency in the Republic of Macedonia until 2020 see 14_Annex_09. Basic goals of this strategy are: defining the points and possibilities of energy savings in the Republic of Macedonia by categories of consumers, by types of energy and by its purpose; creating financial possibilities for support of the activities concerning efficient energy use; providing appropriate investment and technical documentation; efficient organization of the providers of this activity in the Republic of Macedonia; co-relating environmental aspects of the energy use; adopting legal and other stimulations for increased implementation of projects from this area. Part of the Strategy is the implementation plan, which contains activities to be undertaken in the future period concerning energy efficiency, providers of those activities and their time table. The Energy Law (“Official Gazette of RM“ No 47/97, 40/99, 98/00, 94/02 and 38/03),establishes conditions and mode of operation in the energy sector, protection of energy installations, machines and facilities, protection of environment and nature from harmful influence caused by operation of energy facilities. The Law defines the activities in the energy sector, delivery of particular types of energy by energy systems, connection to energy systems upon acquiring Energy Consent, licensing, etc. In order to establish conditions for secure, sustained and quality energy supply, greater reliability, transparency and security in operation of existing and in building new facilities for production, transmission and distribution of energy, as well as energy market development, in compliance with the Energy Law, an Independent Energy Regulatory Commission of Republic of Macedonia was established. The competences of the Energy Regulatory Commission are as follows: providing conditions for secure, continuous and quality energy supply at minimum costs; prescribing tariff systems for individual types of energy; prescribing conditions of supply of individual types of energy; deciding on prices of individual types of energy in compliance with the Methodology of pricing, tariff systems of individual types of energy and other legal acts; issuing, modifying and withdrawing licenses for individual activities in the energy field; evaluating execution of the licenses; initiating and suggesting, through competent institutions, new laws and regulations from the energy field - and accordingly, providing opinions on laws, regulations and other acts from the energy field; taking participation in resolution of disputes and proposing measures concerning disputes; adopting regulations and other acts in compliance with the law.  Pursuant to the existing Energy Law the following secondary legislation was adopted:   Methodology on Pricing of Individual Types of Energy (electricity, thermal energy, geothermal energy and oil derivatives), (“Official Gazette of RM” No 43/98 and 08/01), see 14_Annex_07  Conditions on delivery of appropriate energy type to the energy systems: electricity (“Official Gazette of RM” No 06/01), natural gas (“Official Gazette of RM No 36/99), thermal energy (“Official Gazette of RM” No 28/89 and 47/89);   Tariff systems for sale of individual types of energy: electricity (“Official Gazette of RM” No 45/82, 15/83, 22/88, 29/89, 28/92 and 24/99), thermal energy (“Official Gazette of RM” No 51/97, 26/99 and 80/00) and geothermal energy (“Official Gazette of RM” No 07/01); and   Decision on the criteria and conditions for limiting the use of individual types of energy (electricity and oil derivatives), (“Official Gazette of RM” No 22/83). It is generally considered that this law is not compatible with the EU legislative, except for the parts concerning energy transit and trade, which are in compliance with the Energy Charter upon passing the amendments on the Law in 2000 (“Official Gazette of RM” No 98/00), and except for founding and functioning of Energy Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Macedonia compliant to the Directives No. 2003/54/EC and 2003/55/EC which superseded the Directives No. 96/92/EC and 98/30/EC, upon passing the amendments on the Law in 2002 and 2003 (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 94/02 and 38/03). The Law on Transformation of the Joint Stock Company Electric Power Company of Macedonia for Production, Transmission and Distribution of Electricity in State Ownership (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 19/04), see 14_Annex_02, was adopted in order to provide for implementation of the Government policy for reforms in the electricity sector, by complying with the economic principles of efficient and effective operation through commercialization, staged liberalization and controlled deregulation, and by implementation of competitive market criteria, through providing of conditions for secure and safe supply of power to the consumers and stable operation of the electric power system, as well as providing the necessary conditions for possible transparent and non-discriminatory access of parties to the power transmission network and conditions for transparent, non-discriminatory and fair privatization of the power sector.  This law regulates the transformation of the Joint Stock Company Electric Power Company of Macedonia for Production, Transmission and Distribution of Electricity in State Ownership by separating the Company into two new state-owned companies (Joint Stock Company Electric Power Company of Macedonia for Production, Distribution and Supply of Electricity, and, Joint Stock Company MEPSO for Transmission of Electricity and Operation of the Electrical Power System), which in effect means a separation of the transmission function from production and distribution functions, and providing a legal base for possible future privatization of the production and distribution parts of the current integrated company. The Law is compatible with the requirement for unbundling of vertically integrated power utilities, contained in the Directive 2003/54/EC. The following legal acts are in preparation phase: a) New Energy Law The Energy Law is one of the fundamental laws which shall affect the further economic development of the country. This complex law, which will be fully in compliance with the European legislative, will define numerous energy issues. Some of the more important ones are: energy policy and planning of energy development together with preparation of a strategy for complex and long-term energy development, and supervising the implementation of the strategy; creating conditions for the energy market (electricity and natural gas) and defining the market rules; transit of energy through energy systems and their use by interested domestic and foreign entities; defining the conditions for energy functions in terms of production, transmission and distribution of energy in market economy; creating conditions for higher level of investment activity in the energy sector, with as high as possible involvement of foreign capital, continued and quality supply of all types of energy to the consumers, according to the energy balances; defining rules for higher level of participation of renewable sources in the energy consumption of the country, increasing the energy efficiency, reducing the negative impact of energy sector to the environment; etc. In the current preparation phase, a need for compliance with the following directives was identified: 2003/54/EC and 2003/55/EC on common rules for the internal markets of electricity and natural gas and the Regulation 1228/2003 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border trading of electricity; 68/414/EEC, amended by 98/93/EC, on maintaining minimal stocks of crude oil and oil derivatives; 73/238/EC on mitigating difficulties in supply of crude oil and oil derivatives; 2004/8/EC on the promotion of cogeneration based on a useful heat demand in the internal energy market and amending the Directive 92/42/EEC; 2001/77/EC on promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources; 2003/30/EC on promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport; 2002/91/EC on the energy performance of buildings; This Law shall be adopted in 2005.  b) Law on Electricity Market Currently, a new model of the electricity market of the Republic of Macedonia is in preparation which will serve as a basis for preparation of the Law on Electricity Market of the Republic of Macedonia. At the same time, this Law shall provide a basis for meeting the requirements of the Athens Memoranda and the Energy Community Treaty. Apart from the relations in the electricity sector, which are set out by the existing Energy Law, like the question of participants and functions in the sector, provisions and criteria for operating different functions, safety of operation, tariff conditions, role and competences of the Energy Regulatory Commission, the Law will also set out matters about liberalization of the market, role and protection of competition, international electricity, criteria on investments in electricity sector, relations and obligations in the regulated part of the market, principles of sustainable development of the electricity sector etc. The Directive 85/337/C amended by the Directive 97/11/C on assessment of the impact of public and private projects on the environment was implemented in the new Law on Environment, which is in parliamentary procedure, and will be adopted in the first quarter of 2005. The Directive 93/12/EEC, amended by Directive 1999/32/EC on Reduction of the Sulphur Content in Certain Liquid Fuels is implemented in the Law on Environmental Air Quality (“Official Gazette of RM” No 67/04), which contains a basis for Rulebook on Quality of Liquid Fuels, to be composed by the Ministry of Economy. The Directive 2001/80/EC on limitation of certain air pollutants will be implemented by secondary legislation which will be adopted on the basis of the Law on Environmental Air Quality (“Official Gazette of RM” No 67/04). Namely, the limit emission values from each thermal power plant will be determined by environmental license, which will be issued by the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning, based on the Law on Environment. The Directive 79/409/EEC on the Conservation of Wild Birds will be implemented by secondary legislation which will be adopted on the basis of the Law on Nature Conservation (“Official Gazette of RM” No 67/04). This Law shall be compatible with Directive 2003/54/EC and shall be adopted in 2005. c) Law on Establishing Energy Agency of the Republic of Macedonia For the purpose of successful and timely implementation of reforms in the energy sector, preparation and impact assessment of strategic documents in the energy sector, strengthening the development of the energy sector in Republic of Macedonia, establishment of an open and competitive market for electricity and natural gas and its integration into the regional and the Internal energy market of EU, increasing the activities in the area of energy efficiency and level of participation of renewable energies into the energy consumption by proposing incentives and direct subsidies for their support, etc., appropriate organization of the energy sector is required, which means that an Agency on Energy of Republic of Macedonia needs to be established. The role of the Agency shall be to initiate, coordinate, study and prepare appropriate documents, together with domestic and foreign specialized companies and experts, and to suggest concrete solutions and activities to the Government, through the Ministry of Economy. Specific activities of the Agency will be aimed towards: preparation of mid-term and long-term strategies and development plans; preparational and coordination of the energy reforms; proposal and evaluation of studies and projects on energetic, the energy sectors, energy efficiency and renewable energy sources; preparation and coordination of implementation of investment projects; regional cooperation and coordination of regional projects, and other activities. This Law shall be adopted in 2006. The existing energy legislation in the Republic of Macedonia is considered to be in partial conformity with the European legislation. However, by adopting the Laws which are now in preparation phase, and then adopting a corresponding secondary legislation which will originate from those laws, a full harmonization of the national with European energy legislative will be achieved. 
4. Please provide information and, if possible, the texts of the agreements and conventions (in one of the official EU languages) that have been concluded with third countries or international organisations in the field of energy. 
1.  Final Act of the European Energy Charter Conference with: Annex 1 The Energy Charter Treaty, Annex 2 Decisions with respect to the Energy Charter Treaty and Annex 3 Energy Charter Protocol on energy efficiency and related environmental aspects, was ratified by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia with Law on ratification on the Final Act of the European Energy Charter Conference (“Official Gazette of RM” No16/98); 2.  Memorandum of Understanding on the Regional Electricity Market in South East Europe and its Integration into the European Union Internal Electricity Market - 2002; 3.  Memorandum of Understanding on the Regional Electricity Market in South East Europe and its Integration into the European Union Internal Electricity Market - 2003. 
5. Please provide information on the fiscal measures (VAT, excise duties, CO2 energy tax, other taxes/levies) applied to energy products. Does the system favour indigenous energy sources? How will further tax harmonisation in the EU affect your energy balance? 
VAT - Value Added Tax  
Pursuant to the Law on Value Added Tax (VAT), (“Official Gazette of RM” No 44/99, 59/99, 86/99, 11/00, 08/01, 31/01, 21/03 and 19/04) VAT rates are calculated using proportional tax rates on the tax base of taxable commodities and services turnover, based on the common tax rate of 18% which is applicable to all types of energy products. 
Excise duties 
Excise duties, as a special type of circulation tax, were introduced since January 1994 and were imposed onto turnover and import of: oil derivatives, processed tobacco products, alcoholic beverages, beer, coffee, passenger vehicles and luxury goods. Obligors of excise duties on these products are their producers or importers. Onto the tax bases of separate excise duty products defined in the Law on Excises Duties, rates are applied as determined by the Excise Tariff, which is an integral part of the Law. Excise duty exemptions are anticipated in two segments, namely: the first one treats the excise duty exemptions on import, export, re-export and transit and the second segment refers to the exemptions in domestic circulation which are executed on a principle of recovery of paid excise duty. The Law on Excises Duties, (“Official Gazette of RM” No 32/01, 50/01, 52/01, 45/02, 98/02, 24/03 and 96/04), regulates the excise duties which are charged indirectly or directly for consumption on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia for: mineral oils, alcohol and alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. In terms of energy, important are the mineral oils (automotive fuel, diesel fuel, domestic heating oil - extra light and light special, jet fuel and aircraft petrol, engine petroleum, lighting petroleum, for airplanes and engines), which are processed pursuant to the following: subject of taxation, specific excise duty, proportional excise duty, mineral oils labelling, application of labelled mineral oils, excise duty exemption of mineral oils, special cases which are not considered as production of mineral oils, and excise duty storage of mineral oils.  The primary base for preparation of the Law on Excises Duties was the System Directive of the European Union No. 92/12/EEC, as well as its associated structural directives, separately for each of the goods subject to taxation with excise duties.  The Law on Excises Duties presents an entirely new system in the functioning of an indirect tax, which is based on the following novelties:   Focusing the subject of taxation by using terms established exclusively for the purposes of this system;   Liability to excise duty;   Transportation of excise duty goods through the territory of the Republic of Macedonia;   Origin of excise duty;   Excise duty period; and   Excise duty exemptions. 
Specific legal excise duty per derivatives is: Derivative Legal excise (MKD/kg) Legal excise (MKD/l) Automotive Petrol – 96 32,313 24,396 Automotive Petrol Unleaded – 90 28,731 21,692 Automotive Petrol Unleaded – 95 28,731 21,692 Diesel 14,344 12,121 Extra Light Oil 3,711 M – 1 Heavy Oil 0,100 M – 2 Heavy Oil 0,100 Upon determining the retail price of separate oil derivatives, and for the purpose of rounding off the prices, the specific excise duty of mineral oils may vary up to ± 3%.

2  Energy Tax 
The Law on Environment and Nature Protection and Promotion (“Official Gazette of RM” No 13/03 consolidated text), in article 31, paragraph 2 determines that the assets for environment and nature protection and promotion, which are revenue to the Environmental Fund, are provided from charges which are paid upon registration of motor vehicles, amounting to 4% of basic insurance, and for vehicles with catalytic exhaust gasses purification systems 2% of the basic insurance. The assets of the Environmental Fund are for a purpose of funding projects which are directly aimed towards protection of the environment. Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning coordinates the realization of these projects. The new Draft Law on Environment determines that “The polluter is obliged to compensate the costs for removal of the danger of environment pollution, to bear the costs for renovation and to pay proper compensation for the damage done to the environment, as well as to restore the environment to a condition most similar to the condition before the damage”. A pollution compensation is imposed so that “Legal and natural persons which, according to the Registry of Polluters of different environment elements and the Registry of Toxic and Harmful Substances, have sources of environment and nature pollution at their disposal, provide assets aimed towards protection and promotion of the environment and the nature, according to the type and quantity of pollutants, in a form of compensation regulated by law”.  The Law on Environment provides a basis for determining future fiscal measures which will apply to energy products, as well. This Law is in compliance with the following Directives: 2003/4/EC on Public access to environmental information; 85/337/EEC, 97/11/EC and 2003/35/EC on the assessment of the effect of certain public and private projects to the environment; 96/61/EC on integrated prevention and control of pollution; 2001/42/EC on the assessment of the effect of certain plans and programmes on the environment; 96/82/EC on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances; 2003/35/EC on public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to environment and amendments regarding public participation and access to justice.  The Law is in a parliamentary procedure and shall be adopted in the first quarter of 2005.  At the same time, the Second National Environmental Action Plan, which will be adopted in the second half of 2005, shall process the economic instruments and shall provide recommendations on introduction of other fiscal measures in the Republic of Macedonia. The economic instruments will also be subject to detailed analysis in the CARDS 2004 project "Further enhancement of the environmental management". The tax system of the Republic of Macedonia, concerning energy products, does not favour domestic energy sources. The harmonization with European Union tax regulations shall not influence the balance sheet of the Republic of Macedonia. 6.

II. ENERGY MARKETS 
B. Questions related to paragraph II.A 
1. Could compliance with the above-mentioned rules and objectives lead to any problems in your country? (Please answer for each separate point.) If so, which are particularly difficult and for what reasons? 
Carbohydrates 
As regards the harmonization of this matter no problems are expected. Production (exploitation) of carbohydrates does not exist in the Republic of Macedonia, except in relation to processing imported crude oil. The import of oil and oil derivatives, as well as wholesale and retail sale according to the existing Law on Trade (“Official Gazette of RM” No 16/04) and secondary legislation adopted on the basis of this Law can be executed only by enterprises which meet the prescribed technical conditions on volume and technical equipment of warehouse capacities, as well as the retail facilities, but there is no discrimination regarding the free competition. The only oil pipeline (Skopje – Thessaloniki) is an investment owned by a private company and the Republic of Macedonia. 
Transparency of prices 
According to Article 11-g of Energy Law (“Official Gazette of RM“ No 47/97, 40/99, 98/00, 94/02 and 38/03), see 14_Annex_01, the Energy Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Macedonia has a responsibility to prescribe pricing methodology of individual energy types and to prescribe tariff systems for particular types of energy, and also to bring decisions on prices of particular types of energy. The decision-making process of the Energy Regulatory Commission is regulated by Article 11-i of the Energy Law, according to which the decisions brought by Energy Regulatory Commission are published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia. Also, the Rules of Procedure of the Energy Regulatory Commission state that the decisions of Energy Regulatory Commission are published on the web page of the Energy Regulatory Commission. This provides an infrastructure for transparency of the relevant data on energy prices which are subject to decisions of the Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Oil and Oil Derivatives Sector 
According to the Pricing Methodology of particular oil derivatives, the price of crude oil and oil derivatives is calculated per 14-days' period, taking in consideration the movement of the price of crude oil on the world market and the US Dollar exchange rate in the specified period. In accordance with the competences of the Energy Regulatory Commission originating from the Energy Law, the Energy Regulatory Commission determines the prices of individual oil derivatives and publishes them in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia, and immediately notifies the public media through notification distributed through the Information Agency of the Republic of Macedonia. 
Natural Gas Sector 
The price of natural gas is currently determined by the gas supplier in the Republic of Macedonia. There is an ongoing procedure for creating and adopting a new Methodology on pricing of natural gas by the Energy Regulatory Commission, which will provide transparent determining of retail prices of natural gas. 
Electricity sector 
The price of electricity in the recent period has been determined according to the Methodology on Pricing of Individual Types of Energy (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 43/98 and 08/01), see 14_Annex_07, and the tariff systems of electricity. According to the existing regulations, the decision on the price of electricity is being brought by the Managing Board of JSC - EPCM, approved by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, and published in the Official Gazette of RM. The newly-formed Energy Regulatory Commission has a responsibility to prescribe a tariff system and methodology on pricing of electricity, as well as to give consent on the requirements for prices by the electricity industry taking into consideration their compliance with the Methodology. The Energy Regulatory Commission has prepared a Rulebook on the Method and Conditions for Regulating Electricity Prices (“Official Gazette of RM” No 95/04), see 14_Annex_08, while the new tariff system of electricity is in a preparation procedure and shall be adopted in the first quarter of 2005. 
Transit of electricity and gas 
Electricity The existing Energy Law does not specify the competences on determining and approving the rules of management and allocation of inter-connection capacity. The rules on management and allocation of inter-connection capacity will be determined by the Grid Code, which is to be prepared by MEPSO - Macedonian Electro-Transmission System Operator, and approved by the Energy Regulatory Commission. This Rulebook shall be in conformity with Regulation 1228/2003/EC. Currently, electricity is exported by means of purchase agreements and bilateral agreements, and the cross-border electricity exchange is conducted according to the agreement on cross-border trade, signed by countries which participate in SETSO (Southeast Europe Transmission System Operators). Natural gas The state of construction of the natural gas transmission infrastructure in the Republic of Macedonia does not allow for transit of natural gas through the territory of the country. The new Energy Law will regulate the transit of natural gas, taking into consideration the provisions of Directive 2003/55/ on common rules of internal market of natural gas in the European Union. 
LIBERALIZATION OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS MARKET 
1. Opening of the market 
Electricity and natural gas 
The Republic of Macedonia signed the Memoranda of Understanding on Regional Energy Market in Southeast Europe and its integration into the European Community Internal Energy Market (MoU 2002, MoU 2003). According to these Athens Memoranda, as well as the process of signing the Treaty on Energy Community, the following deadline is proposed for opening the electricity and natural gas market (Annex I, Draft Energy Community Treaty):   After January 1 2008, all consumers except households;   After January 1 2015, all consumers. The Law on Market of Electricity, which is to be adopted in the first half of 2005, will define Eligible Customers of electricity, the threshold of gaining Eligible Customer status (minimal yearly consumption of electricity) and a time frame on lowering of this threshold. The Energy Regulatory Commission will be competent for granting the status Eligible Customer of Electricity, pursuant to conditions determined by this Law.  With the new Energy Law, Eligible Customers of Gas will be determined in a procedure similar to the one for Eligible Customers of Electricity. 
2. Legal separation of transmission and distribution systems 
Electricity 
Pursuant to the Law on Transformation of the Joint Stock Company Electric Power Company of Macedonia for Production, Transmission and Distribution of Electricity in State Ownership (“Official Gazette of RM” No 19/04), see 14_Annex_02, the existing JSC – EPCM in state ownership, will be separated into two joint stock companies, as follows:   Joint Stock Company Electric Power Company of Macedonia for Production, Distribution and Supply of Electricity, (new), in state ownership; and 
  Joint Stock Company MEPSO for Transmission of Electricity and Operation of the Electrical Power System, in state ownership. The accounting separation of the assets for production, distribution and supply of electricity was completed before the end of 2003. The legal separation of activities and assets of the transmission system operator was completed on 31.12.2004. Distribution system operator which will be independent in terms of its organization and decision making is expected to be established during 2005. 
Natural gas 
The new Energy Law introduces separation of accounting and legal activities pertaining to transmission, distribution and supply/storage of natural gas, taking the provisions of EU Directive 2003/55/ into consideration. 

3. Regulated access to third parties 
Electricity and natural gas 
According to Article 13 of the Energy Law (“Official Gazette of RM“ No 47/97, 40/99, 98/00, 94/02 and 38/03), connection of energy facilities managed by legal or physical entities to the energy systems is accomplished by entering into agreements with the legal entities which manage the energy systems. This agreement in particular provides for:   Technical conditions for connection to the energy systems;   Agreement on energy production;   Secured collection of bills for the supplied energy; and   Conditions for regular and additional supply for producers which use part of the production for their own needs. According to Article 13-a of the Energy Law, the legal entities which manage the energy systems for transmission, transportation and distribution of energy and energy sources are obliged to provide services with their available capacities to parties interested in transmission, transportation, distribution and transit of energy and energy sources through those systems. Conditions for providing these services and the tariff items should be transparent and equal for all users and should be published in the public media. If the legal entities which manage the energy systems for transmission, transportation and distribution of energy and energy sources unfoundedly refuse to provide services or practice discrimination in any respect during provision of services, the legal entity interested in receiving those services can request the Regulatory Commission to undertake measures and activities for solving their demand according to the law. The new Energy Law shall precisely define the regulated access for third parties to networks for transmission and distribution of electricity and natural gas respectively, in a non-discriminatory and transparent manner. With this approach, the independent producers, traders and eligible customers of electricity and eligible customers of natural gas will have access rights to the system on the basis of published prices for using the transmission and distribution networks, which have been previously approved by the Energy Regulatory Commission. Access to the storage capacities, the quantity of gas in the pipeline and the ancillary services, which may be regulated or negotiated upon, will be defined in the new Energy Law. 
4. Regulatory body 
The Energy Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Macedonia is an independent legal entity founded by the Law on Amending the Energy Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No 94/02 and 38/03) for the purpose of providing reliable and continuous supply of energy to the consumers in the Republic of Macedonia, protection of environment and nature, improvement and protection of the competitive energy market pursuant to objective, transparent and non-discriminatory principles. The members of the Energy Regulatory Commission were appointed on 23.07.2003 by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, upon a proposal of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. The Energy Regulatory Commission commenced with operations on 01.01.2004. The Energy Regulatory Commission operates and makes decisions independently, and notifies the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia about its operations at least once a year. The Energy Regulatory Commission operates on public sessions, except in cases when confidential information and business secrets are being discussed, upon which the President of the Energy Regulatory Commission brings the decision. The sessions of Regulatory Commission are convened and presided by the President of the Energy Regulatory Commission. The Energy Regulatory Commission brings decisions with majority of votes from the total number of members and its decisions are published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia. Individual acts of the Energy Regulatory Commission may be appealed in front of the Appeals Commission on Energy. The appeal does not postpone the execution of the decision of the Energy Regulatory Commission. Professional and administrative functions of the Appeals Commission are executed by the expert office of the Ministry which is competent for energy matters. According to Article 11-g of the Energy Law, the Regulatory Commission executes the following operations:   Ensures reliable, continued and quality supply of energy;   Ensures development of a competitive energy market;   Prescribes conditions for supply of individual types of energy;   Prescribes a pricing methodology of individual types of energy;   Prescribes tariff systems of individual types of energy;   Decides on the prices of particular types of energy, according to the Pricing Methodology, tariff systems of individual types of energy and other legal regulations;   Issues, modifies, withdraws licences and monitors license execution for particular activities from the energy area;   Prescribes rules for connection to energy systems;   Ensures improved protection of energy consumers' rights;   Initiates procedure of adopting laws and other regulations from the energy area;   Participates in resolution of disputes and proposes measures concerning disputes;   According to its competencies and in a legal procedure, suggests measures to the competent bodies against entities breaching the Energy Law;   Adopts Rules of Procedure and other acts of the Regulatory Commission; and   Performs other activities determined by law. The activity of the Regulatory Commission is financed by assets obtained through levies charged on the total revenue of organizations performing activity related to energy and from the licensing fee. Before 1 October of the ongoing year, the Regulatory Commission submits a Draft Financial Plan of the Regulatory Commission for the following year to the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, which contains all revenues and expenditures of the Regulatory Commission, including the salaries of the members of the Regulatory Commission and the employees, as well as the fees of the members of the Appeals Commission and their deputies. Within the frames of the Draft Financial Plan, and based on planned revenues of organizations performing energy-related activities for the ongoing year, the Regulatory Commission determines the fee for the following year through assigning an equal percent of collection from the total actual revenue of the organizations, upon a given consent from the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, and amounting to no more than 0,1% of the total actual revenue of the organizations. According to the determined percentage and the actual revenue in the previous year, the organisation performing energy-related activities pays the fee in two equal instalments, the first before April 30th, and the second before September 30 of the current year. The unused assets of the Regulatory Commission from the previous year are transferred to the following year and the fee is accordingly reduced. After the finishing of the first year of the Regulatory Commission's operation and before March 31 of the following year, the President of the Regulatory Commission submits an Annual Report to the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and to the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia concerning the operations of the Regulatory Commission, which also includes material and financial activities of the Regulatory Commission. The Annual Report on the operations of the Regulatory Commission is also submitted to the Ministry competent for energy matters and is published in one of the public media. 
Enhanced provisions on public service 
a) Obligation on universal service for electricity Within Article 4 of the existing Energy Law the operations of production, transmission and distribution of electricity, production, transportation and distribution of natural gas and production, transmission and distribution of thermal and geothermal energy, except for own use, are declared as energy-related activities of public interest. According to Article 14 of this Law, the legal or natural persons, who perform energy-related operations of public interest, are obliged to perform their activity continually and with high quality. Pursuant to Article 26 the producers and distributors of energy are obliged to supply energy to the consumers in accordance with the energy balance, the agreement on supply and the conditions on supplying the appropriate type of energy. At the same time, According to Article 28 of the Energy Law, energy suppliers supply the energy to energy consumers if the energy facilities, machines and installations are in conformity with the prescribed standards, technical norms and norms of quality for the corresponding type of energy, which guarantees uninterrupted distribution and use of energy in the agreed quantity, power and quality and continuity and safety of people and property. Article 41 of the Energy Law determines that every legal and natural person and citizen, who connects to the energy system, is obliged to provide energy consent from the energy system operator to which it connects to. In addition, the user which increases the energy usage and the engaged power determined by the existing energy consent, is obliged to provide new energy consent. At the same time, the energy provider is obliged, within 15 days of the application for energy consent, to issue a decision on energy consent in accordance with the technical, energy-related and economic conditions and to connect the consumer to the energy system, providing that the conditions from the energy consent and the supply agreement are met. The Law on Electricity Market, which is to be adopted in the first half of 2005, and the new Energy Law, which is to be adopted in the year 2005, will provide reliable supply of electricity to the consumers, as well as transparent and reasonable pricing. In the new Energy Law, the universal service obligation for electricity shall be defined clearly, and in transparent and non-discriminatory manner, which shall impose an obligation to supply all tariff consumers with electricity, and this obligation shall also be included in the licence of the electricity provider. The transmission and the distribution system operators will provide connection of all consumers which meet the respective technical requirements and will provide: secure, continuous and quality supply of electricity, respecting the appropriate standards on quality of service. b) Better protection of consumer rights Besides the obligations determined by the Energy Law, the electric energy operators have obligations defined in the Consumer Protection Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No 38/04). At the same time, pursuant to this Law, the electricity supplied to the consumer will be calculated according to the consumption in a certain period, applying the electricity tariff system. The Law contains an obligation for the supplier to notify the consumer on all conditions of the agreement on supply of electricity. Also, the supplier is obliged to list the details concerning the quality and quantity of the supplied electricity in the bill. The supplier should provide non-discriminatory conditions for connection of all consumers to the network. The following state bodies have competencies on consumer protection:   Consumer Protection Council, as a Government consultative body;   Energy Regulatory Commission;   Ministry of Economy;  Ombudsman;   State Market Inspectorate; and   State Inspectorate for Technical Inspection. Furthermore, other non-governmental organizations and associations have important role in consumer protection, like the Consumer Protection Organization. According to article 11-g of the Energy Law, the Energy Regulatory Commission is responsible for improvement of the rights of energy consumers and for this purpose it cooperates with the aforementioned institutions and associations, and has mechanisms for guaranteeing the rights and interests of the consumers by the following means:   By issuing licenses to the energy companies, the Regulatory Commission imposes additional obligations for public services onto the energy companies, ensuring reliable supply of electricity to all households, including those in remote and/or isolated areas;   By approving the electricity supply prices for regulated groups of consumers;   By including guarantee form in the licence stipulating that the rights and interests of the consumers are protected. According to the existing Energy Law, the specific consumer protection is regulated by articles 30, 31, 34, 35 and 36 of the Energy Law, where:   In cases of temporary interruption of the supply of energy from the energy system (during planned inspections, examinations and control measurements, overhauls, reconstructions and expansions of the facilities, machines and installations) the energy supplier is obliged to execute them in a period when they are causing the least damage to the consumers, to notify the consumers in writing about the day and time of the temporary interruption and is obliged to notify the customer class of households and other smaller energy consumer through public media at least three days before the disruption;   In a case of a temporary interruption of the supply of energy from the energy system (unplanned examinations, overhauls, inspections, control measurements and maintenance of the facilities, machines and installations) the period and length of the interruption are agreed by the supplier and the consumer of energy, where the energy supplier is obliged to notify the customer classes of households and other small energy consumers through public media at least 24 hours before the interruption;   The supplier is obliged to reconnect a consumer disconnected from the energy system when he ascertains that the reasons for the disconnection from the energy system have ceased. The energy consumer bears the expenses for reconnection to the network;   Energy consumer which considers to be unfoundedly disconnected from the energy system can request the competent inspection body to determine the state of facts which caused the supplier to cease delivery. If the competent inspection body determines that the disconnection of energy is unsubstantiated, it will order the energy supplier immediately, at its own expense, to reconnect the facilities, machines and installations of the consumer to its network and the energy consumer has a right to claim damage compensation;   In cases of Force Majeure (floods, earthquakes, landslides, fires, severe winds, excessive icing of electrical conductors and poles, atmospheric discharges) and other circumstances (malfunction of machines and facilities not caused by actions of the supplier or of the consumer), the energy supplier may limit or terminate energy supply from the energy system and is obliged to notify the consumers about the occurred interruption and the time of elimination of the interruption. c) Protection of socially sensitive groups of consumers There is an ongoing study, financed by EBRD, on protection of the socially sensitive groups of consumers. At the same, it is possible to apply many known mechanisms for protection of sensitive groups, such as the welfare system, introduction of intraclass block tariffs and methods of energy efficiency. d) Publishing the fuel mixture for electricity production In the current practice, the JSC - EPCM as an exclusive producer of electricity publishes the combination of primary fuels which it uses for production of electricity in its Annual Report, which is a public document, as well as on its own web page. e) Continuous fulfilment of the service level criteria The quality of service, according to the licence, is regulated by the Energy Regulatory Commission via three parameters:   Continuity of service: the continuity of flow of electric energy/gas/thermal energy to the consumer. This aspect is generally measured by frequency and duration of the interruption of service. Interruptions of service are less frequent in the gas industry than in electricity industry, mainly due to the different nature of the gas infrastructure and the fact that the gas network is subterranean and less exposed to external influences. The continuity of service actually implies responsibility onto the distribution function, but is also attributed to other functions; 
  The quality of product: refers to the quality of transmitted energy. The quality of service parameter may be measured by oscillation of voltage and frequency of electricity, content of fuel in gas (which may affect its caloric value and operation of the burner) and its pressure, and content of fuel in oil derivatives. For thermal energy, these measurements include delivered water temperature and quality. Standards pertaining to the quality of product are very difficult to measure and because of that companies often rely on consumers to report certain problems; 
  Consumer services: relates to the quality of relations between consumers and the company. This parameter may be measured in several ways; for example, through swiftness of response to telephone calls and response to written requests/complaints, and temporal restrictions of delivery of service (including punctuality during appointments). Consumer services are responsibility both of the suppliers and the distribution companies. 
The Energy Regulatory Commission shall undertake mechanisms for regulation of quality of service such as:   Benchmarking on quality performance between companies or comparison of competitors in order to stimulate competition. The competition comparison needs clear and detailed rules on methods of measurement and the data;   Total and guaranteed performance standards; and   Other penalties like: written warnings, modification of licence or withdrawing of licence. Measurements of performance which represent every parameter of quality: continuity of service, quality of product and consumer services provide the Energy Regulatory Commission with enough information for evaluating the adequacy of company's operations. These performance measurements will be submitted to the Energy Regulatory Commission on a regular basis. If and when the Energy Regulatory Commission is notified that some company does not respond and does not operate properly, it will take respective measures. The Energy Regulatory Commission may request additional information as a part of the investigation on insufficient service, but this additional information is also collected on a regular basis. Parameters which must be determined for regular notification include the following: frequency of notification, period of notification, format of notification and report details. The Energy Regulatory Commission shall prescribe standards on service performance, which should be met by licence holders, and upon granting each licence, the licence holders shall receive a Notification Manual, which will include all necessary information on what and when should licence holder report and whether they are meeting the requirements of the licence. The Energy Regulatory Commission cooperates with other governmental bodies on this matter, such as: Technical inspectorate. f) Supervision of safety issues concerning supply Pursuant to the Energy Law, the Energy Regulatory Commission ensures reliable, continuous and quality supply of energy. The Energy Regulatory Commission shall introduce Key Performance Indicators (KPI), in order to monitor the safety issues concerning the supply area, taking into consideration the international standards SAIDI, SAIFI, CAIDI, i.e.: Maximal acceptable number and duration of supply interruptions, maintained stability of frequency and voltage, period of reconnection after supply interruptions, minimal period of notice in a case of planned supply interruptions, minimal period of notice for planned reading of meters, maximal period during which the company has to respond to customer's applied complaint. This matter shall be defined in more details with adoption of secondary legislation on energy. 
2. What is your policy, what are your plans on electricity, gas or oil exchanges and network interconnections with neighbouring countries and/or regions? What projects are being carried out as regards electricity and gas interconnectors? Who provides the funding and what agreements exist with respect to access to those networks? 
Electricity 
In addition to the Athens Memoranda signed in 2002 and 2003, the Republic of Macedonia entered into negotiations and is determined to sign the Treaty on Energy Community, which shall enable establishment of a Regional Energy Market. Besides of this legal framework, the Republic of Macedonia is in process of strengthening the existing interconnection corridors on the North-South route (Serbia and Montenegro and Republic of Greece) by means of:    Upgrading of the existing 150 kV transmission line Bitola (Republic of Macedonia) - Florina (Republic of Greece) to 400 kV. The value of the project on the Macedonian side is 4,5 million EUR. In March 2003 this project was submitted to the Government of the Republic of Greece for financing from the programme “Greek Plan on Economic Reconstruction of the Balkans“. Considering the uncertainty as regards the beginning of the programme, a possibility of financing this project from own or other commercial sources is considered;   Construction of a new 400kV transmission line between Skopje (Republic of Macedonia) and Niš (Serbia and Montenegro). This transmission line has a total length of about 200 km and the investment is estimated to around 42 million EUR. A feasibility study is currently being prepared. This project was also submitted to the Government of the Republic of Greece in March 2003 for financing from the programme “Greek Plan on Economic Reconstruction of the Balkans“. Furthermore, the Republic of Macedonia is in process of establishing new interconnection corridors East-West, by means of:    Construction of a new 400 kV transmission line between Štip (Republic of Macedonia) and Chervena Mogila (Republic of Bulgaria). This project, with total cost of approximately 50 million EUR, is in a realization phase and is expected to be launched by the end of 2006. EBRD provided 40,4 million EUR as a loan for JSC - EPCM. JSC - EPCM and NEK (Republic of Bulgaria) are covering the remaining 10 million EUR from own sources. During the construction NEK will pay its part of the project to JSC - EPCM. The whole arrangement is covered with a package of contracts.    An initiative exists and two options have been considered so far (especially within SECI) for connection between Republic of Macedonia and Republic of Albania on 400 kV level. Those options are Skopje - Tirana and Bitola - Zemblak. Additional research will show if there is a necessity and which option could be realized. There is a preliminary interest at EBRD and the WB for financing interconnection with Albania. The connection Bitola - Zemblak could be of exceptional value if the interconnection between Albania and Italy by underwater cable in the Adriatic Sea becomes a reality. In that case, a significant corridor for transmission of electricity would be provided - from East (Ukraine and Turkey) through Rumania, Bulgaria, Macedonia and Albania towards Italy.  By realization, partial or full, of the above-stated projects, Macedonia will be interconnected with all neighbours individually, and will have transmission capacity for exchange much larger than the internal needs, therefore, as a small system in the central part of the region, it shall contribute for increasing of the regional energy flows and shall create possibilities for establishment of new transport corridors for transmission of electricity in the region and in the wider surroundings. 
Natural gas 
Currently, Macedonia is connected with one gas transmission pipeline, with capacity of 800 million m3/year, from the gas transmission grid in Bulgaria to Skopje. Besides that, within the strategy of expansion and interconnection of the gas transmission pipeline with the neighbouring countries' networks, several potential options are being considered, such as:   Construction of a regional gas pipeline system from Bulgaria, through Macedonia and Albania towards Italy, with capacity of 8 billion m/year;    Construction of a major gas transmission pipeline from Turkey through Macedonia towards north to Austria;   Revitalization of a local major gas pipeline for connection to Kosovo (Serbia and Montenegro), The realization of the potential projects for construction of regional gas pipelines depends on the results of several ongoing studies, especially of the World Bank study, as well as of the interest and needs of the gas market in the region and in Europe. 
Oil  Dominant processing facility in the oil industry of Macedonia is the Oil Refinery JSC OKTA Skopje, whose basic activities are: refinement of crude oil, production of oil derivatives, chemical and petrochemical products, trade and distribution of oil derivatives. After the construction of the oil pipeline Thessaloniki-Skopje, when all pre-requisites were satisfied for larger exploitation of the installed capacity for processing of crude oil in the only refinery in Macedonia - OKTA, possibilities were created for faster development and improvement of oil derivatives trade and distribution to the markets of Serbia and Montenegro, more exactly in Kosovo and Southern Serbia. In 2002, preparation activities commenced on construction of product transportation line from OKTA towards Kosovo, which will provide fast, inexpensive and reliable transportation of the necessary types and quantities of oil derivatives for the needs of that market. The product transportation line towards Kosovo will provide a flow of oil derivatives of 65 m3/h. Besides that, the Republic of Macedonia is involved in a process of preparation and potential realization of a project on construction of regional oil pipeline within Corridor 8 (East - West) from Burgas (Bulgaria), through the territory of Macedonia to Vlore on the Adriatic coast in Albania. 
3. What steps have you taken to implement the commitments taken in the framework of the 2003 Athens Memorandum of Understanding on the Regional Energy Market in South East Europe, and to prepare for the establishment of the Integrated Regional Energy Market? 
Pursuant to the commitments of the 2003 Athens Memorandum of Understanding, there is a need of reforms in the energy sectors - electricity and natural gas management, mainly referring to the requirement for implementation of Directives 2003/54/EC and 2003/55/EC and Regulation 1228/2003/EC from June 26 2003 on free access to network for cross-border exchanges, as well as the requirement for implementation of the directives directly related to the impact of the energy sector on the environment, such as Directive 85/337/EC on the assessment of the effect of certain public and private projects on the environment, the Directive 1999/32/EC on reduction of the content of sulphur in certain liquid fuels and the Directive 2001/80/EC on Large combustion plants.  Reforms and measures stemming from the requirements of the Athens Memorandum of Understanding can provisionally be separated into the following categories: institutional, legal and measures for commercialisation of electricity and natural gas utilities. Reforms are undertaken in each of the mentioned areas and they are either completed or in an implementation phase, with appropriate intensity in the areas of electricity and environment. 
Key elements of Athens Memorandum of Understanding on the Regional Energy Market in South East Europe National institutions 1. Establishment of independent institutions for creating strategy, regulations and operative management of the system   National Energy Authority  The Ministry of Economy has the role of a National Energy Authority, which, among other things, has competencies concerning issues in the field of energy. Within the Ministry, a Sector on energy and raw minerals was established, responsible for preparation of strategic planning and policy of the energy sector, including safety of energy supply, renewable sources and energy efficiency. Based on indications about the need of increased capacity of the Energy and Raw Materials Sector, an establishment of Energy Agency is planned, which shall provide support to the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, the Ministry of Economy and, to a certain extent, to the Energy Regulatory Commission and the energy-related industry, especially from the aspect of development of renewable energy resources and energy efficiency.   Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) The Energy Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Macedonia is an independent legal entity founded by the Law on Amending the Energy Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No 94/02 and 38/03) for the purpose of providing reliable and continuous supply of energy to the consumers in the Republic of Macedonia, protection of environment and nature, improvement and protection of the competitive energy market pursuant to objective, transparent and non-discriminatory principles. The members of the Energy Regulatory Commission were appointed on 23.07.2003 by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, upon a proposal of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. The Energy Regulatory Commission commenced with operations on 01.01.2004. The Energy Regulatory Commission operates and makes decisions independently, and notifies the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia about its operations at least once a year. The Energy Regulatory Commission operates on public sessions, except in cases when confidential information and business secrets are being discussed, upon which the President of the Energy Regulatory Commission brings the decision. The sessions of Regulatory Commission are convened and presided by the President of the Energy Regulatory Commission. The Energy Regulatory Commission brings decisions with majority of votes from the total number of members and its decisions are published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia. Individual acts of the Energy Regulatory Commission may be appealed in front of the Appeals Commission on Energy. The appeal does not postpone the execution of the decision of the Energy Regulatory Commission. Professional and administrative functions of the Appeals Commission are executed by the expert office of the Ministry which is competent for energy matters. According to Article 11-g of the Energy Law, the Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Macedonia executes the following operations:   Ensures reliable, continued and quality supply of energy;   Ensures development of a competitive energy market;   Prescribes conditions for supply of individual types of energy;   Prescribes a pricing methodology of individual types of energy;   Prescribes tariff systems of individual types of energy;   Decides on the prices of particular types of energy, according to the Pricing Methodology, tariff systems of individual types of energy and other legal regulations;   Issues, modifies, withdraws licences and monitors license execution for particular activities from the energy area;   Prescribes rules for connection to energy systems;   Ensures improved protection of energy consumers' rights;   Initiates procedure of adopting laws and other regulations from the energy area;   Participates in resolution of disputes and proposes measures concerning disputes;   According to its competencies and in a legal procedure, suggests measures to the competent bodies against entities breaching the Energy Law;   Adopts Rules of Procedure and other acts of the Regulatory Commission; and   Performs other activities determined by law. The activity of the Regulatory Commission is financed by assets obtained through levies charged on the total revenue of organizations performing activity related to energy and from the licensing fee. Before 1 October of the ongoing year, the Regulatory Commission submits a Draft Financial Plan of the Regulatory Commission for the following year to the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, which contains all revenues and expenditures of the Regulatory Commission, including the salaries of the members of the Regulatory Commission and the employees, as well as the fees of the members of the Appeals Commission and their deputies. Within the frames of the Draft Financial Plan, and based on planned revenues of organizations performing energy-related activities for the ongoing year, the Regulatory Commission determines the fee for the following year through assigning an equal percent of collection from the total actual revenue of the organizations, upon a given consent from the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, and amounting to no more than 0,1% of the total actual revenue of the organizations. According to the determined percentage and the actual revenue in the previous year, the organisation performing energy-related activities pays the fee in two equal instalments, the first before April 30, and the second before September 30 of the current year. The unused assets of the Regulatory Commission from the previous year are transferred to the following year and the fee is accordingly reduced. After the finishing of the first year of the Regulatory Commission's operation and before March 31 of the following year, the President of the Regulatory Commission submits an Annual Report to the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and to the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia concerning the operations of the Regulatory Commission, which also includes material and financial activities of the Regulatory Commission. The Annual Report on the operations of the Regulatory Commission is also submitted to the Ministry competent for energy matters and is published in one of the public media.   Transmission System Operator  Pursuant to the Law on Transformation of the Joint Stock Company Electric Power Company of Macedonia for Production, Transmission and Distribution of Electricity in State Ownership (“Official Gazette of RM” No 19/04), see 14_Annex_02, the existing vertically integrated company JSC - EPCM shall be separated into two joint stock companies, as follows:  Joint Stock Company Electric Power Company of Macedonia for Production, Distribution and Supply of Electricity, (new), in state ownership; and  Joint Stock Company MEPSO for Transmission of Electricity and Operation of the Electrical Power System, in state ownership. The legal procedure for registration of the two new joint stock companies, which is conducted in accordance with the Company Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No 28/04), enforced from 1.05.2004 and the Decision of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia for separation of JSC - EPCM in state ownership, Skopje, by founding with separation, from 27.09.2004, was completed by the end of 2004.  The Macedonian electro-transmission system operator Joint Stock Company MEPSO for Transmission of Electricity and Operation of the Electrical Power System, commenced with operations on 01.01.2005.  The  Joint Stock Company MEPSO for Transmission of Electricity and Operation of the Electrical Power System is owner of the assets for transmission of electricity and will perform maintenance, expansion planning and construction of the transmission system, operation of the electricity power system, as well as organisation and management of the electricity market and ancillary services.   Electricity Market Operator The Market Operator, which will be responsible for organising the wholesale market of electricity, will be founded as a separate organisational unit within Joint Stock Company MEPSO for Transmission of Electricity and Operation of the Electrical Power System.  Depending on the needs and requirements for development of the electricity market in the Republic of Macedonia, the Market Operator could be separated from Joint Stock Company MEPSO for Transmission of Electricity and Operation of the Electrical Power System, in future. 2. Creating independent operators of larger distribution systems  According to the plan on restructuring of JSC - EPCM, immediately after the completion of the first phase of restructuring, defined by founding of the Transmission System Operator - Joint Stock Company MEPSO for Transmission of Electricity and Operation of the Electrical Power System, and the new company for production, distribution and supply of electricity – Joint Stock Company Electric Power Company of Macedonia for Production, Distribution and Supply of Electricity, (new), the second phase of restructuring has commenced, related to the legal separation of production and distribution. During this phase of restructuring, a decision will be made on the level of establishing an independent Distribution System Operator. This procedure will continue in the 2005.  
National electricity market 
1. Elimination of cross-subsidies and development of transparent tariffs for transmission and distribution The accounting separation of assets and activities of production, distribution and transmission of electricity was completed before the end of 2003. This provided conditions for creating transparent transmission and distribution tariffs and preventing cross-subsidies between separate activities. The prescription of tariffs is responsibility of the Energy Regulatory Commission. The Energy Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Macedonia prepared a Rulebook on the Method and Conditions for Regulating Electricity Prices (“Official Gazette of RM” No 95/04), while the new tariff system of electricity is in a preparation procedure and shall be adopted in the first quarter of 2005. For that purpose, two studies were prepared - one financed by the USAID and produced by the NERA consulting house in 2003/2004, and another financed by EU through the CARDS project on Development of the Energy Regulatory Commission in Macedonia, implemented by IKRP Rokas & Partners, completed in august 2004. USAID also financed training of employees of the Energy Regulatory Commission for calculation of electricity tariffs, conducted by the consulting company Pierce Atwood in October and November 2004. On the bases of the analyses and experiences a Tariff methodology for calculation of the income of the electricity companies based on combination of the methods - price cap and revenue cap has been adopted. This also refers to application of the postal stamp method for payment of the transmission tariff, or application of unified transmission tariff on the whole state territory. 2. Adopting a National Action Plan  A National Action Plan on establishment of an electricity market, prepared by the Ministry of Economy, has been adopted at the session of the Committee on Restructuring and Privatization of the JSC - EPCM, held on 10.12.2003. The section of the National plan concerning the reduction of losses in transmission and distribution network and improvement of collection of bills is prepared and is being implemented within Joint Stock Company Electric Power Company of Macedonia for Production, Distribution and Supply of Electricity, (new). During 2005, activities for privatisation of certain parts of Joint Stock Company Electric Power Company of Macedonia for Production, Distribution and Supply of Electricity, (new) shall commence. For the purpose of conducting a transparent process of privatization, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia hired the consultant Meinl Bank Consortium from Austria. At the same time, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia signed an agreement on minority share pre-privatisation investment amounting to 45 million EUR with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The agreement implementation is conditioned by fulfilling a set of milestones related to the reforms required by the Athens Memorandum of Understanding and the European Directives, as well as the necessary steps for transparent privatisation by means of public competition. By this agreement the process of reforms and privatization is to be completed within a period of two years. 3. Adoption of the UCTE norms and standards  In the electricity system of Macedonia, the UCTE norms and standards are fully applied.  The re-connection of the system with the first synchronous zone of UCTE was successfully performed on 10.09.2004. 4. Separation of the accounts of individual parts of the system (production, transmission and distribution), adoption of the International Accounting Standards (IASs), and independent annual audit of every part separately and measures on corruption abatement.  The separation of the accounts for production, distribution and supply of electricity was completed before the end of 2003. International Accounting Standards became effective from 01.01.2005, in reference with which all necessary preparations within JSC Electric Power Company of Macedonia were completed. Within the fight against corruption and financial crime, the Law on Corruption Abatement (“Official Gazette of RM” No 28/02 and 46/04) and the Law on Prevention of Money Laundering and Other Proceeds from Crime (“Official Gazette of RM” No 46/04) were adopted. Furthermore, Committee on Corruption Prevention of the Republic of Macedonia, Financial police, Agency for prevention of money laundering were established, and other measures were undertaken for abatement of corruption in energy-related utilities. 5. Development of licences for operation  Based on the results of the CARDS project on Development of the Energy Regulatory Commission in Macedonia, implemented by IKRP Rokas & Partners, the Energy Regulatory Commission is developing a secondary legislation for licences. The legislation includes a Rulebook on Conditions, Method and Procedure for Issuing, Modifying and Cancellation of Licences for Energy-related activities. Also, it develops types of licences for individual energy-related activities, some of them being electricity and natural gas, which pertain to authorization and operation licensing for energy facilities. The Energy Regulatory Commission is prepared to adopt the licensing rules in the first quarter of 2005. 6. Preparation of Grid Code, based on non-discriminatory approach  Within the activities for development of the regional electricity market, the Regional Grid Code is in final stage of preparation by the EDF. Based on this Grid Code and local differences, within the same project a National Grid Code will be prepared. The Grid Code should be proposed by the Transmission system operator - Joint Stock Company MEPSO for Transmission of Electricity and Operation of the Electrical Power System, and approved by the Energy Regulatory Commission during the first half of 2005. 7. Adopting legislation on competition in the electricity sector  The national legislation on competition is in preparation phase by the consultant law firm Hunton&Williams, supported by the USAID, and by the local workgroup consisting of representatives of all relevant institutions in Macedonia. A serious approach on development of the legislation in two phases was developed.  First phase concerns the adoption of Electricity Market Design Plan, which defines the main entities on the market and their relations from the aspect of flows of energy, dispatch and system control, contractual relationship and funds. Based on this Design Plan, primary and secondary legislation shall be prepared, which shall regulate the competition relations in the electricity sector. The second phase concerns the actual preparation of legislation. The primary Law on Electricity Market is to be adopted in the first half of 2005. It includes introduction of the basic principles of competition in the electricity sector, such as: the right on non-discriminatory third party access to the network, defining eligible customers of electricity, public service obligation and transparency of the procedures for investment and construction of energy facilities. The necessary secondary legislation, which is also in a preparation phase, mainly includes transparent tariffs on production, transmission and distribution of electricity, issuing, modification and cancellation of licences, Grid Code, and Market Code. Preparation of the secondary legislation is mainly competence of the Energy Regulatory Commission. 8. Opening of market for so-called eligible customers (all consumers that are not households) and adopting regulations for their access to the network  The criteria of establishing the definition and the threshold of eligible customers will be determined by the Law on Electricity Market. The initial opening will be limited by the criterion of annual consumption of 20 GWh of electricity. The Energy Community Treaty, which is in negotiation phase, envisages the following deadlines for opening the electricity and natural gas market (Annex I, Draft Energy Community Treaty):   From January 1st 2008, all non-household customers;   From January 1st 2015, all customers. 
Regional electricity market 
1. Participation of the national institutions in the market facilitation group, as well as in the sub-groups of regulators (CEER) and transmission system operators (ETSO) of the EU Market Facilitation Group The Energy Regulatory Commission participates in the work of the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER) through the Work Group of Energy regulators of SEE (SEEER), since the very beginning of its operations. 2. Implementation of the SECI Plan for Teleinformation System among National Dispatching Centres in the Region  JSC - EPAC, with support by the World Bank, is developing a modern Electricity Management System (EMS) and telecommunication system, which enable real time management of the system and exchange of information with the neighbouring countries and the UCTE. These systems, supplemented by telecommunications with the neighbouring countries (Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece), will enable completion of the SECI Plan for Teleinformation connection within the region, as well as connection within the Electronic Highway of the UCTE. This project is expected to be completed by the end of 2006. 3. Application of the CEER and ETSO guidelines on cross-border exchanges, cross-border tariffs and congestion management in the network In terms of interstate electricity trade, JSC - EPCM has signed the Agreement on cross-border trade of SEE countries, taking effect from 01.07.2004. Since 01.01.2005, this Agreement is inherited by Joint Stock Company MEPSO for Transmission of Electricity and Operation of the Electrical Power System, after its separation of JSC - EPCM. The Agreement regulates the payment methods for electricity transits through countries of the region based on the Cross Border Trade Mechanism - CBT Mechanism, defined in the Annex of the Agreement. In regards to solving overloads in the regional electricity network, the JSC - EPCM takes active participation in the preparation of procedures for common operation, within the Work Subgroup on congestion managements and access to the transmission network within Transmission System Operators of SEE (SETSO). This activity form 01.01.2005 is responsibility of Joint Stock Company MEPSO for Transmission of Electricity and Operation of the Electrical Power System. 
Key elements of the Athens Memorandum of Understanding on Regional Natural Gas Market in South East Europe 
The elements for natural gas market development in the Republic of Macedonia, as well as the infrastructure for management of the gas itself, are in initial phase. The existing transmission gas-pipeline is operated by JSC Makpetrol. At the same time, Makpetrol is the only supplier of natural gas for the large industrial consumers which are currently connected to the pipeline. A distribution network of natural gas is not developed yet. National institutions 1. Establishment of independent institutions for strategy, regulations and operative management of the system    National Energy Authority  The Ministry of Economy has the role of National Energy Authority, which, among other things, has competencies concerning energy-related issues.    Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) The Energy Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Macedonia is responsible for development of the natural gas market.    Transmission System Operator  No activities have been undertaken for establishing an independent transmission system operator of natural gas.  
National Natural Gas Market 
The National Natural Gas Market operations shall be regulated by the new Energy Law, which, among other things, shall regulate issues concerning transmission, distribution and supply of natural gas, third-party access to the network under non-discriminatory conditions and definition of eligible customers, as well as establishment of an independent transmission system operator of natural gas. The secondary legislation is being prepared by the Energy Regulatory Commission, simultaneously with the secondary legislation on other types of energy transported by networks. Secondary legislation shall include tariffs on transmission and distribution of natural gas, as well as conditions for network operation and regulated access of third parties.  
Regional natural gas market 
Activities of the Energy Regulatory Commission The Work Group on natural gas within the CEER WG SEEER was founded in February 2004, and its participant is the Energy Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Macedonia. The aim of the Work Group is to provide the regulatory contribution necessary for development of the regional natural gas market and compliance with the EU Acquis. 
Harmonization and implementation of the EC Directives on impact of energy-related activities on the environment 
According to the obligations from the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the Athens Memorandum of Understanding from 2003, the Agreement with EBRD for conditional delayed purchase of shares in the privatization of the Joint Stock Company Electric Power Company of Macedonia for Production, Distribution and Supply of Electricity, (new), as well as the future Treaty on Energy Community, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia is obliged to prepare a Plan for implementation of Directives directly concerning the impact of energy-related activities on the environment, the Directive 85/337/C on assessment of the effect of certain public and private projects on the environment the Directive 1999/32/EC on the reduction of sulphur content in certain liquid fuels and the Directive 2001/80/EC on Large combustion plants. The provisions of the abovementioned directives have already been incorporated into the package of laws from the area of environment (the Law on Environment - already in parliamentary procedure, to be adopted in the first quarter of 2005, and the Law on Environmental Air Quality (“Official Gazette of RM” No 67/04)).  Based on these laws, a detailed secondary legislation shall be adopted, directly regulating the conditions, method and procedure of implementation of legal obligations. 
4. Indicate your country’s relation with the Trans-European Energy (TEN-E) priority projects concerning electric and gas interconnections (cf. Decision 1229/2003 and Regulation (EC) 807/2004 for Community financial aid in the field of trans-European networks). Recent relevant Commission documents are the proposal for a revision of the TEN-E guidelines (COM (2003) 742) and the Communication “Energy Infrastructure and Security of Supply” (COM (2003) 743). Indicate your country’s relation with the Quick-start projects in Energy Networks specified in the Communication “European Initiative for Growth” (COM (2003) 690). What are the current and future facilities for import/export of energy and what is their capacity/annual throughput?  
Power system The power system of the Republic of Macedonia is currently interconnected with the power systems of Serbia and Montenegro (SCG) and Greece at a voltage level of 400 kV.  The Directive 85/337/C amended by the Directive 97/11/C on assessment of the effect of certain public and private projects on the environment was implemented in the new Law on Environment, which is in parliamentary procedure, and will be adopted in the first quarter of 2005. The Directive 93/12/EEC, amended by Directive 1999/32/EC on decreasing the sulphur content in liquid fuels is implemented in the Law on Environmental Air Quality (“Official Gazette of RM” No 67/04), providing a basis for the Ministry of Economy to adopt Rulebook on Liquid Fuels Quality. The Directive 2001/80/EC on limitation of certain air pollutants will be implemented by secondary legislation which will be adopted on the basis of the Law on Environmental Air Quality (“Official Gazette of RM” No 67/04). Namely, the limit emission values from each thermal power plant will be determined by environmental license, which will be issued by the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning, based on the Law on Environment. In the development plan, the power system of the Republic of Macedonia is connected via the TEN-E initiative through the following interconnections:   400 kV transmission line Bitola (Republic of Macedonia) – Florina (Republic of Greece) The line is ready for construction, and expropriation is completed. The feasibility study and technical studies (main design) were prepared with co-financing of EC within the TEN Programme, where the Public Power Corporation of Greece (PPC) was the main contractor of the project, and the JSC - EPCM was associated contractor to PPC (CONTRACTXVII/5.7100/2/97-014). This project was submitted to the Government of the Republic of Greece in March 2003 for financing from the Programme “Greek Plan on Economic Reconstruction of the Balkans“. Considering the uncertainty as regards the beginning of the programme, a possibility of financing this project from own or other commercial sources is considered;   400 kV transmission line Skopje (Republic of Macedonia) - Niš (Serbia and Montenegro ) For this line, a feasibility study is in a final preparation phase, co-financed by EC as a part of the TEN Programme. The main contractor of the study is the independent Hellenic Transmission System Operator (HTSO), whilst the Electric Power Company of Macedonia is sub-contractor. (CONTRACT No TREN/TEN/-E/2002/5.7100/Z/02-005). This document was submitted to the Government of Republic of Greece in March 2003 for financing from the Programme “Greek Plan on Economic Reconstruction of the Balkans“.   400 kV transmission line Štip (Republic of Macedonia) - Chervena Mogila (Republic of Bulgaria)  The project is in implementation phase. There are ongoing tender procedures for selection of most suitable construction contractors. The physical construction of the line (Overhead Transmission Line-OHTL) is foreseen to commence mid-2005 and to be completed by the end of 2006. This project is being financed mainly by financial support of EBRD, with signed loan agreement amounting to 40,4 million EUR.   Potential connection with Albania, as an option, is being considered within SECI Regional Transmission System Planning project. Additionally, in cooperation with EBRD and the SEETEC project of the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), a project was initiated for preparing a feasibility study on the Corridor East-West, with a possibility of connection to Italy by undersea power cable. This possibility is considered very advantageous and is supposed to have positive influence on evaluation of the other interconnection investments in the narrower region, especially between Macedonia, Bulgaria and Albania.  All high voltage, 400 kV, interconnection lines built by Macedonia have a maximum transmission capacity of 1.200 MW. For determining the real transmission interconnection capacity to each country separately, there are international methods and procedures (UCTE). All the investments, which are carried out and planned by Macedonia, have a significant influence on enlarging the transmission capacities for power exchange among countries in the region and with the European Union. Furthermore, the capacity for exchange with neighbours which is available to Macedonia is currently close to the peak load of the internal system, which significantly surpasses the criterion of 20% set by EU as recommended. Investments in new inter-connections increase the possibilities, diversity and security of Macedonia's power exchange with neighbouring systems, and further, at the same time in the region have essential influence to the possibilities for overcoming potential congestions in the future regional electricity market, as well as in trade and exchange with EU countries.

Gasification system  
The existing main transmission gas pipeline in the Republic of Macedonia is in length of 98 km (Deve Bair - Skopje), the main gas pipeline branches to the cities of 26 km and distribution gas network of 31,5 km with capacity of 800 million m per year and consumption of natural gas of 100 million m per year.  The Republic of Macedonia has a strategic orientation to connect the gas network to networks of the neighbouring countries, mostly by extension of the transmission pipeline towards the Albania, Serbia and Montenegro and Greece. For connection of the countries of Southeast Europe to Italy, a Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) within the framework of Corridor VIII is being considered by the countries in cooperation with some commercial companies from Western Europe. The potential gas pipeline would connect gas transmission systems of Republic of Bulgaria, Republic of Macedonia, Republic of Albania and Republic of Italy. The route of this gas pipeline in the Republic of Macedonia is anticipated to pass from Delevo through Prilep to Struga and would be with length of about 200 km. A feasibility study is currently being prepared for this project. This gas pipeline will have capacity of 8 to 12 billion m/year, and the natural gas would be supplied from Russia and Sub-Caucasian countries. 
5. Could you briefly describe the legal, procedural, technical and environmental frameworks for authorisation of networks? What is the average timescale to complete procedures governing authorisation for the construction of power and gas installations/networks etc.? Do you have plans to improve the timescale and address the difficulties; if so, when and how?  
The procedure for obtaining approval for construction of facilities of public interest (transformer substations, hydro and thermo power plants, gas power plants, biomass power plants, geothermal power plants, wind power plants, pipelines, underground lines) is regulated by the existing legislative (Law on Expropriation (“Official Gazette of RM“ No 33/95, 20/98, 40/99 and 31/03), Law on Spatial and Urban Planning (“Official Gazette of RM“ No 04/96, 28/97, 18/99, 53/21 and 45/02) and Law on Construction of Investment Buildings (“Official Gazette of RM“ No 15/90, 11/91, 11/94, 18/99 and 25/99)). According to the aforementioned regulations, the competent Ministry (Ministry of Transport and Communications), upon a request of the investor, issues the documentation necessary for construction of the object, which is as follows:   Conditions for construction;   Construction approval for the facility; and   Usage approval for the facilities after completion of technical inspection of the facilities. In addition, according to the existing Energy Law (“Official Gazette of RM“ No 47/97, 40/99, 98/00, 94/02 and 38/03), see 14_Annex_01, the Energy Regulatory Commission issues a license for energy-related activities. According to the Law on General Administrative Procedure (“Official Gazette of the SFRY” No 52/56, 10/65, 04/77, 11/78, 09/86 and 16/86, and “Official Gazette of RM” No 44/02), conditions for construction are issued no later than 10 days of application. In order to obtain an approval for construction, the investor should prepare appropriate technical documentation (main design) in conformity with the Spatial Plan of the Republic of Macedonia, which shall contain a Study on evaluation and analysis of the environmental impact and a Study on protection against fires and explosions. After submitting the request with the necessary documentation, the Ministry of Transport and Communications issues the approval for construction within 15 days. After completion of the construction of the facility and after the completed technical inspection of the facilities (confirmed by a Committee established by the Minister of Transport and Communications), a usage approval of the facility is issued. 
According to the Law on Concession (“Official Gazette of RM“ No 25/02) and the Energy Law, concession of an energy-related facility is awarded on a public competition, organized and conducted as an open call procedure or as a limited call concession procedure. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia brings the decision on granting a concession and publishes it in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia and in one of the public media. The procedure of granting concessions is prepared, organized and conducted by Committee established by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, which is obliged to prepare tender documentation and announce a public invitation for bidding for concession. After the deadline for bidding expires, there is public opening of bids and the Committee evaluates and ranks the bidders, and starts negotiations with the highest-rank bidder, and after the completion of the negotiations, the conceder (the Government of the Republic of Macedonia) invites the highest-rank bidder to meet the concession agreement conditions stated in the public invitation. After concluding a concession agreement the procedure is considered as closed. The procedure on granting concessions for water during construction of hydro power plants is conducted according to the Law on Waters (“Official Gazette of RM” No 04/98 and 19/00) and the Law on Concessions, through an open competition. Concession for water exploitation is granted by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia upon a proposal from the competent Ministry (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy). The application for water concession is submitted to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy accompanied by appropriate technical documentation. After reviewing the documentation, optional field inspection of the location and gathering opinions from the competent ministries, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy produces a draft-Decision for commencing procedure of awarding a concession, and submits it to the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, which produces a Decision on commencing procedure and forms a Committee for execution of the procedure. After that, the Committee prepares the tender documentation (with conditions for open competition), and after the approval from the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, the Committee announces an open competition for bidding for concession. The deadline for bidding is 90 days, after which the Committee opens the bids in public and evaluates the bids in a manner and within a period compliant with the evaluation criteria stated in the public announcement and with the tender documentation, and prepares a ranking list which is simultaneously distributed to all bidders and then negotiates with the highest-rank bidder. After that, the conceder (the Government of the Republic of Macedonia) invites the highest-rank bidder (concessionaire) to meet the concession agreement conditions stated in the public invitation, after which both parties conclude the concession agreement. The procedure for granting concessions for detailed geological surveys and exploitation of raw minerals is conducted according to the Law on Mineral Resources (“Official Gazette of RM” No 18/99 and 29/02). The application is submitted to the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, and the Government submits it to the Ministry of Economy, which evaluates the documentation, performs a field inspection of the designated location, collects opinions from the competent ministries and submits a draft-Decision to the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia brings a Decision for granting concession on surveying and exploitation of raw minerals. The time between receiving the application and bringing a Decision for concession for surveying and exploitation is 90 days. For the purpose of harmonization of the existing legislation with the EU legislation, the new Draft Law on Environment includes the fully transposed directive on amending the directive of the Council 337/85 on assessment of the impact of certain public and private projects on the environment 97/11 and the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in Transboundary Context (Espoo). The Draft Law on Environment, which is in a parliamentary procedure and will be adopted in the first quarter of 2005, contains a chapter on Environmental Impact Assessment, which describes the procedure of assessment of the environmental impact (further in the text - EIA). The Government of the Republic of Macedonia will issue a decree (currently in a drafting phase) which shall determine the projects according to which an obligatory procedure of EIA is conducted, as well as the criteria on general designated projects which will need assessment of the need of EIA on individual basis. For all other projects that are not included in the aforementioned decree, a study on environmental impact assessment will have to be prepared.  According to the Draft Law on Environment, the investor who plans a project is obliged to submit a Letter of Intent to the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning concerning the purpose of the project as well as an opinion about the necessity of EIA. After receiving the Letter of Intent, the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning notifies the investor with a Decree about the need of environmental impact assessment. According to the type of the project, the Ministry determines the volume of the study of environmental impact assessment. The Opinion should contain the alternatives which should be considered, a basic overview and the necessary examinations, methods and criteria used for prediction of impact assessment, measures for improvement which should be considered, a list of legal entities which should be consulted during preparation of the EIA study, the structure, contents and volume of environmental information. If projects require EIA, the investor is obliged to prepare a Study on EIA and submit it to the body competent for environmental issues. Upon reception of the study, the competent body prepares a report on relevance of the EIA study. The report may also be prepared by a person authorized by the competent body. The Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning on the basis of the EIA, the report, a public discussion and received public opinions brings a decision on approval or disapproval of the Project. The brought decision causes legal effect in a period of two years after its adoption and its validity period may be prolonged if there are no significant changes occurred during a modification of the project, as a result of the conditions in the affected area, new information in connection with the basic content of the study or development of new technology which might be used in the project. The body responsible for Project Implementation may not issue a decision/permit for implementation of the project without decision on approval or disapproval of the Project issued by the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning and submitted by the investor. In addition, the body which issues permits for implementation of the project is obliged to notify the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning if an application for projects without EIA was submitted. During the whole EIA procedure, the competent body consults the local self-government units on whose territory the project is implemented, as well as the public, the non-governmental organizations from the area of protection and promotion of the environment through providing necessary documentation, announcing and organizing a public debate and publishing on the web page of the Ministry. In the Decision, the Ministry should state the opinions which were considered during its adoption, as well as an explanation on the opinions which were not considered.  Pursuant to the Law the duration of EIA procedure is 120 days, not including the time necessary for preparation of the EIA study (the foreseen periods are reduced to a minimum). It is necessary to mention that the EIA procedure which will be conducted before issuing the approval for construction, as a separate procedure conducted by the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning.  The Draft Decree on determining projects for which an EIA procedure is conducted, in its Annex 1 determines the projects which require an obligatory EIA procedure, among which: 1.  Crude oil refineries (except facilities for production of oils from crude oil) and installations for gasification and liquefaction of 500 tonnes or more of coal or bituminous shales a day; 2.  Thermal power plants and other combustion facilities, with output heat of 300 megawatts or more; 3.  Pipelines for transmission of gas, oil or chemicals with diameter larger than 800 mm and length greater than 40 km; 4.  Installations of overhead electrical cables with voltage of 110 kV or more and length greater than 15 km. The Annex 2 of the Decree determines the projects for which the necessity of AEI will be evaluated individually and by the minimal criteria given in Annex 1 and Annex 2 of the Directive on AEI, which relates to the following projects:) Industrial facilities for production of electricity, steam and hot water; b) Industrial facilities for transportation of gas, steam and hot water and for transmission of electricity through overhead cables; c) Surface storage of natural gas; d) Underground storage of flammable gases; e) Surface storage of fossil fuels; f) Industrial briquetting of coal and lignite; g) Facilities for processing and storage of radioactive waste; h) Hydro power plants; and i) Facilities for exploitation of the wind power, for energy production (so-called wind farms).  The Draft Decree is currently under public debate, after which scope and type of the projects which will require an AEI procedure shall be finally determined.  For the purpose of harmonization of the existing legislation with the EU legislation,  new Law on Construction is in preparation, where the duration for receiving a construction permit is left unchanged, because we consider it to be sufficiently short in the current legislation (15 days). Furthermore, a new Law on Waters was prepared and is currently in procedure of adoption and will be adopted in the first quarter of 2005, which shall determine the procedure, conditions and deadlines for granting a concession on water. In preparation phase are the new Energy Law and the new Law on Mineral Resources (it is expected to be adopted in 2005), which will also treat the procedure on granting concessions. 
6. What is the legislative/regulatory framework for competition in the energy sector? Which are the specific issues that require an adaptation of the existing legislation? In which energy sub-sectors are there State aids (please specify) and in which are there trade barriers and what are these barriers? Which monopolies (e.g. refinery, import/export monopoly, exclusive or special production, transportation or distribution rights) in the energy sector currently exist in your country and what are your plans with them? What is the legislative situation regarding Independent Power Producers? 
The general legislative framework stems from the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, according to which the Republic has an obligation to provide equal legal position for all economic operators on the market, as well as to take measures against monopolistic behaviour on the market. The Constitution stipulates that the freedom of the market and entrepreneurship may be limited only for purpose of protection of the public interest, determined by law. In the Republic of Macedonia the rules on competition in the energy sector are applied according to the Law on Protection of Competition ("Official Gazette of RM" No 04/05). This Law regulates the forbidden forms of disturbing, limiting or violating competition, competition protection, and measures and procedures in connection with limitations of competition. The energy sector is not excluded from the application of this Law. All entities which operate in this sector, regardless if they are public enterprises or private-owned companies, are obliged to a market conduct compliant with the provisions of this Law. In case of competition violation in the energy sector, through forbidden agreements or decisions, agreed practice, misuse of a dominant position or concentrations, authority competent for the procedures is the Commission for Protection of Competition. The existing Energy Law (together with all amendments thereof) and all international Agreements signed by the Republic of Macedonia (the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the Protocol for Accession to the World Trade Organisation, the Energy Charter Treaty etc.) represent a factual legal framework which sublimates the principles of: equal treatment for all entities on the market, i.e. protection against unfair competition, elimination of quantitative restrictions and measures with similar effect, principles of most-favoured nation and national treatment etc. The new Law on Electricity Market and the new Energy Law, which are being prepared, and in accordance with the Programme on approximation of the national legislation with the EU legislation (2004) are planned to be adopted in the first half of 2005 and during 2005 (respectively), shall regulate the issues of establishing a competitive Energy Market. Considering that currently there is no legislative framework for a competitive market, it will be established by the new laws which will be harmonized with Directives 2003/54/EC and 2003/55/EC, complying with requirements of Athens Memoranda and the forthcoming Treaty on Energy Community among the countries of Southeast Europe and the EU. With the enforcement of the Law on State Aid ("Official Gazette of RM” No 24/03), which is in conformity with the EU legislation, a new system of granting and treatment of state aid is introduced. After 2003, there are no more trade limitations and no state aid exists in the field of energy. Since 2004, the exclusive right on import of energy sources is also abolished. Within the electricity sector, the monopolistic structure of the JSC - EPCM is visible through the exclusive position of this enterprise in regards to transmission and distribution of electricity, while in the production, it has a dominant position. This enterprise finished its transformation in the end of 2004, which enabled, through legal separation of the transmission system and the control system, transfer of exclusive transmission rights to the Joint Stock Company MEPSO for Transmission of Electricity and Operation of the Electrical Power System, in state ownership. In the subsequent phase, during 2005, a distributional system-operator shall also be established. Regarding the dominant position on the market and prevention of abuse thereof, this enterprise will be under constant regime of monitoring by the Energy Regulatory Commission. The exclusive rights of the company JSC Makpetrol in the trade and supply of natural gas are attached to the right of operating the transmission gas pipeline system and the branching network, and the main reason for that is the undefined status regarding the ownership of the basic infrastructure, which is currently being disputed. After solving this issue, conditions will be created for necessary institutional structuring of this sector, which shall enable efficient regulation of the dominant positions of the entities by the Energy Regulatory Commission. Within the liquid fuels (oil derivatives) sector, the market behaviour of the dominant production and wholesale companies, regarding the possible abuse of the market position and limiting of competition, will be controlled by the Energy Regulatory Commission and the Commission for Protection of Competition. According to the existing Energy Law, the independent power producers have a right to connect to the energy systems for transmission and distribution of individual energy types on the basis of an agreement with the enterprise which manages the appropriate energy system. The content of that agreement is regulated by the Energy Law. The new legal regulations, which are being prepared, will stipulate regulated access of third parties to energy networks in accordance with the EU energy directives (2003/54/EC and 2003/55/EC). 
7. What is the structure of electricity and gas markets (ownership, concentration, separation of activities)? What are the main sources of energy? What is the structure of tarification for transmission/distribution? Who approves tariffs or tariff methodology? Are there cross-subsidies? Are all consumers connected to the distribution network? What is the rate of collection of bills? Is there a regulator in place? What are its competencies, staff and budget? Is there a Transmission System Operator for electricity in place? What are its competencies? 
Structure of electricity and gas markets (ownership, concentration, separation of activities) 
The Republic of Macedonia signed the Memoranda of Understanding on the Regional Electricity Market in South East Europe and its Integration into the European Union Internal Electricity Market, in 2002 and 2003. Currently, negotiations are underway for signing a Treaty on Energy Community, which is expected to be signed by the EU and countries of SEE in 2005. According to these documents, the following deadlines for opening the electricity and natural gas market are foreseen (Annex I, Energy Community Treaty):   From January 1st 2008, all non-household customers;   From January 1st 2015, all customers. Electricity Apart from the Joint Stock Company Electric Power Company of Macedonia for Production, Distribution and Supply of Electricity, (new), in state ownership, and Joint Stock Company MEPSO for Transmission of Electricity and Operation of the Electrical Power System, in state ownership, other entities which participate the electricity market are the customers, which can be “direct customers” - connected to the transmission network and “distribution customers” - connected to the distribution network. According to the Energy Law (“Official Gazette of RM“ No 47/97, 40/99, 98/00, 94/02 and 38/03), see 14_Annex_01, functions are defined as follows: production, transmission, distribution of electricity, as well as transit and trade. Production, transmission and distribution of electricity are functions of public interest. The transformation of JSC – EPCM is conducted according to the principles contained in the Directive 2003/54/EC. Pursuant to the Law on Transformation of the Joint Stock Company Electric Power Company of Macedonia for Production, Transmission and Distribution of Electricity in State Ownership (“Official Gazette of RM” No 19/04), see 14_Annex_02, the existing JSC – EPCM in state ownership, will be separated into two joint stock companies, as follows:   Joint Stock Company Electric Power Company of Macedonia for Production, Distribution and Supply of Electricity, (new), in state ownership; and 
  Joint Stock Company MEPSO for Transmission of Electricity and Operation of the Electrical Power System, in state ownership. The accounting separation of the assets for production, distribution and supply of electricity was completed before the end of 2003. The legal separation of activities and assets of the transmission system operator was completed on 31.12.2004. Distribution system operator which will be independent in terms of its organization and decision making is expected to be established during 2005. 
Natural gas 
The natural gas market in the Republic of Macedonia is considered to have relatively underdeveloped distributional infrastructure. In the area of natural gas supply there is intensive activity on creating institutional and legislative environment for participation in the future energy market of Southeast Europe and wider. In that sense, appropriate provisions from primary and secondary legislation of European Community are going to be transposed, mainly the EU Directive on natural gas 2003/55/EC, and the provisions from the Energy Charter Treaty, as well as the Protocol on energy transit shall be implemented.  
Main sources of energy 
Natural Gas sector 
Currently, the natural gas sector is supplied through a single transmission pipeline stretching from the border with Bulgaria to Skopje. Only some industries on the territory where this pipeline passes are gasificated. There is an ongoing procedure for determining the ownership rights of the gas pipeline between the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and JSC Makpetrol, and consecutive creation of institutional and legislative environment for operation harmonized with the requirements of the Directive 2003/55/EC. In addition, a gradual transposition and implementation of certain provisions from primary into secondary legislation will be made and they will be put into practice. The same applies to harmonisation of provisions from the Energy Charter Treaty, the Protocol on Energy Transit and the Athens Memorandum. In addition, the increased gas consumption and the increased number of distributional consumers, which are expected as a result of the potential concession projects in preparation, are significant factor for development of this market. 
The oil sector 
The Oil Refinery JSC OKTA Skopje has a dominant position, especially in production, transport and wholesale, and also operates as a supplier of oil derivatives in the Republic of Macedonia. Besides of this company, JSC Makpetrol also has a strategic position on the market of derivatives. Both companies are dominantly privately-owned. By signing the Agreement on purchase of shares and on concession in 1999, between the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and the Joint Stock Company EL.P.ET. Balkanike (controlled by Hellenic Petroleum SA and Meton-Etep S.A.), as a Strategic Investor, more than 54,19% of the shares of OKTA were sold, and by that the Strategic Investor became a dominant owner of the Oil Refinery JSC OKTA Skopje. With additional purchase of shares, this percentage increased to a current level of about 69,46%. 
Thermal and geothermal sector 
Production, distribution and supply of thermal energy for heating are mainly performed in Skopje and, to a lesser extent, in Bitola. The fuel is masut (heavy oil) and natural gas. Production and supply is performed by privately-owned companies. The owner of the distribution network is the Privatization Agency of the Republic of Macedonia, and the network is leased to these companies. This sector is completely privately-owned. Geothermal energy is used for agricultural purposes (heating of greenhouses) in Vinica, Koani, Gevgelija and Strumica, and in Koani it is also used for heating of premises in urban environment. Exploitation, distribution and supply of consumers in Koani are performed by a public company and to the other systems by privately-owned companies. 
The Coal Sector Coal (lignite) is mostly (around 98,5%) used as a primary fuel for production of electricity in the existing thermal power plants in Bitola and Oslomej. Exploitation and transport of this lignite are treated as part of the production process and are entirely a responsibility of Joint Stock Company Electric Power Company of Macedonia for Production, Distribution and Supply of Electricity, (new), in state ownership. The production of coal for the industry is privatized. 
Consumption 
The average total consumption of energy in the Republic of Macedonia on an annual level is around 120.000 . Within the primary energy consumption, crude oil participates with 30%, coal with 51,6%, natural gas with 3%, and the remaining approx. 15% are hydro energy, fire-wood and geothermal energy. The total consumption of energy is covered as follows: 60% from domestic production and 40% from import. 
Structure of tarification for transmission/distribution 
The Energy Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Macedonia prepared a Rulebook on the Method and Conditions for Regulating Electricity Prices (“Official Gazette of RM” No 95/04), see 14_Annex_08, while the new tariff system of electricity is in a preparation procedure and shall be adopted in the first quarter of 2005. Furthermore, the Energy Regulatory Commission shall prescribe and adopt a new Pricing Methodology on natural gas.  Currently, the retail price of individual types of energy is formed according to the Methodology on Pricing of Individual Types of Energy (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 43/98 and 08/01), see 14_Annex_07,,which incorporates the production price, transport price, trade margin, excise duty, taxes and other special duties.   
According to the Energy Law (“Official Gazette of RM“ No 47/97, 40/99, 98/00, 94/02 and 38/03), the Energy Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Macedonia is competent to prescribe a Methodology on pricing of individual energy types, to prescribe tariff systems on individual energy types and to bring decisions on prices of individual energy types.  There are no subsidies in the energy area.  
Connection of the consumers to the distribution network 
There are direct consumers which are connected to the power transmission system of 110 kV directly, while the following are connected to the distribution network: industrial consumers (35 kV, 20 kV, 10 kV, 6 kV, and I tariff level 0,4 kV), households and others (II tariff level 0,4 kV, public lighting). 100% of distribution consumers in the Republic of Macedonia are connected to the single distribution network. 
Collection of bills 
According to the data from the Joint Stock Company Electric Power Company of Macedonia, the percentage of collection of electricity bills is 85%, and separated by categories of customers is as follows:  Households 87%;   Industry 89%, and   Direct consumers 72%. 
Regulatory body, competencies, personnel and budget 
The Energy Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Macedonia is an independent legal entity founded by the Law on Amendments to the Energy Law from June 2003 (“Official Gazette of RM” No 94/02 and 38/03).  The members of the Energy Regulatory Commission were appointed on 23.07.2003 by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, upon a proposal by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. The Energy Regulatory Commission commenced with operations on 01.01.2004.  
Competencies 
According to Article 11-g of the Energy Law, the Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Macedonia executes the following operations:   Ensures reliable, continued and quality supply of energy;   Ensures development of a competitive energy market;   Prescribes conditions for supply of individual types of energy;   Prescribes a pricing methodology of individual types of energy;   Prescribes tariff systems of individual types of energy;   Decides on the prices of particular types of energy, according to the Pricing Methodology, tariff systems of individual types of energy and other legal regulations;   Issues, modifies, withdraws licences and monitors license execution for particular activities from the energy area;   Prescribes rules for connection to energy systems;   Ensures improved protection of energy consumers' rights;   Initiates procedure of adopting laws and other regulations from the energy area;   Participates in resolution of disputes and proposes measures concerning disputes;   According to its competencies and in a legal procedure, suggests measures to the competent bodies against entities breaching the Energy Law;   Adopts Rules of Procedure and other acts of the Regulatory Commission; and   Performs other activities determined by law. The Energy Regulatory Commission is independent in its operations and decision-making, and at least once a year reports to the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and to the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia. The Energy Regulatory Commission performs operations from its scope of activity on public sessions, except in cases when confidential information and business secrets are discussed, concerning which the decision is brought by the President of the Regulatory Commission. The sessions of the Regulatory Commission are convoked and presided by the President of the Regulatory Commission. The Regulatory Commission brings decisions with majority of votes of the total number of members and its decisions are published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia. Individual acts of the Regulatory Commission may be appealed in front of the Appeals Commission on Energy. The appeal does not postpone the execution of the Decision of the Regulatory Commission. Expert and administrative work of the Appeals Commission is performed by the expert office of the Ministry competent for energy matters. 
Personnel 
The Energy Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Macedonia currently employs 19 experts, including the members of the Regulatory Commission. The Regulatory Commission consists of five members. The members and the President of the Regulatory Commission, which is one of the members, are appointed and dissolved by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, upon a proposal of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. The position of member of the Regulatory Commission is professional. The term of office of every member of the Regulatory Commission, except for members of the first composition, is five years, and no member may serve more than two terms of office. The term of office of the appointed members in the first composition of the Regulatory Commission is: for one member - one year; for two members - two years; for three members - three years; for one member - four years; for one member - five years. The term of office of the members of the Regulatory Commission of the first composition may be extended for no more than five years. If a member of the Regulatory Commission is dissolved by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia before the end of his term of office, the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia appoints a new member until the end of the term of office. 
Budget 
The budget for 2005 is 40 million MKD. The operation of the Regulatory Commission is financed from own sources provided from fees collected from the total income of energy-related operators and from charges for the issued licenses.  The Regulatory Commission, before October 1 of the ongoing year submits a draft Financial plan of the Regulatory Commission for the following year to the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, which contains all revenues and expenditures of the Regulatory Commission, including the salaries of the members of the Regulatory Commission and the employees, as well as the fees of the members of the Appeals Commission and their deputies. Within the proposed financial plan, and on basis of the planned revenues for the current year of the energy-related companies, the Regulatory Commission determines the fee for the following year by setting an equal percentage of collection of the total actual revenue of the companies, which must be approved by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and can not exceed 0,1% of the total revenue of the companies. The fee, based on the determined percentage and the total actual revenue in the previous year, is paid by the organisation performing energy-related activities in two equal instalments, the first before April 30, and the second before September 30 of the ongoing year. The unused assets of the Regulatory Commission from the previous year are transferred to the next year and the fee is reduced accordingly. After the finishing of the first year of the Regulatory Commission's operation and before March 31 of the following year, the President of the Regulatory Commission submits an Annual Report to the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and to the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia about the operations of the Regulatory Commission, which also includes the material and financial activities of the Regulatory Commission. The Annual Report on the operations of the Regulatory Commission is also submitted to the Ministry competent for energy-related issues and is published in one of the public media.

8. In the solid fuels sectors, it should be noted that a state aid framework [Council Regulation 1407/2002 of 23 July 2002 published in the Official Journal of the European Communities L 205, page 1]exists for certain categories of coal [Article 2(a) of Council Regulation 1407/2002 defines the categories of coal covered by the state aid regulation as “high-grade, medium-grade and low-grade category A and B coal within the meaning of the international codification system for coal laid down by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe”.]and that other solid fuels having no specific state aid framework (lignite, oil shale, peat etc.) fall directly under the provisions of the Treaty. Does your country produce indigenous coal covered by the state aid framework? 
In the Republic of Macedonia neither exist nor are being exploited categories of coal covered by the framework of state aid (Council Regulation () No. 1407/2002 of 23 July 2002, on State aid to the coal industry), which are classified as high-grade, medium-grade and low-grade category A and B coal within the meaning of the international codification system for coal laid down by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (International system for codification of medium-grade and high-grade coal (1998), International classification of coal in seam (1998) and International system of codification for low-grade coal (1999)). 
9. In the event that your country produces coal covered by the state aid framework, could you please indicate: a) What is your government’s position as regards Council Regulation 1407/2002? Could you provide an overview of your current or future modernisation, rationalisation and restructuring plans for coal undertakings (cf. Articles 4 and 5 of the Regulation)? Does your government have or envisage to have a support scheme for capacity reduction? What are the contents of this scheme and what are the social/regional justifications? b) What are the features of State aid in the sector? Are all elements of State aid currently part of the State budget? Is it planned to include all State aid in the State budget? c) Concerning hard coal, what is your government’s position on achieving a “coal-free trade area” in accordance with EU competition rules, particularly those related to “vertical agreements” (e.g. agreements with coal procedures and electricity producers)? 
In the Republic of Macedonia neither exist nor are being exploited categories of coal covered by the framework of state aid (Council Regulation No. 1407/2002 of 23 July 2002). 
10. With regard to Council Regulation no. 405/2003 of 27 February 2003 [Official Journal of the European Communities, L 62 of 6 March 2003, page 1.] establishing a Community system for monitoring imports of hard coal originating in third countries, is your country in a position to provide the information required by this Regulation? 
The Republic of Macedonia imported total of 63.000 tonnes of coal in 2003, of which 2.100 tonnes were for the purposes of steel industry. For 2004 the planned import was 72.500 tonnes, of which 2.500 tonnes were for the purposes of the steel industry.  
11. All solid fuels: a) Please provide information on the current and recent levels of production of hard coal and lignite. b) Please provide information on any current State aid schemes for indigenous lignite production as well as on plans for their progressive reduction. c) Where solid fuel industries are subsidised and with a view to restructuring, what are the current and future social plans, including those for adaptation of the labour force, and what are the regional conversion plans (e.g. attraction of new business)? 
The total production of lignite in the Republic of Macedonia is from 7.500.000 to 8.000.000 tonnes per year. The Law on State Aid (”Official Gazette of RM“ No 24/03) defines the terms and conditions for granting and utilizing state aid in all areas of economy, except in the areas of agriculture and fishing. Article 2 of this Law determines that every state aid, no matter whether granted through state aid schemes or as an individual aid, which endangers or threatens to endanger competition through favouring certain companies or certain products is opposed to the provisions of this Law, as long as it can affect the trade between the Republic of Macedonia and the European Community. The aid granted contrary to the provisions of this Law will be returned. The aid for export is incompatible to the provisions of this Law. Furthermore, Article 3 defines that state aid is every aid granted by a state aid donor, in every form, which favours certain companies, certain products or certain services. State aid donor is the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, civil administration bodies, local self-government units or other bodies or institutions which provide or are planning to provide state aid.  There are no special programmes for state aid of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia to the domestic production of lignite. In connection to this, there are no special plans on reduction or withdrawal of this type of aid. According to Chapter IV of the Law on Raw Minerals (“Official Gazette of RM “ No 18/99 and 29/02), for surveying and exploitation of raw minerals, where lignite is included, a concession is issued and a concession fee for exploitation is paid. By special decisions determining the criteria and amount of the concession fee for performing detailed geological surveys and exploitation of mineral raw materials by the Government (“Official Gazette of RM“ No 22/03 and 51/03), the fee is determined to 90.000 MKD/km per year for use of the space and 3 MKD/tonnes for produced lignite. On the other side, Article 49 of the Law on Concession (“Official Gazette of RM” No 25/02 and 24/03) determines that granting of concessions does not apply to public companies which before the day of the enactment of this Law use goods of public interest, or perform activity related to these goods, until their transformation to limited liability companies or joint stock companies according to the Law on Public Enterprises or their privatization, unless otherwise stated in the law. The lignite mines AD Brik - Berovo and Drimkol-lignite DOO Struga, whose production is intended for industrial and consumer use (around 100.000 tonnes per year), are paying concession fee for exploitation.  The lignite produced in the Republic of Macedonia is almost entirely used for production of electricity. Considering that the thermal power plants (Bitola I, II and III and Oslomej) are located near the existing lignite deposits, opening of other deposits is planned after the existing ones are exhausted, for the purpose of continuity of electricity production. Because of this, there are no larger changes expected regarding the labour force engaged in the production of lignite for the period until 2025.

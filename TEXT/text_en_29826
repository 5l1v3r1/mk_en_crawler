ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A court in Istanbul on Monday (December 27th) rejected demands by lawyers to replace three judges in the so-called Sledgehammer case, in which 196 former military officers are accused of plotting to oust the government. The lawyers argued the judges are biased, as they ordered the arrest of almost half of the suspects in the very early stages of the investigation, based on weak evidence. 
The alleged coup plan was discovered in January when an anonymous source handed over a suitcase of documents, CDs and audiotapes to the Taraf daily newspaper, allegedly detailing a secret plan by high-ranking military officers to bomb two Istanbul mosques and to down a Turkish fighter jet over the Aegean. According to the indictment, the conspirators hoped to "pave the way for a military takeover by plunging the country into chaos and unrest". A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.

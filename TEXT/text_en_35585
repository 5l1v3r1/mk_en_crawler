SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A government spokesman said Saturday (10 April) that all of the country's troops in Iraq were accounted for. His remarks came in response to claims by a group calling itself the Brigades of Martyr Sheikh Yassin, which said that it holds 30 foreign hostages, including Bulgarians. The foreign ministry in Sofia issued a separate statement saying it had no knowledge of any Bulgarians missing in Iraq. On Sunday, the National Security Council held an emergency session to discuss removing Bulgarian troops from Karbala, Iraq, should the situation there escalate out of control.
In other news, 40 people were injured Friday when a man released tear gas inside a traffic police office in Sofia.

ATHENS, Greece -- Several thousand students, teachers and civil servants demonstrated in downtown Athens on Friday (January 9th) to protest the government's economic policy and planned education reforms, media reported. A group of participants started throwing stones and bottles at riot police. Police officers fired tear gas and made at least six arrests. The rally was the first since Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis reshuffled his cabinet earlier on Wednesday. (Kathimerini, Ta nea - 10/01/09, ANA-MPA, In.news, SKAI, Reuters, AP - 09/01/09)

TIRANA, Albania -- A total of 22 deputies in the main opposition Socialist Party (SP) say that SP should press for early parliamentary elections, a matter that will be high on the agenda during the party congress that begins on Monday (April 9th). The deputies view early elections as the only way out of the political crisis with the Democratic Party (DP)-led government. Others within the party worry, however, about holding new elections so soon ahead of the presidential election expected this summer. Former SP leader Fatos Nano told local Klan TV last week that he might run for president. (Shekulli, Gazeta Shqiptare, Korrieri, Balkanweb - 08/04/07; Albanian News, A1 TV, 24-ore - 07/04/07)

Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic, 24, is playing a season that will go down in tennis history. Now the world's No. 1 seed, Djokovic has raked in 64 victories, won ten titles, was victorious in three out of four grand slam tournaments and has secured the post at the top of the ATP list until the end of the year. 
The Serb also made record-breaking earnings in tournaments in a season -- more than $10.6m. In this latest victory the US Open in New York, he beat former No. 1 Roger Federer in the semifinal, despite Federer's two-set advantage and as many as two match points in the crucial fifth set. 
In the final, Djokovic beat his biggest rival, Spain's Rafael Nadal, in a match described by many experts as a top show. 
However, even after all that, Djokovic told Serbian media he was "hungry" for new victories. 
"I still have a lot to prove to both myself and the tennis world. I want to win many more tournaments and big matches ... Winning on the court is the best part of it all, which is why I will keep on fighting for new cups," Djokovic said.

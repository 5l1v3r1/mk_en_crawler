ZAGREB, Croatia -- Transport and Infrastructure Minister Bozidar Kalmeta easily survived a no-confidence vote in parliament on Friday (December 11th). The main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) filed the motion late last month, shortly after the arrest of officials from Croatian Motorways (HAC), the leading highway operator, for suspected fraud. The SDP claimed that Kalmeta should be held accountable for the corruption scandal within the state-controlled company. (HINA, Nova TV, Bankamagazin - 11/12/09)

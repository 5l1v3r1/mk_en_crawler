LONDON, United Kingdom -- EU foreign ministers are due to gather in Wales on Thursday (1 September) for an informal meeting expected to focus on the launching of accession talks with Croatia and Turkey. Olli Rehn, the EU's commissioner for enlargement, urged the ministers to clear the way for the negotiations with Ankara to begin on 3 October. In separate comments, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso noted that no member state has requested talks be delayed.
On Tuesday, Croatian Foreign Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic told the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee that her country is co-operating fully with the UN war crimes tribunal. Accession negotiations with the EU, originally scheduled to begin in March, have been postponed because of Zagreb's failure to hand over a top war crimes indictee, Ante Gotovina.

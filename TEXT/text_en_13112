SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The central government will introduce a Value-Added Tax (VAT) of 17 per cent across the country on 1 January, Prime Minister Adnan Terzic said Tuesday (27 December). This "risky, radical step," he said, would make the country's tax system compatible with those in the rest of Europe. A special team has been appointed to monitor prices to make sure merchants do not use the new tax as an excuse for price hikes. BiH is also revamping its customs structure and regulations in a bid to stamp out corruption, smuggling and tax evasion. (Nezavisne novine - 28/12/05; AP, PBS BiH, Fena, RTRS - 27/12/05)

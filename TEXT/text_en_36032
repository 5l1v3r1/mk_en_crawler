PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Kosovo government began reconstructing apartments in Pristina on Saturday (27 March). Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi visited the site together with other officials. He said 5m euros have been set aside to fix the more than 280 Serb homes that were destroyed or damaged during two days of ethnic violence earlier this month. Rexhepi promised to work for reconciliation between the two ethnic groups, and again denounced the acts of violence. Francesco Bastagli, the UN deputy chief officer in Pristina, said the reconstruction effort was "modest but encouraging", adding that the government of the province has much more work to do.
In other news, EU security chief Javier Solana told European leaders during a closed session in Brussels on Friday that they must remain focused on Kosovo to prevent the Serbian province from descending into violence once again. (BBC, Reuters, B92, Beta, Tanjug - 27/03/04; AP, AFP - 26/03/04)

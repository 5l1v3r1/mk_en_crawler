SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said on Thursday (February 18th) in Sarajevo that BiH's future is within the EU. After talks with Prime Minister Nikola Spiric, she pointed out that the Union stands ready to help the country achieve this goal. Ashton acknowledged the progress made in meeting criteria in the visa liberalisation roadmap, but noted that constitutional changes are needed for BiH's further EU integration. Spiric said he expects no additional conditions for including BiH in the visa-free regime. From Sarajevo, Ashton heads on to Belgrade and Pristina.

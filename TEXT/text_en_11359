BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu promulgated the ratification law Wednesday (25 May) for the EU Accession Treaty that was approved by parliament last week. The treaty, which was sealed in Luxembourg in April, stipulates Romania's entry in the EU in January 2007, together with neighbouring Bulgaria. 
Also Wednesday, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu asked all cabinet ministers to communicate efficiently with a special panel of 56 EU advisers and follow their recommendations for realisation of EU accession criteria. Tariceanu stressed that some ministries need to enhance collaboration with the advisers so expertise is not wasted. (Rompres, Nine o'clock, Romanian Government Web site - 25/05/05)

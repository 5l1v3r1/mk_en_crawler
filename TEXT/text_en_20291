NEW YORK, United States -- Croatia won a seat on the UN Security Council on Tuesday (October 16th) after a tight race with the Czech Republic. In the first round of voting, 95 countries backed Croatia, compared to 91 for the Czech Republic. Zagreb's support grew to 106 in the second round. After losing ten votes in round two, the Czech Republic dropped out of the race. This marks the first time Croatia will hold a non-permanent seat on the Council. It will replace Slovakia at the end of the year and serve as Council member for the next two years. (AP, AFP, Reuters, Vecernji List, Vjesnik - 17/10/07; Javno.com, Reuters, HRT - 16/10/07)

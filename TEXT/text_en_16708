ISTANBUL, Turkey -- The European Commission and European lawmakers urged Turkey on Thursday (6 April) to grant Kurds more economic and cultural rights, and voiced concern over violence in the country's southeast. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan responded sharply to the MEPs, noting they failed to refer to the violence linked to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The government insists that members of the PKK encouraged recent incidents that killed 16 people and injured more than 300. 
Also Thursday, Erdogan repeated his call for a democratic solution to the Kurdish issue. He asked the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) to declare the PKK a terrorist group and condemn recent violence, in order to launch a dialogue with the government.

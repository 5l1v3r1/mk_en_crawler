BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU security chief Javier Solana said on Monday (26 September) that talks on Kosovo's status should start by year's end. Addressing a conference of the EU Institute for Security Studies, Solana said the talks must result in a comprehensive solution for the province. UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen also has called for launch of the status negotiations by the end of 2005. Despite shortcomings in the implementation of standards, he said, the UN and its member countries understand that the province cannot remain under UN administration forever.

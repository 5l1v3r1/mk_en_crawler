ZAGREB, Croatia -- NATO's Assistant Secretary General for Political Issues, Guenter Altenburg, praised Croatia on Wednesday (9 March) for significant achievements in defence reform. He is leading an expert mission responsible for the annual assessment of implementation of the third stage of the Membership Action Plan. While acknowledging Croatia has made considerable progress in meeting criteria for joining NATO, Altenburg stressed that full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal remains a major condition.
On Thursday, EU foreign ministers are meeting in Brussels to discuss whether to go ahead with the scheduled launch of accession talks with Croatia on 17 March. A final decision will be made on 16 March. The European Commission said Wednesday that Croatia's failure to arrest fugitive war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina raises a broader question about the rule of law. The same day, Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said the government is preparing a response to chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte, who remains critical of Zagreb's level of co-operation with the tribunal.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Thirty-five Kurds were arrested on Monday (April 25th) in an ongoing investigation against the Kurdistan Associations Union (KCK), an organisation affiliated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The detainees include two deputy mayors of Hakkari and the local leader of the main pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP). The arrests drew strong criticism from the BDP. About 20,000 people joined a sit-down protest, while around 10,000 set off to attend a march in the neighbouring province of Van. (Zaman - 26/04/11; Bianet, Hurriyet, Anadolu news agency - 25/04/11)

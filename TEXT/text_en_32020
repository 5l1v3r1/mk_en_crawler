TIRANA, Albania -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte met with Albanian government officials during a visit to Tirana on Friday (18 October), thanking them for past co-operation but insisting on more information about war crimes committed in Kosovo. In particular she is seeking assistance that would lead to the arrest of members of the former Kosovo Liberation Army and wants information refugees from Kosovo may have provided about genocide underway there.

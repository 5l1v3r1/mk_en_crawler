PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The two biggest parties -- the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), led by former Kosovo Liberation Army leader Hashim Thaci, and late President Ibrahim Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) -- have agreed to form a government together to lead the province to independence. The PDK will hold seven portfolios in the new cabinet, while the LDK will get five ministries. That leaves three for ethnic minorities, including Serbs. The PDK won 34.3% of the votes in the November 17th election, compared to its main rival, the LDK, which got 22.6%. Thaci, who will head the next cabinet, said one of his main goals would be to root out corruption.
Speaking on Wednesday (December 26th), outgoing Prime Minister Agim Ceku said his government has prepared Kosovo for independence. Among the cabinet's achievements, he cited contributions to the Kosovo status process and internal stability. Among the challenges faced were problems in the judicial system and in fighting corruption. He rejected any attempt to divide Kosovo, warning this could cause trouble in countries populated by ethnic Albanians.

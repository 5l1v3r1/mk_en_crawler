SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A regional prosecutor from Ruse, suspected of links to organised crime, has stepped down, the Supreme Cassation Prosecution announced on Monday (24 July). Lyulin Matev's resignation followed repeated demands from Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev, who cited the results of an internal investigation that indicated a connection between Matev and a local racketeering gang. Velchev also is seeking the resignation or dismissal of a second prosecutor, Nikolay Ganchev, suspected of similar links. (Sega, Monitor - 25/07/06; Darik - 24/07/06)

TIRANA, Albania -- Greek authorities are allowing Albanian immigrants to visit their country for the June 28th general elections. The Greek Interior Ministry said on Wednesday (June 10th) that all Albanian immigrants can go home twice this year and come back to Greece legally, between late June and late September. Albanians living outside their homeland continue to be barred from casting votes from countries to which they emigrated. The main opposition Socialist Party has vowed to change that if it wins.

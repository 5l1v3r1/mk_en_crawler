TIRANA, Albania -- The ODIHR Election Observation Mission has released its third interim report on the 3 July parliamentary elections, focusing this time on the ballot counting process and the handling of complaints and appeals. According to the document presented Tuesday (19 July), the counting process was generally smooth. In some zones, however, it was delayed, disorganised and occasionally contentious, the report said. Noting the large number of appeals filed with the Central Election Commission, the international monitors said all complaints should be reviewed and political pressure avoided.

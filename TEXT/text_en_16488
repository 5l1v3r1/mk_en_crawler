SOFIA, Bulgaria -- NATO is asking Bulgaria to consolidate its participation in Alliance peacekeeping missions, it was announced after talks between NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe General James L. Jones and Bulgarian Army chief General Zlatan Stoykov in Mons on Tuesday (October 10th). The defence ministry says NATO wants the country to send fewer but larger missions that can serve under Bulgarian command. Currently, Sofia has 628 troops in four peacekeeping operations -- including Iraq and Afghanistan -- and plans to contribute a frigate to the UN force in Lebanon.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters in Pristina that he is prepared to meet with his Serbian counterpart, Boris Tadic, should UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari suggest it. He was responding to comments last week by Ahtissari's spokesman, who said the envoy planned to organise such a meeting. Local media on Saturday (24 June) quoted Sejdiu as saying he was "very encouraged" by the results of his recent visit to the United States, where he met with US Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice and other officials.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH army needs at least 1,300 new soldiers, Deputy Defence Minister Igor Crnadak said on Monday (November 5th). The ministry is expected to announce a recruitment drive within weeks. The army now consists of 10,000 professional soldiers, 1,000 civil staff and some 5,000 reservists. After defence sector reforms, Crnadak says there is a surplus of officers but not enough soldiers. (RTRS, Focus - 05/11/07)

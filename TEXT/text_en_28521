TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition bloc led by the Socialist Party (SP) announced on Sunday (November 14th) plans for a new wave of protests aimed ultimately at bringing down the government. The SP accuses it of trying to control all institutions in the country. Opposition parties say they have offered to end the political crisis with the ruling coalition in return for a thorough investigation into materials used in the June 2009 general elections, which the opposition believes was marred by serious violations. The Democratic Party-led government, however, insists that any request should go through the courts. The SP also plans to initiate a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Sali Berisha and Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli because of the 2009 vote.

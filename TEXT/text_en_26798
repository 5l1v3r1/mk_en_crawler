PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The answers to the European Commission's (EC) lengthy questionnaire have been translated and will be delivered to Brussels by Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic on Wednesday (December 9th), European Integration Minister Gordana Djurovic said on Saturday. She added that the answers will be made public once the consulting process is over and the country has responded to any additional questions from the EC. Djurovic pointed out that several thousand state officials, local and foreign experts helped prepare the answers. Based on Podgorica's responses to more than 2,100 questions, the EU will assess its readiness for membership. Montenegro hopes to obtain candidate status next year and launch accession talks by 2011.

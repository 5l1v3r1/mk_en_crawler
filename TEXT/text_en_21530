BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government said on Monday (October 27th) it intends to block a controversial new law granting a 50% raise to teachers. Labour Minister Mariana Campeanu and Chamber of Deputies Speaker Bogdan Olteanu said the cabinet plans to introduce an emergency decree blocking the raise until parliament drafts a new law on public-sector salaries. President Traian Basescu signed the increase into law Friday, triggering sharp criticism from the government, which argues the move will cause an economic crisis.
In related news Monday, the far-right Greater Romania Party (PRM) announced it will support a no-confidence motion initiated by the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL) over the teacher wage issue. "If this government can't apply parliament's decisions, if it can't act as a government, it must go," PRM deputy leader Lucian Bolcas said. On Saturday, PDL leader Emil Boc said his party would call for a no-confidence vote if the government blocked the 50% raise. (Ziarul Financiar, Mediafax, Hotnews, NewsIn, Reuters -27/10/08)

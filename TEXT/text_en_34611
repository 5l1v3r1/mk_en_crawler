ATHENS, Greece -- In a letter sent to Prime Minister Costas Simitis on Wednesday (27 August), Defence Minister Yiannos Papantoniou submitted his plan to reform the country's armed forces. The proposal calls for hiring an additional 13,700 professional infantrymen and reducing the length of conscripted military service to less than 12 months.

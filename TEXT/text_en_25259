PRISTINA, Kosovo -- US Ambassador to Kosovo Christopher Dell says Washington supports the strategy formulated by the International Civilian Office (ICO) and the Kosovo government. The plan hopes to extend the authority of local state institutions to the northern part of the country. Belgrade-backed "parallel structures" in the north are tied to criminal structures, Dell said on Tuesday (January 26th) in Pristina, after meeting with Justice Minister Nekibe Kelmendi, who thanked the US government for its continuous support. Belgrade is angry over the new strategy and Spain, current holder of the rotating EU presidency, says UNMIK was not consulted about it. (KLAN Kosova, KTV, RTK, TV 21, Arta - 26/01/10)

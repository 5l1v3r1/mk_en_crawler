PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica made his first visit to Kosovo on Wednesday (May 7th) since the former province declared independence on February 17th. Kostunica travelled to the northwestern town of Zubin Potok, where he opened a sports hall and held a campaign rally ahead of Sunday's Serbian elections. "To preserve Serbia in Kosovo means telling the truth -- that it belongs to Serbia and the Serbian people," Kostunica told about 1,000 supporters. Pristina leaders condemn such campaigning on Kosovo's territory. Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu said on Wednesday that candidates "are persona non grata" and urged UNMIK to respond to those attempting to fan tensions.

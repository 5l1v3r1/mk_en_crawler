ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday (19 January) that no one should expect early general elections in Turkey this year. He said his ruling Justice and Development Party is determined to complete its five-year term and that the next general elections will be held, as scheduled, in the second half of 2007. Erdogan cited a poll published this week in the Vatan newspaper that suggested no party would win enough votes to form a majority cabinet on its own if elections were held now. (NTV - 19/01/06)

WASHINGTON, United States -- Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said on Monday (October 27th) the Bush administration will soon abolish visa requirements for Bulgarians and Romanians travelling to the United States. The two Balkan states will receive invitations to join the United States' Visa Waiver Programme (VWP) in the next couple of months along with others, including Poland and Malta, Chertoff said ahead of a tour of EU countries recently included in the VWP. Chertoff denied recent media reports that Washington blocked Greece from the list in retaliation for its preventing Macedonia's accession to NATO. He said Greece will join the VWP after signing required agreements. The Bush administration's refusal to include all EU member states in the programme has strained relations between Washington and the EU. Earlier this month, the European Commission threatened to take punitive measures against the United States if Washington fails to include other EU nations in the VWP by year's end.

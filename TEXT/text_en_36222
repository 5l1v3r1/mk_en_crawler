SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Authorities have set a new date -- 12 March -- to submit the country's EU membership application, according to a government source cited by the local press. The long-awaited procedure was planned for 26 February in Dublin, but was postponed due to the death of Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski. (Dnevnik, MIA - 04/03/04)

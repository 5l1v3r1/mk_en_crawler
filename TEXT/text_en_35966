ATHENS, Greece -- Public Order Minister Giorgos Floridis is due to travel to Washington on Thursday (15 January) to meet with the heads of the CIA and the FBI, as well as Attorney General John Ashcroft and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. He is expected to discuss security for the Athens Summer Olympics. Greece plans to hold a drill next month, as well as one on March, in which US security personnel would participate. Defence Minister Yiannos Papantoniou says all NATO countries have been involved in the security planning.
In other news, Greek opposition New Democracy party leader Costas Karamanlis proposed a list of guidelines Monday to be followed by all candidates in the 7 March parliamentary elections.

ATHENS, Greece -- An Athens court on Friday (4 August) handed down a 25-year prison sentence to a former judge convicted of corruption. Leonidas Stathis also was ordered to pay a fine of 71,020 euros. His name surfaced in a trial-fixing scandal last year, when he was accused of taking bribes from lawyers in exchange for favourable sentences for their clients. Seven lawyers received four-year sentences. 
In other news, Justice Minister Anastasios Papaligouras announced on Saturday that the ministry is drafting a new bill aimed at combating corruption in the private sector. The measure is in line with Greece's obligations as a member of the Council of Europe. (Kathimerini, NET TV, ANA-MPA - 05/08/06)

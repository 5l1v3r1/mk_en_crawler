SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Dozens of journalists protested in central Sofia on Thursday (September 25th), demanding a crackdown on organised-crime groups after an assault on a news editor. Four men beat up Ognyan Stefanov, editor-in-chief of the online news provider frognews.bg, as he left a Sofia restaurant Monday. He is recovering from serious head injuries, broken legs and spinal trauma. Some of his articles exposed links among government officials, politicians and crime bosses. Parliament approved a declaration Thursday condemning "this brutal assault" and "all attacks on the freedom of speech". (Mediapool, Dnevnik, Netinfo, BTA, Darik, Reuters - 25/09/08)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The business community must lobby leaders to focus on urgent economic reforms, Principal Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian said in a speech to the BiH Foreign Trade Chamber on Tuesday (September 11th). Gregorian added that abandoning nationalistic and populist rhetoric would be crucial to the country's economic success. "As long as the parliaments are unable to enact and implement the reform programme ... BiH will not be able to attract and retain the investment needed to create jobs and lift the country out of poverty," he said. 
In Brussels Tuesday, High Representative to BiH Miroslav Lajcak spoke before one of the EU's key foreign policy panels. He noted that despite broad public support for EU integration, BiH political leaders seem unable to co-operate. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 12/09/07; OHR web site, RTRS - 11/09/07)

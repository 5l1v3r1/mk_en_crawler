ANKARA, Turkey -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer arrived on Thursday (19 February) for his first visit to Turkey, meeting with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul. Erdogan suggested it would be appropriate for NATO to assume a role in Iraq, to which de Hoop Scheffer responded that an UN-approved, legitimate government should be established there first. Gul pledged active participation in such a mission if NATO plans to undertake one. (Anadolu Agency, NTV, TRT 2 - 19/02/04)

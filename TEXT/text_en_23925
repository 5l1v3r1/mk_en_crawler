PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon has asked the government to wait until his visit to Belgrade this week before officially dismissing Kosovo Serb police officers, local media reported on Wednesday (March 18th). The Serbs left their jobs to protest Kosovo's independence and asked the international community to put UNMIK police officers in charge of police stations in Serb-dominated areas. During a meeting of the Joint Rule of Law Co-ordination Board in Pristina on Tuesday, de Kermabon said Brussels officials were pressuring the Belgrade authorities to resolve the matter.
In other news, a bomb exploded in the northern part of Mitrovica on Tuesday, causing property damage. Police, EULEX and KFOR special units are investigating the incident.
Also Tuesday, the government marked the fifth anniversary of a deadly rampage against Kosovo Serbs by vowing it would never be repeated. Unrest broke out in March 2004, with ethnic Albanians attacking Serb enclaves, driving residents from their homes and destroying their property. It left eight people dead, hundreds injured and several Orthodox churches damaged or destroyed. In Serbia, meanwhile, many Orthodox churches held memorial services. Both President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic said those who commit violent acts against Kosovo Serbs have gone unpunished.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- After polls closed Saturday (26 October) evening, the OSCE announced that turnout was barely over 50 per cent, and far lower among the Serb population, except in the five municipalities where they have the majority - Leposavic, Novo Brdo, Strpce, Zubin Potok, and Zvecan. UNMIK chief Michael Steiner attributed the low turnout to conflicting and often negative messages from Serb political leaders. Steiner has indicated he views the local elections as a test of the province's decentralisation plan, aimed at securing wide representation for Serbs. At stake in Saturday's vote were 920 posts in 30 local assemblies, sought by some 5,700 candidates from 68 political entities. Preliminary results are expected late Monday.(B92, Tanjug, AFP, Euronews - 27/10/02; Koha Ditore, AP, Reuters, AFP - 26/10/02)

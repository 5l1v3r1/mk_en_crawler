THE HAGUE, The Netherlands/BELGRADE, Serbia -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has asked the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) to order prosecutors to disclose documents allegedly proving a secret immunity deal he made with former US special envoy for the Balkans Richard Holbrooke, the ICTY said on Friday (November 7th). Holbrooke has repeatedly denied that in July 1996 he promised Karadzic immunity from the UN tribunal if the Bosnian Serb abandoned politics.
In other news Friday, the Serbian procurator's office said a protestor's death stemmed from injuries he sustained in battling police during a pro-Karadzic demonstration in late July. The authorities will prosecute those responsible for the death of Ranko Panic, 41, prosecution spokesman Tomo Zoric said. The Serb Radical Party asked for Interior Minister Ivica Dacic's resignation.

BERLIN, Germany -- Authorities arrested three Turkish nationals Thursday (November 6th), on charges of having played leading roles in a Turkish far-left organisation in Germany. The three, a woman and two men, allegedly belonged to the terrorist wing of the banned Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front (DHKP-C). Prosecutors issued a statement saying the three face charges of supplying funds, smuggling weapons and recruiting members of the organisation. The DHKP-C is considered a terrorist organisation in the United States and Europe. It has claimed responsibility for a series of murders and terrorist attacks in Turkey since 1970.

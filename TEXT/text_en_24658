SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Central Bank Governor Kemal Kozaric says that since BiH has a 200m-euro quota in the IMF, the country can request up to 1 billion euros an assistance. Speaking on Friday (April 3rd), he acknowledged that BiH will slip into recession this year, since the deficit accounted for 14.6 % of GDP in 2008 and the unemployment rate is of 23%, including the grey economy. Talks with a team from the IMF will begin on April 15th. (AFP, Reuters, Fena, Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 03/04/09)

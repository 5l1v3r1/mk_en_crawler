BUCHAREST, Romania -- The main opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) on Monday (7 February) called for establishment of a special parliamentary committee to investigate allegations of fraud during the November 2004 general elections. The ruling coalition has accepted the idea of a probe by parliament and wants it discussed by parties represented there. Several reports of fraud -- mostly involving the then-ruling PSD âsurfaced during the November vote, but the Central Election Bureau insists the elections were fair.

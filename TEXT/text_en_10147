BOSTON, United States -- Federal prosecutors have charged a Bosnian Serb with filing false documents and lying about his role in executions in Srebrenica when he sought to immigrate to the United States. Marko Boskic, 40, was a member of the 10th Sabotage Detachment, which carried out executions of Muslims in Srebrenica. If convicted, he could face US prison time and extradition to Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he could be tried as a war criminal. 
In other news, prosecutors asked the UN tribunal to sentence two Bosnian Serbs to 32 years and 15 years respectively for their role in the Srebrenica massacre. Vidoje Blagojevic was the commander of the Bratunac brigade. Dragan Jokic was chief of engineers in the Zvornik brigade. (AP, UPI, AFP - 29/09/04)

MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Dozens of divers celebrated the reopening of the medieval Old Bridge in the town of Mostar on Sunday (24 August). They participated in the tradition of 20-metre thrill jumps in the waters of Neretva River, marking the end of the physical barrier between the two halves of town. The Old Bridge, or Stari Most, collapsed during the regional arms conflict in 1993, becoming a symbol of ethnic division in the town. The major phase of reconstruction work was completed on Friday, before a crowd of Muslim and Croat residents. Work will continue for several more months, with the bridge open to traffic in the spring. (AFP - 24/08/03; Onasa - 21/08/03)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- US Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs Daniel Fried urged Athens and Skopje to work together with UN envoy Matthew Nimetz to resolve their bilateral name dispute. Fried said that Washington fully backed the UN-mediated negotiations between Macedonia and Greece -- which does not recognise its neighbour's constitutional name "Republic of Macedonia" for historical reasons -- on finding a mutually acceptable solution. Fried also said the United States believed in Greece's readiness to be a good neighbour to Macedonia, adding that the name dispute was the sole open issue between the two.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Croatia closed three more EU negotiation chapters at an intergovernmental conference Wednesday (December 22nd) in Brussels. This brings the total number of provisionally closed chapters up to 28, leaving seven more to be completed. EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele commented that the country has made significant progress over the past year. The government hopes to close the remaining chapters by mid-2011, including the most difficult ones, on competition and the judiciary. (Hina, HRT, Poslovni Dnevnik - 22/10/12)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The UN has ordered peacekeeping missions around the world to suspend use of rubber bullets, the AP reported on Thursday (July 12th), citing UN Police Commissioner in Kosovo Richard Monk. The decision was made in response to the deaths of two protesters at a pro-independence rally in Kosovo in February. An investigation later found that the rubber bullets were years past their expiration date.
Also Thursday, Self-Determination movement leader Albin Kurti, whose group staged the February protest, was released from jail. He was arrested on February 10th and charged with initiating violence. (AP, Telegrafi, RTK, B92 â 12/07/07)

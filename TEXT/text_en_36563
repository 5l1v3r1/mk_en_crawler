ATHENS, Greece -- The Summer Olympics will cost about 6 billion euros, Deputy Finance Minister Petros Doukas said Wednesday (4 August). The initial budget for the Games was 4.6 billion euros, but construction delays and extra security measures have resulted in overruns. Doukas also said Greece's budget deficit could reach 4 per cent of GDP, exceeding the EU's mandatory ceiling.
In other news Wednesday, members of the US track and field team arrived on the island of Crete. The US women's soccer team will be joining them there. The biggest names in track and field are scheduled to arrive in Crete next week.
Meanwhile, the government is already at work trying to decide on the future use of 100m euros' worth of equipment bought specifically for the Games. This includes hotel equipment, automobiles, electronic hardware, medical equipment, electrical appliances, and audiovisual devices. The government has also printed up leaflets to hand out during the Games, indicating appropriate prices for dozens of basic goods and services, in a effort to prevent price gouging by vendors.

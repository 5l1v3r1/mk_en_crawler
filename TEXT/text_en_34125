BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Parliament began its summer recess Thursday (17 July) without adopting the action plan on economic harmonisation between the republics of Serbia and Montenegro. Members of the federal parliament were expected to look at the plan during an extraordinary session, but discussion was put off until at least 1 September, when the legislature resumes work.

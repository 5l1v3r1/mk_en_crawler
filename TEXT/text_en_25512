TIRANA, Albania -- The European Commission (EC) will publish a report on April 15th regarding Albania's progress in meeting criteria for EU visa liberalisation. A similar evaluation will be made for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH); a high-ranking EC official was quoted as saying on Wednesday (March 24th). Brussels has reportedly urged officials in Tirana to focus efforts on increasing public awareness. Citizens have to understand that the easing of visa restrictions does not give them right to seek work and asylum in the so-called Schengen states. Rather, they are allowed to spend up to 90 days as tourists. (Shqip, Shekulli - 25/03/10; Top Channel, Lajmifundit, Top News - 24/03/10)

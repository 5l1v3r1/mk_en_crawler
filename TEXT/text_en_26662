ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament is set to discuss the government's so-called Kurdish initiative on Tuesday (November 10th). For the past three months, the cabinet has been preparing the public and political parties for the initiative, which aims to halt terror attacks and bring peace to Turkey's Kurdish-dominated southeast. Interior Minister Besir Atalay is expected to brief parliament Tuesday about the project's general framework, goals and limits. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is to speak to parliament about it later this week. (Anadolu news agency, UPI, World Bulletin, Zaman - 10/11/09)

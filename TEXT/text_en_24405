WASHINGTON, United States -- The IMF announced on Friday (May 8th) it has approved Kosovo's application for membership, confirming reports by Kosovo officials earlier in the week. The IMF's executive board has certified an earlier vote by the Board of Governors to offer membership to Kosovo, the IMF said in a statement. The country will become a member once its representatives sign the relevant documents at IMF headquarters in Washington. On Saturday, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci welcomed the news. "Together we will achieve great results," he told a press conference in Pristina. (Beta, Tanjug, B92, MINA, AFP, Xinhua - 09/05/09; Reuters, DW, DPA, New Kosova Report - 08/05/09)

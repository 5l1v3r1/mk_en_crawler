SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government announced on Friday (14 March) that it would support a British plan for the peaceful disarmament of Iraq. Foreign Minister Solomon Passy said the draft creates "a prospect for a new consensus and a breakthrough in the position of the Security Council members." Bulgaria is a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, and has backed the United States, United Kingdom, and Spain in their efforts to disarm Saddam Hussein's regime. Passy also expressed surprise over a statement by Guenter Verheugen, the EU commissioner for enlargement, which voiced disappointment with the Bulgarian and Romanian positions on Iraq. Romanian Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana cautioned against reading too much into Verheugen's statement, calling for a temperate response. (AP, AFP, Reuters, Mediafax - 14/03/03)

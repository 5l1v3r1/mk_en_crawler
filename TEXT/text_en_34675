ZAGREB, Croatia -- Double world skiing champion Janica Kostelic, who is recovering from a second knee operation, told local media before Croatia's friendly match with England on Wednesday (20 August) that she desperately wanted David Beckham's shirt. She did not say why, but noted she was not a collector of football memorabilia. Boris Zivkovic, the captain of Croatia's football team, came through, announcing Thursday that he had a shirt and would be presenting it to Kostelic. (AFP - 21/08/03)

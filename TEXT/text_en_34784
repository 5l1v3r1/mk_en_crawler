MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown told the press Friday (8 August) that the international community and local authorities in BiH have stepped up efforts to arrest war crimes suspects Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. He was responding to a letter from local intellectuals which criticised the Office of the High Representative for what it described as insignificant efforts to nab the principal war crimes indictees. Ashdown said he believes the two former Serb leaders will appear in court shortly. (HINA, BBC - 08/08/03)

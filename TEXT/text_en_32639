SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The leaders of the major religious faiths in BiH pleaded Saturday (28 December) for the preservation of ethnic peace and tolerance in the federation. The plea was in response to the Christmas Eve (24 December) murders of a Bosnian Croat and his two daughters, allegedly by a Muslim extremist. Catholic Cardinal Vinko Puljic, Muslim leader Reis-ul-Ulema Mustafa Ceric, President of the Jewish Community Jakob Finci and Serb Orthodox Metropolitan Nikolay all urged ethnic and religious communities to refrain from violence and be tolerant of others. The murders provoked a massive response throughout BiH, as various organisations and political parties are questioning the security of non-Bosniaks in the country. (HINA, PBS, RTRS - 28/12/02)

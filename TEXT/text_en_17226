ZAGREB, Croatia -- In an interview published by the Zagreb daily Vecernji list on Wednesday (December 27th), President Stipe Mesic said the appointments of ambassadors and diplomatic staff should be based on expertise, rather than on who is currently in power. His comments come less than a week after Croatia's Foreign and European Integration Ministry acknowledged a scandal in the United States last year involving a Croatian diplomatic official's husband, who was convicted of drug possession in Los Angeles.

As movie theatres gradually close their doors in Serbia, a long-cherished form of entertainment and recreation is coming to an end. One of the main reasons, people in the waning industry say, is the lack of serious government action against movie piracy. 
In March 2006, under the threat of international sanctions, the government publicly burnt 347,456 pirated CDs and DVDs. While the action raised expectations of a serious campaign against violators of intellectual property, it turned out to be a one-time effort. 
Loss of ticket sales is one of the factors that has forced Beograd Film, the country's largest cinema company, out of business. It will be auctioned on Friday (February 16th). With 18 movie theatres in Belgrade alone, the company was once worth an estimated 20m euros. Now the price will likely be less than 5m euros, out of which 2m euros will go towards paying off debts. 
Unpaid for months, the employees and management of Beograd Film went on strike late last year. As a result, half of the capital's cinemas were closed to moviegoers. With ticket sales declining steadily over the past 15 years, the strike was simply the last nail in the coffin. According to general manager Miroslav Cenic, the company's illustrious history ended with only 13% of seats being sold. 
For moviegoing Belgraders, the options have narrowed. Only a few multiplexes are open in the capital on the regular basis, and even these are in trouble. 
As long as one can buy the latest blockbuster on the street for a fifth of the box office price, cinemas will be at a huge disadvantage. The loss is felt not only by moviemakers, distributors and cinema owners, but also by those who like watching movies the traditional way -- in front of the big screen.

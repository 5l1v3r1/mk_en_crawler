BUCHAREST, Romania -- Justice Minister Tudor Chiuariu announced on Sunday (December 9th) that he will resign to allow an investigation against him to take place. He told reporters that he did not want political wrangling to damage the credibility of institutions and hamper the work of the judiciary. Prosecutors want to investigate the minister in connection with a real estate deal that involved former Telecommunications Minister Zsolt Nagy. Chiariu's critics contend that he assessed a plot of land at 5m euros, while the actual value could have been 20 times higher. The minister denies any wrongdoing, saying he is the victim "of a ridiculous frame-up". Basescu publicly called for Chiariu's dismissal last week.

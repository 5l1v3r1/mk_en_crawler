SOFIA, Bulgaria -- US Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg met with senior officials Thursday (June 3rd) to discuss co-operation and Bulgaria's NATO involvement. After talks with Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, Steinberg expressed satisfaction with Bulgaria's partnership and praised the country's contribution to NATO's mission in Afghanistan. He also commended Sofia's efforts to implement judicial and economic reforms, as well as its support for the Euro-Atlantic integration of other countries in the region. Borisov reiterated Bulgaria's Euro-Atlantic orientation, saying "frequent visits by high-ranking American officials and guests underscore the US support for the Bulgarian government, and for our uncompromising fight against corruption and organised crime, as well as for our intention to adhere to strict fiscal discipline." Steinberg was in Sofia one week after Leon Panetta, director of the US Central Intelligence Agency. Borisov and Steinberg also discussed the planned US missile defence shield in Europe, as did Steinberg and Foreign Minister Nikolay Mladenov. (DPA, Novinite, Focus - 03/06/10)

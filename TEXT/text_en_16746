TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament's Law Committee decided on Tuesday (6 June) to extend by one year the deadline for completing the real estate restitution and compensation process. That means all such cases should be wrapped up by the end of 2008. Though the extension gives owners more time to exert their rights, lawmakers admitted they cannot agree on an exact compensation regimen. (Albanian News - 08/06/06)

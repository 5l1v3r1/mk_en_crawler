ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish police have arrested two suspected al-Qaeda supporters in the central Turkish town of Konya, local media reported Saturday (19 November), citing local officials. The detained men, a father and son, were allegedly preparing bombs for future attacks. Police found electronic devices for the remote detonation of explosives, as well as documents suggesting links to the al-Qaeda organisation.
The son, identified as Ibrahim O., was released from jail earlier this year after serving a two-year sentence on terrorism charges in connection with the November 2003 suicide bombings in Istanbul. Dozens of people died in those attacks, which targeted two synagogues, the British consulate and the Istanbul offices of HSBC Bank. (Reuters, TurkishNews.com, Anadolu Agency - 19/11/05)

ATHENS, Greece -- A blast rocked central Athens Monday (12 December) morning, damaging several buildings and cars. There were unconfirmed reports of two injuries. An anonymous caller warned the police about the attack some 30 minutes before the blast, giving them time to clear the area. Authorities believe that the nearby Economy Ministry was the target. The blast coincides with a national strike by transportation workers, who are protesting government plans to amend public sector labour laws.

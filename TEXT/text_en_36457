SOFIA, Bulgaria -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer arrives in Sofia on Thursday (13 May), his first visit since he assumed his post and the country became a NATO member. He told the local daily Trud that a main topic of discussion would be NATO's request to Bulgaria and the other new members to provide more troops for Alliance missions as soon as they feel prepared.
In other news, the Sofia Appeals Court upheld on Wednesday a lower court's decision to suspend Sofia Mayor Stefan Sofianski from his position until a probe into alleged corruption is completed. Prosecutors say Sofianski damaged the state by selling a mall six years ago at a fraction of the market price. (Info Radio, Trud, Dnevnik, 24 Chasa - 13/05/04; Mediapool - 12/05/04)

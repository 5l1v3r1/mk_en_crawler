TIRANA, Albania -- Authorities have seized an apartment in Kukes belonging to an Arab man with suspected links to al-Qaeda. Abdul Latif Saleh, 48, a resident of Albania since 1993, is accused of receiving 496,000 euros from Osama bin Laden to set up a terrorist group in Albania. Officials say he has also acted as a business partner to Saudi national Yasin Qadi, designated a "global terrorist" by the US Treasury Department. The authorities have already frozen more than 2m euros in accounts under Saleh's name, as well as Qadi's assets. (AFP - 20/01/06)

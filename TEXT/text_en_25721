VANCOUVER, Canada -- Croatia's Ivica Kostelic won the silver medal in Sunday's (February 21st) Super-combined ski competition, rocketing through a run just .33 of a second behind Bode Miller of the United States. Kostelic, 30, underwent a seventh knee surgery two months ago. On hand for the medal-winning run were his parents and sister, Janica, who won six Olympic medals of her own before retiring in 2007.

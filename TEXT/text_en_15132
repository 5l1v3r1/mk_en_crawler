LONDON, United Kingdom -- Not enough is being done to prevent the trafficking of children in Southeast Europe, according to a report by UNICEF released on Wednesday (30 August). The report is particularly critical of Romania, Moldova, Albania and Kosovo, warning thousands of children were smuggled from these areas into west European countries to be used in the sex trade, slavery, or for begging. The report expressed particular disappointment with Kosovo, where despite the UN and UNICEF presence, the issue has been neglected.
In other news Wednesday, female unionists from 36 countries gathered in Podgorica for an international forum on the problems of working women. Representatives of the European Commission, the US and the European Confederation of Syndicates also participated. (Albanian News - 31/08/06; AKI, MINA - 30/08/06)

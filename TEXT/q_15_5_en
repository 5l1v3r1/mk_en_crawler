4. Does your country have the necessary administrative capacity, including human and material resources, to fulfil the requirements laid down in the Community legislation listed above?  
There is a legal, regulatory and administrative framework governing the areas which are included in the Community Action Programme in the field of public health. 1.  The Constitution guarantees the right to health care to all citizens of Macedonia, and the right and obligation to protection and improvement of our own and the health of others. The Republic of Macedonia has signed and has been implementing all international acts referring to protection of the health care rights and prevention against discrimination, which have been incorporated in the national legislation such as: The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR); The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR); -  The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD);  The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW); -  The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment;  The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC);  The European Social Charter.  Every citizen of the Republic of Macedonia is entitled to health care in accordance with the Law on Health Care (“Official Gazette of the RM” Nos.38/91, 46/93, 55/95, 17/97, 10/04), see 13_Annex_03 and the Law on Health Insurance (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” Nos. 25/00, 34/00, 96/00, 50/01, 11/02 and 31/03) that establish rights and obligations pertaining to the health insurance, procedure for obtaining health care services, and the system and organisation of the health care delivery. . These laws, including the secondary regulations pertaining to the communicable diseases and  safety of blood and blood products, directly or indirectly refer to the regulation of the health care of the population, viewed  in the context of  the objectives of the Decision 2002/1786/EC (for more details see 13_V_A_2_1). After the independence of Macedonia, the new Constitution introduced significant changes in the health system, allowing transition from a decentralised to a centralised health system based on the principles of comprehensiveness, accessibility, and continuity of the health care. The Law on Health Care adopted in 1991, had established the Fund for Health Insurance under the purview of the Ministry of Health. Additional forms of health insurance were also introduced. Preventive health care for the population was separated on the basis of distinguishing the interests and the needs of the state regarding this segment while ensuring the financing of the preventive health care from the Central Budget. Since 1991 the private health institutions in Macedonia have been established in parallel to the public health institutions. With adoption of the Law on Health Insurance, in 2000 (“Official Gazette of the RM” Nos. 25/00, 34/00, 96/00, 50/01, 11/02 and 31/03), and with the view of implementing the model of mandatory health insurance, the Health Insurance Fund of Macedonia has been established as a sole and independent financial institution effective on the entire territory of the country. The Health Insurance Fund has its branch offices in municipalities where the insured persons can exercise their health care rights. All the funds for mandatory health insurance are collected by the Health Insurance Fund and the Fund ensures the payment for the health services delivered in a uniformed way, as well as that the, health sector and the health care services covered by health insurance  are financed accordingly. The centralized financing of the health care has achieved the following: Financial stability of the system; Regional equity with regards to resource allocation; Reduction in the administrative costs of the system. The Law on Local Self-Government (“Official Gazette of the RM” No.5/02) was adopted in 2002 with an aim to enable the  decentralisation of public services at a local community level by granting the local authorities the right to participate in the management of the primary health care facilities through participation of the their representatives in the managing boards of the primary health care institutions, promotion of health and healthy lifestyles, surveillance of communicable diseases, health education of the population, monitoring of the general health condition and participation in dealing with health problems of certain vulnerable categories of population. The health care rights are exercised in the existing health care system consisted of public and private health care organisations. Health care is easily accessible by the population because its provision is organized within a wide network of health care organisations which allows for approximately 90% of the population to be able to receive health care services   in less than 30 minutes. According to the data provided by  the National Public Health Institute,  in 2002 there were 24,428 public sector employees, out of whom 4,573 physicians. There were 487 physicians in the private sector health care delivery. In effect, by  including this number into the total number of physicians the coverage ratio is  399 inhabitants per 1 physician or 2.5 physicians per 1,000 inhabitants. The latter implies that the primary health care standards have been met. Health care delivery is organised at three levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. The primary health care is the basis for the entire healthcare system and it enables delivery the basic health care at municipal level. The delivery of primary health care is organized through 3 healthcare stations, 18 health centres and 16 medical centres that provide primary and secondary health care. The amendments to the Law on Health Care (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 10/04) require the medical centres to be restructured into independent healthcare institutions for primary healthcare and hospitals), i.e., into 462 medical units for general practice, 77 for occupational medicine, 84 medical units for health care of children at the age from 0 to 6, 63 units for health care of school children, 50 for women’s health care, and 334 for dental care. The primary health care in rural areas is delivered in 293 medical units, 152 of them with full time employed physician. More than half of the total number of physicians (approximately 56%), i.e., a quarter of the specialists, are engaged in the primary health care.( for more details see 13_V_B_3). Monitoring of the health status of the population and surveillance of the environmental health factors The Republic of Macedonia pays special attention to the prevention of diseases at all levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Specialised preventive health care is carried out by the National Public Health Institute based in Skopje and 10 regional public health institutes. In addition there are 21 local/branch offices of the regional institutes based in: Skopje, Veles, Kumanovo, Stip, Kocani, Strumica, Ohrid, Prilep, Bitola, and Tetovo. This territorial distribution covers the entire territory of Macedonia and provides full coverage with specialised public health services. As of 1993, regional public health institutes have become independent health care institutions responsible for performing public health functions regulated by the Law on Health Care. The on-going decentralisation activities shall expand the authorities of these institutions at municipal level. This process has been compliant with the Decision 1786, or more specifically, with the activities planned to take part at the municipal level, and with the identification of the healthcare priorities as basis for work on the healthcare strategies. REGIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTES  The processes of the healthcare system reform and the process of decentralisation particularly the ones affecting the public health functions, impose the need for reorganisation of the public health institutes  with a view to  enable their  functioning in a reformed public health system and in compliance with the Decision 1786. The National Public Health Care Institute at central level and the public health institutes   monitor the health status and health care of the population in their regions and collect and analyse  health statistics data in accordance with the Law on State Statistics (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 54/97), the Programme for Statistical Research (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 69/03), the Law on Keeping Healthcare Records (“Official Gazette of the SFRY”  No. 22/78 and “the Official Gazette of the RM”, No. 15/95), the Law on Keeping Healthcare Records (“Official Gazette of the SFRY” Nos. 22/78, 18/88 and the “Official Gazette of the RM” No.15/95), and the Law on Health Care (“Official Gazette of the RM” Nos.38/91, 46/93, 55/95, 17/97, 10/04) (mentioned in Chapter 1). Communicable and non-communicable chronic degenerative diseases as referred in the Decision, such as AIDS, cancer, addiction diseases, injuries, etc. are covered as well as other diseases of socio-medical significance reported to the data registries kept at the National Public Health Institute Special –attention is paid to the health education and health promotion in general, and to the aforementioned diseases and conditions, in particular. The public health institutes also monitor the environmental health risk factors. The specialised preventive health care is regulated on annual basis by the Programme for Preventive Health Care (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 25/04) which defines activities, their scope, carriers executors, time schedule, resources and available funding. The measures, tasks and activities defined by the Programme also provide for the enforcement of the provisions of a large number of laws regulating the issues on surveillance, research, and study of the health status of the population, reasons for the occurrence and spreading of communicable and other diseases of socio-medical significance, and the impact of the environmental factors on the health status, proposing and undertaking measures for protection and advancement of the health status of the population. The Cancer Registry is the tool for compiling reports on malign neoplasms from all health care organisations in the country through the public health institutes. The additional source for reporting the malign neoplasms are the histological findings of malign neoplasms, records of the deceased with the malign neoplasms as the cause of death and records of patients  hospitalised and treated of malign neoplasms. The registry is computer maintained according to all determined modalities: gender, age, place of residence, date of reporting, histological findings and stadium of the disease. The National Public Health Institute provides technical and methodological assistance related to the reporting and keeping records on the malignant diseases. In order to comply with the requirement stipulated with the Law on Keeping Records in the Field of Health, records will be kept for non-communicable diseases, too. Reports will also be collected on diabetes, ischemic heart diseases, kidney failures, psychoses, alcoholism and other addictions, occupational diseases, rheumatic fever, intoxications and traffic caused trauma. The establishment of data registries on these diseases is currently underway and to that effect computer programs have been developed by the National Public Health Institute. The data registries will issue respective publications. The publication “Registry on diabetes for 2003” is under preparation. Publications on diseases of socio-medical significance will be prepared based on data processing of the non-communicable diseases registries. The data will be presented according to several parameters: morbidity, structure, gender, age, place of residence (rural-urban), municipalities, health care organisations, etc. The activities on the monitoring of the health indicators under the “Health for All” by the World Health Organisation continue. The basis  for the collection of the  health indicators is a table overview specifically prepared by the WHO by using data from the regular routine reports and conducting special surveys; The National Public Health Institute and the regional public health instituteswill implement the EUPHIN–EAST software program in order to modernise the processing and presentation of health statistical data.  Pursuant to the principles of the World Health Organisation defined in the framework health policy for the European region presented in the “Health for All”, and based on the data on health status of the population, the data on diseases and deaths caused by certain diseases, and the occurrence of specific health problems, review of the developments in the area of health care, the Ministry of Health has identified priorities targeting the advancement of health care. To this end, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Macedonia established a National Coordination Expert Body for Advancement of Health Care in June, 2000. This body consists of representatives of several governmental and non-governmental institutions and organisations. The National Coordination Expert Body for Advancement of Health Care has been promoted into the National Committee for Health Care Advancement. Priority task of this body is development of a National Strategy for Health Care Advancement which is to define the national policy and targets to be met including an action plan for its effective implementation. The public health institutes are specifically in charge of performing the following tasks:  -  Health education regarding the healthy lifestyles (physical activity, proper nutrition, non-smoking, stress management, and conflict resolution); -  Health education regarding the prevention against diseases and deaths caused by cardiovascular, malignant, respiratory diseases, diabetes and injuries (injuries at work, at home and in traffic accidents); -  Health education regarding the improvement and promotion of living conditions (nutrition, water supply, waste disposal and protection of the population from air pollution). Based on the data collected and processed by the National Public Health Institute, reports, analyses, and programmes are being developed for the following purposes: 1.  Health education of health care workers in the primary health care regarding the drugs addiction prevention in the Republic of Macedonia; 2.  Conditions in the specialist -consultative care ; 3.  The status of the addiction diseases and alcoholism in the Republic of Macedonia in 2003; 4.  Utilization of the hospital capacity in the health care organisations in the Republic of Macedonia; 5.  Health status of population and health care delivery in the Republic of Macedonia; 6.  Status of the nursing activities in the Republic of Macedonia; 7.  Analysis of the hospital morbidity and mortality in the Republic of Macedonia in 2003; 8.  Conditions and problems of the chronic kidney failures in the Republic of Macedonia; 9.  Conditions and problems of diabetes in the Republic of Macedonia; 10. Material and financial condition of the health sector in the Republic of Macedonia; 11. Screening of medical status of pupils and students. Public Health Related Promotion, Education and Information on public health 
National info server for public health The national info server for public health is established as part of the co-operation between the Ministry of Health and the Open Society Institute, as stipulated by the Memorandum of Co-operation signed between the two parties. The Project ”National Info Server for Public Health” has been implemented by a team of experts from the public health sector, the Ministry of Health, the Health Insurance Fund, the National Public Health Institute and the Faculty of Medicine, financially supported by the Open Society Institute. The goal is to provide access to the web oriented public health information to be available for the health care workers – healthcare service providers and the beneficiaries of health care services. In order to provide additional information on public health, there are several links on the web page for relevant local and international institutions. There are special web-oriented instructions, based on the current legislation and in accordance with the WHO standards and recommendations on the environmental indicators, and on surveillance of injuries. A pilot web-oriented prototype registry for traffic traumas has been developed and tested. The Declaration of the World Health Organisation on the Rights of Patients provides better information to the citizens about their rights as patients. The glossary of terms used in the health sector reforms will help the web-page users to be able to easily keep up with the reforms of the health system. The web page (www.medicaleducation.org.mk/isph) enables the health care workers to use and exchange information – mainly the physicians, in order to improve their knowledge on health statistics, data collection and archiving, creation and use of data bases via the Internet. It will result in high-quality information on health statistics which are aimed to be the basis for planning and management of the health sector. 
Public Health Center  The Public Health Center has been established within the Faculty of Medicine financially supported by the Open Society Institute, and technically supported by the Brown School for Public Health from Jerusalem, Israel. A curriculum of post graduate public health studies has been developed and accepted by the Faculty of Medicine, harmonised with the Law on Higher Education and with the global criteria of ASPHER. The first class of 40 students attended the first year of studies; open competition for admission of the second generation is underway. The need for experts in public health has been also confirmed by the Ministry of Health and the healthcare organisations. One of the priorities of the Ministry of Health is improvement of the health care organisation management, especially of hospitals.  
Human Capacity Building on Public Health in Municipalities The on-going Project ”Healthy municipalities: Health Management and Administration” has a goal to build human resources capacity that will provide quality local public health services, in the context of the Law on Local Self-Government and decentralisation of public services, and in compliance with the Decision 1786. The Project is carried out by education of local teams in four modules. The outcome will be competent persons on the local level in the executive and political authorities, professionals from the public health and the community, the civil society, who will prepare local Health Care Strategies. The third module is being prepared. The Project will continue in 2005. The following local plans and strategies in the Republic of Macedonia are prepared for implementation: National Health and Environmental Action Plan of the Republic of Macedonia; -  National Action Plan for Food and Nutrition (adopted by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia in 2004); Healthy and Safe Environment Strategy (HESME). 
Prevention against malignant diseases Malignant neoplasms are the second cause of death of the population in Macedonia and they are high on the rank of the total number of diseases. The malignant neoplasm surveillance is regulated by the Law on Keeping Healthcare Records (“Official Gazette of the SFRY” No. 22/78 and “Official Gazette of the RM”, No. 15/95), and the Law on Keeping Healthcare Records (“Official Gazette of the SFRY” No. 22/78, and “Official Gazette of the RM” No. 15/95). The reports on malignant neoplasms are gathered by the regional public health institutes from the healthcare organisations under their territorial jurisdiction and then are forwarded to the National Public Health Institute. The National Public Health Institute keeps a registry on malignant neoplasms, analyzes the data and prepares information with proposed measures for prevention (please find enclosed the report or go to the web page www.medicaleducation.org.mk/isph). The National Public Health Institute performs surveillance of the environmental factors influencing the health status of the population exposed to these factors. The working environment is also responsibility of the Institute of Occupational Medicine.  The Ministry of Health undertakes certain activities for primary prevention of breast cancer and cervix cancer.  Prevention of communicable diseases and AIDS The National Strategy on the HIV/AIDS was adopted in 2003 when the Republic of Macedonia submitted the application and was granted by the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia develops a Programme for Prevention of HIV/AIDS every year (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 25/04). Prevention against dependence disorders National Strategy on Tobacco Control and Action Plan on Prevention against Problems Caused by Alcohol Abuse are currently under preparation. The goal is provision and improvement of health status of the population of the Republic of Macedonia.  A National Programme on Eradication of Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking was adopted (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 35/96). Prevention of Injuries The percentage of injuries is high in the Republic of Macedonia, taking the third place in the structure of death causes. The public health institutes collect and process the data on injuries registered under the morbidity statistics, and the reports on traffic trauma (please find enclosed or go to the web page www.medicaleducation.org.mk/isph). he National Public Health Institute keeps a registry on traffic trauma and prepares related information.  A Study on Socio-Medical Aspects of Traffic Traumatism with Children and Youth in the Republic of Macedonia was developed in 2002. The State Statistics Office is responsible for mortality statistics that includes injuries in general, and traffic accidents in particular. The traffic accidents prevention is regulated by the basic Law on Traffic Road Safety (“Official Gazette of the RM” No.14/98 and the latest amendments made in June, 2004). Having adopted the Strategy of the World Health Organisation (WHO) “Health for All” until 2000 and the Strategy “Health for All in the 21 Century”, the Republic of Macedonia has shown its commitment to direct its strategic activities towards achievement of these goals.  There is a plan for development of a Strategy for Prevention against Traffic Traumatism which will be based on the appropriate strategy of the WHO. One of the priorities of the two-year agreement for co-operation with the WHO is fight against violence. The following documents and activities are planned to be prepared during this timeframe:  National Report on Violence and Health (gathering of information from the official statistics and the non-governmental sector has been initiated), establishment of national task force, and capacity building for development of National Action Plan for Violence Prevention. Cooperation between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy has been established to implement the legislation on recording the incidence of violence and on prevention of family violence, and all other forms of violence. 2. 2.

1. Document COM(2000) 285 final, and the programme of Community action in the field of public health (Decision 2002/1786/EC) sets out the health strategy of the European Community. Does your country have a health strategy set out in a legal document? What are the main priorities? Are activities being implemented in these areas? If so, give a brief description. 
Activities to begin with the development of a Health Strategy are underway. This process is continuous and supported technically by the WHO and the World Bank financed Health Sector Management Project. Since there is no long term health care strategy, the priorities are determined annually with preventive programmes and policies for specific fields, or biannually as part of the co-operation between the Ministry of Health, the WHO and UNICEF.  The Health Sector Transition Project, completed in 2003, set out strategic documents as a base for the activities that were completed up to the present, the on-going ones, as well as for the future activities that will have to be taken in the health sector by the Ministry of Health .  Strategy for Organisation and Financing of the Primary Health Care Strategy for Continuous Medical Education and Specialisation in Primary Health Care Strategy for Accreditation of Physicians Strategy for Perinatal Health Care Strategy for Tuberculosis Control Strategy for Pharmaceutical Policy he component 1 of the new Health Sector Management Project, financially supported by the World Bank loan for the period between 2004 and 2008, refers to the health policy, and is focused on designing a general Health Strategy, and strategies for primary health care, information technology (IT), pharmaceutical policy, quality of health care, privatisation, and public relations. Reform activities in the health sector are presented in detail in the answer to question 13_V_B_3
Public Health Priorities The public health priorities in Macedonia are defined every year by vertical preventive programmes funded by the central budget of the state and the Health Insurance Fund which provides coverage for all the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia. he vertical programmes are adopted by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia.  The Programme for Preventive Health Care defines the priority public health activities, i.e., of the specialised preventive health care.  In addition to the Programme for Preventive Health Care (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 25/04), the rest of the vertical programmes are as follows: -  Programme on Research of Incidence , Prevention and Eradication of Brucellosis with the Population of the Republic of Macedonia (2004) (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 25/04); Programme on Preventive Measures for Prevention of Tuberculosis with the Population of the Republic of Macedonia (2004) (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 25/04); -  Programme on Obligatory Immunisation of the Population of the Republic of Macedonia (2004) (“Official Gazette of the RM No. 25/04); -  Programme on Protection of the Population from AIDS (2004) (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 25/04);< -  Programme on Medical Check-ups of Pupils and Students (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 25/04);< Programme on Health Care of Certain Groups of Population and Certain Diseases of Citizens without Health Insurance in the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 24/04);< Programme on Active Maternal and Child Health Care in the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 24/04);< -  Programme on securing  funds for patients treated with dialysis, securing medicine for transplantations and securing citostatics, insulin, growth hormone and treating patients with haemophilia in Republic of Macedonia  for 2002 (“Official Gazette of the RM“ No. 24/04); -  Programme on Organisation and Improvement of Blood Donation in the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 24/04);< -  Programme on Health Care of Persons with Mental and Dependence Disorders in the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 24/04). 
Two-year co-operation Agreement with the WHO Specific priorities of the public health are covered by the two-year co-operation agreement between the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organisation, Regional Office in Copenhagen. The two-year co-operation agreement between the Regional Office for Europe of the World Health Organisation and the Government of the Republic of Macedonia for the period 2004- 2005 was elaborated in details after subsequent negotiation steps between the Ministry of Health and the WHO Office. The health priorities of the country, presented by the health care authorities represent a starting point of the process leading to development of this document. While determining the other health priorities of the country, for the 2004-2005 period, the global priorities and trends of the policy, contributions from other partners to the country and the capacity of the WHO were taken in consideration.  These cooperation priorities have been further reflected in the priorities of the WHO for the European region.  The Agreement is a framework and may be altered upon mutual written consent of the Regional Office for Europe of the World Health Organisation and the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Macedonia.    The Regional Office for Europe wil particularly support the coordination with the WHO headquarters in Geneva, in order to maximise the efficiency of interventions in the country according to the principle of “one WHO.”  As a result of the negotiations between the Republic of Macedonia and the Regional Office of the WHO for Europe, the following fields have been set as priorities of the two-year-co-operation agreement for the 2004-2005 period: Health policy and development of the system (Decentralisation); Pharmaceutical sector ; Communicable diseases surveillance; Mental health and drug abuse; Maternal and children health care (including also the improvement of gender relations); Environment and health (with an emphasis on labour medicine); Disaster readiness and response; - Food safety; HIV / AIDS; Persons with special needs; -  In case additional funds are available in the period of agreement duration, the following priorities shall be taken into consideration: Hospital health care reforms; Nursing and obstetrics; - Non-communicable diseases; - Tuberculosis; obacco. 
Cooperation with UNICEF The UNICEF five-year framework programme for the period between 2004 and 2005 sets forth the cooperation priorities with a particular emphasis on the early child development cluster and HIV/AIDS protection. The programme will be applied through annual plans of activities. Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015 The improvement of the Roma health status as well as the health status of other minorities and vulnerable groups is one of the main priorities of the public health. The Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015 is a result of the commitment of the European Union (EU) and the acceding countries for improvement of the general conditions of the Roma population in Europe. The goals and priorities, the framework, and the dynamics of implementation of activities have been defined.  The Ministry of Health will participate in the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015 by taking part in the National Healthcare Action Plan based on the Millennium Development Goals The procedure for development of the Draft National Action Healthcare Plan is underway.  Millennium Development Goals The Millennium Development Goals are global objectives set out by the world leaders on the Millennium Summit in September, 2000. They represent a serious attempt to reduce poverty, its causes and manifestations. The Millennium Development Goals focus the efforts of the international community on the achievement of essential and measurable improvement of the living conditions.  The Millennium Development Goals are an assigned framework which will be appropriately adapted to the develoment needs of the Republic of Macedonia: 
Eradication of poverty and hunger; 
Universal primary education; 
Promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women; 
Reduction of infant mortality rate; 
Improvement of maternal health; 
Programs against HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases ; 
Providing sustainability of the environment;  
Developing a global partnership for development.  
The eight objectives complement each other and they are directed towards reduction of all forms of poverty, and towards promotion of the widely accepted standards of behaviour for better health, promotion of legal regulations, social and environmental conditions that reduce the risk and improve the living condtions of individuals and of the community. The specific socio-economic, cultural, and political attributes of this region, as well as the selection of the appropriate indicators should be taken into consideration when applying the Millennium Development Goals, he World Bank (World Development Indicator Database) database for development is basis for the completed assessment of the possibilities for achieving the Millennium Development Goals of the countries in the region that will not be admitted in EU in 2004. According to the data available at the World Bank, it seems that the Republic of Macedonia has realistic chances to achieve three of the millennium development goals closely related to the improvement of health and prevention: Reduction of infant mortality rate;  Improvement of maternal health;  Programs against HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases.   However, there are no data on the depth of poverty and access to clear water which are also of an enormous importance for the public health.  To achieve the millennium development goals, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia cooperates with UNDP in a joint project for Development of a National Report on the Millennium Development Goals, establishment of thematic working groups for the millennium goals, co-operation with the Government officias responsible for the millennium development goals, creation of database with defined indicators for monitoring of the implementation of the millennium goals in the process of EU integration.One of the priorities of the public health action is health and environment protection and improvement, with a special emphasis put on the occupational medicine. This will be accomlished with the activities planned within the two year cooperation agreement between the Regional Office of the WHO and the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Macedonia for the period between 2004 and 2005,within the Occupational Health Institute, considered as  WHO cooperation  centre. As a contemporary public health approach, the main fields covered are: improvement of occupational health, occupational medicine and protection at work, and safe management of the living and working environment. To reactivate the defined priority, the elements of the  Council Resolution on a new Community Strategy on Health and Safety at Work 2002-2006 (2002/ c 161/01) are planned to be incorporated. The anticipated activities should provide development of a national occupational health programme, development of new models of occupational health services as an infrastructure of this segment of the health care system, by strengthening and harmonization of the national policies and legislation on  occupational health with the documents of the ILO, WHO, and EU. The National Strategy for Health, Environment and Safety Management in Enterprises – HESME) which is a joint programme of the WHO and ILO in co-operation with the European Commission initiated by the Ministry of Health in the Republic of Macedonia several years ago and which is currently in an adoption phase, also supports the development of the overall strategy for health advancement.  he goal of the Strategy is protection and improvement of occupational health and safety at work and improvement of the working ability and welfare of the employees. It is a process of comprehensive improvement and promotion of occupational health including all interested parties within and out of the enterprises, and represents an effective system of management of enterprises, where issues related to health, safety and healthy environment are integrated in the enterprise development strategy his provides quality of the environment and the health of the whole population,  encouraging people to reconsider their own health and the health of their families taking into consideration the environment, lifestyles , the professional and social determinants influencing the health and the quality of health care. The best practices of the HESME should be the base for implementation of the goals of the “Safe Work Programme” according to ILO and in accordance with the principles of ”Cleaner Production Strategy” supported by the UNEP.  The best practices of the HESME will contribute to achievement of the EU standards defined by the Amsterdam Treaty (Articles 137, 152, 174, 153). At the same time, the HESME Programme is included in the activities of the Public Health Programme of the EU for 2001–2006 (Commission of the European Communities, Proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council adopting a Programme of Community Action in the Field of Public Health 2001 – 2006, Brussels, 16/5/2000) emphasizing the need for connecting the public health with the other health related initiatives, such as occupational health and safety at work, environmental policy, and development of a comprehensive health information system that will provide new efficient public health through HESME, promotion of occupational health, and also by adjustment of these instruments to the national and local needs. The implementation of the Strategy goals presumes a multidisciplinary, multi-sectoral and multi-level approach. The Occupational Medicine Institute, being a reference centre of the World Health Organisation, will permanently act towards complete application of the Strategy in line with the local Occupational Health Agencies engaging all available professional and other resources. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia adopted the Action Plan for Food and Nutrition in April, 2004. he Strategy for HIV/AIDS of the Republic of Macedonia for 2003-2006, which is a framework for development, implementation, surveillance, and evaluation of program activities on HIV/AIDS was adopted at the end of 2003. he Project for Elimination of Iodine Deficit in the Republic of Macedonia was completed in 2003. A Strategy for Mental Health which promotes the approach to mental health in the community departing from the old institutional and asylum model of treatment of people with mental disorders is being prepared. 2. The European Commission produced a Health Status report with regard to the Member States of the EU in 2000 (please note that a revised version was posted on the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate-General’s web-site in 2003). Please provide similar information on the health status of the population in your country. This should include information on key health indicators such as gender specific and combined infant mortality and life expectancy; patterns of mortality and morbidity; situation with regard to communicable and sexually transmitted diseases.

Life Expectancy According to the data of the State Statistics Office of the Republic of Macedonia, life expectancy at birth for both genders was 72.49 years during the 1996-1998 period, 74.68 for women and 70.37 for men.

Communicable diseases In the Republic of Macedonia 48 communicable diseases important for the whole country are subject to mandatory reporting. To monitor, prevent, and eradicate those diseases based on the Law on Protection of the Population from Communicable Diseases (Official Gazette of the RM No. 66/04) and the measures and activities of the Programme for Preventive Health Care, annual Plans and Programmes are developed and actively implemented by all the preventive healthcare institutions, coordinated and directly supervised by the Sector for Epidemiology and Microbiology at the National Public Health  Institute in Skopje.  
A review on some communicable diseases : 
HIV/AIDS There have been 64 cases of HIV/AIDS registered in the Republic of Macedonia conclusive to 31/12/2000: 48 infected and 16 HIV positive persons. The first HIV positive case was registered in 1987, the first infected in 1989, and the first deceased person from AIDS in 1990. Heterosexual contact (with 28 persons) is the dominant way of HIV virus transmission (with the 48 infected persons). Gender distribution indicates that there are more men (34) infected than women (14). The most vulnerable age group is the one between 30 and 39 (17 persons), followed by the  age group between 20 and 29 (12 persons). More than 65% of the diseased are registered in three municipalities of the Republic of Macedonia (Skopje, Tetovo, and Prilep). The situation with the HIV positive persons is very similar to the one with AIDS, i.e., there are 10 men out of 16 HIV positive, heterosexual contact is the dominant way of transmission and the age group from 20 to 29 is dominant with 6 cases. There were 42 deceased persons out of the total number of 48 infected persons in the period from 1990 to 2003. Out of the total number of 64 persons with HIV/AIDS, 3 persons are children at the age from 0 to 6 years (2 of them deceased), and 1 is a HIV carrier. 
Viral hepatitis B The viral hepatitis B as a special nosologic unit has been reported since 1983. The number of registered cases in the Republic of Macedonia has maintained at almost constant level or increased in the period 1992-2003. There were 1,300 registered infected persons in the period 1996-2003, or on average 162 cases per year, with an average morbidity (MB) of 8.1/100,000. With regards to the age groups of the infected persons, the dominant age groups are the ones between 20 and 29 (23.4 %) and between 30 and 39 (15.3 %). Mandatory immunisation against viral hepatitis B of the new-born children was introduced in November, 2004 by the Law on Protection of the Population from Communicable Diseases (Official Gazette of the RM No. 66/04). So far, this immunisation has been administered only according to epidemiological indications (as of 1992) for certain risk population groups and professionally exposed persons. 
Viral Hepatitis C As of 1996 when diagnostic of the viral hepatitis C has been introduced , there have been 176 registered cases of viral hepatitis C in the Republic of Macedonia, or on average 22 cases are registered every year. The morbidity ranges from 0.5/100,000 to 1.65/100,000. There are no registered deceased persons from viral hepatitis C. According to epidemiological surveys, this disease is most frequently registered with drug addicts and dialysis patients. All blood units from the voluntary blood donors are strictly tested for HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis B and C, and syphilis according to the international standards. 
Sexually transmitted diseases There have been 20 cases of syphilis registered in the Republic of Macedonia in the period 1994-2003, with average morbidity of 0.002/100,000. The most present group is at the age from 20 to 29 or 49.6%, where men are dominant with 78%. There have been 211 cases of Gonorrhoea in the Republic of Macedonia in the period 1994-2003, or on average 21 cases per year with morbidity of 0,001–0.18/100,000. The most present age group is from 20 to 29 or 62.6%, where men are dominant with 87.4%. The above data shows that these diseases are significantly decreasing and the incidence is in significant regression; the emphasis of medical actions, as in many other countries, is directed towards prevention and education of the population about HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C and the non-specific urogenital infections caused by Chlamydia and viruses which because of the high incidence require measures for early detection and effective treatment.  
Travel Diseases With regards to the surveillance of communicable diseases related to international travel, the Republic of Macedonia has a regular set of measures and activities of health surveillance of persons arriving from countries with endemic presence of cholera, malaria, yellow fever, plague, and other communicable diseases. A immunisation against yellow fever is obligatory for persons who travel from the Republic of Macedonia to countries where the yellow fever endemically prevails. Persons who travel to countries with endemic presence of malaria are ordinated chemoprophylaxis, and an appropriate immunisation using serobiotypes recommended by the World Health Organisation for meningococcal meningitis,. According to the international epidemiologic status and in accordance with the recommendations of the WHO, targeted measures and activities for surveillance of importing Congoan-Krimic hemorrhagic fever, plague, SARS, anthrax, etc. are occasionally being applied. There are no autochthonous cases of malaria in the Republic of Macedonia (the last case was registered in 1965), and the last imported case was registered in 2003. 
Communicable diseases caused by food The alimentary toxic infections are the most frequent communicable diseases caused by food in the Republic of Macedonia. Epidemics of alimentary toxic infections caused by various bacteria carriers are frequent. On average, there were 421 salmonelosis cases registered annually in the period between 1992 and 2003, out of which the largest number of 698 cases was registered in 1993,and the least of 276 cases, in 1997. The morbidity ranges between 34.8/100,000 and 13.8/100,000. The number of salmonelosis patients has maintained at a constant level in the last 7 years, with small oscillations (350-450). The most frequent serotypes of isolated salmonellas in the Republic of Macedonia in the period between 1993 and 2003 were S. enteritidis (71 %) and S. Tuphi murium (27.9 %). In the last 10 years, there were averagely registered 5 salmonelosis epidemics per year , with an average of 220 infected persons. The epidemics are most frequently registered in dining halls, fast food restaurants and pastry shops (73%), and only 17 % out of them were family epidemics (home-made food). Mayonnaise (30%), sweets (24%) and chicken (17%) are the most frequent incriminated food for epidemics. 
Diseases for which a  mandatory immunisation is required   There has been a very good system for routine immunisation against certain communicable diseases in the Republic of Macedonia existing for decades, based on legal regulations (Law on Protection of the Population from Communicable Diseases (Official Gazette of the RM No. 66/04) and Rulebook on Methods and Conditions for Immunisation). The Ministry of Health adopted a Programme for Mandatory Immunisation upon recommendation of the Epidemiology and Microbiology Sector at the National Public Health Institute. The immunisation is obligatory and free of charge for every person subject to this obligation. As a result of such a systematic method of immunisation, high scope of immunisation using all types of vaccines is realised in the Republic of Macedonia every year (see 13_V_B_6), and a large number of the diseases, against which immunization is implemented, have been eradicated, eliminated, or registered in a very small number. Thus, the variola eradication was achieved. There hasn’t been systematic immunisation against variola since 1982. The Republic of Macedonia was awarded a Certificate for Eradication of Poliomyelitis Acuta in 2002. The last case of Poliomyelitis Acuta was registered in 1987.\ The last case of Diphtheria was reported in 1976, and the mandatory immunisation has been carried out on a regular basis. There have been individual cases of Tetanus registered, but not every year. The last case was registered in 2002,and the infected person was older than 60. The morbidity of the following diseases has been significantly reduced: Pertussis (16 cases in 2003 or reduction by 99.5% compared to the period before introduction of vaccination), Morbilli (18 cases in 2003, i.e., reduction by 99.8%),  Rubeola (52 cases in 2003, or reduction by 96.5%), Parotitis epidemica (77 cases in 2003 or reduction by 98.8%). Immunisation against influenza which is carried out every year is mainly directed to the population at the age beyond 60 and to the patients with chronic diseases. This immunisation is not mandatory. Approximately 15,000–20,000 persons are vaccinated per year in the Republic of Macedonia. Legal regulations of the Republic of Macedonia stipulate that immunisation against tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, morbilli, poliomyelitis acuta, rabies, cholera, yellow fever, abdominal typhus, and viral hepatitis B will be conducted only after epidemiological indications. The presented status of the diseases against which immunisation is conducted, shows that the epidemiological status in the Republic of Macedonia is favourable. Some of the diseases against which a immunisation is conducted have been eradicated or reduced to very small numbers. However, the potential risk factors (migrations, trade, tourism, etc.) and the incidence  of new global diseases, for e.g. the SARS, and the potential danger of biological terrorism requires a further serious approach to communicable diseases and further permanent antiepidemic and preventive action and work. 
3. Document COM(2001)723 final, the 2003 Joint Report by the Commission and the Council and document COM(2004)304 final highlight common challenges faced by health care systems and the three long-term objectives of those systems: care accessibility for all, high quality of care and financial sustainability of the systems. Please describe briefly the health system of your country, including possible on-going or planned reforms of the system, e.g. the financial basis, the national/regional division, levels of capacity in infrastructure, expenditure and personnel. Describe briefly any on-going or planned reforms of the system in relation to the three objectives above. 
Health Care System The health care system of the Republic of Macedonia as defined by the Constitution and the Law on Health Care (“Official Gazette of the RM” Nos.38/91, 46/93, 55/95, 17/97, 10/04), see 13_Annex_03represents the basis of the current system of health care delivery in Macedonia. It includes the basis of the health insurance system, the rights and responsibilities of beneficiaries and the rights and responsibilities of service providers, the organisational structure of the health care system and utilisation of health care funds. The Law also defines the areas of responsibility of individuals, employers and the Government in respect to the health status and protection of health. The individual is responsible for his/her own health, the company is responsible for providing healthy work environment including specific health protection for workers borne by the employers, while  the Government is responsible for providing healthy environment. The Government is also responsible for providing preventive health care for the population by granting access to the health service delivery. The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia clearly defines the principle of universal access to health care. This Law, and later a special Law on Health Insurance (“Official Gazette of the RM” Nos. 25/00, 34/00, 96/00, 50/01, 11/02 and 31/03) established mandatory health insurance which renders possibility for health insurance coverage of the entire  population of the country  . 
The rights to health care are attained in the existing health care system consisted of, public and private health care organisations. Health care is easily accessible to the population because it is carried out by a wide network of health organisations. The appropriate geographic distribution of health care institutions provides approx. 90% coverage of the population who can receive medical assistance for less than 30 minutes. In 2002, the public sector employed 24.428 persons, including 4.573 physicians. There were 487 physicians in the private sector, achieving the Standard of coverage of 399 inhabitants/one physician, or 25 physicians per 1.000 inhabitants. This meets the standards of primary health care. The data of 2003 is currently being processed. Health care is organised at three levels of care: primary, secondary-consultative and tertiary. It is delivered by 77 organisations owned by the state  or so-called public health care organisations which are as follows : 11 public health institutes , 3 health stations, 18 health centers providing primary health care and mostly located in small towns, 16 medical centres providing primary and secondary healthcare, 15 special hospitals, one general hospital, 6 pharmacies as independent legal entities, and the Clinical Center  (University Hospital) with 22 specialised clinics, and several other centres for tertiary health care  for medical and dental care. Organisationally, medical centres include hospital and out-patient services as primary health care. Health centers provide delivery of primary health care and partially out-patient and polyclinic secondary health care, e.g., through ophthalmologic, internal, otorhinolaryngologic and/or other services. The primary health care is the basis of the overall health system and provides basic health care at municipality level. The primary health care is implemented in 3 health stations, 18 health centers , 16 medical centres  By adoption of the amendments to the Health Care Law (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 10/04), the medical centres will be restructured into independent health care institutions for primary health care and hospitals, i.e. in 462 health  facilities  for delivery of  general practice, 77 for occupational  medicine, 84 for health care of children aged 0-6 years, 63 for health care of school children, 50 for women’s health care and 334 for dental care. Primary health care in rural areas will be delivered through 293 medical units, out of which 152 will have full time employed physicians. More than half of the total number of physicians (approx. 56%), or 1/4 of the specialists, are engaged in the primary health care. Health care is also delivered by the private health care organisations which most often are established as primary health care practices or as specialist practices. The number of private hospitals that provide secondary health care is very small. Considering the small territory of the country, the health care is relatively accessible to the population, except for the mountainous regions where due to poor roads and distance from the existing out-patient clinics, there is a need for delivery of primary health care to the local population. FundingThe expenditures of public funds in health ranged between 5,5 and 5,6% of the GDP in the last three years. This level is higher than the average expenditures in low and middle income countries (2,3%) and the average for the ECA region (4%). The health care spending as share of the total Government spending is also rather high compared to other low or middle income countries. Private spending for health care is approx. 3,3% of the GDP (data from 1999) which indicates relatively high level of out of pocket payments  which causes inequality and barriers to access of the poor to these services. The distribution of funds is inappropriate and most of the expenditures (over 50%) are made by the secondary and tertiary hospital care. The low level of investment in the primary health care resulted in a primary health care system which provides poor low quality care, especially in the rural areas. Patients tend to by-pass primary health care in favour of treatment at highly specialised health care institutions. The average number of non-hospital visits per capita/annually in the Republic of Macedonia is only around 3 compared to the EU average of 8. In the last decade, capital investments in the health sector (facilities and equipment) are at a very low level (approx. 1% of the total spending in health). As a result, many facilities, especially in the rural areas, are in poor condition with equipment that needs to be renewed. The health care funding is organised as a system of compulsory health insurance managed by the Health Insurance Fund. In 2000, the Health Insurance Fund separated from the Ministry of Health. The Health Insurance Fund is mainly funded by salary contributions, although this source of income as percentage of the total expenditures of the Health Insurance Fund gradually decreased from 75% to 63% in 2001. Most of the other income comes from the Pension and Disability, the Fund for Unemployed and the general revenues. The funds provided from the compulsory health insurance at the Health Insurance Fund comprise approx. 90% of the total expenditures in health care. A combination of factors as shortfalls  at the revenue side  and poor expenditure management  have  contributed to permanent cash deficit, steadily accumulating debts to suppliers estimated at 32,5 million USD (13% of the annual expenditures) by the Health Insurance Fund and the public health care institutions. The financial management capacity of the Health Insurance Fund is insufficient. From the aspect of expenditure management of the public funds, the extra-budgetary funds such as the Health Insurance Fund cause problems for effective resource allocation and offer possibilities for inappropriate conduct in cases when transactions are not subject to the same level of financial discipline. Currently, the Health Insurance Fund acts as a payer for health services instead of being an active purchaser of health services.  The Health Insurance Fund has reached a significant progress in this area by development of global budgets for hospitals and systems of payment per capita in the private health care institutions for primary health care. The package of services in the mandatory health insurance sometimes can not fully be provided due to reduction of income of the Health Insurance Fund and leads to increased informal payments. The accountability of the Health Insurance Fund to other agencies, especially to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Finance, is poor. PSMAC (Public Sector Management Credit) and the Health Sector Transition Project (closed in 2002) provided assistance for capacity building of the Health Insurance Fund, however, the financial management and control over the Health Insurance Fund deteriorated during the months prior to the parliamentary elections in October, 2002. There are still considerable weaknesses in the financial management, internal control and external accountability. The improvement of the information system in the health system has started within the first Project in health system, but there is still a lot to be done. Reforms: In order to achieve the goals of maintaining expenditures and improvement of the quality and access, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia focuses on strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Health, the Health Insurance Fund and the health service providers in order to improve their performance and increase transparency and accountability of different institutions. The Government has identified the reforms of policies and capacity building in the Health Insurance Fund, the Ministry of Health and the health service providers as a key element to achieve the goals in the health sector. The Health Sector Transition Project `in the Health Sector (1996-2002) included: health (54%); central; administration (34%); health insurance (12%). Altogether, the project helped to establish the bases for several areas of the health reform, including: -  Strategy and initial reform of the primary health care and Continued  Medical Education (CME) of physicians in the primary health care; -  Quality enhancement in the perinatal activity, which reduced the perinatal mortality by intensive training and investments in equipment; Training of the Health Insurance Fund staff, the Ministry of Health staff and the management staff of other health care institutions; Development of a system on signing contracts with physicians in the primary health care (on the principle of capitation), contracts with hospitals, financial management and information systems at the Health Insurance Fund; -  Development of national policy on drugs, pharmaceutical information centre and training of doctors in the area of rational drugs prescription; Public campaign to promote the health sector reforms. 
Achievement of the general goals: 1. Improvement of the health status of the population by improvement of the quality of basic health services. The Component on Health Services contributed to significant reduction of the perinatal mortality by 21%. The perinatal mortality rate is the number of stillborns and the number of deceased newborns in the early neo-natal period (during the first week after birth) measured in the total number of 1,000 newborns. There are records on improvement of the quality of the perinatal health care and the primary health care achieved by education within this component. The perinatal health care departments of the child birth and paediatrician departments taking care of neo-natuses, the principles of evidence based medicine have been largely adopted, as a result of the National Centre for the CME– for perinatology and neo-natalogy. General practitioners have improved their abilities for detection and treatment of diabetes and hypertension cases at the primary health care level. The increased trend of incidence of tuberculosis registered in the early 90’s decreased, whereas the lowest level was achieved in 1999 (27,6 new cases per 10.000). The rate increase of diseased in 2000 (31,6 per 100.000) was a cause to worry, but it has to be interpreted in the context of the influx of 400.000 refugees during the Kosovo crisis. 2. The second goal of the project – to support the initial stage of reforms in the health policy, increase of expenditure efficiency, fiscal sustainability and possibility for selection of family doctor by the patient within the health system – is presented by three different objectives, i.e.: -  Strengthening of the allocative efficiency of health services. Reduction of average length of hospital stay, increasing the number of consultations per doctor in non-stationary health care facilities and decreasing the trend of overly high ratio of the primary health care physicians per population implies improvement of the allocative efficiency through changing the balance of the stationary vs. the primary health care services in favour of the latter, as well as better technical efficiency of hospital and primary health care services. Although these changes can hardly be attributed only to the project activities, the improved skills with approx. 40% of all primary health care physicians in Macedonia were related to the increased accessibility of the essential equipment for diagnostics and treatment, which contributed to improvement of skills of the general practitioners for treatment of problems that could be solved at the primary health care level. The sub-component of medical education and the pharmaceutical component also had an impact on the improvement of allocative efficiency in drugs prescription. 3. Provision of financial sustainability. The new Law on Health Insurance (“Official Gazette of the RM Nos. 25/00, 34/00, 96/00, 50/01, 11/02 and 31/03) was adopted, as well as the secondary regulations pertaining to capitation as a payment mechanism for PHC physicians, payment of participation by beneficiaries, and the priority programmes (covering both the uninsured and the insured persons). These regulations were designed to improve the fiscal control over the payments of the primary health care and to increase the revenues collected from the beneficiaries, which will provide protection for the poor and the patients with chronic diseases. The revised positive list of drugs and the new information system improved the Health Insurance Fund capacity for control of expenditures. The debts of the Health Insurance Fund to health care institutions have not been eliminated. Since the restructuring after the mid-term review of project activities, all factors that influence the goal of fiscal sustainability were not considered. The conditions set in the policy matrix of the Public Sector Management Credit met by the Health Insurance Fund in 2002, eliminated the cause of debts to health care institutions in the public sector through replacing of the inappropriately implemented point system of payment to the hospitals with a system of signing contracts with hospitals based on a global budget. The debts of the Health Insurance Fund and the public health care institutions to commercial suppliers (especially to suppliers of drugs) still exist. 4. Increased possibility for patients’ choice. The primary health care reform increased the possibility for selection of a doctor by the patient and established a system of payments to private doctors on the principle of capitation. By the adoption of secondary legislation on payment of capitation in the primary health care, payment of participation, and priority preventive programmes, progress has been made in these areas. Five hundred private doctors have signed contracts with the Health Insurance Fund to be paid on the capitation principle. Public campaign was carried out in order to inform the patients about their rights, obligations and options within the new arrangements. The important aspect of the introduction of the patients’ choice by possibility of selecting a doctor by the patients, introduced by contracts with private doctors, is that the Health Insurance Fund has been signing contracts with doctors from all the regions in the country. On-going reforms – Project on Management in the Health Sector There are three key development challenges and opportunities for the health sector which will be supported by the World Bank in accordance with the Country Assistance Strategy, presented on 9of September 2003: Achievement of a solid system for expenditure  management of public funds , especially by increased emphasis on extra-budgetary institutions including the Health Insurance Fund ; assurance of continuous health service delivery  in the context of decentralisation; guarantee of quality, efficiency and access to health services. The Health Sector Management Project is funded by an investment loan in an amount of US$ 10 million and Government contribution of approx. US$ 1,58 million  The proposed loan will complement the reforms supported by several programmatic loans for adjustment of the public sector management and related technical assistance funded by the Dutch Government grant financing. One of these loans for adjustment (loan for adjustment of the public sector management or PSMAL) was approved at the same time as the proposed loan and it supports the changes in the policies of the Health Insurance Fund related to the hospital contracting and introduction of internal audit capacity of the Health Insurance Fund for the purpose of strengthening of financial management, as well as external/system audit of the HIF. This loan will provide the necessary assistance, training and equipment for the Health Insurance Fund, with emphasis on the strengthening of the management information system. These investments will be critical for the guaranteed success of the policy reforms in accordance with PSMAL and for support to expansion of these reforms. The Government will fund limited construction works, training expenses, operational costs, taxes and payments. The whole Project should be seen as part of the overall programme for support of the health care system reform in the Republic of Macedonia. The objectives of the project are: -  upgrade of the capacity of the Health Insurance Fund and the Ministry of Health for formulation and effective implementation of health care policies, health insurance, financial management and contracting with service providers; development and implementation of efficient scheme of restructuring of hospital services with an emphasis on development of day care services and approximation to primary health care. The project consists of the following components: Component 1: Formulation of policies and implementation. This component will help the Ministry of Health to develop and strengthen of its critical functions such as formulation of policies and strategies, monitoring and evaluation of health reforms, information and public relations. The component consists of three sub-components: Support to the general policy in health and development strategy, Communications and public relations, and Improvement of administrative and business processes within the Ministry of Health. Component 2: Strengthening of the management by the Health Insurance Fund. The goal of this component is to improve the management of the Health Insurance Fund as organisation responsible for provision of healthcare services on behalf of its beneficiaries in accordance with the compulsory health insurance. This component has three sub-components: Eligibility criteria and revenue collection  Management of the Health Insurance Fund, and - Purchasing functions. Component 3: Improving service delivery. This component will improve the quality and the efficiency of health care organisations by supporting the development of staff skills, introduction of new methods and instruments for management and upgrade of certain units, selected for implementation of well-defined sub-projects. These improvements will contribute to increase of administrative and operational capacity of the health care institutions, placing them in a better position to respond to the challenges and the stimulative segments of the contracting process with the Health Insurance Fund. The component consists of two sub-components: Hospital management and primary health care, and Grants for improving service quality and efficiency. The project will be evaluated on the basis of performance indicators. These include quantitative indicators (measurable improvement and outcomes) and qualitative assessment. The assessment of the achievement of each performance indicator will be made in comparison with the basic indicators. These indicators will be regularly monitored by the information system set up as a part of the Policy Analysis Unit at the Ministry of Health. The key project indicators are the following: -  reduction of the administrative costs and the work of the staff on issuing health insurance coupons (blue coupons); -  increase in the number of persons paying contributions and increase in the level of compulsory contributions as percentage of “required” contributions; reduction of the number of drugs bought at pharmacies which do not contract with the Health Insurance Fund and for which the Health Insurance Fund refunds the costs; -  satisfactory annual audit reports by the Health Insurance Fund (giving opinion without qualification); -  percentage of contracted health care institutions in accordance with the selected clinical guidelines ; reduction by 10% of the average length of stay (ALS) -  reduction by 30% of the number of re-admission with the same diagnosis within 3 months, and increase by 20% of non-hospital surgery as percentage of the total surgery. The average length of the process of drugs registration (including drugs registered by short procedure for drugs registered by EU, i.e. the ones approved by FDA) will be reduced by 50%. All physicians, dentists and pharmacists will be licensed according to the newly adopted procedures. Development of health budget reflecting the key mid-term priority policies of the Government. During the discussions with the World Bank and their support to the reforms with the loan for the public sector adjustment, four areas of reforms in the health sector were specified as key sectors in order to receive the loan (PSMAL): -  Development of a system of contracts with hospitals that will lead to better control over expenditures and to establishment of incentives for better quality of work; Improved  financial management of expenditures and obligations by the Fund and the health care institutions; -  Reduction of prices the Fund pays for drugs and other medical materials in a transparent, competitive and legally based process of procurement, and enhanced and efficient process of issuing registrations by the Bureau for Drugs which this competitive process of drugs procurement will enable; More efficient administration and collection of health insurance contributions. Other reform activities at the Ministry of Health As a part of the Framework Agreement, the Ministry of Health is undertaking intensive activities to implement Art. 22 item 9 of the Law on Local Self-Government (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 5/02). The legal projects contained within the Operational Programme for Decentralisation of the central authorities in 2003 and 2004, all Stability Pact projects and most of the on-going project and programme activities based on contracts/agreements with the World Health Organisation and UNICEF practically mean establishment of legal framework and creation of the critical conditions for community-based reforms. The Law on Appending and Amending the Law on Health Care (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 10/04) was also adopted. The goal of the adoption of this Law is to provide conditions for increased level of competency and professionalism with physicians, dentists, pharmacists by establishing a process of licensing and license renewal every seven years. At the same time, it provides a process of accreditation of institutions involved in the procedures for continued education in order to provide the necessary conditions for increase of the knowledge and skills level. Thus, in a final extent the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia are to be provided with better quality health services. With the inclusion of members of the local self-government in the management boards of the public health care institutions in the primary health care and the provision of the possibility for ownership transformation of pharmacies and the possibility for lease of the organisational units with pharmaceutical and dental activity, this sector is being decentralised. The local self-government representatives will participate in the decision-making process and the management of public health care organisations in the primary health care, i.e. the graduated pharmacists and dentists working at the public health care organisations will be given a possibility to establish private health care organisations with leased space and equipment. They will manage their own organisation, i.e. they will run their own “business” which will increase the motivation to be successful in the business rather than waiting to receive salary or “somebody else” to solve the problem of the institution. This will provide the better representation of the citizens at local government level, in the process of decision making in the public health care organisations at the primary health care level to influence and express their needs when making decisions at the management boards regarding the health care delivery and improved supply of drugs for the population. This Law created a basis for privatisation of public sector pharmacies and dental practices. There are two types of privatisations defined: one by sale and one by renting the space and equipment. Within this operational programme, a Law on Protection of the Population from Communicable Diseases (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 66/04) was adopted, which defines the competence of municipalities in taking over the general public health measures for prevention of spread of communicable diseases. A Strategy on Mental Health is under preparation which promotes the approach to mental health inside the community and departs from the old institutional and asylum model of treatment of persons with mental disorders. The data on expenditures and resources in the health system of the Republic of Macedonia is specified in the answers to questions 13_V_A_4 and 13_V_B_3
4. What are your current health expenditures, as a percentage of GDP, and in absolute terms (in Euro), and how are they structured, including the amount spent in the public sector and the private sector, the amount spent on prevention, and health promotion? 
The table presents the expenditures and the structure of expenditures of the Health Insurance Fund in 2003. The data on the health care expenditures collected by the official statistics are limited to the data on the expenditures only of the Health Insurance Fund.

In the table the data on health care expenditures are limited to the data on the expenditures of the Fund only. While analyzing the data on expenditures, it should be taken into account that the health care expenditure data are merely data on expenditures of the state (public) health sector and only include private practices who have signed contract with the Fund on providing health care services to insured persons. These expenditures do not include the out of pocket payments by the  beneficiaries which is payment of the full price of medical services in the private health sector (mainly for dental services and drugs bought from private pharmacies) or the full price in the state health sector for services and drugs that patients could not obtain from the health insurance. The expenditures presented in the table do not include the expenditures of the military healthcare services (paid from the budget), the humanitarian aid, and donations to the healthcare institutions. Every year the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia allocates funds for implementation of 11 prevention programs. In 2004, there were MKD 322.000.000. i.e., EUR 5.252.854.80 allocated for these purposes. 
5. Are you implementing the OECD manual “A system of health accounts” or are you planning to do so?  
The manual “A System of Health Accounts” is not currently implemented in the Republic of Macedonia. There are on-going activities aimed at studying the manual in order to create conditions for application of the Health Accounts System. 
6. Indicate your immunisation programmes, and the level of coverage. 
Immunisation Programme The immunisation in the Republic of Macedonia is carried out in accordance with the Programme for Compulsory Immunisation of Population of the Republic of Macedonia. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia adopts the Programme  proposed by the Minister of Health every year. The Programme includes an  
Immunisation Calendar In October, 2004, the Republic of Macedonia adopted a new Law on Protection of Population from Communicable Diseases (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 66/04) which regulates the obligation for continued immunisation against hepatitis B. The immunisation starts in November, 2004 with newborn children using three doses of vaccine at the age of 0 months, 2 months, and 6 months. The Immunisation Calendar has been changed so that the vaccination against hepatitis B has been included. IMMUNISATION CALENDAR Age of persons  subject to immunisation

Coverage with immunisation is regularly monitored by 10 regional public health institutes and 21 local public health offices. 
RESULTS OF THE MANDATORY IMMUNISATION IMPLEMENTATION 
Variola vera is eradicated. No systematic immunisation against this disease has been carried out since 1982. 
Republic of Macedonia was awarded a Certificate for Eradication of Poliomyelitis Acuta in 2002. The last case of poliomyelitis acuta was registered in 1987. 
The last case of Diphtheria was reported in 1976, whereas the mandatory immunisation is carried out on regular basis. 
Tetanus is registered by individual cases, but not every year. The last case was registered in 2002 with a person older than 60. The morbidity of the following diseases has been significantly reduced : 
Pertussis (16 cases in 2003); Morbilli (18 cases in 2003) Rubeola (52 cases in 2003) Parotitis epidemica  (77 cases in 2003). Communicable diseases which have not been registered for a long time are the following : 
Typhus fever, the last case was in 1956, 
Malaria (autochthonous), the last case was in 1965, 
Para typhus, the last case was in 1996. 

7. Please provide the following information regarding communicable diseases: 
a) Is there/Are there plan(s) of action for an outbreak at national level? If yes, please provide a translation of one. 
b) Is there a legal basis for monitoring anti-microbiological resistance? How is the system organised? 
c) Can you provide the Commission with the curriculum of training in epidemiological specialisation? 
d) What is the number of hospital departments and the number of beds for the treatment of communicable diseases? 
e) Is there a quality assurance system implemented for laboratory performance? How many laboratories have an accreditation? 
a)  
At the moment, we are developing plans for emergency cases and procedures for control of communicable diseases at the borders of the Republic of Macedonia concerning international road traffic in accordance with the National Action Plan for Integrated Border Administration financed by the CARDS Programme of the EU All activities at  the border crossings related to the international road transport of goods and passengers  are carried out by the state sanitary and health inspectors, providing quality prevention and control of a possible threat of a “new” communicable disease spreading in or from the Republic of Macedonia and informing the World Health Organisation immediately. Apart from the entire personnel of the Ministry of Health, professionals working with the National Committee for Integrated Border Administration and the Ministry of Interior are also involved in these activities. A Commission for Protection from Communicable Diseases composed by experts in various fields (epidemiologists, infectologists, microbiologists, paediatricians, a representative of the Institute for Veterinary Diseases, etc.) functions at the level of the Ministry of Health. The Commission’s task is to monitor the situation of communicable diseases in the country, to alert in specific situations and to develop action plans in case of an outbreak of some disease at the national level. The aforesaid Commission had successful action plans during the SARS and anthrax outbreaks. There is a well-developed system of measures and activities related to surveillance of communicable diseases based on daily submission, collection, and analysis of individual reports on communicable diseases and group reporting on certain diseases, as well as rapid response for information when there is an increased number of infected persons or an epidemics of a communicable disease, or an outbreak of a disease not registered on the specific territory for a long time or caused by an unknown carrier. Faxes, phones and mobile phones are used for the purpose of immediate notification. 
b)  
This field is regulated by the Law on Protection of Population from Communicable Diseases (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia 66/04), in  Articles 23 and 24 which specify a total of 38 carriers of communicable diseases that are monitored and notified to the competent healthcare organisations by the microbiological laboratories. The microbiological laboratories are obliged to report every case of isolated bacterium with unusual resistance to antibiotics to the competent health care institute. 
c) 
Specialisation in epidemiology lasts for three years, and the following courses should be taken: - General Epidemiology; Ecological Tries and Other Epidemiological Models; Sensibility and Immunity, Sources of infection; Ways of transmission (water, food, vector, contact); Types of epidemics; Application of epidemiological methods in epidemiological researches (descriptive, analytical, experimental); Prevention of diseases and health disorders; -  Measures and prevention of communicable diseases (monitoring, reporting, isolation, surveillance, vaccination, seroprophylaxis, disinfection, disinsectisation, deratisation); Legal and secondary acts on protection of the population from communicable diseases; - Intrahospital infections; Basics of microbiology (bacteriology, virology, parasitology); -  Epidemiological characteristics of the intestinal communicable diseases (dysentery, cholera, intestinal typhus, salmonellas and other alimentary toxic-infections, viral hepatitis A, poliomyelitis, amoebiasis, etc.); -  Epidemiological characteristic of the respiratory communicable diseases (morbili, variccela, rubeola, influenza, mumps, infectious mononucleosis, streptococcus infection, pertussis, meningococcal infection, legionelosis, tuberculosis, etc.); -  Zoonosis (brucellosis, Q fever, tularaemia, leptospyrosis, rabies, anthrax, tetanus, plague, echinoccocus infection, trichinelosis, prionic diseases); -  Diseases transmitted by vectors (malaria, typhus fever, dengue, leishmaniosis, papa tachi fever, lime disease, hemorrhagic fevers, etc.); -  Sexually transmitted diseases (HIV infections, viral hepatitis B, C, D, etc., gonorrhoea, syphilis, etc.) - Basics of infectology; Basics of hygiene, health ecology and ecological risks (food, water, air, human environment); -  Risk factors and prevention of non-communicable chronic diseases (cardiovascular, malign, cerebrovascular, diabetes, gastrointestinal diseases, respiratory system diseases, traumatism); Basics of social medicine, health promotion and health education; - Medical statistics; Preparation of specialist’s thesis on certain public health topic.

There is no system for quality control of the laboratory work. There are no officially accredited laboratories carrying out microbiological diagnostics of communicable diseases in the Republic of Macedonia. 
8. Are your health institutions members of any European or WHO networks? If so, which ones? 
The Institute for Occupational Health, a WHO Collaborating Centre for Occupational Health, Skopje participates in the network of the World Health Organisation together with over 50 collaborating centres from Europe for joint partnership action of the European countries supporting WHO activities in the field of occupational health. The activities of the Institute are especially important within the framework of the Global Plan of the Collaborating Centres of Europe giving special contribution to the goals of developing national and local profiles of occupational health and safety at work - development of European Indicator System; Education and Training, and Specific Problems of Medical Workers; the problem of Stress and Work and important activities in the field of Improvement of occupational health. In the two-year co-operation contract with the WHO on specific priorities, the Occupational Health Institute- WHO Collaborating Centre is obliged to design and develop a National Programme for Occupational Health and offer new models of Services for Occupational Health according to the national needs and the EU recommendations within the health sector reform. The National Health Care Institute is included in the system for early notification to the WHO on HIV/AIDS (EUROHIV and EUROAIDS), on MORBILI (monthly report to the WHO), and zero report of children’s paralysis (poliomyelitis), i.e., surveillance of acute phlakcyde paralysis (zero report). The National Health Care Institute participates in the WHO Surveillance Programme for Control of Food borne Infections and Intoxications in Europe. The Programme is being carried out by the FAO/WHO Collaborating Centre – Federal Institute for Health Protection of Consumers and Veterinary Medicine (Berlin) under leadership of the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health in Rome. The Ministry of Health directly cooperates with the WHO, UNICEF and other organisations through its coordinators on specific fields and projects (immunisation, mental health, millennium goals, alert system, etc.). The Chamber of Dental Medicine of the Republic of Macedonia has been a member of the World Dental Association since 1996, as well as of the European Dental Association since 2003, and of the Balkan Dental Association since 1996. Republic of Macedonia is a member of the European Network for Healthy Schools – a WHO project, Euro-Pharm Forum, and the European Forum of Medical Associations. 
9. The EU is setting up a network of competent authorities in health information and knowledge. Does your country have the administrative capacity, including human and material resources, to participate in the work of such a network? Please describe the system used to collect, analyse and report health data and information in your country. 
The system of health statistics in the Republic of Macedonia is regulated by the: -  Law on Health Care (“Official Gazette of the RM” Nos. 38/91, 46/93, 55/95 and 10/04);see_13_ Annex_ 03Law on Health Data (“Official Gazette of the  SRM” No. 37/79 and “Official Gazette of the RM” No.15/95) Law on Health Data (“Official Gazette of the SFRY” No. 22/78, 18/88” and  “Official Gazette of the RM” No.15/95) Guidelines on Keeping Health Data (“Official Gazette of the SRM” No. 21/85). Ten regional Health Care Institutes in Bitola, Veles, Kumanovo, Kocani, Ohrid, Prilep, Strumica, Skopje, Tetovo, and Stip collect data from the health organisations (medical centres, medical homes, the Clinical Centre, general hospitals, special hospitals, institutes, and private health organisations). The following data for record-keeping are collected in the Republic of Macedonia: 1.  Records of medical and periodical examinations of the population; 2.  Records of conditions, protective measures, and improvement of the human environment; 3.  Records of child-births and pregnancy termination; 4.  Records of family planning activities; 5.  Records of visits, health services, determined diseases, conditions and injuries; 6.  Records of communicable diseases; 7.  Records of drugs consumption; 8.  Records of received and prescribed narcotics; 9.  Records of human resources in health organisations. Beside these records the Law on Health Data (“Official Gazette of the SRM“No. 22/78 and “Official Gazette of the RM”, No. 15/95) requires establishing of data registries for the following diseases : - Malign diseases; - Diabetes; - Heart ischemia; - Kidney insufficiency; - Psychoses; Alcohol and other addictions; - Occupational diseases; - Rheumatic fever; - Intoxications; - Traffic traumatism; Funds for mandatory types of health care; -  Funds for health care of workers, employed persons and citizens from the Republic of Macedonia being treated abroad; - Investments; Medical appliances and instruments. The records serve as sources of data for statistical research in health which is of general interest. They also serve to monitor and study the health condition of the population, i.e., to take the necessary health care measures for the needs of scientific research, for the needs of the country defence , for public information, for meeting the international health care obligations  and other official purposes. The method of record-keeping and the instruments for providing data are regulated by the “Instructions on Methods of Keeping Records in the Field of Heath (“Official Gazette of the SRM” No. 21/85). The health condition data are submitted on specific prescribed forms forms: 1.  Report on Malign Neoplasm – Form no. 3-35-86; 2.  Individual Report on Diabetes: Form No. MZS -02; 3.  Individual Report on Ischemic Heart Disease: Form No. MZS -03; 4.  Individual Report on Kidney Insufficiency: Form No. MZS -04; 5.  Individual Report on Ischemic Psychoses: Form No. MZS -05; 6.  Individual Report on Ischemic Alcohol and Other Dependence Disorders: Form No. MZS -06; 7.  Report on Occupational Health and Person Suffering from an Occupational Disease : Form No. 3-36-86 8.  Individual Report on Rheumatic Fever: Form No. MZS -08; 9.  Individual Report on Intoxication: Form No. MZS -09; 10. Individual Report on Traffic Trauma: Form No. MZS -10; The issue on keeping data in health is also regulated by the Law on State Statistics (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 54/97), the Programme for Statistical Research” (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 69/03), in order to more precisely regulate which research, of what scope and purpose will be carried out. On the basis of the prescribed forms, information, reports and registries are prepared regarding the each of the above mentioned records. In order to have measurable and comparable national data to the data of the countries in the region and the world, there is a List of National Indicators on more then three hundred health indicators submitted to the Regional Office of the World Health Organisation. The Ministry of Health and the National Health Care Institute in co-operation with the WHO conduct activities for drafting a bill on keeping health records compatible with the legislation of the EU member countries and the health statistics of the WHO. The Project on Reforms in the Health Sector has begun, performing activities for establishing an Integrated Health Information System and a Centre for Information Technology at the National Health Care Institute, which will provide fast and efficient data collection and analysis. The National Health Care Institute is involved in the activities carried out and coordinated by the State Statistics Office for approximation to the Eurostat System. Activities for improvement of the methodology on collection and processing of health and statistical data are carried out alongside in order to improve their applicability for the needs of the Republic of Macedonia and other international organisations and institutions. Republic of Macedonia needs to establish a System for Electronic Data Collection and Processing to achieve efficiency and effectiveness of the system and quality of data in accordance with the European Standards. 
10. How is the sale of alcoholic beverages regulated in your country? 
The existing regulations on sale of alcohol are: 1.  Law on Safety of Foodstuffs and Products and Materials in Contact with Foodstuffs (“Official Gazette of the RM”, No. 54/02). The provisions of this Law on safety, marking, advertisement, and warning measures also apply to alcohol products. There is another important provision which states that alcohol beverages and their trademarks can be advertised only at places where sold, including the appropriate penalty provision. 2.  Broadcasting Law (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 20/97 and 70/03) The Broadcasting law prohibits advertising of alcohol. 3.  The Consumer Protection Law (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 63/00) The Law presents the health and economic aspects as inseparable from the consumer’s right: Protection of life and health from consumption of hazardous product. Fraud advertisement influencing the economic behaviour of consumers. Obligation for proper information of consumers. 
11. What are the gender specific and combined smoking rates in your country by age groups (in percentages)? 
In the Republic of Macedonia, a RESEARCH ON  TOBACCO CONSUMPTION BY THE YOUTH was carried out in 2002 within the Project GYTS – Global Youth Tobacco Survey supported by the CDC–Atlanta and WHO Regional Office for Europe in Copenhagen. The report indicates that smoking is widely spread amongst the youth at the age 13-15 in the Republic of Macedonia. 8.2 % of the examinees are smokers. One out of ten boys or girls is a smoker. There is no statistically significant difference between boys or girls smokers in the Republic of Macedonia. Smoking cigarettes is not the only type of tobacco products consumption by the youth. The results of the research indicated that 4.7% out of 8.2% current smokers enjoy other products and forms of smoking tobacco. The results of the scientific study on the role of health education for prevention of the risk factors for ischemic heart diseases carried out in 2000–2001 on population at the age of 15-64 indicated that every second examinee is a smoker (42.7%), 10% are occasional smokers, 11.4% are former smokers. 6.2% smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day. Smoking cigarettes depends on age (X=47.32 DF=4, p<0.05), but not on the level of education (X=6.16 DF=6, p>0.05) and in relation to smoking in the regions of the country (X=5.59 DF=6, p>0.05). The research on physicians smokers was carried out in co-operation with the World Health Organisation and BMA – TCRC from London.

12. Do you have cross-border arrangements for treating patients with any EU Member States or candidate countries? If so, what is the annual flow of patients into and from your country by sending/receiving country? 
Republic of Macedonia has signed agreements with individual European Union Member States (group I of the List of Social Security Treaties), with the neighbouring countries (group II) and other countries (group III). The state has taken over all the bilateral Conventions (agreements) on social insurance signed by the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Republic of Macedonia, as an independent state, has signed Conventions (agreements) on social insurance with: Austria, Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro, Turkey, Switzerland, Denmark, Bulgaria, and Germany. These agreements regulate the status and the rights of Macedonian citizens employed in those countries or during their stay on other grounds, members of their families residing in our country, citizens and insured persons residing and being employed in one country when exercising health insurance rights of another country, beneficiaries of foreign pensions residing in our country and members of their families, and mutual obligations of the insurance holders for providing conditions for acquiring and determining the rights of the insured. The social insurance agreements are generally based on the “principle of insurance” which implies equal health care of the insured persons from both contracting countries, under same conditions and same volume as for domestic insured persons, charged to the competent bearer. The other principle is the “principle of reciprocity” which implies use of health services during the stay of the insured persons from one contracting country on the territory of the other contracting country, charged to the contracting country on whose territory they are staying. The Health Insurance Fund of the Republic of Macedonia does not keep records of the flow of patients into and from the country. The payment of health services is done according to actual and lump sum expenses for the contracting countries based on the insurance principle. Payment of health services is not done for contracted countries based on the principle of reciprocity.

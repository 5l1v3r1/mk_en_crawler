SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Boris Trajkovski appealed Thursday (20 November) for the political and public consensus needed to approve the package of laws on decentralising power. Trajkovski said government coalition partners, signatories of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, opposition and ruling parties will hold a series of meetings about it in coming days. Power decentralisation is the last condition for full implementation of the Ohrid Accord. Trajkovski's plea came during the opening of the Third Forum of Civic Society, focusing on human rights, rule of law, education, religious matters and the environment.
Also Thursday, Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva met in Brussels with NATO Secretary General Lord George Robertson. She said the government plans to appoint a Euro-Atlantic integration co-ordinator, in response to Robertson's recommendation to improve co-ordination of all ministries. Mitreva also briefed him on the progress of Macedonia's voluntary weapons collection campaign. (Utrinski Vesnik - 21/11/03; MIA, A1 TV, Makfax - 20/11/03)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown on Thursday (11 March) criticised the work of the Republika Srpska (RS) commission investigating the July 1995 events in Srebrenica. In a public statement addressed to Commission Chairman Marko Arsovic, Ashdown urged the panel to tackle issues relevant to the problem. He warned that if the commission fails, the consequences would affect both RS and BiH, and might jeopardise BiH's chances to integrate into NATO structures. (PBS BiH - 11/03/04)

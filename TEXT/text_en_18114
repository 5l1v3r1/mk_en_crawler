SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska's (RS) ruling party Union of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) said on Monday (May 14th) it would insist on the federalisation of BiH in upcoming negotiations on constitutional reform. According to SNSD chief secretary Rajko Vasic, the party would propose creation of three federal entities -- RS, Bosnia and Hereg Bosna. He said the new federation would not require territorial exchanges between the two entities and would not slow BiH's EU integration efforts.
The main Bosniak parties -- Party of Democratic Action and Party for BiH -- immediately denounced the idea, saying it would lead to the disintegration of BiH. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 15/05/07; RTRS, Fena, PBS - 14/05/07)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- A forged passport which retired General Ante Gotovina allegedly used to flee Croatia in 2001 was issued under the name Kristian Horvat, the daily Vjesnik reported Tuesday (3 May), citing police sources. At the same time, the chief of the police investigation department, Mirjana Rigljan, confirmed that retired Zagreb policeman Salih Fazlic and lawyer Marijan Pedisic were detained for ordering the false passport, for which they reportedly paid 450 euros. Pedisic is a member of Gotovina's defence team. Also Monday, the Zagreb County Court decided that brothers Franjo and Miroslav Katavic, whom prosecutors charged with possessing equipment used for document forgery and illegal arms possession, should remain in custody for one month.

LUXEMBOURG, Luxembourg -- The EU could convince the Netherlands to stop blocking the interim trade accord with Serbia in the coming weeks, Luxembourgeois Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn told Serbian counterpart Vuk Jeremic on Wednesday (December 17th)). Asselborn said he will meet soon with Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen and would try to find a solution. B92 quoted Asselborn as saying that he understood the Dutch insistence on Serbia's need to co-operate fully with the UN war crimes tribunal, but added "now we have to go together in the right direction". The Netherlands is blocking all new steps in regards to Serbia's EU integration until the Balkan state arrests and extradites Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic. The interim trade accord is the first step in implementing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which Serbia and the EU signed last spring. (B92, Tanjug - 17/12/08)

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- French General Philippe Morillon, who served as commander of the UN Protection Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992-1993, is due to appear before the tribunal hearing the war crimes case against former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Morillon will testify in open court, as the prosecution wraps up its case.
In other news, the tribunal on Tuesday (10 February) extended a gag order imposed on Milosevic and Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj, intended to prevent them from influencing Serbian politics before a government is elected in Belgrade. Milosevic will be able to conduct meetings as long as he does not use them to relay information to the media. The court says Seselj's "defiant position" is unchanged, so his contacts have been limited to lawyers, consular officers and his immediate family. (AFP - 10/02/04)

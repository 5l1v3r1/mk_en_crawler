SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina -- The lack of progress on key reforms is very concerning and this status quo should be changed, EU Security Chief Javier Solana and High Representative to BiH Miroslav Lajcak said in Brussels on Monday (July 9th). If the current negative trends continue, the country could find itself in deep political crisis, Lajcak warned. BiH leaders have demonstrated that the European future of the country is a main goal, the high representative said. Police reform, as outlined by the EU, remains the main condition for initiating the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), Solana said. The two also agreed that the security situation in BiH is improving, although Solana said that for the time being, the EU police mission will remain in the country and help preserve internal order.

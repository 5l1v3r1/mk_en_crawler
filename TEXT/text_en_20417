BUCHAREST, Romania -- Economy Minister Varujan Vosganian said on Monday (November 12th) that Romania is facing a major labour shortage, mostly in the construction, automobile and heavy industry sectors. "We are experiencing a shortage of some 500,000 workers and we need more engineers and mechanics," Vosganian said at a press conference on vocational training. He added that the labour shortage is largely due to the massive emigration of Romanians during the past couple of years. More than 2 million have left the country looking for work in Italy, Spain and other European countries. (AFP, Financial Times, AP, Hotnews.ro - 12/11/07)

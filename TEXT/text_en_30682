NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council will hold debates Monday (May 9th) on the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). High Representative Valentin Inzko is set to present his regular report, which is expected to criticise Republika Srpska's decision to call a referendum on the BiH Court and Prosecutor's Office as an action undermining the Dayton Peace Agreement.

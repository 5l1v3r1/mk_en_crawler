BERLIN, Germany -- Croatian President Ivo Josipovic said on Thursday (January 20th) that he has received German backing for efforts to complete the EU accession talks. After talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Christian Wulff in Berlin, he said they hailed Croatia's progress, but at the same time, stressed the need to meet all criteria for membership. One of the main topics discussed with Merkel were relations in the region. Josipovic and Merkel voiced hope that new government in Bosnia and Herzegovina will be established soon and constitutional reforms will be implemented, in view of the region's European perspective.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- NATO inspectors will focus on reforms in Macedonia's police and judicial system, when they visit the country in September, local media reports said Saturday (August 4th). Political reform will also be high on their agenda. "There is still much work to be done in the field of decentralisation, judicial reforms and religious freedom," NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer was quoted as saying. Specific changes sought by the Alliance include a reduction in the number of police officers. Currently, Macedonia has twice as many policemen as soldiers. (A1, MIA - 04/08/07)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen on Tuesday (March 23rd) told Bosnian leaders that while doors of the Alliance remain open to BiH, the country must implement all necessary reforms. Among those cited were changes to the constitution in accordance with a recent ruling by the European Court of Human Rights and resolving the state and military property issue. Rasmussen praised the progress that BiH has made in reforming its defence sector and voiced NATO's readiness to help the country become a member. BiH hopes to receive a NATO Membership Action Plan at a meeting of the Alliance's foreign ministers in Tallinn, Estonia, next month. (RTRS, Srna, Fena, BHRT, Dnevni Avaz, OHR - 23/03/10)

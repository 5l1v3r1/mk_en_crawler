SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Former Prime Minister Ivan Kostov formed a new right-wing party, Democrats for Strong Bulgaria, at a special meeting on Saturday (29 May). More than 1,300 people registered as founders of the new party. On Sunday, they plan to adopt the charter and party programme, and elect leaders. Kostov is expected to be named chairman by a unanimous vote. He left the main opposition Union of Democratic Forces earlier this year after a fall-out with leader Nadezhda Mihailova.

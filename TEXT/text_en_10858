TIRANA, Albania -- The main opposition Democratic Party (DP) threatened on Monday (4 October) to stage mass protests if the ruling Socialist Party (SP) does not settle the stalemate in the electoral commission soon. DP official Jemin Gjana said the SP should demonstrate it is willing to hold free and fair elections. The warning follows the ruling party's announcement that it will ask parliament to extend the deadline for approval of electoral reforms by the commission. The current deadline is Tuesday.

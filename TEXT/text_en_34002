BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Four days before the European Commission's regular report on Romania's progress in the EU accession process, the <I>EU Observer</I> reports that the draft still does not recognise the country as having a functioning market economy. According to Brussels, noticeable progress has been achieved as regards macroeconomic stabilisation and structural reforms, yet problems remain with financial discipline, corruption and weaknesses of the judiciary and the public administration sector. If not granted functioning market economy status, Romania would be the only candidate country failing to meet Brussels' economic recommendation. (EU Observer - 01/11/03)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin signed an agreement with Macedonian counterpart Antonio Milososki in Sofia on Friday (November 3rd) that would allow Macedonians to enter Bulgaria with free visas as of next year. They agreed that Bulgaria would introduce visas for Macedonian citizens in line with its obligations as an EU member after January 1st, but that there would be no charge for them. Kalfin also stressed that Bulgaria would continue acting as a lobbyist for Macedonia's integration in NATO and the EU. As for Bulgaria's repeated refusal to register the pro-Macedonian OMO Ilinden as a political party, Kalfin noted that Bulgaria was fined once by the European Court of Human Rights in relation to the case and had paid the fine. The ruling, he insisted, did not oblige Bulgaria to register OMO Ilinden. 
On Saturday, Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov visited the Macedonian village of Novo Selo for a ceremony opening the restored Bulgarian military cemetery from the Balkan conflicts and WWI. Macedonia recently allowed the Sofia-funded renovation of the site, sought by Bulgaria for years. (Darik - 05/11/06; Monitor, Makfax, Utrinski Vesnik - 04/11/06; A1 TV - 03/11/06)

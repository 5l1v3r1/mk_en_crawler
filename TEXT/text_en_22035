ANKARA, Turkey -- Osman Can, rapporteur at the Constitutional Court, issued a non-binding recommendation Friday (May 16th) to reject the ongoing case against lifting the ban on wearing the Muslim headscarf at universities. The Republican People's Party, Turkey's major opposition party, filed with the Court, asking it to reject constitutional amendments that allowed the headscarf to be worn openly at public universities. Can concluded that the Constitutional Court lacks jurisdiction, as it could only review whether procedures on adopting amendments were observed. Eight of the 11 judges on the Court were appointed by former Turkish President Ahmed Necdet Sezer who was staunchly secular.
The ruling Justice and Development Party has one more case pending at the Constitutional Court, aimed at banning members from politics for threatening secularism. (Zaman - 18/05/08)

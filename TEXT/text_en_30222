LUXEMBOURG -- The EU's strategy for the Danube region was approved by the EU foreign affairs ministers as expected, the Hungarian EU presidency announced on Wednesday (April 13th). The strategy affects 14 countries along Europe's longest river -- eight EU member states (Germany, Austria, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania) and six non-EU countries (Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Ukraine and Moldova). It is aimed at addressing a number of wide-ranging issues, including better transport and energy connections, social and economic inequality, environmental threats, better security and safety and improved education systems. The strategy does not envision any additional funding but instead aims to use existing funds provided under the EU cohesion policy.

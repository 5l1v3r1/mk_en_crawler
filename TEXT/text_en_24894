TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Socialist Party (SP) on Wednesday (April 1st) criticised the government for failing to prepare the country well enough for the June 28th general elections. The SP says Albania cannot guarantee that one fifth of the voters will be able to cast their ballot as a result of glitches in issuing new ID cards, a process that began in January. Voters must present a passport or a new electronic ID card at the polls.
In other news on Wednesday, the ruling Democratic Party (DP) signed a pre-election agreement with the Environmentalist and Agricultural Party. This is the second such agreement on co-operation that the DP has reached, after the one with traditional ally, the Republican Party.

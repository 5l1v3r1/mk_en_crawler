PRIJEPOLJE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Some 1,000 family members gathered in the southwestern Serbian town of Prijepolje on Sunday (27 February) to remember 19 residents killed by Bosnian Serb militiamen during the 1992-1995 conflict. Local residents and human rights activists from Serbia joined the families. On 27 February 1993, a Bosnian Serb paramilitary group stopped a train in the village of Strpci, across the border in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and abducted 19 men, mostly Serbian Muslims. They were taken to Visegrad and executed. Only one of the 30 perpetrators has been convicted. The others remain at large. (AFP- 28/02/05)

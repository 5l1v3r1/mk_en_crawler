BELGRADE, Serbia -- The trial of those accused of assassinating Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic resumed before the Belgrade special court on Thursday (7 September) with pleas by some defendants. Presiding over the session was Nata Mesarovic, who is replacing Marko Kljajevic. The latter resigned as chairman of the three-judge panel last week. Judge Radmila Dragicevic-Dicic appeared for the first time at the Thursday hearing, filling Mesarovic's seat on the panel. At the proceeding, four of the defendants, including Milorad "Legija" Ulemek, pleaded not guilty to charges of murdering Djindjic in March 2003. (Danas - 08/09/06; Tanjug - 07/09/06)

Damaged bridges and overpasses on the highway between Skopje and Veles are being repaired under a NATO-funded project. In all, around 35m euros will be spent to help repair bridges that have sustained damage from heavy vehicles that use the highway for transport between Kosovo and the Greek port of Thessaloniki. 
A total of 60 bridges and four overpasses will be restored in the effort. The contractor selected for reconstruction and bridge reinforcement is the Turkish firm CESAS. The first phase, involving 30 bridges, got under way on October 23rd. Studies by the Faculty of Civil Engineering in Skopje suggest that the bridges on this section are the most damaged, so they are receiving priority. 
Thirty other bridges will be reconstructed in the second phase. In addition, reconstruction of four overpasses at Blace -- the border crossing between Kosovo and Skopje -- is planned. 
Two lanes of the highway have been closed for the project, and will remain out of commission for at least a year. Closure of the section initially caused a series of difficulties: people were unprepared and there was a lack of an adequate signalling system. The section has now been resignalled. 
The maximum speed on the section is 80 km/h, dropping to 60 km/h at places, and traffic police are recommending that drivers use caution. Police have also promised to introduce regular patrols to help prevent accidents. 
There have been disagreements over whether a toll should be charged. Following the closure of one lane, the public enterprise in charge of toll collection said it was necessary that drivers paid a toll. The government, however, has decided that that no toll should be paid.

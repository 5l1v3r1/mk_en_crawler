BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Radio B92 quoted sources Thursday (31 July) who said that military security forces have arrested Serbia-Montenegro Army Gen Vukosav Arsic on suspicion of corruption, forgery of documents related to the sale of army real estate, and embezzlement. Earlier in the week, the Supreme Defence Council reportedly sent him into retirement, along with several other officers and the head of military intelligence, Gen Radoslav Skoric. Defence Minister Boris Tadic refused comment but said the names of recently dismissed officers would be disclosed in ten days. (B92, Beta, BBC - 31/07/03)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) will carefully monitor Montenegrin authorities' steps in guaranteeing security during the first ever Gay Pride parade in the country, scheduled for May 31st, EC spokesperson Natasha Butler said on Monday (May 2nd). She added that threats against event organisers, posted in Facebook, are raising concerns. Butler said participation by senior officials in the Gay Pride event would be a symbolic gesture supporting the fight against discrimination. (Mina, RTCG, Tanjug - 02/05/11)

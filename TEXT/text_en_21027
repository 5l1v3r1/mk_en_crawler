BELGRADE, Serbia -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte paid a farewell visit to Serbia on Monday (December 3rd) prior to stepping down at the end of the month. She acknowledged progress in Serbia's level of co-operation regarding access to documents and archival information, but said she was disappointed that four remaining fugitives had not been arrested. Serbian officials reiterated they are doing all they can to meet remaining obligations to The Hague tribunal. Del Ponte's final report to the EU on Serbia's co-operation -- due in a week -- will determine to a large extent whether Belgrade signs a previously initialled Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU in January.

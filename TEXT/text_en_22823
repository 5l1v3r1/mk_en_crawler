ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan on Monday (May 5th) hailed the renewed dialogue with Iraqi Kurds, but warned that closer ties depend on their support in Turkey's fight against the militant Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, and the prime minister of the Kurdish administration in northern Iraq, Nechirvan Barzani, held talks last week with the chief advisor to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Ahmet Davutoglu."The meeting took place in an extremely positive atmosphere," Babacan said, adding that this was the first direct contact between the two sides in two years. 
Meanwhile, two PKK militants were killed on Monday by Turkish border police officers while trying to cross the Iraqi border into Turkey. The clash took place near Uludere in the Sirnak province, the General Staff said in a statement published on its website.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Since the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) government announced a draft amending 20 articles of the constitution a few weeks ago, President Abdullah Gul has met with leaders of opposition parties, trying to convince them of the need for change. The last of the meetings, Thursday (May 7th), was with the co-leader of the Democratic Society Party, Ahmet Turk, who refused to comment on his party's position but insisted it hopes for a more democratic and modern country. On Wednesday, Gul met with Nationalist Movement Party leader Devlet Bahceli. Though he agreed reforms are desirable, Bahceli said his party would oppose any change that would result in ethnic or cultural separatism. (Zaman, Hurriyet - 08/05/09)

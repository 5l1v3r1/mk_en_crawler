BELGRADE, Serbia -- The UN Security Council fact-finding mission arrived late Wednesday (April 25th) evening in Serbia, after talks in Brussels with senior EU and NATO officials on the Kosovo status issue. The team, led by Belgian Ambassador to the UN Johan Verbeke, met with EU security chief Javier Solana and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, as well as with NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer. 
According to Rehn, the EU views the adoption of a new UN Security Council resolution on Kosovo's status as key to providing international legitimacy and a legal basis for EU involvement in the province. For his part, de Hoop Scheffer urged the fast resolution of Kosovo's status, based on UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan, adding it would endanger European security to delay the process. 
The UN fact-finding mission meets with officials and NGOs in Belgrade, before heading on to Pristina on Friday. (Glas javnosti - 26/04/07; UN website, Tanjug, Beta, B92, Top-Channel, RTK, 24-ore, Telegrafi, AP, UPI - 25/04/07)

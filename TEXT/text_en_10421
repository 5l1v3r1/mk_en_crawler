SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The regular biannual Regional Table and Working Table meetings of the Stability Pact for Southeast Europe ended Friday (19 November) in Skopje. The event was attended by regional foreign ministers and by representatives of the EU, the United States, Switzerland, Norway, Japan, the OSCE and the civil administration in Kosovo. They agreed that the Stability Pact has helped intensify regional co-operation, which in turn has accelerated Euro-Atlantic integration processes. Stability Pact Co-ordinator Erhard Busek said Croatia and Macedonia, which are drawing closer to EU entry, are positive examples for others in the region. Macedonian Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva said Skopje hopes to start EU accession talks in 2006. (MIA, HINA, ATA, Macedonian radio - 19/11/04)

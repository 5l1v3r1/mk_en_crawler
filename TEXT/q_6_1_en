2. What are the plans and timetables for complete liberalisation of medium and long-term capital movements? Please distinguish between decisions already adopted, measures programmed, and conditional measures. 
Medium and long-term capital movements in the Republic of Macedonia are regulated by the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” Nos. 34/01, 49/01, 103/01, and 51/03). This Law regulates the inflow and outflow of capital of the Republic of Macedonia pursuant to Articles 58, 59, and 60 of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the European Union.  The main characteristics of the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations is the gradual liberalisation of the capital movement taking into account the timescale and the type of the capital in line with the obligations undertaken by the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and the strategy of gradual opening of the Republic of Macedonia towards the free movement of capital.  In order not to amend the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations at accession of the Republic of Macedonia to the European Union, these movements of capital are regulated in the transitory and final provisions, which were not liberalised immediately after this Law entered into force, but will, however, undergo liberalisation in a certain phase of the implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. The following movements of capital have not been entirely liberalised, however, the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations provides timelines for their liberalisation:  
 Investments by residents in real estate abroad are not permitted until the expiration of the first SAA phase (referred to in the Articles 11 and 59 of the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations)  
 Issue and introduction of domestic securities and resident share certificates of resident investment funds abroad, until the expiration of the first SAA phase, is permitted solely upon prior approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (Articles 13, 18, and 59 of the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations).  
 Residents,  except authorised banks, the Deposit Insurance Fund, insurance companies, pension funds and investment funds, cannot purchase securities until the expiration of the first SAA phase (Articles 14 and 59 of the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations). 
  Issue and introduction of foreign debt securities on domestic market with maturity of  three years or more is not permitted until the expiration of the first SAA phase (Articles 15 and 59 of the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations).  
  Domestic enterprises and natural persons can freely open and hold foreign exchange accounts  abroad after the expiration of the second SAA phase. In the meantime, certain residents may hold foreign exchange accounts abroad upon prior approval by the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia in accordance with the prescribed criteria (Articles 23 and 59 of the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations). 
 Regarding investments by non-residents in real estate in the Republic of Macedonia, as well as life and credit insurance transfers, the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations is liberal regarding transactions, however, it is conditioned by the provisions referred to in the relevant special laws or ratified international agreements (Article 12 of the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations). Other transactions pursuant to the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations are entirely liberalised. The annex table in question 1 of this Chapter (04_I_1) details all capital transactions and their liberalisation levels.  
3. Describe the key features of the current law on foreign exchange operations. 
By accepting IMF Article VIII Status in June 1998, the Republic of Macedonia introduced current account transaction convertibility abroad, entirely liberalising current account transactions between residents and non-residents.    In order to implement the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the European Union, a new Law on Foreign Exchange Operations was passed in April 2001 and entered into force in October 2002. Pursuant to the new Law on Foreign Exchange Operations a high level of liberalisation of capital transactions was implemented, in line with the SAA provisions.  The Law on Foreign Exchange Operations (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos 34/01, 49/01, 103/01, 54/02, 32/03, and 51/03) has been drafted on the basis of SAA and is completely aligned with the SAA provisions.  The main purpose of the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations is to regulate the terms and conditions for performance of operations that affect the balance of payments of the Republic of Macedonia and all other operations in foreign currencies if they are performed within the Republic of Macedonia and as such do not affect the balance of payments of the Republic of Macedonia. In this respect, the subject matter of the Law is the overall operations among residents and non-residents, regardless of the area where they are performed and whether it is in domestic or foreign currency. The subject matter of the Law are also the operations between the residents themselves, but only if the object of operation are foreign means of payment or if the operations are in foreign currency.  The Law divides the subjects according to their place of residence, i.e. according to their seat into residents or non-residents.  Definitions, i.e. the terms in the Law are in line with the EU regulations and that would facilitate access to EU membership because, in this regard, the terminology of the Law would not need to be changed and harmonised later on.  The Law is structured on several main subjects: current transactions, capital transactions (direct investments; investment in real estate, securities operations, credit operations and deposit account operations), payments and transfers, foreign exchange market and denar exchange rate, special NBRM measures, reporting and supervision of the enforcement of the Law. The main foreign exchange operations regulated by the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations are briefly elaborated in the remaining part of the answer.  
Current transactions between residents and non-residents are liberalised in line with the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations. Conclusion of contracts in foreign currency between residents is also liberalised; however, the currency of contract transactions is in denars (Articles 3 and 4).  
Direct investments of the residents abroad are liberalised in line with the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations. Direct investments of non-residents in the Republic of Macedonia are liberalised, except in the specific fields (military industry; natural, cultural and historic treasures; trade in arms; trade in narcotics). Pursuant to the Law there is an obligation to register all direct investments of residents and non-residents in the Ministry of Economy. The residents may freely transfer abroad the profit generated and the capital invested, pursuant to Article 59, paragraph 1 of the SAA (Articles 7, 8, and 9). 
Investments of residents in real estate abroad are not permitted until the expiration of the first SAA phase (Article 11). As for investments in real estate in the Republic of Macedonia by non-residents,  the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations refers to the application of a special law. Consequently, the regime of acquiring real estate in the Republic of Macedonia by non-residents is not regulated in this Law (Article 12).  The Law on Foreign Exchange Operations provides liberal conditions for issue and introduction of domestic securities abroad and investments of residents in securities abroad as well as issue and introduction of foreign securities in the Republic of Macedonia and investment of non-residents in securities in the Republic of Macedonia. Namely, until the expiration of the first SAA phase, the residents may issue and introduce domestic securities on foreign markets upon obtained approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and after the expiration of the first SAA phase, only submission to the Securities and Exchange Commission is required (Articles 13 and 59). Authorised banks may invest in foreign securities abroad in line with the criteria determined by the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia. In addition to authorised banks, the Deposit Insurance Fund, insurance companies and pension and investment funds may purchase securities abroad pursuant to the laws that regulate their operation.  Upon the expiry of the first SAA phase other residents (citizens and enterprises) may invest in foreign securities abroad (Articles 14 and 59).   
Foreign securities may be issued and introduced in the Republic of Macedonia upon the approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission, with the exception of foreign debt securities, with maturity of three years or more, whose issue and introduction is not permitted. Issue and introduction of these debt securities will be liberalised after the expiration of the first SAA phase (Articles 15 and 59). Non-residents may invest in domestic securities through authorised participants on the stock market. Securities are negotiated abroad or from abroad by an authorised bank (Articles 16 and 59).   
Non-residents may open foreign currency and denar accounts in Macedonian commercial banks and hold disposable assets (Article 24). Domestic enterprises may keep foreign currency on the foreign exchange accounts in the banks of the Republic of Macedonia and keep the assets on such accounts for an unlimited period. Domestic enterprises and natural persons may freely open and hold foreign exchange accounts in foreign banks upon the expiration of SAA. In the meantime, opening foreign exchange  accounts abroad is permitted only after obtaining prior approval by the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia and on the basis of provided criteria (Articles 23 and 59).   
Credit transactions, short-term and long-term, are entirely liberalised, and compulsorily recorded in the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia. Authorised banks may conclude credit transactions with non-residents on their behalf and for their own account or on their behalf and for the account of a third party; whereas residents which are not authorised banks may conclude credit operations on their behalf and for their own account with non-residents. Accordingly, enterprises and banks in the Republic of Macedonia may, without any complex administrative procedures, take loans from foreign banks or foreign companies; only a notification procedure is required to the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia. Credit relations among residents may also be concluded in foreign currency under the conditions prescribed by the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (Articles 20 and 21). 
Pursuant to the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations, payment operations abroad may be carried out by the banks authorised for these operations by the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia. Residents such as trade companies, sole proprietors, and subsidiaries of foreign legal persons in the Republic of Macedonia, may pay and charge in effective foreign currencies in transactions with non-residents on terms and conditions prescribed by the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (Articles 26 and 26-a).  
The Law lays down that the foreign exchange market covers all operations regarding purchase and sales of foreign currency, and the participants on the foreign exchange market may be: authorised banks, which can conclude purchase and sales operations on their own behalf and for their own account as well as on their own behalf and for the account of the third person; and other entities only on their own behalf and for their own account. Residents may purchase foreign currencies only for the needs of payment abroad and sell only on the basis of received payments from abroad (Article 31).  The main determination of the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations is that the exchange rate on the Foreign Exchange Market is freely established on the market (Article 33).  In case large capital outflows or inflows cause distortions in the balance of payments, which can affect the operations on the Foreign Exchange Market in the Republic of Macedonia as well as the management of the monetary and foreign exchange policy, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia may introduce special protective measures, but for period not exceeding six months, which is in accordance with SAA Article 59, paragraph 4. This possibility is provided for the risk of exceptional distortions in the balance of payments and of disturbances of the financial system stability (Articles 37, 38, and 39).   The implementation of the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations is handled by the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, the Ministry of Finance, customs authorities and the State Foreign Exchange Inspectorate, the Ministry of Economy, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. These supervisory bodies exchange the information on violations of provisions referred to in this Law and jointly work on the established irregularities (part 9 of the Law).   Penalty provisions are prescribed for violation of the provisions referred to in the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations. Namely, criminal liability is provided for serious violations. In addition to fines, a ban on performing certain operations may be issued for the violations committed (part 10 of the Law).  The transitional provisions lay down limitations on the enforcement of this Law pending the application of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the European Union and until the expiration of the first phase (part 11 of the Law).  
4. Please comment on the strategy for liberalisation of short-term capital movements. How is this strategy linked to other economic developments? How consistent is it with other policy objectives, in particular that of the exchange rate? Given experience elsewhere, are excessive inflows not considered more likely than initial outflows? Which instruments are available to manage inflows? 
The strategy for liberalisation of the short-term capital movement in the Republic of Macedonia is a gradual process, characterised by the presence of certain implicit limitations in the initial phase of the liberalisation as a prevention from possible destabilising speculations. Thus, pursuant to the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 34/01, 49/01; 103/01, and 51/03), which entered into force on 15.10.2002, an entire liberalisation of the short-term commercial and financial credits is realised in support of the free exchange of goods and services, and a partial liberalisation of portfolio investments aiming at gradual integration in the international financial markets and control of sudden short-term capital inflows/outflows.   The entire liberalisation of the short-term financial and commercial credits is followed by the establishment of an information system for their monitoring through compulsory registration in the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM).  Partial liberalisation of portfolio investments provides the following possibilities:  a) Residents may issue and introduce domestic securities on foreign markets only on the basis of approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (Articles 13 and 59);  b) Resident authorised banks may trade on their own behalf and for their own account on the foreign markets with securities issued or guaranteed by governments and OECD member states, by international financial institutions, and with other securities whose issuers have a high investment rating evaluated by at least one first class international rating agency.  Investment rating criteria are determined by the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia with a special decision (“Decision on determination of the type of securities that authorised banks may buy and sell abroad”, Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 53/02). Apart from authorised banks, at the moment, the Insurance Deposit Fund, pension funds, investment funds and insurance companies have the right to invest in foreign securities. All residents may invest in securities on those foreign markets which collaborate with the Macedonian Stock Exchange (Articles 14 and 59).  c) Non-residents may issue and introduce foreign securities on the domestic market only upon approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission, whereas issue and introduction of debt securities is limited to maturity of up to three years pursuant to the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations (Articles 15 and 59);   d) Pursuant to Article 16 of the Law, non-residents may trade with securities in the Republic of Macedonia only through an authorised participant where detailed regulation of the terms and conditions of the trade are under the competence of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, which has adopted a special decision for that purpose (“Decision on the terms and conditions for non-resident securities in the Republic of Macedonia, Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 53/02). By this Decision a unique method is established of securities transactions by banks and by authorised participants, and control is introduced over the inflow and outflow of foreign currency emerging from these types of investments, through registration in NBRM of the foreign exchange rights of the authorised banks. According to the Decision, in order to trade with securities non-residents must compulsorily open a custody account at the authorised bank in the Republic of Macedonia, whereby they conclude a contract, while the authorised bank is obliged to buy the right to obtain foreign currencies for those securities from the NBRM. The authorised bank is obliged to keep records for the securities condition and trade and inform NBRM on regular basis. The value of the purchased rights should be at any moment equal to the position of the securities. The rights are of a three-month length period and may be used every working day in the course of the quarter, and the purchase premium is determined quarterly by the Governor of NBRM. Purchased rights may be used only for foreign exchange outflow abroad by simultaneous decrease of the non-resident securities position in the course of the quarter. This Decision gives the possibility that the bank does not purchase the right unless the non-resident states in the custody account contract that the purchased securities shall not be transferred within a one-year period from the moment of their acquisition and authorises the custody bank to give an order to the Central Securities Depository to incorporate a ban of securities disposal in favour of the bank for a one-year period.   Such characteristics of the strategy for short-term capital liberalisation are consistent with the need for long-term assets sources to finance the current account of the balance of payments amounting to about 7% of GDP (without official transfers), as well as with the level of the development of the available instruments and financial markets (mostly the money and short-term securities market and the foreign exchange market).   The strategy of gradual and controlled liberalisation of short-term capital is also consistent with the current policy of the foreign exchange rate which presents a nominal anchor of the monetary policy.  Having regard to the experience of the other countries in transition, the liberalisation of the capital flows in conditions of higher interest rates in the Republic of Macedonia than in the developed countries and the recently obtained BB+ investment rating according to the Standard & Poor’s Rating Agency will probably result in higher capital inflow. In that, the securities portfolio is not sufficiently diversified due to the presence of only a small number of short-term securities on the domestic market (in 2004 the first continuous issuance of three-month and six-month government securities started, whereas, NBRM has been issuing treasury bills with 7 and 28-day maturity). From the aspect of available instruments to manage the inflows, beside the above-mentioned NBRM legal authority for the prescription of the terms and conditions of the securities trade, NBRM is actually able to intervene with market instruments through intervention on the foreign exchange market and through auctions of treasury bills on the open market. The former experience shows that the treasury bills, as a basic NBRM monetary instrument have enough capacity to sterilise the liquidity surplus, so that the action may also be taken by changing the mandatory reserve rate.  The Law on Foreign Exchange Operations (Articles 37, 38, and 39) also provides for the possibility, in case of risk of significant disturbances in the balance of payments and disturbances in the stability of the financial system caused by large capital inflow in the Republic of Macedonia, that the NBRM may introduce special measures (for up to 6 months) regarding non-resident accounts positions in the Republic of Macedonia; trade with foreign currency, if a resident is included; residents taking loans and credits from non-residents, as well as advance collection of residents from non-residents or deferred payments by residents to non-residents; payment of matured and outstanding debts of residents to non-residents; transfer of valuables, cash, securities, and gold to, and from, the Republic of Macedonia; transaction of securities and gold between residents and non-residents and issue of guarantees and/or similar security and provision of pledge and other types of guarantees in favour of non-residents.  In the answers on questions no 9 and 12 from section I. Monetary And Exchange Rate Issues, subsection D. Monetary And Exchange Rate Policy, of Chapter 11, (11_I_D_ 9 and 11_I_D_ 12respectively) the relations among the foreign exchange rate policy, the monetary policy and the liberalisation of capital movement are elaborated in details.  
5. On current account convertibility, it is our understanding that IMF Article VIII status was accepted in 1998. In this context, can the Republic of Macedonia confirm whether there are any remaining technical issues? 
In June 1998, the Republic of Macedonia accepted IMF Article VIII, hence introduced denar current account convertibility and total liberalisation of current account transactions among residents and non-residents. Namely, making and receiving payments intended for export and import of goods, services, income and transfers are completely liberalised pursuant to the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 34/01, 49/01, 103/01, and 51/03). The transfer of gain and other profit generated from foreign direct investments are free after settling all obligations towards the state.  Therefore, we may freely conclude that the Republic of Macedonia does not have any remaining technical issues. 
6. What are the obligations of the State regarding bonds issued for payment of frozen foreign exchange deposits: principal/interest? What is the market value of these bonds (in percentage)? What can these bonds be used for? 
Having regard to the need of permanent regulation of payment of the foreign exchange deposits and of providing the funds for their payment, in 2000 the Law on the Manner and the Procedure of Payment of Foreign Currency Deposits of the Citizens, guaranteed by the Republic of Macedonia, was passed (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 32/00, 108/2000, 4/2002, and 42/2003). Therefore, this long standing problem which significantly undermined citizens’ confidence in saving and in the banking system of the Republic of Macedonia, was finally solved permanently.      The bonds that the Republic of Macedonia issued on the base of the old foreign exchange savings are in a dematerialised form, registered and denominated in EUR and they are unrestrictedly transferable (Article 10 of the Law). The payment of the bonds is done according to the EUR middle exchange rate of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia valid on the day of the bond maturity.   The nominal value of the bonds is paid in 20 semi-annual instalments on 1 April and 1 October, and the first instalment is due on 1 April 2002 (Article 11 of the Law). The annual interest rate of the bonds is 2% and is paid in denars according to the middle exchange rate of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia valid on the day of the maturity. The payment of the interests is on 1 April and 1 October, and has started from 1 April 2001 (Article 12 of the Law).  Pursuant to the Law, Article 17, bonds in nominal value may be used for:     Payment of obligations pursuant to Article 109, paragraph 2 of the Law on Transformation of Socially-Owned Enterprises for conversion of internal shares into ordinary shares;    Payment of concession contribution and long-term lease;    Purchase and payment of stocks and shares in state owned enterprises in transformation;    Payments for purchase of denar claims, which pursuant to the Law on Financial Recovery and Reconstruction of part of the banks in the Republic of Macedonia are transferred to the Bank Rehabilitation Agency (at the moment these assets are transferred to the Ministry of Finance like a legal successor, since from April 2004 the Agency had ceased to exist),      Purchase and payment of state-owned flats;    Purchase of business premises owned by the Republic of Macedonia;   Payment for awarding and purchasing of urban land owned by the Republic of Macedonia;   Purchase of agricultural land owned by the Republic of Macedonia; and    Purchase and payment of state capital.  These bonds are traded through the Macedonian Long-Term Securities Exchange, in line with the stock-exchange market rules and may be traded by domestic and foreign natural and legal persons (Article 20 of the Law). These bonds are specially characterised by the fact that claims from the citizens do not expire (Article 18 from the Law).  On 19 September 2000 the trade with these bonds on the First Market in the Macedonian Long-Term Securities Exchange started. The initial price of these bonds was 60.91% of the bond value. However, depending on their demand, their value fluctuates with an upward trend. At the moment (October 2004), the market price of the bonds is 72.6% of their nominal value.   The funds for bonds payment (principal and interest) are provided annually in the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia (Article 14 of the Law). The table below includes details on bonds data.

7. What has been the contribution of foreign direct investment to the development of the economy? What was the size of FDI inflows (annual, cumulative and per capita) in recent years? What were the originating countries and into which sectors was it mainly channelled? What share has been brownfield (e.g. in the context of privatisation) and what share greenfield investment? 
In the period from 1991 to the end of 2003 the total investments in Macedonia amounted to USD 1.024 billion, a cumulative estimation of USD 497 per capita.  The positive effects of FDI  are reflected in increased competition, better quality of services, enlarged number of products, new technologies, and cost transparency. This can be noticed, in particular, in the sectors where the largest FDI inflows have been registered, such as telecommunications (37 %), banking (17 %), foodstuff production (8 %), production of oil, chemicals, rubber, plastic products (4 %), trade (3 %), as well as insurance (2 %).  The largest share of the FDI in the Republic of Macedonia, amounting to 37 %, was chanelled to the telecomunication sector; a result from the privatisation of the state-owned telecommunications company.  The privatised telecommunications company still has a monopoly on the fixed-line telephony, as well as to the entrance of the second foreign mobile operator in the area of mobile telephony.  FDI inflows in the banking sector amount to about 17 % of the total foreign investments. The Macedonian banking system is almost entirely reformed. As of 2003, in Macedonia there are 21 banks and 15 savings houses, so that almost the entire banking capital in the country (99 %) is concentrated in the banks. As much as 18 banks are authorised for foreign operations. The foreign capital in the banking system is of exceptional importance because 47.2 % of the banking capital belongs to foreign investors. As much as 15 banks, have in the structure of their capital a certain percentage of foreign shares, whereas 8 of them have majority shares, over 51 %, belonging to foreign investors.    The share of foreign investments in the insurance sector is also worth mentioning (about 2 %, i.e. USD 21.000.000) where entry of foreign capital contributed to an increase in the insurance services provided and an improvement of their quality. The largest national insurance company, was taken over by foreign investors through the process of privatisation, in addition, entrance of other foreign insurance companies has been registered.    Almost all FDI inflows in the period between 1997 and the end of 2003 came from the member states of the Europen Union. In 2003 FDI originating from EU, accounted for 56 % of the total inflow.  The biggest cumulative investor in Macedonia is Hungary investing USD 323 million (as a result of the purchase of JSC Macedonian Telecommunications), Greece with USD 234 million, followed by Cyprus, Germany, Switzerland etc.  Regarding foreign direct investments, annually and cumulatively, FDI per capita, investment origin, see Chapter 15 Question 4 section I subsection I (15_I_I_ 4).  NBRM has carried out an additional research on FDI structure based on the FDI structure in the banking sector and the records of the Privatisation Agency on foreign investments from privatisation and post-privatisation. According to these analyses, about 20 % of the total FDI inflow  has been invested directly through the process of state-owned enterprise privatisation by the Privatisation Agency of the Republic of Macedonia. Taking into account the privatisation of JSC Macedonian Telecommunications, the privatisation and post-privatisation of the banking sector, and FDI inflow in firms during the post-privatisation process, the percentage of total FDI through privatisation and post-privatisation amounts to 74 %.  
8. Could the authorities comment on privatisations of state-owned enterprises in the past and those envisaged in the future? Which sectors are involved? Does the government maintain any special rights (e.g. 'special shares', representation on the board of directors, veto rights on important decisions) in privatised companies? How many residual shares does the State own in privatised companies? Who/which institution is in charge of their management? How is the State represented in companies where it owns shares? Is there a strategy or an action plan for the management of State capital? 
Could the authorities comment on privatisations of state-owned enterprises in the past and those envisaged in the future? 
Soon after the embarking on the process of privatisation in the Republic of Macedonia it became obvious that the presence of state capital, distinctive from the social capital could be identified in the balance sheet of a large number of Macedonian enterprises. This was a reason for enacting a special Law on Privatisation of the State Capital (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 37/96, 25/99, 81/99, 49/00, and 06/02) in 1996.  Pursuant to this Law, the social capital has been sold together with the state capital during the privatisation process. In the enterprises subject to privatisation and possessing social capital, the status of the capital (social and state), was to a great extent equalised in order to achieve a favourable block of shares and to facilitate the attraction of numerous investors.   Four major periods of privatisation could be distinguished during the privatisation of the social (and later the state capital as well), as follows: (1) privatisation by the way of issuing internal shares pursuant to the Law on Social Capital (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 84/89 and 46/90) and the Law on Enterprises (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 77/88 and 61/90); (2) privatisation by the application of transformation models pursuant to the Law on Transformation of Enterprises with Social Capital (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 38/93, 48/93, 21/98, 07/97, 09/98, 21/98, 25/99, 39/99, 81/99, 49/00, 6/02, 31/03, and 38/04); (3) introduction of the possibility of privatisation by the way of direct sale of shares by direct negotiation with the strategic investor pursuant to the amendments to the Law on Transformation of Enterprises with Social Capital of 1999 (which was abandoned the following year due to the inherent non-transparency of the direct sale method); and (4) privatisation performed by massive sale of shares of social or state capital through the Macedonian stock market by public offering auction pursuant to the amendments to the Law on Transformation of Enterprises with Social Capital of 2003.  In addition to the privatisation of state capital as discussed above, privatisation of enterprises in state ownership, that were excluded from privatisation on the grounds of the Law on Transformation/Privatisation of Enterprises with Social Capital, is being carried out on the basis of special laws separately for each respective industry.  
Which sectors are involved? 
Privatisation of the JSC Macedonian Telecommunications was carried out on a basis of a special law. A number of other industries are expected to be privatised in the future: some parts of the health sectors (pharmacies, dental medicine, and spas), electric power company (generation and distribution of electricity), railways, post, some parts of social welfare activities, some parts of the culture activities etc.  Programs are being prepared to fully implement the maximum transparency rule, by elaborated marketing campaigns and fair selection of high-quality investors, in order to successfully complete the projected privatisation of these enterprises. The Electric Power Company is in the most advanced phase of its privatisation. Two documents have already been prepared by the consultant and adopted by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia: (1) Restructuring Model of the Electric Power Company, and (2) Implementation Plan for Restructuring of the Electric Power Company, and these activities have launched the process of transformation. In March 2004 the Law on Transformation of the Electric Power Company, Joint Stock Company for Production, Distribution, and Supply of Electric Power in State Ownership (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 19/04) was adopted, which stipulates that this Joint-stock Company be divided into two new companies:    Joint-stock Company MEPSO – owner and operator of the transmission system and manager of the electric power system as well as market operator , which shall remain in state ownership; and    Joint-stock Electric Power company (new), which shall cover the production assets and the function of generation, distribution and supply with electric power, and which will enter the privatisation process following a decision and a strategy developed by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. The model with regard to the transformation of the Macedonian Railways has been selected. It is projected that the existing public enterprise be transformed by means of its division into two parts: Infrastructure – Public Enterprise in state ownership, and Transport – Joint-stock Company, which might be later transferred to the private sector. In addition to this reorganisation, the transformation plan provides for a financial reorganisation of both companies; lay-off of employees; spin-off of all non-core activities; a proper definition of the infrastructure and the Government liability as its owner and a comprehensive definition of the possible Governmental support of the railway traffic. For that purpose a new Law on Railways has been drafted, being in line with the European Union directives.  The new amendments to the March 2004 Law on Health Protection (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 38/91, 46/93, 55/95, and 10/04), lay down provisions with regard to privatisation of some health sectors (pharmacies, dental medicine, and spas). 
Does the government maintain any special rights (e.g. 'special shares', representation on the board of directors, veto rights on important decisions) in privatised companies? 
The Government of the Republic of Macedonia nominates its representatives in the Shareholders’ Assembly or in the Owners’ Assembly (pursuant to the provisions referred to in the Law on Transformation of Enterprises with Social Capital and the Law on Privatisation of State Capital, on the basis of social or state capital shares/stakes issued in the company). The rights of the state representatives in the corporate bodies are aligned with the rights enjoyed by other shareholders stipulated in the Company Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia 28/04) and in the company acts. In particular cases/privatisations, such as JSC Macedonian Telecommunications, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia enjoys so-called special rights. The above is performed pursuant to the provision referred to in the Telecommunications Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 36/96, 17/98, 22/98, and consolidated text Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 28/00), which stipulates that the Government of the Republic of Macedonia is entitled to create a class of one or more shares (golden share) in the existing public telecommunications operator, thus obtaining additional rights. How many residual shares does the State own in privatised companies? State capital expressed in shares/stakes obtained upon various legal grounds as of 31.12.2004 has amounted to a nominal value of EUR 929 million. This amount includes the value of the capital in the Electro Power Company of Macedonia with EUR 683 million. The Table below presents the number of companies and the value of the capital where the Government and governmental institutions and enterprises have ownership, according to the percentage of the company ownership.

According to the Privatisation Agency, its portfolio of residual shares as of 31.12.2004, preceded by an extensive activity of residual shares trading by the end of 2004, comprises 86 enterprises with a total nominal value of their capital amounting to EUR 53,7 million. The Agency has 100% ownership in two of these enterprises with a total nominal value of their capital of EUR 9,0 million. It owns majority capital, over 50%, but less than 100% in 17 enterprises with a total nominal value of their capital amounting to 33,5 million EUR. In 17 enterprises the Privatisation Agency holds a significant majority share, between 20% and 50%, with a total nominal value of the capital of EUR 3,3 million In the remaining 50 enterprises the Agency possesses shares or stakes of less than 20% and a total nominal value of the capital of 7,7 million EUR. It should be noted that the number of shares and stakes transferred to the Agency may nominally increase as a result of possible default of payment of the outstanding instalments by the privatisation contract signatories. This imposes the question of a continuous monitoring of their status. In addition, one can also notice a certain non-correspondence between the Privatisation Agency data and the Central Securities Depositary ones. As it was emphasised in the question commenting privatisation, some enterprises, the residual shares of which cannot be presently traded by the Agency, are the once having not identical records in the Central Securities Depositary and in the Privatisation Agency. Both institutions are currently making efforts to reconcile the data.   
Who/which institution is in charge of their management? How is the State represented in companies where it owns shares? Is there a strategy or an action plan for the management of State capital? 
Pursuant to the Law on Privatisation of State Capital, the Government Privatisation Commission manages and possesses the state capital as obtained and defined in this Law on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. The Privatisation Agency is in charge of the technical and administrative operations for the needs of the Privatisation Commission.  Considering the fact that privatisation is in its completion phase, the Privatisation Agency is scheduled to cease its operation by 31.03.2005 pursuant to the amendments to the Law on Transformation of Enterprises with Social Capital (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 31/03 and 38/04). The 2003 amendments to this Law precisely stipulate the allocation of all activities, rights and duties, and the property currently owned by the Privatisation Agency of the Republic of Macedonia to other state institutions. The capital which will not have been sold by that time, pursuant to this Law, shall be transferred to the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund, whereas the competences shall be undertaken by the Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Finance and the Public Enterprise for Management of Housing and Business Premises of the Republic of Macedonia. Further activities with regard to the management of the state capital are focused on speeding up the process of disposal of the remaining part of the state capital portfolio of the Privatisation Agency of the Republic of Macedonia. Privatisation is intended to be one of the essential mechanisms within the public sector transformation process on both national and local level. Privatisation shall be carried out following a thorough analysis of the specific industry conditions, and the possibility for application of different methods of privatisation shall be considered, starting from privatisation by spinning off part of the industries, implementing different types of concessions, BOT and BOO arrangements or embarking to a full fledged privatisation of assets in the case it is deemed to be the most efficient solution. Attracting foreign capital shall be considered as an important objective in the course of the privatisation, without limiting possible participation of the citizens. Privatisation shall be preceded by setting up an effective legal and regulatory framework as needed.  In spite of the significant privatisation in 1990’s and the beginning of the first decade of this century, the state still remains owner of some commercial enterprises, and even though the state strategy in this respect is basically focused on divesting state ownership, it shall not occur instantly and certainly not in each individual case in which the state is the owner of the capital. In the meantime, the state has to improve the principles of state capital management with a purpose of improving the operative efficiency of enterprises with state capital. The state should aim at application of the accepted principles of corporate governance, assisting thus in ensuring economic benefits not only for enterprises with state capital but also for the society in general.  The Republic of Macedonia has not yet defined a specific strategy with regard to state capital management. The issue of corporate governance in cases where the state is the sole owner is conducted on the basis of the global legal frame for corporate governance (primarily the Company Law) or the laws on individual public activities on the basis of which the state has established public enterprises. In some way the corporate governance in companies exclusively owned by the state is covered by the applicable legislation, but better practices for corporate governance should be implemented in the future for the cases where the state is the owner of a majority or a minority capital share.   When the Privatisation Agency ceases to exists, the shares and stakes it manages shall be reallocated to the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund of the Republic of Macedonia. Until the time of reallocation, the Privatisation Agency has been engaged as a representative of the state that was in charge of the nomination of members in the companies’ executive boards. This has often been conducted upon proposal by the relevant ministries. There is no elaborated written procedure for the nomination and monitoring of the operation of the nominated members. The need to better define these policies and procedures will be even more critical with the reallocation of the shares in the Fund. In this respect, it is important to mention that the Law anticipates that, in cases when the reallocated shares or stakes contribute to less than 50% of the total company stock, they will be converted into preference shares, thus implying that the Fund shall not be concerned for active management of the shares. But if they participate with more than 50% in the company stock, they maintain the ordinary shares or stakes status and the Fund shall have to undertake the role of active owner. So far the legislation does not provide for detailing of the management procedures. The decision to convert minority shares into priority shares implicitly indicates the state determination not to be engaged in the management of companies with state capital. However, taking into consideration the extensive portfolio of the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund, the Fund (in accordance with the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, and in particular, with the Ministry of Finance) will have to draft a management strategy. This strategy shall include not only portfolio management but also active management of particular companies. The Fund might transfer the portfolio management activity to professional managers, but the outlining of the objectives to be obtained and the mechanisms to be engaged in this regard need to be defined by the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund.   Management of other state assets should be also discussed, in particular, the receivables, which are under the competence of the Sector for Assets Management within the Ministry of Finance. The issue with regard to management of the state capital is also raised in the framework of receivables management, in the course of their collection, sale, assigning, or other type of their management. A particular case is when the enterprises, from which the state has receivables, undergo bankruptcy procedure and when a Board of Creditors is established in which the state, being one of the creditors has to nominate its representatives. During the operation of the Asset Management Agency there were certain internal procedures in place, which could be further detailed and the principles and practices in all segments of state capital management should be levelled regardless of what is the source of their developing: ownership or debt relation. While discussing management of state capital, the operation of the Public Enterprise for Management of Housing and Business Premises of the Republic of Macedonia should be also considered. This Agency operates on the basis of its own regulations and rules, however, the global management principles should also apply.  1.  In the course of setting up a detailed strategy of management of state capital, the fundamental principles of corporate governance of the state enterprises drafted by OECDshould be observed, and even though they are in a phase of discussion and detailing, they clearly define the basic matters that need to be respected. They are classified in six chapters and refer to the following: Ensuring of an efficient legal and regulatory frame for state enterprises. Consequently, it is expected that the state shall ensure such a legal frame where the state and private sector should be treated on equal basis so that the state enterprises shall not have an advantage over private companies neither through regulatory nor industrial policy of the state. General rules should apply for both state and private companies on equal basis. In other words, the functions of the state as a regulator and as an owner should be clearly divided. It seems that Macedonian legal system does ensure fairly levelled playing field, however, there is still a room for improvement in the enforcement of these regulation in practice.   2.  The state should act as a good, active and responsible owner. It should define a clear and consistent ownership policy, defining that the management of the state enterprises shall be transparent and accountable, containing the necessary level of competence and efficiency. It is probable that this area should be in the focus in the future period. Consequently, the ownership policy should be defined to determine: (a) aims, (b) the role of the state in the corporate governance, and (c) mechanisms to be deployed for the accomplishment of the policy. The so-called entity responsible for ownership should be identified within the governmental administration. If more institutions in a country are in charge of the ownership (as is the case in Macedonia) the coordinating entity should also be appointed. The accountability of the coordinating entity and the other entities in charge of the ownership should be clearly defined. In these terms with the accountability towards the Assembly is a better form of organisation (which, for example, a department of the Ministry of Finance is not provided with). The key point in the management process is that the entity responsible for the ownership introduces a well-structured and transparent nomination procedure of the members in the managing and other boards in the enterprises where the state has full or majority ownership. The state should refrain from direct participation in the day-to-day management of the companies, but it should hold accountable its members of the companies boards, allowing them operative autonomy. For each enterprise where the state owns shares or stakes, it is responsible, through the entity liable for the ownership to (a) participate in the assemblies of shareholders (assemblies of members) and to vote on the basis of the shares (stakes) owned by the state, (b) strive for establishing information systems that shall enable regular monitoring and evaluation of the company performance, (c) ensure dialogue with the external company auditors, (d) establish remuneration of the members of the company boards which shall be in accordance with the long-term company interests and attractive enough to qualified professionals.  3.  Equal treatment of shareholders (stakeholders). The state should also be sensitive concerning the rights of other shareholders in the companies where it owns shares and should ensure transparency to all shareholders.  4.  The state should ensure that enterprises in its ownership fulfil their liabilities regarding other stakeholders in the companies, and that are in line with the general legal and moral codes of operation. 5.  Transparency and disclosure of information pursuant to the rules for good corporate governance. Setting up a department for internal control, regular implementation of external audit (independent from the state audit).  6.  Managing boards in the state enterprises should have the following attributes: they should have the appropriate authority, competences, impartiality, integrity and accountability so that they can strategically manage and monitor the executive management. It is important to point out that nomination of the members from administration should be applied to limited and transparent nomination procedures, as a rule. Good practices of corporate governance suggest that the Board President’s role should be different from the General Executive Director. The boards of directors should be submitted to annual evaluation of their operation.  With regard to the above-stated the Ministry of Finance should prepare a detailed strategy for state capital management, which, in particular, should cover the following:  a)  Determination of the objectives of state ownership;  b)  Assessment of whether, and where, if needed, there is a necessity for amending the regulation regarding achievement of the state capital management strategy in terms of its incorporation of the best corporate governance practices;  c)  Definition of the coordinative entity of the ownership and its competences.   d)  Drafting an accurate registry of the property owned by the state and the nominee owners institutions in charge of ownership management.   e)  Definition of the procedure regarding cooperation between relevant ministries, relevant entities in charge of state ownership, and the coordinating entity of the ownership and their setting accountability mechanisms.  f)  Definition of the procedures regarding nomination of the executive board members in the companies with state owned capital;  g)  Definition of the procedures with regard to monitoring of the performance of the enterprises and nominated members of their boards.  h)  All institutions in the country responsible for management of the state capital or state assets (the Sector for Assets Management within the Ministry of Finance, the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund, the Public Enterprise for Management of Housing and Business Premises of the Republic of Macedonia, other ministries and state institutions) should be entrusted to draft their own policies (or to reconsider their existing ones) from the point of view of management of the assets and from the point of view of their consideration to the best practices of corporate governance in their operation; and  i)  Definition of the procedures regarding management of the present state capital portfolio and other assets (or reconsideration where those procedures have not been optimally set up): sale, exchange of property, assigning, purchase etc.  
9. Was there considerable inflow of capital other than FDI (portfolio investment, other)? If so, did it pose problems for the conduct of monetary policy or the exchange rate? How were such problems resolved? If such inflows have not yet taken place, how do the authorities envisage managing their impact in the future? 
The partial liberalisation of capital transactions began in October 2002 after the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 34/01, 49/01, 103/01, and 51/03) had entered into force. Large capital inflows have not taken place due to the shortness of the time period. Therefore, portfolio investments (which are partly liberalised) present an insignificant percentage of GDP. In addition to the partial liberalisation of these transactions, a factor contributing to the low level of this kind of inflows is the quite weak diversification of securities portfolio of both equity securities and debt securities.     On the other hand, in certain periods, more substantial inflows have been realised on the basis of medium-term loans and credits, where inflows based on credits from multilateral creditors (IBRD, IMF, IFC, EBRD) have dominant participation which also does not pose any problems from the aspect of implementation of the monetary policy.  One of the most significant foreign exchange inflows in the banking system was the inflow based on foreign exchange deposits due to the euro-conversion in 2001. Namely, the introduction of the euro in the beginning of 2002, as well as the need for conversion of currencies into euro resulted in moving the foreign exchange saving from “under-the-mattress” to the banking system. However, the significant increase in the foreign exchange liquidity of the banks did not result in the pressure of appreciation of the domestic currency, which is mainly due to several factors: a) uncertainty regarding foreign exchange deposit withdrawal, where the banks led an extremely conservative policy regarding their placement and conversion in domestic currency; and b) the refraining from greater activities on the part of large economic subjects, caused by the security crisis in 2001.

The available inflow management instruments are presented in the answer to Chapter 4: Free movement of capital, I. The regime of capital and current account payment movements. Question 4 04_I_ 4). 10. Is the financial system sufficiently developed to cope with the greater freedom of capital movements? What are the implications for financial supervision? Is there a clear division of competencies among the authorities that are in charge of financial supervision? Please provide details. 
The provisions referred to in the Law on Foreign Exchange Operationss (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 34/01, 49/01, 103/01, and 51/03) enable sufficient liberalisation of the foreign exchange regime. It can be concluded that in the course of the two-year enforcement of this Law, the financial institutions have not had any disturbances, i.e. problems, due to the high liberalisation of the capital movements. There is, of course, always a need for a continuous development of the financial system, so that competition may empower all financial institutions to lead a prudent business policy, protected from the potential risks from their operations.      The financial system of the Republic of Macedonia comprises the following financial institutions:   Banks;   Savings houses;    Exchange offices;    Insurance companies;    Financial lease companies;    Brokerage companies;    Swift money transfer companies    The Macedonian Securities Exchange Market;    The Central Securities Depository;    The Deposit Insurance Fund;

Pursuant to the legislation in the Republic of Macedonia, supervisory bodies are clearly set up for all financial institutions, and the competences of the financial supervisory bodies are clearly defined.   Banks, savings banks, exchange offices, and the companies for swift money transfer services are under direct supervision of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia. Insurance companies and financial lease companies are under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance. The Macedonian Stock-Exchange Market, brokerage companies and the Central Securities Depository are under the competence of the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Even though current legislation is set up and appropriate supervisory bodies are established, investment funds and pension funds have not been established yet in the Republic of Macedonia. Reform of the pension system is ongoing, and in 2005 it is expected that two pension funds as a second mandatory pillar of the pension system will be established by tender procedure. It is provided that investment funds will be under the direct supervision of the Securities Commission, and a special Agency for Supervision of the mandatory fully funded pension insurance will be in charge of the supervision over the private pension funds.   
In Chapter III, the answers: (03_II_A_4_18), (03_II_B_2_6), and (03_II_C_1_1) detail the legal frame and competences of all supervisory bodies of the financial institutions in the Republic of Macedonia.  Due to the high liberalisation of capital movements that has been enabled since 2002 by the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations, supervisory bodies in the Republic of Macedonia , within their secondary legislation, have established criteria and methods regarding the operation of the financial institutions with the intent of protecting them from foreign exchange risks.  The banks have a dominant share in the financial system of the Republic of Macedonia. Thus, the biggest portion of this answer will contain an elaboration of banking regulations from the aspect of capital movement and protection from foreign exchange risks.  In order to implement the monetary and foreign exchange policy of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, a range of prudent standards is provided regarding capital transactions, i.e. investments of both residents abroad and non-residents in the Republic of Macedonia.  Pursuant to the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations, there is a complete liberalisation of the bank credit operations both in the area of credit approval to non-residents and in the area of lending of foreign exchange to residents. The conditions to be fulfilled for foreign exchange credit approval to residents are prescribed in the Decision on terms and conditions regarding conclusion of foreign exchange credit operations between residents (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 66/02). The prudent standards included in the Banking Law and its secondary legislation regulating undertaking of credit risk by the banks is equally applied to all credit exposure regardless of whether it is denar, foreign exchange, or credit exposure to residents or non-residents. In the case of placement of assets with non-resident banks, pursuant to the Decision on establishment of the methodology for classification of the active balance and off-balance bank positions according to the level of their risk (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 21/01-consolidated text), the banks are obliged to provide a special reserve for country risk. The risk rate for different countries is presented in a special list which is provided to the banks on a quarterly basis by the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia.   The Law on Foreign Exchange Operations regulates in detail capital transactions related to securities operations:    Issuance and introduction of domestic securities abroad;   Investment by residents in securities abroad;   Issuance and introduction of foreign securities in the Republic of Macedonia;   Investments in securities by non-residents in the Republic of Macedonia; and    Direct investments on the basis of investments in securities.  In order to restrict the risk undertaken by the banks regarding investments in foreign securities, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia has adopted a Decision on determining the type of securities, which authorised banks may purchase and sell abroad (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 53/02). This Decision determines the qualitative criteria of issuers, as well as the credit rating of the securities banks may invest in.   The Law on Foreign Exchange Operations and the Decision on the terms and conditions of securities operations of non-residents in the Republic of Macedonia (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 53/02; 11/03, and 19/03) regulate the conditions for securities operations for non-residents in the Republic of Macedonia. Regarding all investments of non-residents in securities, with the exception of the cases from Item 1 of the above-mentioned Decision, it is provided that non-residents must, compulsorily, open custody accounts with the authorised banks in the Republic of Macedonia. Authorised banks keeping custody accounts are obliged to keep records of the purchased and sold securities. In order to restrict the speculative character of the non-resident transactions with securities and the possible disturbances of the foreign exchange market that may be caused by these transactions, the non-resident is obliged to:    Provide a statement that the purchased securities will not be sold within one year from the day of their acquisition;     Authorise the custody bank to give an order to the Central Securities Depository, which will instruct to record a prohibition on having at disposal securities that would be to the benefit of the bank for a period of one year.  Unless the above-mentioned statements or authorisations are obtained, the authorised bank is obliged to purchase the foreign exchange provision right within the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia for the position of the securities it is in custody of. The value of the purchased rights at any moment must be at least equal to the position of the securities. The rights are of 3-month duration and may be used each working day in the course of the quarter, and the premium is determined by the Governor of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia. The purchased rights may be used only for foreign exchange outflow abroad and only with a simultaneous decrease of the position of the investor’s securities in the course of the quarter.   The monitoring of the bank exposure to the risk from exchange rate fluctuations arising from bank exposure (open long or short positions) in some currencies is regulated by the Decision on determination and calculation of open foreign exchange positions of the banks (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 103/01 – consolidated text). This regulation is a prudent instrument to monitor the risk exposure of the banks and minimise the risks created as a result of significant disturbances of the exchange rate of certain currencies, where the banks have an open position in relation to the denar. Pursuant to this Decision, the open foreign exchange position of a particular currency may amount to up to 20% of the guarantee bank capital, with the exception of the open foreign exchange position in euro, which may be up to 30% of the guaranteed bank capital, the open aggregate foreign exchange position up to 50% of the guarantee bank capital, and the open short foreign exchange position in a particular currency and the aggregate short open foreign exchange position up to 10% of the guarantee bank capital. In line with the Decision on the methodology of establishing risk weighted bank assets (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 50/01), due to the provision of an appropriate level of capital to cover exchange rate risks, in the calculation of the capital adequacy indicator, the open aggregate foreign exchange position, established in line with the Decision on estimation and calculation of open foreign exchange bank positions, is also taken into account.    As a result of the liberalisation of the foreign exchange regime, in the course of 2003 an obligation for the banks was introduced to allot and maintain a compulsory foreign currency reserve. This obligation was introduced by the Decision on compulsory bank foreign currencies reserve (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 19/03). According to this Decision, the base for calculation of the compulsory reserve are the foreign exchange bank obligations to residents and non-residents. The compulsory foreign exchange reserve rate, introduced by this Decision, is 7,5%, and is calculated on the 10 day of each month, and is allotted in euro on a special foreign exchange account in NBRM.    All above-mentioned secondary legislation that additionally regulates the provisions of the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations as well as prudent supervisory standards, enable the prudent framework to restrict bank possibilities as dominant subjects in the financial system to undertake high risk exposures in conditions of a liberalised foreign exchange regime, in particular, in the part of capital transactions.   What is missing in the existing legal framework is the prudent regulation to regulate bank exposure to market risk and interest rate risk emerging from investments in both domestic and foreign equity and debt securities, as well as inclusion of quantitative indicators regarding exposure to these risks in the methodology of calculation of the capital adequacy rate as a general indicator of the bank solvency position.   Pursuant to the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations insurance companies, pension funds, and investment funds may invest in securities abroad. The conditions to be fulfilled by issuers and the securities credit rating in which insurance companies, pension funds, the Deposit Insurance Fund, and investment funds may invest are regulated by the laws that regulate the operation of these institutions, and which to a great extent do not deviate from the criteria prescribed in the Decision on determination of the type of the securities which authorised banks may purchase and sell abroad.   With regard to other financial institutions, we will discuss insurance companies. Pursuant to the Law on Supervision of Insurance (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 27/02, 84/02, 98/02, and 33/04), companies are obliged to carry out adjustment of invested assets covering technical reserves, and which are exposed to risk of potential losses as a result of the change in interest rates, exchange rate fluctuation, credit risk and other market risks, due to the obligations emerging from insurance contracts affected by these changes. In the course of asset investments covering technical reserves, an insurance company is also obliged to take into account the maturation of its obligations arising from insurance contracts. In addition to this, an insurance company may adjust its investments to assets which cover mathematic reserve with its obligations arising from insurance contracts, whose amounts depend on the foreign exchange rate fluctuation only up to 80%.  Types of permitted investments of the insurance companies are detailed in the answer to the question (03_II_B_4_21) Chapter 3 of the Questionnaire. The scope and the type of invested assets of capital pension funds and investment funds are detailed in the answer to the question (04_I_ 11) Chapter 4.  11. Does a substantial inflow of capital provide the opportunity for a more balanced opening of the capital account, by allowing residents to invest abroad? In this context, what are the investment rules applied to institutional investors (e.g. pension funds) regarding investment in foreign securities? 
Large foreign capital inflow means a bigger capital account, which in conditions of low accumulation of the domestic capital gives possibilities of easier liberalisation (or management) of the capital account outflow as well as investments abroad.    Pursuant to the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations, insurance companies, pension and investment funds as well as institutional investors in the Republic of Macedonia may purchase securities abroad in line with the laws that regulate their operations.   After the expiry of the first SAA phase, other residents (citizens and enterprises) may also invest in foreign securities abroad.  Nowadays only 9 insurance companies operate in the Republic of Macedonia as institutional investors. The investment policy of the insurance companies, including legal criteria and restrictions to invest in foreign securities, is detailed in the answer to the question (03_II_B_4_21) Chapter 3 of the Questionnaire. In 2005 two pension funds will be established as a second compulsory pillar of the pension system. Pursuant to the Law on Mandatory Fully Funded Pension Insurance, in Article 105 (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos.  29/00, 85/03, and 40/04) the securities in which pension funds may invest abroad are determined, as follows:   1.  Bonds and other securities issued by foreign governments and central banks of the member states of the European Union, Japan and USA;   2.  Debt securities which have a recommended investment rating, consistent with international credit rating agencies, issued by non-public, foreign companies or banks from the member states of the European Union, Japan and USA;  3.  Shares issued by foreign companies or banks which have a recommended investment rating, consistent with international credit rating agencies, and which are traded on major stock exchange markets in the member states of the European Union, Japan or USA;  4.  Share documents, shares and other securities issued by authorised investment funds established in the member states of the European Union, Japan or USA, which have mainly invested in shares quoted on the stock markets in those countries.    Investment in particular types of foreign instruments is subject to the following restrictions pursuant to Article 107 of the Law:    Up to 20% of the value of the pension fund assets may be invested in foreign issuer’s instruments out of the Republic of Macedonia. In the scope of this restriction, up to 5% of the assets value of the pension fund may be invested in the instruments indicated in item 2, and up to 5% of the assets value of the pension fund may be invested in the instruments indicated in items 3 and 4;   Pension fund assets may be invested in securities of the same issuer up to 10% of the nominal value of each security issued by that issuer.  The Supervision Agency of the capital funded pension insurance, in line with the Rulebook for investments in the pension funds (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 44/04), regulates in detail the quality of securities in which pension fund assets may be invested; the countries or groups of countries in which pension fund assets may be invested and the highest amounts from pension funds assts that may be invested in one company or a trade company, or in one instrument.    The Law on Investment Funds (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 09/00) does not regulate special investment restrictions of the investment fund assets in foreign securities. The Law, according to Article 14, provides investment restrictions regarding both domestic and foreign securities, as follows:    Funds must not invest more than 20 % of their assets in securities of a single issuer;    Funds may acquire up to 20 % of the total number of securities issued by a single issuer;    Funds may acquire up to 15 % of the total nominal value of debt securities issued by a single issuer; and    Funds may not invest in more than 15 % of the total number of shares issued by one issuer, and more than 10 % of the total nominal value of debt securities issued by a single issuer.  
12. Please explain in detail the nature and scope of restrictions on the acquisition of real estate by foreigners in your country. 
1. One of the fundamental values of the general provisions referred to in the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 52/91) determines that everything not prohibited by the Constitution and law is permitted in the Republic of Macedonia  (Article 8, paragraph 2)  The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia determines that a foreign person may acquire the right to ownership in the Republic of Macedonia under conditions determined by law (Article 31).   Regarding real estate, constitutional provisions referred to in Article 56, paragraphs 1 and 3, and Article 30, paragraph 2 are in line with this constitutional provision.   Namelly, pursuant to Article 56, paragraph 1 referred to in the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, all natural resources of the Republic of Macedonia, the flora and fauna, all amenities  as well as the objects of cultural and historical importance determined by law are goods of common interest for the Republic of Macedonia and enjoy special protection. Pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article, the terms and conditions under which particular common goods in the Republic of Macedonia may be subject to concession are regulated by law.   Pursuant to Article 30 paragraph 2 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, ownership of property creates rights and liabilities and serves for the benefit of the individual and the community.  Acquisition of the right to real estate ownership for domestic and foreign persons in the Republic of Macedonia is regulated by a number of laws. The Law on Ownership and Other Real Rights (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 18/01) is a lex generalis regulating generally the issue of real estate ownership and other real rights, thus settling the issue of real estate ownership in general, but it refers to a special law (lex specialis) regarding certain property right issues. This Law and the special laws in line with the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia build a system regarding acquisition and restriction of real estate property rights for both domestic and foreign persons.  In line with this system of the rights and restrictions to real estate ownership acquisition, foreigner rights are equal with the rights of the domestic persons, but there are differences regarding particular real estate (restrictions for foreign persons) depending on the real estate features or reciprocity concerning the acquisition of property rights.   In the Republic of Macedonia, in the case of existence of acquisition right to particular property there are no quantitative restrictions.  
2. In the legislation of the Republic of Macedonia in the field of ownership, pursuant to the Law on Ownership and Other Real Rights, there is real estate that may be owned only by the state or may not be subject to domestic and foreign legal and natural persons’ property rights (determined to be of general or public interest by positive regulations). Thus, domestic and foreign persons may not be holders of the property right for common goods, public roads, waters, watercourses and lakes, woods in state ownership (except in the case of exchange of state owned woods with woods in domestic private ownership for consolidation of the complexes), and agricultural land in state ownership (except in the case of exchange of agricultural land in state ownership with private owned agricultural land in line with conditions determined by law).  Pursuant to the Law on Ownership and Other Real Rights (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 18/01), common goods (streets, roads, bridges, squares, parks) are state owned goods used by all natural and legal persons (Article 16, paragraph 4).  Pursuant to the Law on Public Roads (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 26/96, 40/99, 96/00, and 29/02), public roads are common goods and are in state ownership (Article 2, paragraphs 1 and 2).  Pursuant to the Law on Waters (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 04/98 and 19/00), waters, watercourses and lakes as common goods of the Republic of Macedonia enjoy special protection determined by this Law and are owned by the state. (Article 2) Pursuant to the Law on Forest Protection (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 47/97 and 07/00), forests in state ownership are common goods of the Republic of Macedonia and enjoy special protection determined by this Law. They are treated like agricultural land and are not subject to acquisition of property right.     With regard to the mentioned real estate, foreign natural and legal persons have an equal legal position with domestic persons because both categories are excluded from the possibility to acquire the property right.  
3. Foreign persons in the Republic of Macedonia, unlike domestic persons, may not acquire property rights to the following types of real estates: construction land, agricultural land, and forests in private ownership.  Pursuant to the Law on Ownership and Other Real Rights (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No.18/01) (Articles 245 and 246), the Law on Construction Land (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 53/01), and the Law on Agricultural Land (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 25/98, 18/99, and 2/04), foreign natural and legal persons may not acquire right to own land (construction and agricultural) in the Republic of Macedonia.   Foreign persons may have a long-term lease right to construct business buildings and premises as well as residential buildings and flats, upon approval by the Ministry of Justice, upon prior opinion acquired from the Ministry in charge of urban planning and construction and the Ministry of finance; and regarding long-term lease of agricultural land on the basis of approval by the Ministry of justice, upon prior opinion acquired from the Ministry of agriculture, forestry and water economy and the Ministry of finance.   To acquire the long-term lease right to construction and agricultural land, there is a condition of reciprocity provided for in the Law on Ownership and Other Real Rights, determined by the Ministry of justice.   
4. Pursuant to the Law on Forest Protection (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 47/97 and 07/00), foreign natural and legal persons may not acquire the right to forest ownership in the Republic of Macedonia.   Pursuant to the Law on Agricultural Land (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 25/98, 18/99 and 02/04), foreign persons may not acquire the right to own agricultural land in public and private ownership.  Pursuant to the Law on Nature Protection (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 67/04), foreign persons may not acquire the right to real estate ownership situated in the protected natural areas.  
5. In the legislation of the Republic of Macedonia there is a condition according to which foreign natural and legal persons in their right to acquire real estate are equal with domestic persons, however, the acquisition of such right may be accomplished only if the foreign natural or legal persons establish a legal person registered in the Republic of Macedonia as a domestic legal person.   
13. Please outline considerations involved in plans for the eventual liberalisation of inward investment in real estate in your country, distinguishing, if appropriate, between agricultural, forest, industrial, residential (urban, rural, coastal), security areas. In this context, what progress has been made on the establishment of a land register? 
1. Fundamental values, pursuant to Article 8 paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (Official Gazette of of the Republic of Macedonia No. 52/91), among others, are: legal protection of property; freedom of market and entrepreneurship; respect for generally accepted norms of international law. In this scope, everything that is not forbidden by the Constitution and by law is free. (Article 8, paragraph 2) Pursuant to Article 30 paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, the right of ownership and the right of inheritance are guaranteed.  Pursuant to Article 30 paragraph 2 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia no person may be deprived of their property and have their rights arising thereof restricted, except when public interest determined by law is in question.   Pursuant to Article 30 paragraph 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, in cases of property expropriation or in case of ownership restriction, the rightful compensation is guaranteed, which cannot be lower than the market value.  Pursuant to Article 30 (paragraph 2) of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, ownership creates rights and obligations and serves for the benefit of the individual and the state.  The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia specifies that a non-resident in the Republic of Macedonia may acquire a property right under conditions detemined by law (Article 31). This means that the foreign person’s property right is acquired pursuant to law.  The Law on Ownership and Other Real Rights (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No.18/01), is lex generalis and regulates the issue of real estate ownership and other real rights in general; thus the law regulates, in general, the issue of real estate ownership; however, for certain issues it focuses on a special law (lex specialis) to regulate the rights to ownership. This Law and the special laws in correlation with the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia set up a system regarding acquisition and restriction of the rights to real estate ownership both for domestic and foreign persons.  
2. In the Republic of Macedonia there is a possibility of investments in real estate by domestic and foreign natural and legal persons in: construction land; agricultural land; forests; roads; residence space (apartments); business premises (administrative and economic space); mineral raw materials; waters; commercial activities; energetics.  Investments may range from acquisition of real estate ownership if there is a legal basis for the acquisition of the right to property, to acquisition of long-term lease, concession, lease and usufruct.  
Investment in real estate by domestic natural and legal persons  
Domestic natural and legal persons may invest in:     Construction land by acquiring ownership, long-term lease, concession and lease;    Agricultural land by acquiring ownership when the investment (acquisition) refers to agricultural land of private ownership (since agricultural land in state ownership may not be disposed of), by acquiring a long-term lease, concession, lease and usufruct;     Forests by acquiring ownership when the investment (acquisition) refers to forests in private ownership (since forests in state ownership are not subject to sale), and state owned forest may be acquired only in case of exchange with private forest due to consolidation of forest complexes in state ownership, and investments in way of concession pursuant to the provisions referred to in the Law on Concession;     Roads by acquisition by way of concession for construction and use of a motorway, part of the lane or part of the travel belt of a public road;    Residential space (apartments) by acquisition of ownership and by lease;    Business premises (administrative and commercial space) by acquisition of ownership and by lease;     Waters by acquisition of concession;   Mineral raw materials by acquisition of concession;    Carrying out public utilities by acquisition of concession;    Activities in the field of energetics or production, transmission and distribution of electric power, international transport of crude oil through an oil pipeline, production, transport and distribution of natural gas and production, transmission and distribution of thermal and geothermal energy, on the basis of licence (concession), and construction of objects intended for performance of particular activities in the field of energetics by investments on the basis of agreement between the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and the investor, who, for that purpose, establishes a special trade company;     Construction, use, maintenance and protection of navigation courses, ports, winter ports, anchorages, and ocean resorts, on proposal by the Ministry of transport and communications, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia may give approval (concession), if the domestic natural and legal person owns the necessary capital and has the personnel and equipment capacity for successful execution of the works subject to the concession. 
Investments in real estate by foreign natural and legal persons  
Foreign natural and legal persons may invest in:    Construction land, by acquiring the right to a long-term lease (up to 99 years) for construction of business building and business premises and residence apartments on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia (on the basis of approval by the Ministry of justice, upon obtained opinion of the Ministry in charge of town planning and construction and the Ministry of finance, under reciprocity conditions) and by way of concession. Therein, the foreign persons do not obtain the property right of the construction land, but only of the objects;    Agricultural land, by acquiring the right to long-term lease of the agricultural land, on the basis of approval by the Ministry of justice, upon obtained opinion from the Ministry of agriculture, forestry and water management and the Ministry of finance, under conditions of reciprocity, by way of concession and lease. Foreign natural and legal persons may not acquire the property right by investing in this type of real estate.    Forests by acquiring a concession;    Roads, by acquiring a concession for construction and use of motorway, part of the lanes, or part of the travel belt of a public road;    Residential space (apartments), by acquiring the property right to an apartment or residential building under conditions of reciprocity, and by way of lease, whereas foreign legal persons may also invest by way of long-term lease;    Business premises (administrative and commercial premises), under conditions of reciprocity by acquiring the property right and the right to a long-term lease;    Waters by acquiring concession;    Mineral raw materials by acquiring a concession;     Carrying out public utilities by acquiring a concession;    Activities in the field of energetics or production, transmission and distribution of electric power, international transport of crude oil through an oil pipe-line, production, transport and distribution of natural gas, and production, transmission and distribution of thermal and geothermal energy, on the basis of a licence (concession), and construction of objects for performance of particular activities in the field of energetics by way of investment of assets, may be done on the basis of agreement between the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and the investor, who, for that purpose, has established a trade company in the Republic of Macedonia;   Construction, utilisation, maintenance and protection of navigation courses, ports, winter ports, anchorages, and ocean resorts on the proposal of the Ministry of transport and communications, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia may grant its consent (the concession), if the foreign legal or natural person owns the necessary capital and has the personnel and equipment capacity for successful execution of the works subject to the concession. The Law on Concession (Official Gazette of of the Republic of Macedonia No. 25/02) regulates granting concession to foreign natural and legal persons; according to this Law, concessionaires may be foreign legal persons who have a subsidiary registered in the Trade Register of the Republic of Macedonia, if determined by special law (Article 7).  Concession is granted pursuant to the Law on Concession, and other laws which treat concession well.  Non-resident may not become the owner of real estate, which due to protection of the interests and safety of the Republic of Macedonia, is declared as an area which non-residents are not entitled to possess, unless otherwise provided by law.   It is important to emphasise that concerning non-resident natural and legal persons and the impossibility for direct acquisition of the property right to construction and agricultural land, there is a possibility, conditionally, of an indirect way to acquire the property right to this kind of real estate, if the founder of the trade company in the Republic of Macedonia is a non-resident (foreign person) and owns or has a share in the company, where the company is treated as a domestic legal person having all rights and obligations as trade companies in legal trade. This means that non-residents who own domestic trade companies, may acquire a property right as domestic persons, that is, there is no restriction of acquiring the property right to this kind of real estate.    
3. In the legislation of the Republic of Macedonia pursuant to the Law on Ownership and Other Real Rights (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 18/01) and pursuant to other sector specific laws, there are immovables that are exclusively in state ownership, i.e. cannot be subject to a property right of domestic and foreign natural and legal persons.  Thus, pursuant to the Law on Ownership and Other Real Rights (Official Gazette of of the Republic of Macedonia No. 18/01), public goods (streets, roads, bridges, squares, parks) are property in state ownership utilised by all natural and legal persons (Article 16 paragraph 4).  Pursuant to the Law on Public Roads (Official Gazette of of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 26/96, 40/99, 96/00, and 29/02), public roads are public goods and are in state ownership (Article 2 paragraphs 1 and 2).  Pursuant to the Law on Waters (Official Gazette of of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 4/98 and 19/00), waters, watercourses, and lakes as public goods of the Republic of Macedonia enjoy special protection laid down in this Law and are in state ownership (Article 2).  Having regard to the above-mentioned real estate, foreign natural and legal persons have an equal legal status as domestic persons since both categories are excluded from the possibility to acquire the property right.  
4. The Law on Privatisation and Rent of Construction Land in State Ownership is in drafting phase as regards liberalisation of the acquisition of the property right to construction land and investment in this kind of real estate. This Law will contribute to the privatisation of construction land, which is largely in state ownership as yet, and which is subject to the right to utilisation by natural and legal persons (but not to property right); this Law will enable free trade of this kind of land and will stimulate the possibilities to invest in construction land.   5. Acquisition of a property right is in correlation with Article 56 paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, according to which: “All natural treasures of the Republic, flora and fauna, goods in general use as well as the items and objects of special cultural and historical importance, defined by law, are public goods of the state and they enjoy special protection.” According to that, acquisition of the property right for certain types of real estate is restricted and regulated by the State in cases when this real estate is public goods (public interest) and, in this regard, the State reserves the right to certain restrictions and to the regime of utilisation. 
6. The Law on Surveying, Land Register and Entry of the Rights to Real Estate (Official Gazette of of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 27/86 and 17/91) is the basis for registration of land and other immovables thereof (buildings, subsidiary and other objects and the space in them – apartments, business and other premises).  Registration of land and other immovables is carried out systematically.  First a cadastral (and topographic) survey of the land and other immovables is performed and data on the purpose of the land and objects are collected, data on good standing – economic strength of the land and other data intended for the potential owners of the immovables. Upon carrying out expert and computer processing of the collected data on immovables, public presentation of the data is done with establishing and registration of the right to the immovables (first registration) in the course of a systemised procedure which lasts from several months to 2 or 3 years depending of the size of the territorial unit.   Upon the ending of this procedure separately a so-called “Land Register of Real Estate” is established for each cadastral community and its application is published in Official Gazette.   The Land Register of Real Estate as a public book of immovables and rights thereof is shared – unique and basic evidence of immovables and rights thereof, which has a constituent character regarding the rights to real estate. A Land registry certificate is an evidence of the ownership and other real rights.  Pilot projects were carried out within the period from the adoption of the Law in 1986 until 1991. An organized approach to registration of the rights to real estate was carried out on the basis of the “Medium-term Programme for surveying, land register, and entry of rights (first registration) of the real estate 1991-2002”. An improvement of about 45 % has been achieved in the registration of the total area of the territory of the Republic of Macedonia, and in the field of surveying this percentage amounts to 95%. Complete digitalisation has been achieved in the attributive part of the land register data and partial digitalisation (20%) of the land register maps.  In line with the World Bank Project “Cadastre and Real Estate Registration”, by the end of 2010 first registration of ownership and other real rights to the real estate on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia shall be carried out.  Organisational, legal and other measures have been undertaken to improve legislation as well as simplification and acceleration of the procedures regarding first registration and shorten the time limit necessary for transfer of the rights to real estate in the public book.    New legal decisions are in procedure providing for the introduction of individual registration of the rights to real estate, upon clients’ request, and concerning areas where a public book on ownership of real estate is not established. In addition, private practice shall be introduced in the area of surveying and maintenance of the changed data of the real estate. It is predicted that the entry digitalisation of numerical data, cadastral maps and collection of legal documents of title will be entirely finished by 2010. An electronic land register i.e. establishing a fully automated Geodetic-Land Register-Information System (GeoKIS) on geospace and other data on real estate and its on-line access to users and citizens is being set up. The entire electronic transmission of real estate rights and electronic access to documents of title regarding facts contained in the land register as a public book is planned to be introduced, until 2010. Measures have been undertaken for the institutional strengthening of the registration offices and continuous vocational training and upgrading of human recourses for the purpose of a contemporary full-servicing of the citizens’ needs in this field.  
7. In the Republic of Macedonia, pursuant to the Constitution and the special laws which regulate the rights regarding real estate, there are normative and legal presumptions enabling a high level of liberaliaation concerning investments in real estate.  
14. Are there investment agreements with third countries which provide for pre-establishment access of investments? With which countries have investment agreements been concluded? Please provide relevant information on dates of ratification, initial terms of agreements, automatic renewal procedures, and periods for which acquired rights exist. Do such agreements include a regional economic integration organisation clause? Which sectors are normally excluded (e.g. aviation, maritime transport, fishing, audiovisual, etc.) from such agreements? 
Up till now the Republic of Macedonia has concluded 26 bilateral agreements for promotion and mutual protection of investments already in force, 3 agreements ratified by the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia, but not in force yet, and 5 agreements initialledby expert teams, but not by the state officials.   A table including the 29 ratified agreements in force is below. Considering  time of validity of agreements, it varies from 10 to 20 years, leaving a possibility for automatic extension of the agreement validity for 10-20 years, unless one year, or in some cases 6 months, before the expiry  period of the agreement, one of the signatory countries notifies the other party on its withdrawal from the agreement. The withdrawal notification enters into force and the agreement is considered cancelled after the expiry of a one-year period, in some cases within a six-month period, from the day when the other agreement party has received a diplomatic notification of agreement cancellation.     Pursuant to the agreements, each agreement country must provide fair and equal treatment of investments on its territory from the investors from another agreement country.   Bilateral agreements for promotion and mutual protection of investments in their content do not list the sectors in which a non-resident may not invest. Namely, agreements refer to national legislations, or respect legal restrictions that refer to particular sectors in the relevant countries. In Macedonian legislation there are particular sectors/activities excluded from these agreements such as the military industry, movement and trade in arms, movement and trafficking in drugs, protection of historical landmarks and cultural treasures, protection of human health, protection of forests and waters. The annex table enclosed to the answer to question 1, section I, Chapter 04 will be useful to detail the existing restrictions to non-resident investment. (for more details see 04_I_1Agreements do not contain a clause for regional economic integration in organizations.  Concluded bilateral Agreements for promotion and mutual protection of investments

1. Are financial institutions required to inform their customers on the conditions for cross-border credit transfers? If yes, which? 
The NBRM prescribes terms and conditions regarding cross-border payment operations pursuant to the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 34/01, 49/01,103/01, 51/03). For that purpose, NBRM adopted a Decision on the method of cross-border payment operations (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 53/02) and a Manual on the method of cross-border payment operations (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 79/02 and 98/02), where time limits for international payments and the method of customer information are determined.   On the basis of this regulation and business ethics, financial institutions make internal decisions on the conditions for cross-border payment operations and the compensation rate. Particular elements of these decisions are a constituent part of the contract concluded with the customer who is not a natural person to perform cross-border payment operations and credit transfers. Natural persons are informed of the transfer services during the issue of the payment order or the cross-border credit transfer.  In the following period, the NBRM will amend the regulation in the area of cross-border payment operations with the purpose of entire incorporation of the provisions referred to in Directive 97/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union of 27 January 1997.   2. Are financial institutions required to supply their customers with information subsequent to a cross-border transfer? If yes, which? 
The NBRM prescribes terms and conditions of cross-border payment operations pursuant to the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 34/01, 49/01, 103/01, and 51/03). For that purpose, NBRM adopted a Decision on the method of cross-border payment operations (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 53/02) and a Manual on the method of cross-border payment operations (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 79/02 and 98/02).  Pursuant to item 5 of the Decision on the method of cross-border payment operations, financial institutions are obliged to inform their customers on the transferred inflow. In line with the recent bank practice, financial institutions provide customer with the statement of account regarding cross-border transactions, and if so agreed, an additional copy of SWIFT message.       Subsequent to a capital inflow, the customer is issued 743 Form by financial institution – Statement on cross-border payment, which in line with item 176 of the Manual on the method of the cross-border transactions (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 79/02 and 98/02), includes the following information: 1.  Name, address, code number of the bank that receives – processes the payment;  2.  Name, address, code number of the beneficiary;  3.  The registry number of the payment order;  4.  The name of the foreign bank;  5.  The name of the non-resident – applicant;  6.  The name of the foreign conto corrente account bank;   7.  Description of the payment from the foreign bank order (the SWIFT message);  8.  Currency amount and date when the inflow has been approved on the bank account abroad or non-resident’s debit account in the bank;   9.  Foreign currency amount of agency fee and bank costs deducted abroad, if it is stated in the foreign bank order;  10. The middle exchange rate the bank applies to the calculation and entry of the payment and the counter-value in denars;   11. The amount of the calculated service compensation charged to the payment user by the bank; and  12. Other statistical data.  Financial institutions inform their customers of the cross-border payment operation in line with the customer’s instructions in the 1450 Form – order on foreign exchange remittance. Pursuant to item 176 of the Manual for foreign exchange operations, this form, inter alia, includes: information on the order number in the bank registry, the foreign exchange amount, the date of the payment and the exchange rate applied by the bank.  In the following period the NBRM will amend the regulation in the field of foreign exchange operations, completely incorporating the provisions from Directive 97/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union of 27 January 1997.  
3. Is there a time limit for executing a cross-border credit transfer? If yes, how long? Is there compensation to the customer if the deadline limit or the deadline agreed is not complied with? 
Time limits for cross-border payment operations are determined by the NBRM in line with the Decision on the method of cross-border payment operations (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 53/02) and the Manual on the method of cross-border payment operations (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 79/02 and 98/02). In this act there is a time limit for cross-border payment, as cited below.   Pursuant to items 4 and 5 of the Decision, the bank that executes the transaction is obliged to inform the customer named in the order of the transferred inflow on the day of the transfer (if the conditions for fulfilling  the obligation are met by 10 AM), or the next day (if the conditions are met after 10 AM). At the same time, the beneficiary is obliged to submit to the bank the necessary data for transfer approval on their account within three days.    In line with item 42 of the Manual, which is a constituent part of the Decision, the bank is obliged to execute the correctly filled in cross-border payment order the same day (if the conditions for fulfilling the obligation are met until 10 AM) or at least the following day from the acceptance of the coverage (if the conditions are met after 10 AM).  No special compensation to the customer is stipulated if the time limit agreed for execution of the cross-border payment order is not complied with. Customer may acquire compensation through regular judicial procedure for damages. 4. Is there any compensation to the customer in the case of non-execution of a transfer contrary to the instructions given by the customer? 
In the case when the cross-border payment is not executed in accordance with the instructions given by the customer there are no special compensation provisions. The customer may acquire compensation through regular court procedure for damages.   The NBRM has a special foreign exchange control department whose task is to monitor, on regular basis, the on-site activities of banks in the field of foreign exchange operations, including cross-border payments. In the case of non-compliance with the NBRM Acts on cross-border payments, pursuant to Article 56, item 29 of the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations (Official Gazette of Republic of Macedonia Nos. 34/01, 49/01, 103/01, 51/03), fines are provided of 250.000 to 300.000 MKD for banks, and 40.000 to 50.000 MKD for the responsible person in the bank.    It can be mentioned, with regard to recent practice, that there have not been any complaints to the NBRM from the bank customers regarding remittances not carried out according to their instructions.   5. Is an out of court redress system in place for the settlement of disputes between the customers and the institutions? If yes, explain the system. 
The Chambers of Commerce has a Court of Honour as an independent body whose competence, structure, organisation and financing are regulated by the Chamber Act. The Court of Honour  promotes development, fulfilling and strengthening of business practices and business morals (Articles 30 and 31 of the Law on Chamber of Commerce, Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 54/02). In practice, up till now this possibility has not been used by financial institutions and their customers.     The Law on Mediation is being drafted to regulate settling disputes out of courts between the parties in the Republic of Macedonia in order to close these matters in a quick and efficient way.    6. When are transfer orders and netting concerning payments and securities legally enforceable? Are there special provisions in the case of insolvency proceedings or in the case of the existence of collateral security? 
Pursuant to Article 23 of the Law on Payment Operations (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 32/01, 50/01, 52/01, 103/01, 37/02, 41/02, 61/02 and 42/03) denar payment orders, or payment among the participants in the payment operations are considered final (legally transferred) when the institution responsible for conducting payment operations settles the result of established obligations arising from these payments with the NBRM settlement system. The NBRM real-time gross settlement system - MIPS (Macedonian Interbank Payment System) operates in real time from 7:30 to 17:00. Payments carried out in this system are final immediately upon settlement (carried out in real time). Payment settlement transfers by the KIBS low value payments clearing house are settled in MIPS between 14:30 and 15:30, thus rendered final. Securities netting settlement transfers are entered into MIPS in the period between 10:00 and 11:00 thus rendered final, whereas securities settlement is performed in the Central Securities Depository. Securities settlement is performed three days after the trading (T+3).   The Securities Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 63/00, 103/00, 34/01, 04/02, 37/02, 31/03, 85/03 and 96/04) defines the types of securities (share, bond, deposit certificate, treasury bills, commercial papers and government papers).Pursuant to Article 2 of the Securities Law, securities are issued, negotiated and maintained as electronic records in the Central Securities Depository. Pursuant to Article 9 of this Law, “The rights and obligations regarding securities arise from the time of their entry in the Central Securities Depository”.  Pursuant to Article 137 of the Securities Law the rights of the securities holder come into effect upon entry of the security on the account of the holder at the Central Securities Depository and are transferred by the entry of the security on the account of the new holder at the Central Securities Depository, thus the rights of securities are legally acquired, restricted or transferred by adequate entry in the Central Securities Depository, unless otherwise determined by law.    The assets of the clients of the participants in the Central Securities Depository (stock broker houses and banks having a broker operation permit) pursuant to Article 114 of the Securities Law, are kept on a separate account (in NBRM) and may be used solely in accordance with the customer’s contract, and pursuant to Article 138 of the Securities Law, obligations for securities negotiation, arising from transactions in securities, are settled by simultaneous securities delivery and payment in accordance with the DVP – “Delivery versus Payment” principle. Within the bankruptcy procedure, pursuant to Article 80 from the Bankruptcy Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 55/97, 53/00, 37/02 and 17/04), a person, who on the basis of their proprietary or personal  rights, can prove that an object (securities) does not belong to the bankruptcy estate, is not a bankruptcy creditor. Their right for separation of the object will be determined according to the rules valid for exercising these rights outside the bankruptcy procedure. However, pursuant to Article 141 of the Securities Law, if a bankruptcy procedure is opened against a participant in the Central Securities Depository, the provisions in the Bankruptcy Law regarding “denial of past transactions” will not be in effect for settlement transactions done by the Central Securities Depository, pursuant to the prescribed acts and procedures.   Pursuant to Article 15 of the Law on Contractual Pledge (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 05/03), the right to non-possessor pledge (securities are maintained as electronic record in the Central Securities Depository, thus book-entry pledged securities can only be a non-possessor pledge) is acquired by conclusion of a pledge contract, and description and listing of the pledged securities and entry of the pledge in the Pledge Registry.

This type of supervision is carried out when the need arises and it may be within less than 18 months.  The control of the process of prevention of money laundering, beside the control of measures and actions implementation in the Law, covers analysis of the policies, procedures and practices of banks and savings banks for prevention of money laundering i.e. the purpose is to determine the adequacy of the established system for prevention of money laundering.

2. Please elaborate on the functioning of the FIU, the supervisory authorities and the law enforcement authorities with regard to, inter alia, available resources (staff and budget), operational powers, (inter-)national co-operation between competent authorities and the results achieved in terms of suspicious transactions reports received, supervisory investigations, confiscations and convictions/settlements. 
The Money Laundering Prevention Directorate is a body within the Ministry of Finance. It was established in September 2001 pursuant to Article 5 of the Law on Money Laundering Prevention (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 70/01) and started its operation in 1 March 2002 as intermediary for the exchange of information between the private sector and public bodies competent for criminal prosecution of money laundering.  Within the Directorate as an administrative model of the Financial Intelegence Unit (FIU) there are 8 employees (according to the systematization of posts), organised in three units: Analytics Department, Department for Suspicious Transactions, and Department for System Development and International Cooperation.      The Analytics Department: consists of three employees who collect information delivered to the Directorate by the entities (from question 04_III_1, item b)) pursuant to the Law on Prevention of Money Laundering and Other Financial Proceeds from Criminal Offences (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 46/04 – hereinafter the Law). Beside these entities, the Department, for the need of data provision, compulsorly cooperates with the competent state bodies involved in the money laundering prevention system. Regardless of the source all data are processed and analysed and stored in the Department database afterwards. If in the course of the analysis of a particular transaction a suspicion appears, the transaction report from this unit is transferred to the Department for Suspicious Transactions for detailed processing. The database, which is continuously extended, is a basic source of data for the operation of  other two Departments. With purpose to design a simple and safe database with graphic description of the analysis of particular transaction, the Directorate in cooperation with the IT Sector of the Ministry of Finance designed an electronic database thus facilitating the banks to provide electronically the cash transactions over 15.000 EUR from 1 October 2004.    Department: for Suspicious Transactions consists of two employees who act upon the reports on suspicious transactions submitted by entities (referred to in question 04_III_1, item b), by competent state bodies and competent bodies from other countries received through the Department for International Cooperation. After receiving suspicious reports, this Department opens case and handles analysis consisting of, first of all, a check of data existence in the Directorate base, and then a check of the financial operations by a circular letter to all banks. In the Central Registry database and at the registration court it checks whether the person owns or manages a trade company. From the Central Securities Depository data base it obtains data on the ownership structure of the trade company, directly from the Public Revenue Office database it checks the person’s business operations, from the Customs Administration it receives data on inflow or outflow of cash or securities to or from the Republic of Macedonia, and it checks the person’s criminal history in the Ministry of Interior database. This method of case to case analysis, inevitably requires intensive cooperation of the Department with other state bodies, and in cases regarding foreign persons the necessary data are obtained from the Department for International Cooperation. Upon the notification of the entities in the frame of the previously performed analysis, if necessary, this Department, by decision, submits an initiative to the competent public prosecutor to submit a proposal for taking interim measures. Upon conducted analysis, elaborated in an internal report on the suspicious transaction, if grounds for suspicion are established for the criminal action money laundering or terrorism financing, it prepares and submits a report including its opinion to the competent authorities: the Ministry of Interior, the Financial Police or the Public Prosecutor’s Office.     The Department for System Development and International Cooperation which consists of two employees, follows and studies the laws and secondary legislation at the national and international level that regulate the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing. On the basis of the positive international experience, as well as on the basis of the comprehensive analyses, it proposes laws and secondary legislation, provides initiatives for building up the money laundering prevention system, and gives opinions on proposals and laws important for the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing. In cooperation with the Analytics Department, it defines types of money laundering and terrorism financing and studies the trends in preventing money laundering and terrorism financing. In cooperation with the entities (from question 04_III_1, item b)), and the supervisory authorities (from question 04_III_1, item c)), upon the results of the overall work, the Department prepares lists of indicators for recognition of suspicious transactions. The second segment part of the t activities of the Department refers to exchange of data with international bodies and bodies of the relevant countries connected with the discovery and prosecution of money laundering and terrorism financing cases. Data and information are exchanged with the competent bodies of other countries on the basis of concluded agreements, as well as on the basis of EGMONT Group membership. Pursuant to Article 27, paragraph 2 of the Law, the Money Laundering Prevention Directorate may, if required exchange information obtained from the competent bodies involved in the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing in other states, upon their consent, with the bodies competent for conducting the investigation regarding money laundering and terrorism financing. In order to establish bilateral cooperation, this Department is obliged to prepare agreements that are concluded by the Money Laundering Prevention Directorate with the competent institutions from other countries. This Department is liable to realise the obligations of the Money Laundering Prevention Directorate arising from the membership of international commissions and bodies.   From the beginning of its functioning, the Money Laundering Prevention Directorate started with its international activities, mainly, through taking part in the operation of international money laundering prevention bodies such as the Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures for evaluation of the measures regarding money laundering prevention (MONEYVAL) within the Council of Europe, in whose work it participates and contributes on regular basis.  Regarding the international exchange of confidential data and information on a bilateral level, so far, the Money Laundering Prevention Directorate has signed letters on exchange of information and memoranda of cooperation with the money laundering prevention department of Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro, and Albania.  The fact that such memoranda are first signed with those countries arises from the need to establish and strengthen, above all, regional cooperation, which we consider is of exceptional importance and which presents a basis for development of wider cooperation. On the basis of memoranda as well as on the basis of the principle of reciprocity, this Directorate cooperates and exchanges information with the above-mentioned money laundering prevention departments in cases where there is well-founded suspicion of committed criminal action money laundering and terrorism financing.   The Money Laundering Prevention Directorate is a member of the EGMONT Group from June 2004.   Of special importance for the international cooperation of the Money Laundering Prevention Directorate is its membership of the EGMONT Group (on the 12th Plenary Assembly, taking place in the period from 23 – 25 June 2004).   In its previous operation the Money Laundering Prevention Directorate has established cooperation with all competent bodies exchanging data and information regarding money laundering and other proceeds of crime and terrorism financing. Pursuant to the Law, to carry out its responsibilities, the Money Laundering Prevention Directorate may request data and documentation from the state bodies, which, on the other hand, in case of suspicion of money laundering and terrorism financing may submit to the Money Laundering Prevention Directorate a written report pursuant to Article 23 of the Law. Also pursuant to Article 28 of the Law, the Money Laundering Prevention Directorate is authorised to prepare and submit a report to the competent state bodies, including its opinion, always when there is a well-founded suspicion of committed criminal action of money laundering or terrorism financing, and on the basis of analysis carried out of the suspicious cases, upon which those bodies decide to institute criminal proceedings.  Regulatory, supervisory, and audit bodies track and recognise possible cases of money laundering and terrorism financing and take necessary measures and actions pursuant to the Law, and inform the Money Laundering Prevention Directorate in time.  Articles 29, 30, 31 and 32 of the Law, provide provisional measures regarding halting the suspicious transaction of money laundering or terrorism financing and temporary confiscation of money or property. In case of well-founded suspicion of criminal action or terrorism financing, the Money Laundering Prevention Directorate, at latest within 24 hours from the finding that the transaction is in its course, is entitled to submit an initiative to submit a proposal on summary order to the competent public prosecutor. The competent public prosecutor processes the initiative on summary order submitted by the Money Laundering Prevention Directorate, and if he/she estimates it as well-founded, within 24 hours from the acceptance of the initiative he/she submits to the investigating judge a proposal on summary order. The investigating judge of the competent court of first instance also within 24 hours from the acceptance of the proposal submitted by the public prosecutor is obliged to make a decision and to submit it to the competent public prosecutor. The competent public prosecutor is obliged to inform the Money Laundering Prevention Directorate of the decision made by the investigating judge from the competent court of first instance.   Within the cooperation between the Money Laundering Prevention Directorate and other competent bodies the signing of Protocols of cooperation and shared data between the Money Laundering Prevention Directorate and the Ministry of Interior (Criminal Policy Department), Customs Administration and the Public Revenue Office is underway. The cooperation and exchange of the data will be handled through contact officers (responsible persons employed in those institutions), thus providing a higher level of data security and confidentiality. These Protocols will also allow accelerating exchange of data and information among institutions that very often, as a result of the complexity of the cases, may be of crucial importance. These Protocols will also precisely determine which data and information may be exchanged between the institutions, and they will coordinate their activities and competences. In order to perform activities efficiently, the Money Laundering Prevention Directorate is needs the electronic access to the databases of the institutions so it is planning to sign Protocols on cooperation, thus accelerating the exchange of data  in the scope of report analysis and processing and their follow-up to the investigating authorities (MOI, PP, FP).  The access to these databases will enable the Money Laundering Prevention Directorate to establish immediately the identity of the person it suspects of being included in some suspicious transaction, whether that person appears in the records of the Customs Administration as an exporter or importer of particular goods or has carried cash through Macedonia’s customs lines, whether that person fulfils his tax liabilities on time and whether a criminal charge against him is brought.     The Money Laundering Prevention Directorate in cooperation with the competent bodies prepared National Strategy on Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing in order to prepare, develop and improve the common standards for collection and processing of information regarding the discovery and prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing. The existing structures for stamping out money laundering are discussed in question 18, section I, Chapter 24.

In the period between March 1, 2002 and October 1 2004, a total of 54.216 reports have been delivered to the Directorate, as follows:    52.054 reports on cash transactions over 20.000 EUR or 15.000 EUR (8.588 of them on cash transaction over 15.000 EUR);    2.122 reports from the Customs Administration on cash inflows through the customs line of the Republic of Macedonia amounting to 10.000 EUR; and    40 reports on suspicious transactions.  Regarding the analysed reports, the Directorate has established the existence of grounds for suspicion for a possible case of money laundering in 12 cases, 11 of which are completed and delivered to the Ministry of Interior and one to the Financial Police for further investigation and procedure.   Money laundering prevention in the scope of the Ministry of Interior is in the competence of the Organised Crime Sector, i.e. the Department of prevention and control of economic and financial crime, corruption and trafficking.  Operational tasks within this scope are carried out by two inspectors who have intensive cooperation with the Money Laundering Prevention Directorate and share the coordination of the activities, exchange of information and findings on suspicious transactions and money laundering.  In the scope of the Public Prosecutor’s Office in line with the Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 38/04) a Department of Pursuit of Crime Perpetrators in the field of organised crime and corruption is established. The competencies of this Department on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia will be carried out by 10 prosecutors. This Department handles criminal acts committed by organised groups of at least three persons with a purpose to obtain indirect or direct financial benefit or another type of material benefit and who have committed one or more criminal acts as well as other criminal acts subject to penalty of imprisonment of at least four years, including money laundering.    In courts there is specialisation and training of elected judges in the field of the fighting against organised crime.  The table below shows statistical data on the number of criminal charges, investigations, prosecution acts and verdicts regarding money laundering.

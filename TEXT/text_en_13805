BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic said on Friday (19 August) that the procedure for extraditing Madrid terror suspect Abdelmajid Bouchar to Spain could last several weeks. Speaking on the local BK Television, Ljajic said he is in touch with Spanish authorities about the Moroccan-born Bouchar, who is wanted in connection with the deadly train bombings in Madrid in March 2004. After Spain sends the necessary information, the Belgrade District Court will likely endorse the extradition, but procedures -- including a possible appeal by Bouchar -- could prolong the process, the minister said.
The Belgrade newspaper Politika, meanwhile, reported in its Sunday edition that Bouchar was arrested in Serbia on 23 June after having entered illegally the country from neighbouring Bulgaria on 2 June. (Beta, Politika - 21/08/05)

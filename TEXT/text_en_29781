TIRANA, Albania -- EU mediator Miroslav Lajcak made it clear on Wednesday (January 26th) that Albania's European future depends on the will of its leaders and their readiness to apply recommendations from Brussels. After meeting with political leaders in Tirana, Lajcak said violent demonstrations last week were "not a European way to solve political issues". After meeting with Lajcak, Prime Minister Sali Berisha announced that a planned weekend pro-government rally has been cancelled. "Even though this rally would not be violent, I prefer to listen to the international community appeals," he said.
President Bamir Topi urged party leaders to resolves difference through the legal system rather than through organising public demonstrations. This will "contribute to lowering pressure, and open the way for independent justice institutions to carry out their investigations," he said.

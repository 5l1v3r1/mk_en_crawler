STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- Croatia is determined to join the EU by the end of 2009, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said on Tuesday (November 25th) after meeting with Swedish counterpart Fredrik Reinfeldt in Stockholm. "Our ambition is to wrap up the negotiations during the Swedish presidency," Sanader said. Sweden assumes the rotating six-month EU presidency in July. Sanader added that his government is well aware of the challenges it must overcome, as cited in the European Commission's recent progress report on Croatia, which Sanader says will serve as an action plan in the months ahead. Steps include curbing corruption and organised crime, reforming the judicial system and stopping state subsidies to shipbuilders. (Vjesnik - 26/11/08; Nacional, HINA, DPA, MIA - 25/11/08)

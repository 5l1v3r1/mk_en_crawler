ZAGREB, Croatia -- Representatives of EU institutions and 14 countries along the Danube River met on Friday (April 29th) in the town of Vukovar to discuss the EU's strategy for the Danube region and its role in improving peoples' lives. Participants agreed that successful implementation of the strategy would be of key interest to all participant countries and deserves strong political support. EU Commissioner for Regional Policy Johannes Hahn noted that about 115 million people live in the Danube region. "We want to establish strong co-operation, not only among member-countries but also among regions. At present, only 10% of the Danube potential for cargo transport is being used, and possibilities in this area are great," Hahn said. 
The strategy, backed in April by the EU foreign ministers, is expected to be adopted by the European Council in June. It affects 14 countries along Europe's longest river: eight EU member states -- Germany, Austria, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania -- and six non-EU countries: Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Ukraine and Moldova.

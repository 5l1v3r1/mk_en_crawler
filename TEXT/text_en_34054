ZAGREB, Croatia -- Investigators with the UN war crimes tribunal completed their interview with retired Gen Luka Dzanko in Zagreb on Friday (25 July). His lawyer, Nenad Boban, said the talks focused on war operations in the southern front during the 1990-1995 conflicts and Dzanko's role in Bosnia and Herzegovina. "There are two possibilities: either an indictment will be issued covering Gen Dzanko, or an indictment against others, but not him," Boban said. (HINA - 25/07/03)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The state has filed charges against the family of late Yugoslav and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic for the illegal purchase of a family villa in the Belgrade suburb of Dedinje, according to media reports Sunday (October 19th). Milosevic bought the house just before the 1999 NATO bombings of Serbia. According to the daily Blic, the main hearing is scheduled for December 17th at a Belgrade court. Lawyers will represent Milosevic's widow, son and daughter. Russia granted the widow and son asylum in January. They had claimed political persecution by the Serbian government.

ATHENS, Greece -- Over 5,000 people gathered in central Athens on Thursday (May 26th) in a second day of protest against austerity measures imposed by the government. The rallies were organised via Facebook and were inspired by a recent wave of protests in Spain.
Earlier in the day, police clashed with protesting doctors and hospital workers in the centre of the capital. Police used pepper spray to disperse the crowd after short clashes with the demonstrators who tried to enter the Health Ministry building. No injuries or arrests were reported. 
Meanwhile, President Karolos Papoulias has summoned an emergency meeting Friday of the leaders of the main political parties in an effort to secure much needed consensus on further reforms suggested by the EU in return for more aid. Prime Minister George Papandreou failed to secure the opposition's support for the harsh measures earlier this week.

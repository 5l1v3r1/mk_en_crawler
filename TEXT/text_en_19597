WASHINGTON, United States -- President George W. Bush has agreed to the sale of nuclear equipment for civilian use to Turkey and has submitted the document to congress for approval, the White House said on Wednesday (January 23rd). Officials say the agreement will allow Turkey to import nuclear equipment, including units and technologies used for nuclear research and electricity generation. The document, however, does not allow the sale of specific materials, technologies and information that could be used for military purposes. The agreement was first initialled in 2000 by then-President Bill Clinton, but was shelved until new risk assessments were completed. (AFP, PRIME-TASS - 24/01/08)

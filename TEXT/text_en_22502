ZAGREB, Croatia -- A court on Monday (October 13th) again adjourned the war crimes trial of Branimir Glavas and six co-defendants due to illness of one of the defendants. The seven allegedly committed war crimes in the eastern Osijek region in connection with the 1991 torture and murder of ten ethnic Serb civilians. As two months have passed since the last hearing, a retrial is required. Glavas and his co-defendants will again enter their pleas. (HRT, HINA, Tanjug - 13/10/08)

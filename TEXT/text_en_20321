ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament voted on Saturday (January 12th) to strip a deputy of his immunity from prosecution, so he can continue to stand trial for war crimes. Branimir Glavas has been charged with forming a militia and ordering the torture and murder of at least two Croatian Serbs in 1991. He is a former senior member of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union but now leads a small regional party. He denies any wrongdoing and accuses the government of Ivo Sanader of fabricating the charges. 
The previous parliament stripped Glavas of immunity in 2006, allowing his trial to begin in October 2006. But the proceedings were suspended when he was re-elected as an MP this past November. Saturday's decision clears the way for resuming the trial, but does not require Glavas to be detained again. He is in a medical facility as a result of a debilitating hunger strike.

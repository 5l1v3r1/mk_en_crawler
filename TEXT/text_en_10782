ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government will continue with army reforms and lay off 4,886 people working in the defence sector this year, Assistant Defence Minister Zeljko Gorsic said Sunday (7 November). These include active military staff and civil servants. Gorsic added that so far this year the ministry had dismissed 3,089 active military staff. The aim of the continuing reform is to turn the army into one that is younger, better-trained and better-educated. (HINA, HRT - 07/11/04)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Heavy snow and strong winds paralysed much of Southeast Europe on Sunday (December 12th). In Turkey, the extreme weather conditions crippled transport in the Bosporus, the Sea of Marmara and the Dardanelles. Ferries between Istanbul and Bandirma, and Bursa and Yalova were cancelled because of the strong wind. The storm also blocked water connections between the separate districts and islands of Istanbul. Strong winds hampered traffic across the Sea of Marmara. Nearly 43 Turkish and foreign tankers and cargo ships remained blocked in ports in the Tekirdag province. Air traffic has also been affected. 
In northern Albania, snow combined with low temperatures has blocked national roads. Police are monitoring the situation closely, warning of particularly dangerous conditions along roads connecting Puka and Kukes and Puka and Shkodra. Media in Tirana reported that some villages in the Puka municipality are blanketed in snow 1m deep, totally blocking communication. Greece has also been hit by the cold and snow, forcing some roads to close. In Macedonia snowfall, though heavy, is not creating any serious problems for the time being.

ATHENS, Greece -- Around 2,000 trade union members marched through Athens on Tuesday (March 17th) protesting unemployment and demanding protection of workers' rights and better working conditions. The PAME movement, which represents some 40 unions in the country, organised the protest.
Meanwhile, media reported on Tuesday the government was considering whether to impose tough sanctions on demonstrators wearing hoods or masks. The new measure will be part of the cabinet's efforts to fight a wave of street violence that has plagued the country since December, when a police officer shot dead a teenager.
In other news, a group of Greek politicians announced on Tuesday the creation of a new centrist political party called Drasis (Action). Among the founders are former ministers Stephanos Manos and Vassilis Kontoyiannopoulos, who are former members of parliament for both the ruling New Democracy and the opposition PASOK parties. Manos said the party's aim was to help Greece handle the impact of the global financial crisis.

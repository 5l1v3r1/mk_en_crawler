SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said on Wednesday (October 29th) the international community must review its policy towards BiH so the country can continue its EU integration process. Although BiH signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU in June, it has done nothing to meet its obligations, Lajcak said. He said political quarrels among Bosnian Muslim, Serb and Croat leaders have blocked reforms and stalled the country's drive towards the EU. "The process is going much more slowly than expected. Much time and energy have been wasted on steps that reawakened mistrust between [BiH's] entities," he said. He specifically blamed Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik and BiH Presidency Chairman Haris Silajdzic for the current situation. Silajdzic has stepped up demands for abolition of the country's two entities. Dodik has responded with threats to hold a referendum on independence. (RS TV, Beta, Tanjug, B92, AKI - 29/10/08)

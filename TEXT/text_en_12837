THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Serbian Police General Sreten Lukic pleaded not guilty at the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague Wednesday (4 May). He has been charged with four counts of crimes against humanity and one count of violations of the laws or customs of war, stemming from the Kosovo conflict. Lukic was transferred in The Hague in early April, though it is still unclear whether he surrendered or was arrested.
On Tuesday, former Bosnian Serb General Vinko Pandurevic appeared before the UN tribunal to plead not guilty to charges of genocide and other war crimes related to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. Pandurevic surrendered to the UN court in March after five years in hiding. (Reuters, Nezavisne novine, Beta - 04/05/05; RTRS, Reuters - 03/05/05)

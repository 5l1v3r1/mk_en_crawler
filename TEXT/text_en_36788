BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- According to Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, the fact that the ruling coalition's candidate did not win Serbia's presidential election weakened its position. "The government exists while it has the support of a parliamentary majority, but it is substantially weakened," he said Sunday (18 July). Newly-elected Serbian President Boris Tadic heads the Democratic Party, which has so far been excluded from the government.
In other news Sunday, Dejan Milenkovic, a top suspect in the March 2003 assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, appeared before a magistrate in Thessaloniki, Greece. He will remain in police custody pending an extradition request from Serbia. Milenkovic, also known as Bugsy, was arrested on an international warrant on Friday.

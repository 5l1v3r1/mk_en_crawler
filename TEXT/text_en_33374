BUCHAREST, Romania -- The foreign ministers of Romania and Russia, Mircea Geoana and Igor Ivanov, signed a friendship treaty on Monday (5 May) underlining the normalisation of ties between the two countries in recent years. In the document, Moscow acknowledged the right of its former ally to maintain an independent foreign policy and join NATO. The treaty omitted two contentious issues: the German-Soviet pact of 1939, under which Russia received some Romanian territory; and the issue of Romanian assets left for safekeeping in Russia in 1917. These two questions will likely be addressed in a political declaration to be adopted during President Ion Iliescu's visit to Moscow in July.

In an attempt to open the doors on the fight against human trafficking, the European Commission released an unprecedented report on the trend in Europe. 
The next step to combat the crime, according to EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Cecilia Malmstrom, is for all EU states to implement specific laws. 
"Only a few countries have implemented the anti-trafficking legislation, and I urge those who have not yet done so to respect their obligations," Malmstrom said. 
The anti-trafficking directive facilitates prosecution across national borders of those involved in one of the most lucrative criminal businesses, with tougher penalties. 
The draft on the transposition of the EU directive into Bulgaria's legislation has been in place for some time and submitted to parliament, Ernesta Roussev, of the National Commission for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings in Sofia, said, but could not be approved as the assembly was dissolved last month. 
"The draft envisions amendments to the Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and certain changes to the Law on Combating Illegal Trafficking in Human Beings," she told SETimes. 
The report, which covered the period of 2008 to 2010, found that most trafficking victims are from Bulgaria and Romania. 
Of the 3,316 EU citizens identified as victims of trafficking in 2010, Bulgarians and Romanians accounted for 718 and 1,558, respectively, together representing more than 78 percent of the total number. 
The number of "identified victims" and "presumed victims" registered by police, NGOs and other agencies in Bulgaria rose from 250 in 2008 to 432 in 2010. 
The increase "shows that there is an improvement in the identification system," Roussev said, adding that it was also a sign of people's "grown trust in the institutions and NGOs dealing with that problem." 
The number of people sold in the EU for sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, begging, criminal activities, removal of organs and other forms of severe human rights violations grew by 18 percent between 2008 and 2010, the report said. 
The report also covered EU hopefuls Croatia, Iceland, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey. 
Cyprus led with the number of identified and presumed victims of trafficking per 100,000 citizens, peaking in 2009 at 14.2. 
In Croatia, the number of identified and presumed victims of trafficking ranged from eight in 2008, to five the following year, and then seven in 2010. Similarly in Serbia, where 127 victims were identified in 2009, compared to 55 in 2008 and 89 in 2010. 
The report from Turkey shows a substantial drop in identified and presumed victims -- from 120 in the first year of the review period, to 102 in 2009, then 58 in 2010. 
The number of suspected traffickers fell by 17 percent between 2008 and 2010, the EC report stated. 
Police registration systems data from EU member states concluded there were a total of 3,872 suspected traffickers across the bloc in 2010. Of them, 1,701 were EU citizens, or 44 percent of all, with Bulgarians (380), Romanians (305). Three-quarter of all suspects were men mostly trafficking for sexual exploitation. 
According to the report, there were a total 80 suspected traffickers from EU candidate and potential countries in 2010; of them, 49 Turks, 16 Albanians, and 13 Serb nationals. 
"From the non-EU countries, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey reported an increase of convicted traffickers," the report said. 
In 2010, the number of convictions within the Union in the Balkans was the highest in Romania (203), and Bulgaria (106). Among the four non-EU Balkan countries in the study, Turkey was in the lead with 28 convictions, followed by Serbia with 20, Croatia and Montenegro with three each. 
One of the challenges the Union faces, according to the report, is the need to strengthen the investigation process into human trafficking cases, and the prosecution and conviction of those involved in this criminal activity.

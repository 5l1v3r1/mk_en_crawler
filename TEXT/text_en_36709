NEW YORK, United States -- Former Bosnian Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey was released from a jail in Manhattan on Tuesday (27 July), after posting $5m bail. He has been ordered to wear a monitoring bracelet and remain in his Staten Island home until the judge rules on an extradition request from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Sacirbey, who is also a US citizen, is charged in his home country with stealing $610,980 from the Bosnian mission to the UN, where he served as ambassador in 2000. He was indicted in Sarajevo in 2002. Sacirbey has denied the charges, describing them as politically motivated. (CNN, The New York Times - 28/07/04)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn urged authorities and political leaders in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to agree on a clear strategy for tackling EU-related reforms, High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said after meeting with Rehn in Brussels on Monday (September 8th). Rehn stressed the need for a strategy to make quick progress on requirements arising from BiH's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU and reiterated that Brussels is ready to help with that integration process. Rehn and Lajcak also agreed on the need for constitutional reform in BiH and reviewed progress made in meeting conditions for closing the Office of the High Representative. Lajcak again urged BiH party leaders to resolve the future status of Brcko and the issue of state property. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne novine, RTRS - 09/09/08)

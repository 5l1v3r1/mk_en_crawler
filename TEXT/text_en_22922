TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha began a tour on Saturday (May 3rd) under the slogan "Albania in NATO", to inform citizens about the government reforms. "This year alone, $1.2m euros have been invested in the construction of roads, as a result of the combat against corruption and fiscal evasion," Berisha said at his stop in Delvina, southern Albania. Economic and social reforms bring difficulties and dissatisfaction, but they are the only way to build Albania according to European standards, he said. (Topchannel, BallkanWeb, Alsat - 04/05/08)

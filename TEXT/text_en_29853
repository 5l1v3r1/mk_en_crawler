PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Independent Media Commission (IMC) ruled in favour of the media on Friday (February 25th) in a dispute over privacy claims raised by US Ambassador Christopher Dell. He voiced concern that the media violated the Code of Conduct when publishing details of telephone conversations with political representatives and other officials during last week's parliamentary session to elect the new president and government. The IMC ruled that the media acted professionally and in line with the Code of Conduct. 
"Conversations, telephone calls and interviews should not be broadcast without informing the other party in advance, except in cases when public interest is the matter," the IMC said, quoting the Code of Conduct. Freedom of expression and the right to information is the key to democracy, it added. Print and broadcast media published mobile short text messaging conversations during the parliamentary session and between the second and third round of voting for the new president, crucial to secure the votes for Behgjet Pacolli's win. The Press Council of Kosovo also supported the media for working in the public interest. (Kohavision, Klan Kosova, RTK - 25/02/11)

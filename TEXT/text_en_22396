PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is expected to send a letter Wednesday (June 11th) to both Pristina and Belgrade regarding UNMIK's gradual reconfiguration, according to local media reports. In the letter, Ban will discuss the presence of two international missions -- UNMIK and EULEX -- and will say the UN presence will become symbolic after Kosovo's constitution comes into force on Sunday. Ban reportedly will partially meet the demands of the Serbian government, which seeks a functional partition of Kosovo. Newspapers say he will ask the Kosovo Police Service to report to international missions in areas dominated by Serbs and will also initiate the establishment of additional courts in areas inhabited by Kosovo Serbs. 
In other news, the public prosecutor's office now considers Friday's attack on Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's house an attempted murder. Police first described it as a break-in. Tome Gashi, Thaci's lawyer, said on Tuesday the case is more complex than initially reported, since there were two similar incidents involving the homes of Thaci's two brothers the same night. Authorities arrested a 19-year-old ethnic Albanian, Fazli Sejdiu, on Saturday after his father went to police. (Zeri, Koha Ditore, Express, Lajm, Kosova Sot - 11/06/08)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Albania must reform its electoral laws to be able to move forward with its European integration, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said on Tuesday (March 11th) in Brussels. "Electoral reforms are one of the most important issues that have to be completed," Solana said after meeting with Albanian Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha. At the same time, Solana pointed out that EU institutions are very encouraged by "the manner in which Albania is tackling problems." For his part, Basha said "Every challenge is an opportunity ... there is no other road for Albania than the road of reforms."
Separately on Tuesday, the head of the OSCE presence in Albania, Robert Bosch, urged all parties to step up dialogue regarding electoral reform. Bosch said that while the OSCE is ready to provide technical support, lawmakers must make the final decisions.

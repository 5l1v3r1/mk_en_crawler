LEFKOSA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas sent a letter to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on Sunday (3 August) regarding the clearing of landmines. In the letter, Denktas indicated the readiness of Turkish Cypriot military authorities to discuss the issue with UN officials, and said he hoped Greek Cypriots would co-operate in the initiative. Clearing the mines would strengthen the positive atmosphere created by the April opening of border passages between the two parts of the island, Denktas said. (Anadolu Agency, CNA - 03/08/03)

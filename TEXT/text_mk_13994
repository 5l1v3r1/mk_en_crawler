ATHENS, Greece -- Police on Monday (15 August) arrested a man who claimed his cousin sent him a text message from a doomed Cypriot aircraft minutes before it crashed. The airline, Helios Airways, insists the message -- which said the passengers were freezing and the pilot had "turned blue" -- was a hoax. Also Monday, police raided the airline's office in Cyprus, reportedly looking for documents that could be useful in a possible future criminal investigation. 
Experts in Greece are trying to determine the cause of the crash that killed all 121 people aboard the Boeing 737 Sunday. The coroner in Athens told reporters that at least six of the passengers were alive when the plane slammed into a mountain near Athens. This contradicted earlier reports which suggested that all the passengers froze to death when the cabin depressurised at high altitude. The black boxes from the wreckage were sent to France for analysis. All of Helios' aircraft were grounded after the crash. (CNN, BBC, AFP, Reuters, AP - 16/08/05)

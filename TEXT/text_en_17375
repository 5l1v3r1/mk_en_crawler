BELGRADE, Serbia -- Four former and current Serbian policemen and a prison guard in Prokuplje have been arrested in connection with the so-called Bitici war crimes case, according to media reports Tuesday (February 27th). The case involves the 1999 murders of three Albanian brothers with US citizenship -- Agron, Mehmet and Ilijem Bitici. Their bodies were found in 2001 in a mass grave in the eastern village of Petrovo Selo, alongside other Kosovo Albanian victims. Their remains had been trucked from Kosovo to Serbia. All five of these new detainees reportedly testified in the ongoing murder trial that began last November. Two former policemen, Sreten Popovic and Milos Stojanovic, are charged with the murders.

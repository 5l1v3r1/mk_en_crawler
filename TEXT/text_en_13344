BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A Muslim party has decided to join the embattled cabinet of Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, the government announced Thursday (22 September). The List for Sandzak Party, from the predominantly Muslim region in Serbia's southwest, will have three deputy ministers in the cabinet. One of its officials will join the Serbian Council for European Integration. The ruling coalition also includes the Democratic Party of Serbia, G17 Plus, the Serbian Renewal Movement and New Serbia. As a result of this agreement, the ruling coalition gains two additional votes in parliament, which restores the balance of power between the opposition and ruling coalition after the earlier departure of the Social Democratic Party from the government.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The opposition Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) vowed on Sunday (November 22nd) to submit amendments to Vojvodina's statute. According to the SNS, the draft statute and a bill on transferring powers to the province are leading Vojvodina towards secession. SNS lawmakers have said they will not back the legislation when it comes to parliament for a vote. Two other opposition parties -- New Serbia and the Democratic Party of Serbia -- say they will submit amendments as well, as, in their view, the statute is unconstitutional. They intend to challenge the legislation before the Constitutional Court. Debate on the draft statute and the bill on transferring powers to Vojvodina is set to begin on Tuesday.

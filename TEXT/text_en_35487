BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbs headed for the polls on Sunday (13 June) to elect a new president. The country has been without a head of state since December 2002. Three previous attempts to elect a president failed because turnout was under 50 per cent. Serbia's Parliament removed this requirement and the current vote is likely to succeed. Hard-line nationalist Tomislav Nikolic was ahead in the polls, but few observers believe he will win an outright majority. Instead, he is likely to face the second-place finisher in a runoff two weeks from now. In all, 15 candidates are running for president, including Democratic Party nominee Boris Tadic, Dragan Marsicanin of the ruling coalition, Serbia's richest man, Bogoljub Karic, and Princess Jelisaveta Karadjordjevic. Preliminary results are expected Sunday night. (Reuters, AFP, BBC, AP, New York Times, Tanjug, B92, Beta - 13/06/04)

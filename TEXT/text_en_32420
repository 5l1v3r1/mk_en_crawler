WASHINGTON, United States -- President George W Bush warned Turkey on Sunday (23 March) not to send troops into northern Iraq. "We have got more troops up north, and we're making it very clear that we expect them not to come into northern Iraq. They know our policy, and it's a firm policy," he said. Bush went on to assure Ankara that negotiations have taken place with Iraqi Kurdish leaders to prevent incidents. But in a televised address late Sunday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan insisted that Turkey should deploy troops in northern Iraq to ensure security and stability, saying the force would set up a buffer zone along the border to assist refugees and prevent what he described as "provocations". Greece, meanwhile, remains sceptical. On Saturday, government spokesman Christos Protopappas told state-run television NET that citing a possible refugee influx does not mask Turkey's will to invade northern Iraq.
Also on Sunday, two US cruise missiles misfired and landed in unpopulated areas of Turkey, causing no injuries. It happened as Erdogan went on national television, announcing the country had opened its airspace to coalition forces.

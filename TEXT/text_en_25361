THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The trial against former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic at the UN war crimes tribunal was adjourned on Monday (October 26th) because he failed to show up. "In light of the absence of the accused and of counsel to represent him, the chamber will adjourn these proceedings today," Judge O-Gon Kwon said. The proceedings will resume on Tuesday with the prosecution's opening statement. If Karadzic continues to be absent, judges would consider appointing a lawyer to represent him. Last week Karadzic announced he will not appear in the courtroom as he was not ready with his defence. He faces charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. Karadzic is defending himself in court. (AFP, AP, Reuters, BBC, DPA - 26/10/09)

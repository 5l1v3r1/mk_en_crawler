ZAGREB, Croatia -- The European Commission representative in Croatia, Jacques Wunenberger, on Monday (9 May) voiced concern over the loss of interest in EU membership among the people of the country. Recent polls suggest that fewer than half of Croatia's 4.5 million residents now support EU membership. Wunenberger noted that this was the first time support for EU membership had dropped in a country after it was granted candidate status. The launch of accession negotiations was postponed in March over a lack of full war crimes co-operation. (AP - 09/05/05)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The European Commission's (EC) delegation to BiH voiced disagreement with recent proposals for conducting a nationwide census in 2005. In a statement issued Monday (18 October), the EC urged that before talks on a census are held, BiH must have a fully operational statistical office at the state level, ensure financing and resolve major issues related to the refugee return process. 
Also Monday, Croatian Parliament Speaker Vladimir Seks visited Sarajevo, ahead of next month's session of the BiH-Croatia Interstate Council. Seks met with senior BiH officials, including the BiH presidency and Prime Minister Adnan Terzic. (Nezavisne novine, Dnevni avaz - 19/10/04; RTRS, PBS BiH - 18/10/04)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament endorsed changes Wednesday (16 August) to the law on political parties, aimed at reducing corruption and dependence on contributors. The amendments would provide more subsidies to parties, but would require them to publish the complete list of their donors, as well as size and type of donations. They have been obliged to declare only the total sum of donations. Party leaders also will be obliged to submit annual asset statements. (Mediapool, BNT - 16/08/06)

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cypriot President Tassos Papadopolous and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat are expected to meet on Tuesday (8 August) at the Green Line that divides the island, according to a statement from Talat's office Thursday. Talks will focus on the lists of issues for discussion by technical committees, exchanged between representatives of the two sides earlier this week. In early July, Papadopolous and Talat held a key meeting and agreed to immediately move ahead with limited talks. Broader UN-mediated negotiations have been stalled for over two years. 
In other news, US President George W. Bush has sent a letter to Papadopolous, thanking him for the assistance Cyprus has provided in evacuating US citizens from Lebanon. "The acts of kindness that officials of your government and the Cypriot public exhibited underscored the strong ties between our peoples," Bush reportedly wrote, adding that he looked forward to continued co-operation between the United States and Cyprus.

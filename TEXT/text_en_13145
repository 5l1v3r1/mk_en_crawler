SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The state-level Missing Persons Institute of BiH was formally launched Tuesday (30 August) with the sealing of an agreement between the co-founders, the BiH government and the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) in Sarajevo. The event coincided with the commemoration of the International Day of the Disappeared in BiH, where roughly 20,000 people are still missing after the 1991-1995 conflict. Under the agreement, the responsibilities and personnel of the entity structures would be integrated into a new, single institution. 
Commemorations were also held in Croatia, Serbia and Kosovo. On Tuesday, the remains of 16 Kosovo Albanians -- found in a mass grave in Serbia earlier this year -- were buried in Djakovica. (Danas, Vecernji list - 31/08/05; ICMP Web site, Fena, Tanjug - 30/08/05)

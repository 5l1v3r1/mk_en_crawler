PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- US and British officials in Pristina may temporarily close their offices in the province, according to reports Saturday (22 March) by the Belgrade-based news agency Tanjug. Diplomatic sources are quoted as saying the only alternative to full suspension of operations is significant reduction of public services and additional protection from US and British KFOR troops against terrorist threats. An Islamic terrorist group had warned of bomb attacks in response to military raids on Iraq. Local authorities suspect the group was behind the bombings of two international police stations in Pristina on Friday night, which damaged some vehicles but caused no injuries.
That same night, KFOR disrupted an attempt to smuggle three tonnes of ammunition across the Kosovo-Albanian border by boat. KFOR says its personnel recovered the ammunition, but not the smugglers. (Tanjug, B92, Beta - 22/03/03; AP, AFP - 21/03/03)

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- OSCE observers will not be monitoring next month's local elections, Jens-Hagen Eschenbacher, spokesperson for the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, announced on Thursday (April 8th). In an interview with the newspaper Vijesti, Eschenbacher said the OSCE had not been invited to observe the May 23rd election process. Local monitoring group CEMI, as well as the Centre for Democratic Transition, will likely also skip the election due to lack of funds. The opposition Movement for Changes has asked the European Commission to provide special international monitoring to prevent possible violations. (RTCG, Portal Analitika, Tanjug - 08/04/10)

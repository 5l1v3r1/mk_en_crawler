ATHENS, Greece -- UN special envoy for Cyprus Alexander Downer said on Wednesday (May 20th) he is cautiously optimistic about the outcome of ongoing talks to reunify Cyprus and urged the two Cypriot communities to intensify their efforts. After meeting with Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis in Athens, Downer said certain issues have already been resolved but there is still long way to go. Asked about a possible timeframe, he said "I don't think [the Cypriot leaders] want to be stuck with a specific timetable. They just need to keep the momentum ... going." Earlier this week, Downer visited Ankara, where he discussed the Cyprus process with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu. (Naftemporiki, ANA-MPA, CNA, Anadolu news agency- 20/05/09)

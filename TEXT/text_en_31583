ATHENS, Greece -- The government Saturday (18 January) condemned an attack against two journalists during a book signing earlier in the day. Several masked individuals smashed windows at a bookstore where reporters Alexis Papahelas and Tasos Teloglou were signing copies of their book on the November 17 terrorist group. Government spokesman Christos Protopapas described the incident as a serious breach of freedom of speech. The major opposition New Democracy party and the Coalition of the Left and Progress also condemned it. (Macedonian Press Agency, Athens News Agency - 18/01/03)

MOSCOW, Russia -- The foreign ministry on Friday (February 5th) expressed concern and demanded an explanation after Romania announced plans to deploy elements of a proposed US missile defence shield. The Supreme Defence Council in Bucharest backed the idea Thursday. President Traian Basescu says the facilities should be operational by 2015 and that the new system is not directed against Russia. But Moscow is not convinced. "This is a serious issue and we will analyse it seriously. This, of course, causes our concern. We need clarifications. We will raise these issues in our contacts with our European and US partners," the Russian ministry said in a statement. (AFP, Press TV, Reuters, ITAR-TASS - 05/02/10)

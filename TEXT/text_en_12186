TIRANA, Albania -- The leader of the ruling Socialist Party (SP), Prime Minister Fatos Nano, says he believes 3 July is the most suitable date for the next parliamentary elections. Talking to the local TV channel Klan, Nano said that is the date nearest to the one stipulated in the main law, which envisions an election in July 2005. He said such a timetable would not hinder the summer holiday season and that the SP has forwarded its proposal to President Alfred Moisiu. Nano also suggested that if SP were to lose the election, he would resign as party chairman. (Albanian News - 12/02/05)

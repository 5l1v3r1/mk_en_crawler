ANKARA, Turkey -- The Justice and Development Party (AKP) re-elected Recep Tayyip Erdogan as its leader Thursday (23 January). The move came after the Constitutional Court stripped him of his post because he is no longer a member of AKP's founding board. The same court forced Erdogan to resign from the board in October 2002 due to his 1998 conviction for promoting Islamist values. Constitutional amendments parliament recently adopted lift the ban on Erdogan's participation in politics. Meanwhile, members of the High Election Board insist rulings by the Constitutional Court would have no effect on general election results that brought AKP to power in November.

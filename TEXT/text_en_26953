ANKARA, Turkey -- Police have arrested 17 people suspected of ties to an extremist group that allegedly planned terrorist acts aimed at halting reforms that would give the Kurdish minority more rights. Local media reported on Saturday (October 3rd) that the suspects are members and supporters of an organisation known as the Revolutionary Headquarters. They reportedly were detained earlier in the week in five provinces, including Istanbul and Ankara. Documents found during the raids allegedly indicated "sensational attacks" were being planned.

CAIRO, Egypt -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met with his Egyptian counterpart Nabil el-Araby and Prime Minister Isam Sharaf in Cairo on Sunday (April 10th) to discuss the situation in Libya. The two diplomats talked about a roadmap for peace in Libya proposed by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The plan urges forces aligned with leader Muammar Gaddafi to withdraw from cities they have besieged, and proposes establishing humanitarian aid corridors and comprehensive democratic change. South African President Jacob Zuma said on Sunday that Gaddafi has accepted the roadmap. 
In other news Sunday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry criticised Israel's weekend attacks on the Gaza Strip, describing them as "excessive and disproportionate". "The region cannot be allowed to enter into a new spiral of violence," the ministry said in a statement. Nineteen Palestinians, including civilians, have been killed since Thursday, when Israel launched a series of air raids. (Zaman, Turkish Press, Hurriyet - 11/04/11)

COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen on Wednesday (July 7th) criticised the EU's "unfair" attitude towards Turkey. In an interview with the Danish daily Politiken, Rasmussen urged the EU "to take a series of pragmatic steps to improve relations with Turkey, entirely outside the [EU accession] negotiations" process. Rasmussen, Denmark's former prime minister, added that Turkey should be given a bigger role in decision-making regarding the military missions in which it's involved, and be accepted in the European Defence Agency.

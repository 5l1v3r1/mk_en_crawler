SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH House of Peoples passed the public broadcasting service (PBS) law Monday (31 October), meeting the last condition in the EU Feasibility Study. The law envisions the establishment of a single PBS, incorporating all three existing public broadcasters in the two entities, to prevent political interference in the state-run media.
In other news Monday, the main RS parties failed to reach an agreement on BiH's chief negotiator with the EU. Four candidates are in the running: former BiH Ambassador to the United States Igor Davidovic, RS Finance Minister Svetlana Cenic, former RS Industry Minister Dorde Lajsic and former BiH Ambassador to Switzerland Jugoslav Jovicic.

Italian Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema visited Belgrade for talks with Serbian leaders. He suggested that new talks between Kosovo Albanian and Serbian representatives could be held, but only for a limited period and with Kosovo independence as the ultimate goal. Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica repeated their objections to independence, but agreed with D'Alema that a solution outside the UN Security Council would be the worst possible outcome.

Italian Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema paid a two-day visit to Turkey, where he backed NATO chief Jaap de Hoop Scheffer's call for a diplomatic solution to the problem of terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party incursions from northern Iraq. D'Alema also told Turkish media that Italy supports the country's EU membership bid, but would insist that Ankara meet its commitments regarding Cyprus. Although the accession process will be a lengthy one, Turkey's membership overlaps with the EU's basic interests, D'Alema said.

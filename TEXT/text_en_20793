PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UNMIK officials announced on Wednesday (February 6th) that the head of the OSCE mission in Kosovo, Tim Guldimann, has not been asked to resign due to his views on Kosovo. Guldimann, a Swiss diplomat who accepted the post in October, has been telling different Swiss dailies that Kosovo should not be allowed to declare independence because it could pose a serious precedent for other breakaway territories.
The OSCE said on Wednesday that Guldimann has been reproached by UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker, who reiterated that Guldimann's views do not represent those of UNMIK. A report in the Pristina-based Express says he has been banned from issuing any further statements on the future of the breakaway province. (Kosovalive, RTK, Telegrafi, Balkaninsight - 06/02/08)

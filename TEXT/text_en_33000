SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Top BiH Federation and Republika Srpksa military officials reached agreement Friday (23 May) on the establishment of a single general staff and civil command for the country's army. Commanders Gen Atif Dudakovic and Gen Ivica Zeko of the BiH Federation Army and Republika Srpska Army commander Gen Cvetko Savic agreed that the existing entity general staffs would be abolished and that a new structure would start operation early in 2004. The new structure would include departments for personnel, intelligence, training, logistics, finance and civilian-military relations and would operate under the control and command of the BiH presidency. The commanders also agreed to strengthen the powers of the Standing Committee on Military Matters, which acts as a defence ministry in BiH.
SFOR commander Gen William Ward, who mediated the talks, lauded the agreement.Uniform command and supervision of the armed forces in BIH is a fundamental requirement for the country's acceptance into NATO's Partnership for Peace programme, Ward said. (HINA, FENA - 24/05/03)

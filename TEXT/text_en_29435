ZAGREB, Croatia -- Labour unions will attempt to collect the 450,000 signatures required to call a referendum on proposed amendments to the labour law, Ozren Matijasevic, chairman of the trade unions association, announced on Tuesday (June 1st). The proposal would set a six-month deadline for agreeing on a new collective agreement after the existing one expires. After that, workers' rights would be subject to separate agreements with individual employers. By law, any group has 14 days to collect the signatures required to hold a referendum. No attempt has been successful since Croatia declared independence in 1991. (HRT, Vecernji List, SEEbiz - 01/06/10)

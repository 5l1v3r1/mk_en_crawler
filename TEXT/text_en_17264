SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski met with Menduh Thaci, deputy leader of the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA), on Monday (May 28th) in an attempt to resolve differences and keep the cabinet intact. On Sunday, Thaci announced that DPA was leaving the government. But A1 TV quotes unnamed sources who say the issues have been ironed out and the ruling coalition, led by Gruevski's VMRO-DPMNE, would be preserved. 
Another ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic Union for Integration, is considering a return to Parliament, after months of boycott. (Utirnski Vesnik, Vecer - 29/05/07; Makfax, A1 TV - 28/05/07)

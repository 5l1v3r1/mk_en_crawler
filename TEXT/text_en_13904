POZAREVAC, Serbia-Montenegro -- Slobodan Milosevic's remains were laid to rest Saturday (18 March) in the yard of his family home in Pozarevac, some 80km south of Belgrade. The 64-year-old former Yugoslav president died last Saturday of heart failure in his cell at the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, where he was on trial for his role in the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s. An estimated 15,000 Milosevic supporters lined the main street of Pozarevac as the funeral procession entered town, while a ceremony in downtown Belgrade drew some 80,000. Milosevic's widow and children did not attend the ceremonies, saying they feared arrest. (Politika - 19/03/06; CNN, B92, Beta, Tanjug, RTS - 18/03/06)

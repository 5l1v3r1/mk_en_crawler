SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A statement by the US Embassy in Sarajevo on Wednesday (October 11th) clarified that the US government is not involved in a conference in Boston next month, organised by the NGO Dayton Project. Leaders of all the main parties in BiH have been asked to attend. The embassy statement noted, however, that the US government welcomes such talks on priorities, following elections earlier this month. 
In other news Wednesday, the main Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA) decided to start negotiations to form a ruling coalition in the Federation of BiH (FBiH) with its current partner, the Party for BiH (SBiH). SDA finished first in the FBiH elections; while SBiH was second. A top official in the leading Serb party in BiH, the Union of Independent Social Democrats' Igor Radojicic, said a SDA-SBiH coalition would radicalise the political situation and threaten planned constitutional reforms.

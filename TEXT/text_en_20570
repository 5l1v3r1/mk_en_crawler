ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis called on voters to back his New Democracy (ND) party in upcoming elections, and provide it with the majority needed to win a clear mandate. At a press conference Sunday (September 9th) on the sidelines of the 72nd Thessaloniki International Fair, Karamanlis rejected the notion of ND forming a coalition cabinet with other parties in the next parliament. He also vowed his party will proceed with reforms if it wins the September 16th elections. (Naftemporiki, Ethnos - 10/09/07; ANA-MPA - 09/09/07)

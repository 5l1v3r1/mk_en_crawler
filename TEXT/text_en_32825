SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- All 12 Serb deputies from Republika Srpska walked out of the first session of the BiH Parliament's House of Representatives on Tuesday (3 December). The Bosnian Serb representatives left as soon as the new members of parliament were sworn in. The action was in protest of High Representative Paddy Ashdown's imposition of the law on the BiH Council of Ministers. The Office of the High Representative dismissed the walk-out as a "cynical tactic" to buy more time for political deals. (OHR Sources - 04/12/02; PBS BiH, RTRS, NTV Hayat - 03/12/02)

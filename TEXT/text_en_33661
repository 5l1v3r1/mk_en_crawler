BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Vojislav Kostunica, head of the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) and former Yugoslav president, suggested Monday (8 September) that his party would not hold talks with the Democratic Party (DS), the leading party in the ruling coalition. The former federal president's statements come amid discussions between DSS and G17 concerning the possibility of early elections. Kostunica added that DSS would only talk with parties that recognise early elections as the sole option for the country. (B92, BBC, Tanjug, FoNet, BBC - 08/09/03)

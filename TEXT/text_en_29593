TIRANA, Albania -- Political experiments involving the May 8th elections have to end, President Bamir Topi said on Wednesday (April 27th) after a meeting with local observers. "They [the elections] should mark the start of the consolidation of a stage of stability and democracy," Topi said. He criticised various political parties for conflicting rhetoric, the absence of debates and for incidents during the campaign. "It seems that a part of the candidates see May 8th as a test for their militants, structures and ability to control the process," Topi added. He also voiced concern over the small number of independent candidates and women candidates. (VoA, Balkan Web, Top News, Alsat - 27/04/11)

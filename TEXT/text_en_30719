SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A joint committee of the Republika Srpska (RS) parliament and the Council of Peoples on Tuesday (January 11th) failed to reach a compromise over a decision by the Bosniak caucus to block the appointment of the entity's new government. Thus, the matter moves to the Constitutional Court. The Bosniak bloc in RS's Council of Peoples stopped the appointment of the new government citing a breach of the right of all constituent people to equal representation in BiH institutions. The old government will continue to perform its functions until the Court rules on the case. 
Separately, Tuesday's meeting of parties with seats in the new BiH state-level parliament failed to bring any breakthrough in forming a new government and continuing parliament's constituent session. It instead highlighted the deep differences among the main parties. The Serb, Croat and Bosniak parties agreed to meet again in a week. For the time being, they will not convene parliament or elect its leaders. (Fena, BHRT, RTRS, Oslobodjenje, Nezavisne Novine, Srna, Fena - 11/01/11)

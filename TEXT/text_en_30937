BRUSSELS, Belgium -- US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Countryman said on Tuesday (February 8th) that Washington expects Kosovo to form a government that is "clean, competent and committed. It should appoint ministers based on their skills and readiness to work, and not based on who takes over which ministry". Countryman commented after the International Steering Group's meeting in Brussels. 
As for the long-expected Pristina-Belgrade dialogue, Countryman said the US will be at the disposal of both sides and the EU to reach practical decisions. He stressed however "We believe Kosovo is ready to take part in this dialogue and it doesn't need the United States of America to speak on behalf of Kosovo or be its advocate."

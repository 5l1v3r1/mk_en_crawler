THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The Hague tribunal trial chamber has rejected an application for bail from former Republic of Srpska Krajina President Milan Martic. Prosecutor Alex White told the court that Martic had been hiding from the tribunal for seven years, and may face additional charges. He was charged in 1995 with violating the rules of combat during the shelling of Zagreb and with involvement in the deaths of at least five people. The former Croatian Serb leader may also be charged in connection with crimes allegedly committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina. (FoNet - 14/10/02; B92 - 13/10/02)

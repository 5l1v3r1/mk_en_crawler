PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government urged minority Serbs on Wednesday (May 26th) to boycott Sunday's elections in northern Kosovo. Campaigning in the north, Belgrade politicians have vowed to boost Serb control in the area, in part, by buying property. Kosovo Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi reiterated on Wednesday that the elections are illegal and said Kosovo police will provide no additional security Sunday. 
EULEX says it will not recognise Sunday's results, insisting that only elections organised by Kosovo authorities can be considered legitimate. (Zeri, Koha Ditore, Express - 27/05/10; RTK, Telegrafi, DPA - 26/05/10)

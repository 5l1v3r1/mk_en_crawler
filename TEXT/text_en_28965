TIRANA, Albania -- Relations between Albania and Kosovo are excellent and should serve as a model of co-operation in the Balkans, Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli said on Thursday (April 8th) after meeting with Kosovo counterpart Jakup Krasniqi in Tirana. "There are 56 agreements between the two parliaments and five more are in the process," Topalli said. She added that Kosovo's independence is irreversible and that more countries will be recognising it. 
Krasniqi also met with President Bamir Topi, agreeing that Albania and Kosovo have a common EU integration goal and should co-operate in achieving it. (Lajmifundit, Shekulli, Klan, Balkan Web - 08/04/10)

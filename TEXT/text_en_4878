The southernmost island in the archipelago of volcanic islands in the Aegean Sea -- Santorini -- is arguably Greece's main attraction. 
 Its spectacular beauty, along with its dynamic nightlife, has made the island one of Europe's tourist hotspots. 
Fira, the capital, is located atop a hill. From a distance, it looks like the mountain is covered with snow, but if you look closer it is actually veiled with white and pastel houses. 
Numerous pathways and narrow alleys lead to many wonderful spots. One of them is Franco's Bar, known for its fantastic view overlooking an old harbour. Franco's made Newsweek magazine's "The World's Best Bar" list. 
Most visitors stay in Kamari and Perivolos. They typically go to the capital on excursions that include a boat tour to the local volcano, and a swim in the yellow water, which got its color from the volcanic sulphur. 
On the way back, many visit Oia, located on the island's northern side. Oia boasts the richest view in the caldera and unforgettable sunsets. 
The island's beauty was featured on the big screen in the 2001 movie "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider", featuring Angelina Jolie, which was filmed in Oia. 
The Perissa and Perivolos beaches, which are practically connected, are full of cafes and dance clubs. Most visitors come to swim here because it is a spot where the Aegean is calm, and some of the beaches have unusual light black sand. 
For an added adventure, one can take a ferry from Santorini to nearby Therasia on the opposite side of the volcano. Simply getting to the harbour is fun. Travelers can walk down Santorini's numerous steps, take a cable car for a more breathtaking aerial view, or for a traditional approach, ride a donkey. 
While amenities can be pricey, the food is excellent. The swordfish at Taverna Petros is highly recommended.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Voters returned to the polls Sunday (January 31st) for do-over elections in two municipalities, Prizren and Lipjan/Lipljane. The re-vote was organised after elections on November 15th and run-offs on December 13th failed to result in the election of mayors in either place, or in a third municipality, Gjilan/Gnjilane. All three had tight races between the candidates of President Fatmir Sejdiu's Democratic League of Kosovo and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo. After a series of complaints, the Election Complaints and Appeals Commission recommended that the Central Electoral Commission schedule new elections in Prizren and Lipjan/Lipljane and order a recount of votes in Gjilan/Gnjilane.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR commander Major General Virgil Packett said in an interview with Dnevni Avaz that he is confident that SFOR would soon arrest Radovan Karadzic and other war crimes indictees and their supporters. Packett cited recently intensified pressure on Republika Srpska to co-operate, as well as joint actions by the international community. He reiterated that full co-operation between BiH and the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague remains the chief precondition for membership in the Partnership for Peace programme and integration in EU structures. "The leadership of this country should choose between Karadzic or its entry in Europe," said Packett. (Dnevni avaz, Pincom.info - 17/05/04)

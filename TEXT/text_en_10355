SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government decided on Monday (20 September) to ask the ODIHR to deploy monitors for the 7 November referendum on the new decentralisation laws. Cabinet spokesman Saso Colakovski said that Skopje would request the same number of observers that monitored the presidential elections -- around 312. According to ODIHR sources quoted by A1 TV, the organisation would probably not be able to provide that many, given other obligations. Sources say the more likely number is 50 monitors.

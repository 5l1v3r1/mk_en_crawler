SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A new survey finds corruption remains the biggest problem faced by business owners, though many say they are feeling less pressure than before. The poll by the local NGO Coalition 2000 was released Tuesday (11 May). Among other problems cited by business owners were low incomes and unfavourable business conditions.

The court overturned an acquittal by a lower court and convicted Bozhkov of damaging the state in a 1998 privatisation deal. (Sega, Monitor - 12/05/04)

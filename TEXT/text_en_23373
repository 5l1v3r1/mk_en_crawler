ANKARA, Turkey -- Former Deputy Prime Minister Abdullatif Sener announced on Monday (May 25th) the establishment of a new political group, known as "Turkey Party". Sener described it as "a democratic central party" and pledged to promote "a new political style". At a press conference in Ankara, he criticised the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), saying the government can not handle the current economic crisis. 
Sener was an AKP founder and served as economy minister and deputy prime minister between 2002 and 2007, quitting the party ahead of parliamentary elections that year. The Turkey Party is the 61st party in the country and will be represented in parliament by lawmaker Mehmet Yasar Ozturk who resigned from the AKP to join it.

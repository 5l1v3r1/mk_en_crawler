PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Officials investigating the killing of three US police officers and the wounding of 11 others in Kosovo reportedly are focusing on the possibility that their Jordanian attacker had links to the extremist group Hamas. The Associated Press said Saturday (24 April) that investigators have established that Sergeant Ahmed Mustafa Ibrahim Ali, a Palestinian from Jordan, opened fire a week ago as a number of unarmed prison guards from the United States and other countries were leaving a detention facility in Mitrovica. Investigators were examining a trip Ali took to Saudi Arabia one month before he joined the mission in March, to see if it might be connected to the attack. (AP - 24/04/04)

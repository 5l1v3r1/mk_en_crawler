SOFIA, Bulgaria -- On Thursday (14 November), the government adopted new regulations governing foreign arms deals as well as those involving potential dual-use goods and technologies. The measures were passed quickly, in light of an arms scandal involving unauthorised exports of spare parts by a company called Terem. It came to light last week, and is considered potentially damaging to Bulgaria's prospects for membership at next week's NATO summit in Prague. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Nancy Beck said the United States was working with Bulgaria in investigating Terem. Authorities in Sofia intercepted a shipment of reduction gears that could be used in armoured personnel carriers. While the hardware was supposed to go to Syria, it appears it may have been intended for Iraq. (Focus, Mediapool, BTA, BTV, BNT - 15/11/02; AP, AFP - 14/11/02)

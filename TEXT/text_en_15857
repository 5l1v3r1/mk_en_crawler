ANKARA, Turkey -- The first group of 95 Turkish military engineers was deployed in Lebanon on Thursday (October 19th), becoming the first Muslim peacekeepers to join the UN Interim Force (UNIFIL). They were followed by the remaining peacekeepers on Friday. The contingent comprises 237 soldiers and 24 civilians, and is stationed near the port city of Tyre. 
Also Thursday, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) advised Turkey to reconsider its economic reform programme. The OECD said high tax rates and bureaucracy impede economic growth. (Zaman - 20/10/06; TurkishPress.com, Turkish Daily News - 19/10/06)

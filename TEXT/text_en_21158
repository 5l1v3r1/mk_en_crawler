SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A court in Macedonia sentenced two people Friday (November 30th) to the maximum 15 years in prison for drug smuggling. Prosecutors said Stanislava Cocorovska-Poletan and Alija Azirovic tried to smuggle nearly 500kg of cocaine across the Kosovo border earlier this year by hiding it in nearly 900 buckets of white paint. The street value was an estimated 101m euros. (B92, A1, UPI, DPA - 30/11/07)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Three Germans, arrested in Kosovo several days ago, left the country Saturday (November 29th). On Friday, a panel of international judges determined they were not involved in the November 14th explosions at the headquarters of the International Civilian Office (ICO) in Pristina, and ordered their release. Local prosecutors, however, have said they may still press charges. The three are agents with the German Federal Intelligence Agency. Germany insists they had no ties to the attack and were only at the site to see what had happened.
In other news, local media reported on Friday that Slovakia is considering recognising Kosovo's new passports, a move that would clear the way for travellers to apply for Slovakian visas. Slovak Foreign Ministry spokesperson Jan Skoda stressed this "does not mean that we will recognise Kosovo as a state".

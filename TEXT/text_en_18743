NEW YORK, United States -- The progress achieved in stabilising Kosovo could unravel quickly if a decision is not made soon on the province's future status, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned on Thursday (July 5th). "The determination of Kosovo's future status should therefore remain a priority for the Security Council and for the international community as a whole," Ban said in a statement to the Council. He also reiterated his support for the plan drawn up by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari. The Security Council is due to debate Kosovo's future status Monday.
UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker will brief Council members on the current situation. He met with Kosovo opposition leaders Thursday, telling them he plans to express his concern about the instability of the status quo. France wants to delay a status decision by six months, to provide time for additional negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo Albanians. Russia indicates it would block any resolution that would lead to Kosovo's independence, while China has suggested it might use its veto unless Russia and the United States manage to find common ground.

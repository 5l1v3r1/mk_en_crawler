VIENNA, Austria -- The International Steering Group (ISG) for Kosovo met in Vienna on Thursday (April 17th) to discuss the situation in Kosovo two months after its unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia. The ISG commended the progress made and praised Kosovo's leaders for handling the post-secession situation with "maturity and foresight". The EU's representative in Kosovo, Pieter Feith, vowed that "the ISG will do everything possible to make sure this progress is sustainable." The ISG also condemned violence last month against international peacekeepers. A UN police officer was killed on March 17th in northern Kosovo.
Separately, Council of Europe Secretary-General Terry Davis told a news conference Wednesday in Strasbourg that independence has not destabilised the Balkans. Davis conceded there was "great concern ... for the difficulties between countries or within them," but he also cited positive steps. "One should look at the whole picture," he said.

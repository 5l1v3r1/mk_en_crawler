PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Conditions in Kosovo detention facilities are satisfactory, although some problems still persist and relevant authorities should tackle them, according to a report by the OSCE Mission in Kosovo, released on Wednesday (December 29th). Among the problems, the Mission cites a lack of space and overcrowding, inadequate lighting and air circulation in some cells, issues with toilets and bathrooms, as well as inadequate open-air exercise facilities. The report is based on the findings of a two-year assessment. (OSCE mission in Kosovo website, B92, Tanjug - 29/12/10)

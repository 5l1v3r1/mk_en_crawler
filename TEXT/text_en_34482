SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia's ruling party, the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM), responded positively Friday (10 October) to a proposal by the main opposition party, VMRO-DPMNE, for a joint strategy on EU and NATO integration. SDSM said that it was open to any initiative that would help the country's entry into Euro-Atlantic structures. VMRO-DPMNE expressed its satisfaction with the SDSM's response, explaining that the reason behind its appeal was that there were signs that Macedonia lagged behind in its integration process.
On Saturday, Macedonian Finance Minister Petar Gosev said the country would continue the property restitution process despite the recent slowdown. The process of defining property rights and ownership relations was difficult, Gosev said, adding that often more than one claimant was demanding restitution of rights on the same property. He pledged that the problematic issues would be resolved. (MIA, Dnevnik, Radio Free Europe - 11/10/03; MIA, Macedonian Radio - 10/10/03)

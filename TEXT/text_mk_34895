SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR reported Sunday (21 December) that its troops raided a home in Travnik and detained an individual "suspected of engaging in activities that threaten the safety and security" of the country. Local media identified him as Mohamed Perenda Zitouni, a 31-year-old Algerian who fought in the 1992-1995 war and holds Bosnian citizenship following his marriage to a local woman. The arrest came several days after US Ambassador to BiH Clifford Bond warned of an unspecified threat of terrorism. (OHR Sources - 22/12/03; AFP, PBS BiH, FoNet, BBC - 21/12/03)

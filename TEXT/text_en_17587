SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Economic reforms should be brought back on the agenda of the new government of Federation of BiH (FBiH), High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling said during his first meeting with the new FBiH Prime Minister, Nedzad Brankovic, on Thursday (April 19th). Schwarz-Schilling stressed it is common perception that Republika Srpska (RS) is more advanced in the economic sector, adding that FBiH should work to catch up. Yet he stressed he is pleased to see a dynamic young leader at the helm of the entity. 
Also Thursday, US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney met with members of the Movement of Srebrenica and Zepa Enclave Mothers, Srebrenica Mothers and the Women of Srebrenica associations in an attempt to reduce tension in the town. It has been rising since Srebrenica's Muslims stated that unless the town is given special status outside RS jurisdiction, they would stage a mass exodus from it.

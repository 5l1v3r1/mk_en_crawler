STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament adopted a report on Turkey Thursday (5 June), prepared by Dutch parliament member Arie Oostlander. The report welcomes recent progress in the country, but criticises the role of the military as an obstacle to developing a pluralist democracy in Turkey. The report said a new constitution in line with European standards should be adopted, and it lauded the progress of the current government in that direction. The report holds Turkey responsible for the failure of efforts to find a viable solution to the Cyprus issue, maintaining that a solution to the dispute was a prerequisite for Turkey's EU membership.

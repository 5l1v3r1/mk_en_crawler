TIRANA, Albania -- The two main political parties exchanged accusations on Thursday (November 19th), ahead of a protest in Tirana organised by the Socialist Party (SP) against what it claims were manipulations of the June 28th general elections. Prime Minister Sali Berisha accused the SP of trying to block Albania's European integration process. "I am ready for compromise but I won't go beyond a court decision, as this country functions based on democratic laws," Berisha told parliament, which has been half-empty since the opposition decided to boycott its work, demanding on an official investigation into the election process.
SP leader Edi Rama insists his party's efforts to open the ballot boxes from June are democratic and are the only way towards EU integration. (VoA, Ora News, BBC, Shekulli, Top Channel - 19/11/09)

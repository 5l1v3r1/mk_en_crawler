ANKARA, Turkey -- The General Staff announced on Friday (June 25th) that professional troops will be deployed at the borders, particularly the one with Iraq, in the wake of attacks that have resulted in many casualties. At a press conference, Secretary General of the General Staff Ferit Guler said attacks by the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) have killed 19 soldiers and two civilians in the past week. That has prompted generals to deploy professional troops, rather than drafted military personnel, at borders. Around 84% of commando brigades are currently professional, Guler noted, adding that the whole process will be completed by August. The military's top staff also ruled out media speculation of a lack of co-operation in intelligence sharing between Turkey and the United States.

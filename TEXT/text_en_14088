ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government submitted a key judicial reform package to parliament Thursday (15 September), aimed at boosting the judiciary's efficiency and slashing the backlog of cases, so the sector can meet all EU requirements. Among other changes, the largest court in the country -- the Zagreb municipal court -- would be divided into two courts, one civil and one criminal. (HINA, World Bank Web site - 15/09/05)

IZMIR, Turkey -- The head of the European Commission's delegation to Turkey, Hansjoerg Kretschmer, said Saturday (30 April) the starting date for accession talks with Turkey will be an historic one. He added, however, that starting talks does not automatically mean entry into the Union, warning that a long, tough road of reforms lies ahead. He voiced confidence that authorities would overcome difficulties and meet those challenges.

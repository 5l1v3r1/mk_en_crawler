SKOPJE, Macedonia -- While the country has made great progress over the past year in the areas of human trafficking, the economy and legislation on religious communities, more reforms are necessary, US Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo said on Tuesday (October 9th), after a meeting with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski in Skopje. "A political consensus should be reached between the ruling parties and the opposition ... This will be good not only for NATO, but also for the future of Macedonia," DiCarlo said. 
She added that while Washington supports Macedonia's NATO aspirations, Skopje must boost efforts to form its Judicial Council, implement political reforms and iron out issues related to a deal struck in May between leaders of the ruling VMRO-DPMNE and the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration. 
In his response, Gruevski said he hopes Macedonia will be invited to join NATO next year. He said 90% of the population supports membership in the Alliance. (Vecer - 10/10/07; Makfax, MIA, MRT, AP - 09/10/07)

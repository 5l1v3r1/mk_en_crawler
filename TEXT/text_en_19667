SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Council of Ministers approved a law Thursday (February 21st) establishing the fiscal council, an important requirement on the path to EU integration and a major prerequisite for establishing a single economic area in BiH. The council will co-ordinate fiscal policy in BiH, Republika Srpska and the Federation of BiH. One of its most important responsibilities will be to monitor the drafting of budgets on different levels to avoid large discrepancies. Establishing the council has been a longstanding request of both the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 22/02/08; RTRS, Fena, AFP - 21/02/08)

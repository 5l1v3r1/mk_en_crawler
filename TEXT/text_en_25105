BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski vowed on Wednesday (October 28th) that his country will continue with reforms needed to bring it closer to the EU and will keep trying to resolve its long-standing name dispute with Greece. At a joint press conference with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana in Brussels, Gruevski said Macedonia was satisfied with the recent positive progress report by the European Commission and will try to address weaknesses mentioned in the document. Solana stressed that the EU wants to see the name issue settled as soon as possible. 
Separately Wednesday, Dimitris Droutsas, who shares the Greek foreign policy portfolio with Prime Minister George Papandreou, told Reuters that Macedonia cannot start talks to join the EU until the name dispute is resolved. "This is a very clear and strict line Greece is taking," he said. (MIA, A1, Alsat, Sitel, Reuters - 28/10/09)

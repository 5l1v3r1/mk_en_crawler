NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greek Cypriot authorities announced on Thursday (September 3rd) that they expect talks on the reunification of the divided island to start next week. They postponed talks scheduled for this week after more than 500 pilgrims were forced to give up a planned trip for a religious holiday in a village in the Turkish part of the island. "Cases like this are heating up emotions and the negotiations climate, therefore we have decided that the next several days are not the best moment for a meeting," government spokesman Stefanos Stefanou said. Talks will resume on September 10th, he added. (UPI, DPA, Anadolu news agency, BTA - 03/09/09)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Miroslav Lajcak, the EU envoy for Montenegro's independence referendum, visited Belgrade on Monday (8 May), telling the newspaper Blic that the Union will present an official position on future ties between Serbia and Montenegro on 15 May -- six days before the referendum on Montenegrin independence. Lajcak was due to visit Podgorica on Tuesday to meet with local leaders. Montenegro will become independent if more than 55 per cent of the voters back the move. (Blic - 09/05/06)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK will continue its presence in predominantly Serb areas of Kosovo even after it downsizes, to avoid a security vacuum, UNMIK deputy chief David Harland said on Sunday (September 21st). He confirmed that the mission soon will be reduced by 70% from its current 4,000 employees as part of the ongoing reconfiguration process. According to Harland, UNMIK's main priority remains restoring the rule of law in northern Kosovo.
In other news, a new report by the US State Department finds religion in Kosovo is generally respected by the government. It also concludes that while violence is down, the level of inter-ethnic tensions remains high, especially since Pristina's unilateral declaration of independence in February. Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said on Sunday that the government will take the report seriously and work to improve relations among local communities.

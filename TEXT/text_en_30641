TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Socialist Party (SP) said on Thursday (April 7th) that the official launch of campaigning ahead of the May 8th local elections finds them at a distinct disadvantage. They complained to the OSCE about the ballots, which mention only the name of the alliance various parties have joined, The Alliance for the Future, rather than the individual names or logos of the parties. Their opponents, led by the ruling Democratic Party (DP), have also registered under one group but have the logos of their parties visible in the ballot paper. The SP said that this decision by the Central Election Commission has made it lose faith in the commission, which the opposition says is under government control. Formal campaigning begins on Friday.

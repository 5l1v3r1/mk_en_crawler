BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Republika Srpska (RS) government on Friday (21 May) adopted a report on its co-operation with the war crimes tribunal in The Hague. The document concluded that RS has made progress in co-operating with the tribunal recently. The report was requested by the BiH presidency, which has been preparing its delegation to the UN Security Council meeting in late May.
In other news, High Representative Paddy Ashdown said in an interview with the SENSE agency that RS was a paying high price for the fact that runaway war crime indictee Radovan Karadzic is still at large. He warned that the entity might lose its international legitimacy, which he said was based on laws and commitments which RS has not respected. (Nezavisne Novine - 22/05/04; FENA - 21/05/04)

TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha returned from the NATO summit in Lisbon saying Albanian troops will stay in Afghanistan as long is required. "Our stance supports the strategic concept," Berisha told journalists Sunday (November 21st). That concept, he added, requires reforms in military structures; therefore the trend of raising defence budgets will continue in order to support modernisation. The Lisbon summit was the first that Albania attended as a full member. (Shekulli, Top Channel, Balkan Web - 21/11/10)

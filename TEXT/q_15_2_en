1. Is the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women guaranteed?

a) by law; 
b) by collective agreement. 
This principle is regulated by the Labour Relations Law and by collective labour agreements which must not contravene the Law. 3. Do pay gaps exist between women and men? 
Such gaps exist exclusively because of the differences between the jobs that are mainly performed by men and those mainly performed by women. These differences are not a result of gender discrimination. 4. Is direct discrimination forbidden by law in the field of access to employment, training, promotion and working conditions? 
The Labour Relations Law prohibits direct or indirect discrimination in the field of access to employment, career advancement, securing of working conditions, working hours, and termination of employment contract due to race, skin colour, gender, age, health condition, i.e. disability, religious, political and other beliefs, membership in unions, national or social background, family status, financial situation or other personal circumstances. 
5. Is gender specific advertising allowed? 
The Labour Relations Law does not contain provisions prohibiting the gender specific advertising.  This issue is to be specifically regulated with the new Labour Relations Law. 
6. Is there a rule established either by law or jurisprudence that there is no justification whatsoever to ask a woman about pregnancy when applying for a job of whatever kind? 
There is no such provision. According to the Labour Relations Law (Article 9), certain personal conditions, including pregnancy, may not be an obstacle for commencing employment.  
7. Does the national law or case law provide a definition of direct and indirect discrimination? (Directive 2002/73/EC) The national legislation does not provide a definition for direct and indirect discrimination. However, the Labour Relations Law contains provisions which expressly prohibit direct and indirect discrimination regarding the right to access to employment. 8. Are there any legal provisions concerning damages to be awarded by court in case of discrimination on grounds of sex? If so, are there any upper limits defined by law for such cases? 
There are no such legal provisions in the Labour Relations Law. 9. Is there a system of administrative sanctions in case of discrimination based on sex? If so, please give details. 
In the Republic of Macedonia there are no administrative sanctions in case of discrimination based on sex. This issue is to be specifically regulated by the new Labour Relations Law. 
10. Are there any provisions to protect women (not pregnant women) against work underground, onerous and harmful work and in particular from night work? 
Pursuant to the Labour Relations Law, female employees working in industries and building construction can not be assigned to night shifts, unless a minimum seven hour break has been provided between 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. the following day. This does not pertain to female employees granted special authorities and responsibilities or those engaged in health, social or other services for the protection of employees. The same applies for cases of force majeure or in severe economic, social and similar conditions. Pursuant to the Labour Relations Law, female employees with children over one year of age are permitted to work in night shifts only at their request. 
11. Are there any provisions in law or ordinance to define jobs in the sense of Art. 2 (2) of Dir. 76/207 where the sex of a worker constitutes a determining factor? 
There are no such imperative provisions. However, this issue is mainly regulated by the Labour Relations Law provisions that refer to the special protection of female employees. For more details see 13_II_A_413_II_A_6 and 13_II_A_10
12. Is there a general prohibition of night work for pregnant women? 
According to the Labour Relations Law, a pregnant woman or a woman with a child up to the age of two may not work at night. 13. What is the legal position of a spouse of a self employed worker in terms of status, social protection and rights? 
The Labour Relations Law does not make a distinction between regularly employed and self employed workers. Both categories of workers have equal status, rights and obligations, regulated by this Law. Therefore, a legal position of the spouse of a self employed worker is equal to the position of a spouse of any employed worker and does not differ from it whatsoever. According to the health insurance regulations, the spouse of a self employed worker is considered a family member and is a beneficiary of health insurance on this basis, same as the unemployed spouse of any worker. 14. Are pregnant women protected against dismissal during the time of pregnancy and maternity leave? 
According to the International Labour Organization Convention No. 103 for protection of women during pregnancy, which is an integral part of our legal system, a pregnant female employee cannot be dismissed during pregnancy or maternity leave. This issue is to be specifically regulated by the new Labour Relations Law. 
15. Do national law or collective agreements forbid the exposure of pregnant or breast-feeding women to hazardous agents? 
The Labour Relations Law provides a set of provisions referring to the special protection of female employees.

Pursuant to the Labour Relations Law, female employees are not to be assigned to jobs involving strenuous physical labor, underground or underwater work or to other jobs that may be harmful or threatening for their health and lives. The formulation “other jobs“ covers the issue of protection of pregnant and breast-feeding women from hazardous agents. 
16. Does the employer have to assess the risk within the workplace? 
The Law on Safety at Work (Official Gazette of the RM Nos. 13/98; 33/00; 29/02) stipulates the obligation of employers concerning the detailed regulation of relations, rights, obligations, and responsibilities in a given working environment by act. It also stipulates that employers define workplaces which may constitute an increased risk of injury and disease (workplaces with specific working conditions) by a general act, as well as the special conditions required for performing these jobs (age, expertise, mental and physical ability, etc.). 17. What are length and conditions of maternity leave required by law? 
Pursuant to the Labour Relations Law, female employees are entitled to nine months continual leave from work during pregnancy, birth and maternity, and one year leave for birth of more than one child (twins, triplets, etc.). Based on the findings of authorized medical institutions, female employees may begin maternity leave 45 days before delivery and compulsorily 28 days before delivery. Female employees who have adopted a child are entitled to leave until the child is nine months old and one year leave for the adoption of more children (two or more). Female employees who have adopted children between the age of nine months and five years, are entitled to three months leave from work.Fathers and male child adopters are entitled to the same rights.  18. Do provisions in your law clearly stipulate that at least 2 weeks of maternity leave are compulsory?

Do national law or collective agreements give an individual right to parental leave and to reintegration into the previous or an equivalent job? 
The institute parental leave is not incorporated and elaborated in the national legislation of the Republic of Macedonia. The answers to all the questions of parental leave contain a description of the institute maternity leave being determined and regulated by our national legislation. With regards to the aforesaid, our national legislation provides individual right to exercising the maternity leave and returning to the same or to another post for both parents. 
20. Is parental leave granted on an individual non-transferable basis to both parents?

If the court suit is resolved in favour of the employee, the costs of the court proceedings and the other matters are regulated by the regulations on the usual court procedures.  23. Do structures exist to explore the right of equal treatment between the sexes? (Equal opportunities Commission, ombudsperson) 
There is a department for equal treatment of sexes within the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy. This Department deals with other issues as well.  The non-government sector also works on these issues.  The Ombudsman, seated in Skopje, is an entity of the Republic of Macedonia which protects the constitutional and legal rights of citizens and all other persons when their rights are violated by acts, actions, or omission of actions by the state administration bodies and other entities and organizations with public authority, and takes actions and measures for protection of the principles of non-discrimination and equitable representation ofthe ethnic communities in the state administration bodies, the local government bodies, and in the public institutions and services. From the information received from the Ombudsman’s Office so far, there have been no complaints on violation of constitutional or legal rights by women (e.g., out of 1,000 complaints, none refers to sex discrimination). One of the Ombudsman’s deputies is a female, monitoring human rights and paying special attention to women’s rights.  In order to protect the freedoms and rights of citizens, The Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia established a Standing Survey Committee on Protection of Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights (Article 76, paragraph 4 of the Constitution). Its findings provide basis for initiating procedures for determining the liability of public officials. This liability primarily relates to the acts and actions of public officials violating or putting into question the freedoms and rights of citizens. The Committee cooperates with scientific and expert organizations involved in protection of freedoms and rights of citizens, with relevant foreign and international bodies dealing with the same issue, as well as with the appropriate bodies of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia. 24.

25. Are there any legal provisions in place covering occupational social security schemes? If so, do such schemes already exist in your country? 
The occupational social security schemes include health and pension insurance, insurance in case of injury at work and occupational diseases, and unemployment insurance. Certain areas of insurance are regulated by special laws for each type of insurance listed below, as follows: -  Health insurance: Law on Health Insurance (Official Gazette of the RM Nos. 25/00; 34/00; 96/00; 50/01; 11/02; 31/03) and the regulations on its application; -  For pension and disability insurance: Law on Pension and Disability Insurance (Official Gazette of the RM No. 80/93) and the regulations on  its application  In case of injury at work and occupational diseases: Law on Pension and Disability Insurance (Official Gazette of the RM No. 80/93) and the Law on Health Care (Official Gazette of the RM Nos. 38/91; 46/93; 55/95; 10/04);  For exercising the rights in cases of unemployment: the Law on Employment and Insurance in a Case of Unemployment (Official Gazette of the RM No. 37/97) and the regulations on its application. There are no separate legal provisions on the social security schemes for separate occupations. 
B. Equality of treatment in social security 

1. Is there a general social security scheme covering the working population in your country? Does it contain differences in the pensionable age for men and women, or in the survivor pension benefits available to men and women? (These may be permitted under the derogations contained in Directive 79/7/EEC.) 
In the Republic of Macedonia, there is a general social security scheme for the working population which includes: pension and disability insurance, health insurance and employment. The pension and disability insurance contains the provisions regarding differences in the retirement age for men and women. Men are entitled to old-age pension at the age of 64, while women acquire the same right at the age of 62. The survivors pensions are available to men at the age of 55, whereas to women at the age of 45.  2. If there is a general social security scheme, does it also apply to civil servants, including the police and armed forces? Is there any specific scheme for civil servants, or are there within the general scheme specific rules for civil servants? Does it contain differences in the pensionable age for men and women, or in the survivor pension benefits available to men and women? 
The general social security system provides for the rights of all categories of beneficiaries including civil servants, with certain advantages for beneficiaries from the Ministry of Defence and those in service of the regular Army of the Republic of Macedonia, and also for beneficiaries from the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Justice, and penitentiary institutions. There are more favourable conditions in terms of age and length of service for attaining the right to an old-age pension for these beneficiaries, in cases of employment termination due to the needs of the service. These more favourable conditions derive from the wider importance and significance of duties performed by these employees. For this category, the retirement age differs for men and women. Men are entitled to old-age pension at the age of 55, whereas women acquire the same right at the age of 50. The right to old-age pension on the basis of buying off the length of service (the length of service is 40 years for men and 35 for women) is of temporary character for military and civilian army personnel. These benefits are regulated by the Law on Military Service in the Army of the Republic of Macedonia (Official Gazette of the RM Nos. 62/02; 98/02; 25/03, and 71/03). In terms of survivors pensions, there are no special benefits (for more details see 13_II_B_1).

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Foreign Minister Mihai Razvan Ungureanu said on Monday (29 August) that any possibility of delaying the country's EU membership after 2007 must be explicitly dismissed. Opening an annual meeting with diplomats, he stressed that political turmoil in the past months had given a false impression that leaders lack the political will to ensure EU entry in January 2007 and that Romania's diplomatic corps must work to erase this perception in Brussels and other Western capitals.

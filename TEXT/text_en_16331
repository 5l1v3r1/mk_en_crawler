SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament decided on Thursday (10 August) on the new composition of the Central Election Commission (CEC) and appointed its 21 members. But only deputies in the ruling coalition and the minor opposition Bulgarian People's Union voted on the members; the right-wing opposition parties and the ultranationalist Attack coalition left the chamber in protest. They oppose allowing the ruling coalition partners to control 16 of the 21 CEC seats. (Novinar, Sega - 11/08/06; Darik, Mediapool - 10/08/06)

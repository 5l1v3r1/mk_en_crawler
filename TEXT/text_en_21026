ZAGREB, Croatia -- Deputy Parliament Speaker Vesna Pusic said on Monday (March 3rd) that Croatia will recognise Kosovo as an independent country this month, via a unanimous decision by the government. Pusic, chairwoman of the Croatian People's Party, added that Kosovo's independence is a political fact and Zagreb must recognise it. "As far as I know, this will happen by mid-March," Pusic said.
Also on Monday, Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu said 80 states plan to recognise its independence. His comment came during a meeting with Lukas Beglinger, head of the new Swiss Liaison Office in Pristina. He gave Sejdiu an official letter in which Switzerland recognised Kosovo.

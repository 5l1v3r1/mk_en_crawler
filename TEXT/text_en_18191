SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Court sentenced former Bosnian Serb paramilitary commander Gojko Jankovic to 34 years in prison on Friday (February 16th), for crimes against humanity. The case stemmed from the murders, torture and rapes of Bosniak and Croat civilians in Foca between1992 and 1993. Prosecutors, who had sought a 30-year sentence, praised the longer term handed down by the judges. (PBS BiH, RTRS, B92 - 16/02/07)

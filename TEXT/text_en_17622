STRASBOURG, France -- The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe's (PACE) Bureau issued a statement Friday (January 26th), calling on Libyan authorities to release six foreign medics, sentenced to death last month a controversial HIV infection trial. The PACE Bureau said the verdicts against the five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor violated the basic requirements of a fair trial. 
The appeals process is under way in Libya. On Saturday, Bulgarian media quoted Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi's son as saying that the nurses would not be executed. (24 Chasa, DPA, bTV - 27/01/07; CoE website - 26/01/07)

ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis and Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis held a closed-door meeting Saturday (15 January) on the EU's recommendation for extra measures to reduce the country's deficit. The Union demands Greece lower the deficit below the Eurozone ceiling of 3 per cent of Gross Domestic Product. The EU Finance Ministers meet in Brussels on Tuesday and will likely discuss the issue. 
Also Friday, police announced that they had smashed a trafficking channel for hashish, seizing 6.5 tonnes of the drug from a warehouse near Athens' main port. The drugs apparently came from Pakistan and were headed for Western Europe. (ANA, Kathimerini - 15/01/05; EU Web site, ANA - 14/01/05)

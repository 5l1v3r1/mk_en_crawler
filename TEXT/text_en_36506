ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a statement Sunday (8 August) that he would attend the opening of the Olympics in Athens "to spread a message of peace, goodwill and international solidarity". He called the Games one of "the greatest occasions to celebrate our unity in human terms and in the search for noble ideals". Erdogan's trip to Athens comes as a further demonstration of warming ties between the two former rivals. (AFP - 08/08/04)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan heads to Russia on Monday (10 January) for talks on bilateral economic co-operation. The visit was to have begun on Tuesday, but dates were changed to accommodate President Vladimir Putin's schedule. Erdogan is to open a Turkish trade centre in Moscow and meet businessmen from his country. Trade between the two countries has soared in recent years, reaching $6.8 billion in 2003. An increase of more than $3 billion is expected in 2005. (AP, AFP, TurkishPress.com - 09/01/05; Itar-Tass - 08/01/05)

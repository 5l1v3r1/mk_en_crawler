ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament approved on Thursday (October 4th) a government proposal to revoke conscript military service as of January 1st, 2008. The initial plan was to establish a fully professional army in 2010, but the defence ministry insisted this happen sooner, in order to boost the country's chances of being invited to join NATO at the April 2008 summit in Bucharest.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic appeared before the UN tribunal on Monday (27 January), pleading not guilty to five charges stemming from the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict. He says he had no control over the Yugoslav Army or Serbian special police forces that took part in ethnic cleansing. He is expected to go on trial later this year with two other defendants, Nikola Sainovic, an aide to Slobodan Milosevic; and Dragoljub Ojdanic, a former army commander. They surrendered to The Hague last year.
Also Monday, Milosevic's trial resumed after a delay of more than a week due to the defendant's health problems. The hearing focused on the Yugoslav Army's bombardment of Dubrovnik in 1991. (AP, AFP, Reuters, Tanjug, B92, Radio Jugoslavia - 27/01/03)

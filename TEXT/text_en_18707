SKOPJE, Macedonia -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn expressed concern with two issues during a visit to Skopje on Thursday (February 8th): the slowdown in EU-related reforms and the near constant political infighting between the ruling coalition and the largest ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic Union for Integration. He urged officials to find common ground and proceed with police restructuring, state administration reforms and the fight against corruption. Rehn also confirmed European Commission obligations related to reforms, including financial aid worth 60m euros. Rehn met with President Branko Crvenkovski, Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and Parliament Speaker Ljubisa Georgievski.
Separately, Crvenkovski met with visiting UN deputy envoy for the Kosovo status talks Albert Rohan. Afterwards, Crvenkovski said Macedonia supports envoy Martti Ahtisaari's blueprint for Kosovo's final status, and expressed satisfaction with the section dealing with border demarcation between Kosovo and Macedonia.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso on Sunday (May 20th) welcomed the results of Romanian President Traian Basescu's impeachment referendum, which he easily survived Saturday. Barroso said he is confident that the outcome will allow Romania to continue implementing crucial reforms in the judicial sector and to strengthen its fight against corruption. He also reiterated the EC's readiness to help domestic institutions in meeting post-accession obligations to the EU. Justice and Internal Affairs Commissioner Franco Frattini echoed Barroso's sentiment in a separate statement.
Parliament suspended Basescu last month, forcing the impeachment referendum, after accusing the president of abusing his constitutional powers. Analysts say the most fallout may be among the parties behind it, the main opposition Social Democratic Party and the ruling National Liberal Party.

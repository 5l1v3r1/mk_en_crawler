SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Defence Minister Nikolay Svinarov said on Sunday (13 April) a Bulgarian military unit might join operations in Iraq within days. He says the chemical experts might take part in arms inspection operations there, though parliament's resolution on the matter does not provide for such activities. It allows deployments in a neighbouring country to help in case weapons of mass destruction were used.
In other news, a delegation from Bulgaria's Parliament arrived in Moscow on Sunday. They will be discussing development of trade and economic ties, in a bid to boost exports to Russia. (Dnevnik, Trud, 24 Chassa, Standart - 14/04/03; BTA - 11/04/03)

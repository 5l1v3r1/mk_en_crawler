BELGRADE, Serbia -- A smoking ban in offices and public places became effective on Thursday (November 11th). The law bans smoking in all public buildings, offices, educational institutions and hospitals. People who break the rules will be fined 46 euros, while fines for businesses range between 4,600 and 9,000 euros. The law was adopted in May, but allowed a six-month grace period. Bars and cafes were exempted from the ban and their owners could choose whether to have non-smoking areas or not depending on available space. (Beta, Tanjug, DPA - 11/10/10)

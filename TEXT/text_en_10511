STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament (EP) decided Tuesday (14 September) to freeze the financial assets of top war crimes indictees Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Ante Gotovina, according to regional media reports. The BiH news agency SRNA said a new European Council regulation would oblige all EU member countries to start exercising control over financial assets and operations potentially related to the three fugitives. The same source said the EP expects similar decisions from other countries. (Nezavisne novine - 15/09/04; BBC, SRNA, RTRS, B92 - 14/09/04)

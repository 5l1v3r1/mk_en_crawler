SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The head of the East Sarajevo Public Security Centre, Dragomir Andan, asked the public Wednesday (5 January) to provide any available information about fugitives Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic to the Republika Srpska Interior Ministry. Andan's call followed a meeting with EUFOR Commander Major General David Leakey. The centre also said Wednesday that it has filed charges against 13 people for alleged war crimes against Serb civilians, including the murder of 243 Serbs in the Sarajevo quarter of Dobrinje in 1992. The charges were submitted to the regional prosecutor's office. (Nezavisne novine - 06/01/05)

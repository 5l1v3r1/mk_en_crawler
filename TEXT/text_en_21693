ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic absorbed criticism on Tuesday (November 25th) for his comment that the state, facing a financial crisis, should cut the costs of veterans' funerals. Mesic noted that five veterans receive funerals with state honours every day at a significant cost to the military. Every such ceremony requires the costly presence of a squad of soldiers, adding up to 13,000 troops doing funeral duty annually. "Maybe he will order us to stop dying," the president of the Croatian Disabled Homeland Veterans Association, Josip Djakic, said on Tuesday, slamming Mesic's statement as shocking.

TIRANA, Albania -- Another miner died on Tuesday (August 28th) in the chrome mine in Bulqizar. It is the fourth death there in three months. Operations were suspended indefinitely Tuesday as a panel was formed to determine the reasons behind the tragedy. The miners have staged protests and hunger strikes, demanding better working conditions and pay. There were more clashes Tuesday outside the mine.

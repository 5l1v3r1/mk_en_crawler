SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte told a local TV station on Tuesday (3 February) that she has no doubts SFOR is doing everything possible to arrest Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic. She said the NATO peacekeepers might have missed the fugitive by two hours when they raided his former stronghold in Pale on 13 January. Del Ponte added that eight or nine new war crimes indictments would be issued soon against members of BiH's Muslim and Croat communities.
In other news Tuesday, Momcilo Krajisnik, the former speaker of the Bosnian Serb Parliament, appeared before the UN tribunal for the start of his trial. He faces eight counts, including genocide and crimes against humanity. (AP, Reuters, AFP - 03/02/04)

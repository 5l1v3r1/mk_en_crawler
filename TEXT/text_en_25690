SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Authorities have received Greece's counter-arguments to the complaint Skopje filed with The Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ) over an alleged Greek violation of a bilateral agreement. Macedonian Ambassador to the Netherlands and co-representative before the ICJ, Nikola Dimitrov, said on Wednesday (January 20th) that the substance of the arguments will remain confidential until the hearings begin. Macedonia filed its complaint in November 2008, accusing Greece of breaching a 1995 interim agreement by blocking Skopje's NATO entry bid during the Alliance's Bucharest summit. Under the agreement, Athens "agrees not to object" to Macedonia's application for membership in international organisations and institutions that refer to it as the Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia.

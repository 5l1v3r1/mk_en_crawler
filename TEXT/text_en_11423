SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria's outgoing Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg said Friday (22 July) that he is pulling out of talks on forming a coalition with the Socialists and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF). The Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) said it will try to get a minority cabinet approved by the National Assembly on Tuesday. If that fails, the president will hand Saxe-Coburg's NMS-II a mandate to form a government. The Socialists vowed not to back the prime minister for a second term. NMS-II might get support from at least two of the rightwing parties in the Assembly, but would need the votes of either the BSP or the MRF to get the cabinet approved. Many observers believe that early elections would have to be called in September or October. (Reuters, AP, AFP - 22/07/05)

The State Statistical Office does not calculate poverty and social exclusion indicators according to the income distribution. The national indicators on poverty are calculated by the State Statistical Office according to official methodology using data from the Household Consumption Survey. The national standard for calculation of poverty level is the relative method which defines poverty at the level of 70% of the median equivalent consumption, with application of the OECD equivalent scale. After defining the poverty threshold, percentage of households living under the poverty line is established. In 2002, the limit was 64.946 MKD, while in 2003, 63.197 MKD. According to these limits of poverty, 30,21% of the households lived under the poverty line in 2002. The percentage of poor households was 30,17% in 2003. The following are defined as vulnerable groups : persons who are already social benefit users  persons who lost their jobs due to reforms and bankruptcy of enterprises long-term unemployed persons  - pensioners According to the poverty calculations by profile, it may be concluded that the most affected households are the ones with more members, households whose head is at the age under 40 or has not any qualifications or has low level of education. b) Unemployment rates of population aged over 15, by age and sex

The State Statistical Office does not monitor the regional and sectoral trends of the labour market. 
c) The main and the most important source of data and information on measurement and monitoring of poverty and standard of living of the population in the country is the Households Consumption Survey carried out by the State Statistical Office. This Survey collects detailed data and information on income and expenditures of households, their personal opinions on the necessary level of monthly income, and data on other characteristics of the living standard of households. The activities for establishment of mechanisms for measurement, analysis, and monitoring of poverty in the Republic of Macedonia have begun in 1996. These activities are carried out with financial and technical assistance of the World Bank within the Project “Social Reforms–Technical Assistance.” The project activities include establishment and definition of methodological principles, basic concepts and definitions for poverty measurement in the Republic of Macedonia, determination of measures for improvement of the quality of the available data and the need for increase of the sample of households covered by the Household Consumption Survey, determination of experimental poverty lines using the absolute and relative method of calculation, determination of the basic indexes of poverty for various profiles. The first calculations and indicators of poverty in the Republic of Macedonia for the period 1994-1996 are treated as experimental because they were mainly used for examination and selection of the methods, instruments and indicators for measurement and monitoring of poverty. The results obtained from the measurement from 1997 and onwards have been the basis for analysis and monitoring of the poverty in the Republic of Macedonia. Significant changes and improvements regarding the structure and contents of the Household Consumption Survey were introduced in 2002 in accordance with the EU practice, when the use of journals where the selected households record the necessary data and information in details, was introduced as well. During 2001 and 2002, the National Strategy for Poverty Reduction of the Republic of Macedonia was developed and published (the document was published in August, 2002). This document was developed by the members of the Committee for development of Strategy on Poverty Reduction with participation of government representatives from all relevant ministries, the State Statistical Office, and number of experts, university professors and scientists, supported by the World Bank and other international institutions. Within the Social Support Project of the World Bank ’ implemented during the period 2000-2002, the sub-component  Monitoring of Poverty included several measures and activities directed towards strengthening and improvement of the  poverty monitoring capacity in the Republic of Macedonia through improvement of the possibilities for calculation of poverty line, and analyses which would serve as a starting point for determination of the poverty characteristics and creation of the social policy. For the activities of this sub-component, a Working Group for Poverty Monitoring  was established with representatives from the State Statistical Office, the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Education and Science. The goal of the working group is participation in regular estimation of the poverty in the country, construction of poverty profiles identification of the basic characteristics of the poor people, providing information on the causes of poverty, permanent and regular update of the poverty profile, analysis of the efficiency of the policy and measures for alleviation of poverty, etc. During that period, financially and technically supported by the World Bank, several seminars, workshops, and training sessions were held, with participation of the Working Group members, which further improved their knowledge and skills for calculation and analyses of poverty and its characteristics. In 2004, great progress was achieved in the increase of accessibility and use of data available at the State Statistical Office, collected by surveys it conducts. The collected data will contribute to increase of the capacity and possibilities of the relevant institutions in monitoring of poverty and analysis of the effects of certain policies. Cooperation Agreement has been signed by the State Statistical Office and the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, which defines the procedures for provision and communication of micro-data collected by the State Statistical Office to the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy. These data will be used for analysis that will enable monitoring of poverty, monitoring of policy enforcement, evaluation of the effects of specific policies, measures and programmes and creation of new and improvement of the existing measures and policies. These activities will help the analysis of poverty characteristics in the country, analysis of the occurrence frequency of various social transfers with various socio-economic categories of households, analysis of characteristics of persons/households who use various social transfers (pensions, social benefits, children allowance, unemployment benefits), estimation of the participation of various social transfers in the total income of households who receive benefits, estimation of the efficiency and effectiveness of social transfers, estimation of the criteria for targeting transfers and review and analysis of possibilities and methods for improvement of targeting, etc. The World Bank project on poverty estimation in the Republic of Macedonia will be implemented in the next three years (2004-2006). This project is planned as a joint activity of experts from the World Bank and the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, the Ministry of Education and Science, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Health, and the State Statistical Office. The activities of the project will be focused on several issues: review and improvement of the system of poverty indicators, poverty mapping, providing recommendations for the volume of collected statistical data, recommendations for supplementing the contents of the Household Consumption Survey by introducing new data and information on poverty dimensions not related to finances (access to employment, education, health, social services), making several analyses on the poverty profile, the influence of the labour market status on poverty, use of social transfers, etc. The Basis of the methodology for definition and measurement of poverty 
definition Considering the orientation of the Macedonian statistics towards international standards and the need for providing internationally comparable data, the definition of EUROSTAT is used as a starting definition of poverty, according to which poor people are persons, families and groups of persons whose resources (material, cultural and social) are at such level which excludes them from the minimum acceptable way of living in the country of residence.  
poverty lines The poverty line is defined as a level of living standard to be achieved in order to avoid classification of the person/household as poor. -  Relative poverty line (relative standard of existence determined as a necessary level of expenses); Calculation of the relative poverty line The concept of expenditures is used for calculation of the relative poverty line. According to it, all the expenditures for food and non-alimentary goods and services are taken into consideration, including the value of the consumption of home made products. The consumption does not include the expenditures in form of transfers such as memberships, contributions, gifts, loan payments, and savings The expenditures in the form of investments such as buying and investing in own homes, as they do not comprise the existential budget, are not included as well. The poverty line is established at the level of 70% of the median equivalent expenditure. d)  Number of families and number of children per family Censuses Number of families Number of children in the families Number of children per family 1994 539.555 788.975 1,5 2002 574.159 791.975 1,4 Source: 1994 Census and 2002 Census

4. How does the described background affect social protection? 
e) What future developments are expected? 
f) Which are the economic forecasts for the next 2-3 years? 
g) Are there any demographic projections? For which period? How are old-age dependency ratios (population aged 65+ over population aged 15-64) expected to evolve over the coming decades? 
h) Are there any forecasts for labour market developments? 
i) Outline the general trends and influences of economic, demographic and social developments on the social protection system of your country. 
e) Present situation Population forecast trend has been developed at a national level by sex and age for the period of 1996-2020. The main goal of these forecasts came out from the need to monitor the future demographic development and its influence on the socio-economic development in the upcoming period. 
Methodological bases for making forecasts The so-called analytical method was applied to make the projections by 2020. For achieving this goal current changes were analyzed and then hypotheses on future trends were made, based on the main components of the demographic development (fertility, mortality and migrations). The projections of population were made in three basic groups of variants: constant (high), low, and middle. Future plans There is a plan to make forecasts for the population by sex and age for the period 2002-2050 at a national and regional level according to NUTS 3 (8 regions).

f) 
Continuity of the reform activities shall be provided with the support of the CARDS Programme, and an employment strategy will be developed which will define concrete economic forecasts for the next period. 
g) 
On the basis of estimations made from the available data received by  the competent institutions (Pension and Disability Insurance Fund of Macedonia, the State Statistical Office, the Ministry of Finances, etc.) as well as according to analysis of current trends and other relevant data and assessments  a demographic projections have been made for the period of 100 years.  
Demographic assumptions The basic demographic assumptions are the assumptions on fertility and mortality rates, i.e., assumptions on life expectancy. The demographic forecasts have been made using three groups of assumptions: optimistic, basic, and pessimistic According to the basic assumptions, the total fertility rate is forecasted to grow gradually during the period until 2050, and then to stay at a constant level of 2.0 until the end of the forecast period (2100). According to the latest data from the 2002 Population Census, the forecasts on life expectancy at birth for men and women show continuous increase in the next decades until 2050, when it is foreseen to reach 80 years for women, and 75 for men, and then stay at a constant level.

Demographic forecasts Using actuary techniques, demographic forecast was made for the population of the Republic of Macedonia for the period 2004-2100 with a particular emphasis on the age structure of the population. The following graph shows the age structure of population in a shape of age pyramid, as an indicator of the number of population by age and sex for the period 2004- 2040.     10000         20000

It can be noticed that the base of the pyramid gets narrower in 2040, which indicates that new generations are reducing, i.e., that the population of the adult groups will not be regenerated. Nevertheless, prolonged lifetime is the reason why the number of population does not decrease, due to which there is also an increase in the absolute number and percentage of elderly people.

ratiopopulation 18-59 population 60+ratioThe working age population (from 18 to 59), the elderly population (aged over 60) and the ratio between the elderly population and the population able to work are presented on the following graph. This ratio is an indicator of aging of the population. It can be seen that the number of the population able to work increases during the first ten years of the forecast, but it continuously decreases as a result of the low fertility rate. On the other hand, the old population continuously increases during 60 years, and then it decreases slightly. This is a result of the prolonged lifetime of people due to better living conditions, progress of medicine, better health services, etc. According to the basic scenario, the ratio of these two groups of population increases from the present 25,5% to 64,4% in 2060, and decreases from 51,5% in 2100. It means that about one third of population over 18 will be old population. The model – PRISM (developed in Excel programme and supported by computer code of Visual Basic for Applications) was used for the forecasts for period of 100 years. PRISM is a computer model using standard actuary techniques for estimation of the trends of population, the workforce, pensioners, amounts of contributions and pensions and changes of revenues and expenditures of the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund based on different demographic and economic assumptions. 
h) 
The Employment Agency does not publish indicators and data on forecasts for trends and labour market condition for now. However, with the Project “Technical Assistance for Institutional Building as Support of Employment Policy” as part of the CARDS Programme, the conditions will be created to enable the Employment Agency to direct part of its activity towards concrete activities for research and analyses of the labour market. A new department will be established at the Agency which will focus on these issues. As part of the activities leading towards introduction of new methods and techniques of work, a number of trainings on labour market research were conducted by international experts, to which all employees have attended. 
i) 
The network of social protection in our country can hardly cover all the socially affected groups due to shortage of financial, human, and institutional resources. The role of the social protection is reduced only to alleviation, and not to reduction or prevention of poverty. The new amendments to the Law on Social Protection have contributed to the pluralization of the social protection network by enabling private  and NGO sector to provide certain services in the field of social protection which is expected to improve the quality and accessibility of services for the beneficiaries. As for the pension and disability insurance, analyses indicate that if the existing pension system is kept, the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund of Macedonia will work without liquidity and with deficit which will increase in time. The financial work of the Fund is carried out within the planned funds, but besides the biggest participation of the salary contributions in the structure of the total revenues, funds provided by the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia significantly influence the current liquidity and fulfilment of the Fund obligations. Macedonia, like other countries with pay as you go systems, will face demographic changes with negative influence on the system. The actuary forecasts indicate that the pay as you go system will face a big and lasting deficit on long-term as a consequence of the forecasted trend of aging population which will increase the number of old population compared to the working age population . The demographic changes (caused by the projected decrease of the fertility rate and the increased life expectancy which modify the population structure) will have a negative impact on the pension system changing the ratio of insured person vs pensioner, which is of great importance for the pay as you go system.  Analyses of the structure of financial social assistance recipients shows that this benefit has been mainly exploited by the unemployed but fit for work persons. This indicates that the unemployment has a direct effect on the number of users of the financial social assistance, on the duration as well as on the amount of the allocations that the unemployed are using in the social protection system.  
B. Overview of the social protection system  

1. Please provide information on the general philosophy and the main principles and mechanisms of the social protection system: is the system employment-centred or citizen-centred, what are the main distributional effects of the system, who is included/excluded? 
While the main philosophy and principle of the system of social protection is citizen oriented, the main rights deriving from the social insurance system (with the exception of the health insurance system which is also universal) are employment centred.  Health insurance in the Republic of Macedonia is regulated by the Law on Health Insurance. The compulsory health insurance is established for every citizen of the Republic of Macedonia upon the principles of comprehensiveness, solidarity, equality, and effective use of assets. The compulsory health insurance is carried out by the Health Insurance Fund of Macedonia, an independent and unique financial institution for implementation of compulsory health insurance. Beside the compulsory health insurance, the Law also regulates the voluntary health insurance for the purpose of providing health services which are not covered by the compulsory health insurance. The compulsory health insurance includes almost the whole population of the Republic of Macedonia either as insured persons or as family members. It includes the employed persons, self-employed persons, persons doing agricultural or similar business, beneficiaries of pensions and other rights related to pension and disability insurance, veterans, temporary unemployed persons, war and civil invalids, social rights beneficiaries, etc. The insured persons covered by the compulsory health insurance have to pay contribution. The obligatory pension and disability insurance that is based on the employment record, and also on the principle of social justice and generation solidarity, provides rights in the case of aging, reduction or loss of working capability, death and physical injuries. The rights from the pension and disability insurance are attained and exercised depending on the period and amount of investment in pension and disability insurance. The central activities of the unemployment insurance system are focused on protection of the unemployed - through financial compensation as well as active measures and rights until conditions and opportunities for their employment are created. The rights from unemployment insurance are attained upon the principle of solidarity and mutuality and they are derived from the labour relations. Depending on the period and amount of investment, the period and the amount of the right is determined, provided that the right to financial compensation can not be exercised if the labour relations have terminated by will or guilt of the employee. Pursuant to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, the state takes care of social protection of citizens and implements it in accordance with the principle of social justice. The rights of the citizens to social protection are based on the principle of social justice and solidarity. The social protection system has been established as an organised activity to prevent and overcome the basic social risks to which the citizen, a family or a group of population during their lifetime might be exposed to. As social risks are considered: health risks (disease, injury, and disability), age risks (old age and surviving), maternity and family risks, unemployment and professional inadaptability and risk from inadaptability to the social environment. The transfers for social assistance are made through the Social Work Centres to the beneficiaries who have attained the right to social protection. The social protection system is transparent and accessible to all citizens. Citizens can be excluded from the social protection system in case they don’t meet the conditions for attainment of the right or a service in accordance with the Law on Social Protection.

The compulsory health insurance is being implemented by the Health Insurance Fund of Macedonia (hereinafter referred to as the Fund), as independent and the only financial institution given rights and obligations for implementation of the compulsory health insurance on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia. In accordance with the Article 53 of the Law on Health Insurance (Official Gazette of the RM Nos. 25/00, 34/00, 96/00, 50/01, 11/02 and 31/03), the Fund is a legal entity and carries out activities of public interest, executes public authorisations, and it is independent in its work.

The Expert Office is organised in: -  central office with headquarters in Skopje, carrying out the most expert activities such as: management, normative and legal issues, economic and analytical issues, financial and accounting issues, control functions, information technology and other issues providing unification in performing the activities of the Fund, and  -  thirty local offices organised for the area of one or more municipalities, where the insured persons are provided conditions for attainment of their rights and obligations from the compulsory health insurance. Employment: the Employment Agency of the Republic of Macedonia has been established as a part of the system for unemployment insurance, which has an Office at the national level, and local offices, i.e., 30 employment centres, operating at the local level, which are not legal entities. The social protection is carried out by public institutions established by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia by the Decision for Establishment of Network with the necessary type and number of public institutions.  There is also a legal possibility to establish private social care institutions (except for establishment of social work centres and institutions for accommodation of children with educational and social problems) using method, conditions, and procedure stipulated by Law. The decision for establishment of private social care institutions is made by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia , whereas the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy issues a licence certifying the fulfilled legal conditions necessary for initiation of the activity. The municipality bodies also have a possibility to establish public institutions, except for establishment of social work centres and institutions for accommodation of children with educational and social problems.  The amendments to the Law on Social Protection adopted in September, 2004 provided decentralisation of the public institutions for the elderly which completely fall under the jurisdiction of municipalities, i.e., the City of Skopje, depending on the region where these are established. The municipality bodies, and the City of Skopje, have the right to decide on housing of the social protection beneficiaries and to develop non-institutional and institutional forms of protection, to adopt social protection programmes and provide funds for its implementation. These programmes are implemented by the social work centres. Day care centres for daily and temporary care of socially excluded persons may be established as independent institutions or as part of the public institutions by the state, by the individuals and legal entities, and by the local self-government units. The policies of the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy enable a possibility for the day care centres established by the state to be decentralised gradually and to fall under the competence of municipalities. The supervision of the work of municipalities with regards to the application of the Law on Social Protection is carried out by the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy.  The municipalities, i.e., the City of Skopje, take over the founding rights and obligations to the existing public institutions for the elderly by Decision of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia depending on the location of the respective institution. The director of the Public Institution for the elderly is appointed by the Mayor of the municipality, i.e., the City of Skopje. The employees will attain their employment rights as employees of a public institution established by the municipality. The amendments to the Law on Social Protection introduce in the social protection system a possibility for certain social protection activities to be carried out by citizen associations. The Law stipulates introduction of a Registry of Citizen Associations. Certain social protection activities will be carried out with partial financial support given through public competition to a citizen association registered in the Registry of the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy for performing of an entrusted activity. The mutual co-operation between citizen associations and the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy with regards to the methods of carrying out certain social protection activity will be regulated by a contract.  The rights to child care are provided by the state, and the Law on Child Care stipulates that municipalities, the City of Skopje and the municipalities in the city of Skopje can provide wider scope of rights if there are sufficient funds from their own sources.  According to the legal decentralisation amendments in this field, in the function of rationalisation, the decision making on the right to child allowance, special allowance and assistance for infants is competence of the social work centres by procedure prescribed by the Law on Social Protection. Management, ownership, investments and maintenance of kinder gardens is devoluted to the competence of municipalities.  The founding rights and obligations for the existing public institutions for children, i.e., kinder gardens, have been taken over by municipalities, i.e., the City of Skopje, depending on the area where the seat of the respective institution is situated, by Decision of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. The Mayor of the municipality, i.e., the City of Skopje, appoints the director of the public institution for children, i.e., the kinder garden. The employees attain their employment rights as employees of a public institution established by the municipality. Tutors employed with the public kinder gardens working with groups of children aged over 5 and up to 7, shall be taken over by the elementary schools as of 1 September, 2006 in accordance with the Law on Primary Education.

The annual report is submitted within 60 days of the date of expiry of the timeline for submission of the annual account of the Fund.  The Ministry of Health monitors the work of the Fund, and the general acts adopted by the Management Board for implementation of the health insurance are subject to consent by the Ministry of Health.  Social Protection: the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy carries out the supervision of the whole social protection system, including the supervision of legality of the public institutions activities, as well as supervision on individuals and legal entities licensed for performing social protection activities. The Ministry may interrupt the execution of general acts of any social protection institution and initiate proceedings for evaluation of the constitutionality and legality before the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia. The Ministry may order termination of activities and duties given to individuals and legal entities if it considers the activity detrimental to the clients. Having the right to control over the legality, the Ministry may cancel or abrogate any individual act (decision) of any social protection institution. The supervision of the professional work of the social protection institutions both for individuals and legal entities performing such activity is carried out by the Institute for Advancement of Social Activities. The objectives of the supervision are control of the efficiency, pointing out the shortcomings, professional assistance and improvement of the institutions’ activities.    The centres decide on all the social protection rights and provide non-institutional assistance to citizens. The centre unites public authorisations and the professional social protection.  Therefore, it decides in accordance with the General administrative procedure of first instance on rights determined by special regulations, whereas the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy decides on a second instance appeal. Court protection is carried out by the possibility for initiation of administrative proceedings before the Supreme Court.   The pension and disability insurance rights are attained with the PDI Fund (competent body in first instance resolution). A Commission of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia decides in second instance on the pension and disability insurance rights attained with the PDI Fund. Court protection against further decisions in administrative proceedings is provided by registering administrative proceedings before the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia.  Integral part of the regulations that regulate pension insurance is the Law on Compulsory Fully Funded Pension Insurance (Official Gazette of the RM Nos. 29/02, 85/03, and 40/04) whose implementation is a planned activity. The date of implementation of the Law on Compulsory Fully Funded Pension Insurance is related to the date of issuance of the first continuous emission of government bonds, but not later than six month of the date. This Law regulates the establishment of the Agency for supervision of the compulsory fully funded pension insurance. The Agency for supervision of the compulsory fully funded pension insurance is an agency responsible for supervision of the work of the companies that will manage the private pension funds and the pension funds. This Law also regulates that the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy will supervise the legality of the activities of the Agency. In order to have a complete legislation regulating the newly reformed pension insurance system, the Ministry has a planned activity on development and adoption of a Law on Voluntary Fully Funded Pension Insurance. The system of acquiring the rights of children in accordance with the Law on Child Care, all  rights referring to financial benefits (child allowance, financial reimbursement for assistance and care of other persons and assistance for infants) are financed from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. The Ministry of Labour and Social Policy creates the policy of child care and supervises the implementation and attainment of the rights of children in accordance with the cited regulation. 3. Please provide information on financing of social protection: 
a) Main financing sources of social protection (taxes, contributions, state subsidies) and institutions involved (State, parafisci, regional authorities, NGOs, private households etc.); 
b) Main financing principles for the fields of social protection (pay-as-you-go, funded financing); 
c) Financial administration of social protection: contribution rates, contribution base and tax base; is there an upper (lower) ceiling? 

a) Financing of the Health Protection System  The health protection system of the Republic of Macedonia is funded by several sources. The most significant source for financing are the funds from the contributions for obligatory health insurance providing for more than 90% of the total funds for health care and the rights related to it. Apart from the funds from contributions, health care is also funded by revenues from the financial participation of the beneficiaries; from the Budget of the Republic; from enterprises and organisations, from citizens as users of medical services; from donations and from other sources. The health insurance in the Republic of Macedonia is constituted by the Law on Health Insurance. The obligatory health insurance has been instituted for all the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia on the principles of comprehensiveness, solidarity, equality, and efficient funds’ usage. The obligatory health insurance is being implemented by the Health Insurance Fund of Macedonia, as an independent and central financial institution for the implementation of the obligatory health insurance. Apart from the obligatory health insurance, the Law institutes voluntary health insurance for providing medical services not covered by the obligatory health insurance. Almost the whole of the population of the Republic of Macedonia is covered by the obligatory health insurance as beneficiaries or as family members of the insured person. It covers the employed, the self-employed carrying out independent activity, persons carrying out agricultural or similar activities, beneficiaries of pensions and other rights pertaining pension and disability insurance, veterans, temporary unemployed persons, war and civil disabled persons, beneficiaries of social care rights etc.   The health protection uses revenues from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia for implementation of special programmes for preventive health care, protection from special diseases which are also a social problem, treatment of persons not being covered by the obligatory health insurance, and health care for special population groups. Participation of the aforesaid funds in the total revenues of health care is less than 1%. As revenues of health protection are deemed the funds paid by the enterprises and other organisations upon contracts concluded with medical institutions with regards to medical services for the employees thereof not being a part of the basic medical care, medical services being specific health care for employees working under special conditions, performing more strenuous jobs and duties or with regards to services for which they requested accessibility of health care under favourable conditions from the medical institutions,. Medical institutions realise additional revenues directly from the citizens who use their medical services but are not being health insured, from beneficiaries when using medical services not belonging to the basic service packages. There are no precise data on financial amounts being paid by the patients as for the aforesaid part. Medical institutions realise additional revenues from international assistance, donations of humanitarian organisations, donations and contributions of organisations and individuals from the country and abroad. There are also no precise data on the amount of the aforesaid revenues. The Health Insurance Law provides for the possibility of introduction of voluntary health insurance for medical services not being covered by the basic service packages of obligatory health insurance. The aforesaid insurance is carried out by the insurance companies established in accordance with the legislation on insurance, under conditions and using methods determined by the company introducing voluntary insurance. The aforesaid insurance has not been instituted in practice yet due to the wide package of medical services being covered by the obligatory health insurance, to the low standard of living of the population and to the insufficient interest of the beneficiaries and of the insurance companies so far. By the obligatory health insurance, medical services from the basic package are being provided to the beneficiaries at all levels of health care: at the level of primary health care, at the level of specialist-consultative health care and at the level of hospital health care, including tertiary level. It means that medical examinations, examinations with regards to diagnostics and treatment, pharmaceuticals from the list of medicines determined by the Fund, orthopaedic and other medical instruments are available to all beneficiaries at the health care level, when necessary for the health protection of the beneficiaries, as well as health care abroad. Medical services are provided by public and private medical institutions in the Republic of Macedonia. Pursuant to the Law, the Fund remits funds to the medical institutions upon contracts for providing medical services to beneficiaries. The contracts determine the type, the scope and the quality of medical services provided to beneficiaries, the compensation to be paid for the medical services contracted and the method of calculation and payment of the compensation for medical services. The aforesaid obligation for contracting applies to the private medical institutions also.  Social Protection and Social Insurance Pension and disability insurance, health care, as well as insurance for cases of unemployment, are being funded from contributions. The Budget of the Republic also participates in the funding of pension and disability insurance. The Budget provides funds for financing of pensions attained under more favourable conditions, as well as for covering of lack of funds of the Fund. The pension and disability insurance is obligatory, and is funded on the basis of solidarity of generations. The distribution of the funds for fully funded pension insurance shall be initiated during 2005. The funds collected on the basis of solidarity of generations are the Fund's revenues.   Social protection is funded by the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. The Budget finances the following rights: permanent financial benefit, social financial benefit, financial subsidy for assistance and care from a third person, -  health care for the permanent financial benefit users, persons (children or elderly) in foster care and in a social welfare institution, and the beneficiaries of financial benefit for assistance and care, in case they cannot be insured on another grounds, salary compensation for shortened working hours of parents caring for disabled children, one-off financial benefit and benefit in kind, accommodation in a foster family, accommodation in a social welfare institution, functioning of social welfare institutions, financial compensation for civil disabled persons, financial benefit for families with providers serving regular military service, 

The financing of the social welfare is being carried out on the basis of an annual Programme for social welfare being passed by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia.                                                      The provides a possibility that the social welfare funds may also be acquired by concluding a contract for lifetime support with a beneficiary, endowments, legacies, donations and payments by the beneficiaries for the social services for the purpose of establishing a Fund at the social work centre as a body using the funds for the necessities of the beneficiaries and for the development of the field. Management of the Fund is carried out by a Managing Board that involves also one representative of a municipality with purpose to protect the interests and improvement of rights of the citizens of a particular area. The aforesaid activities are in a stage of establishment and further development. There is no law on contributions for obligatory insurance in the Republic of Macedonia. The Law on Employment and Insurance in Case of Unemployment stipulates the sources and the method of financing the rights regarding unemployment insurance and the activities of the Employment Agency of the Republic of Macedonia. Sources for financing of the rights deriving from the unemployment insurance are the following: employment contribution being calculated and paid by employers from the gross salary of the employees;  the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia and  other sources.  The  stipulates that apart from the 15% of the total funds from the existing employment contribution aimed for financing of the aforesaid category of persons, funds are also provided from the following sources:  the value added tax and the custom duties paid by protective companies to the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia; endowments, legacies and  other sources.  Aiming at creation of better conditions and possibilities and stimulation of employment of disabled persons, a special Fund has been established within the Employment Agency, providing funds for employment, adaptation of working places intended for employment of disabled persons with an employer or as self-employed, and for supply of equipment and adaptation of premises with regards to employment of disabled persons.  b) 
The amendments of the Law on Pension and Disability Insurance (Official Gazette of the RM No. 24/00) simultaneously regulate the existing national pension and disability insurance, pension and disability insurance on the basis of solidarity of generations as part of the new pension system as well as the fundaments of the fully funded pension insurance.  The funds of the pay-as-you-go system are provided by the contributions and they are used for payment of the current pensions. The aforesaid pension system provides pensions defined according to a prior determined formula, and shall be financed by a contribution rate of 13,78%. The rights regarding pension and disability insurance are acquired in case of old age, disability and death. The obligatory fully funded pension insurance shall be financed with a capital component, and a previously defined contribution. The contribution rate for the second pillar amounts to 7,42% of the employee’s gross salary. The establishment and existence of a multi-layered pension system shall diversify the risks born by each system. The right of the citizens with regards to social welfare are based on the principles of social justice and solidarity, stipulated by the Constitutional provision that the State provides social protection for the citizens in accordance with the principle of social justice. c) 
The beneficiaries covered by the obligatory health insurance pay a contribution. The contribution rates are determined by the Decision on the rates, bases and amounts of the contributions for obligatory health insurance (Official Gazette of the RM Nos. 4/01, 50/01).

The amount of the compensation shall be 29% of the average monthly net salary per worker in the Republic of Macedonia paid during the last three months for the first category, and 25% for the second category. 
5. How are the various benefits and allowances delivered to the beneficiaries? How is the accessibility and efficiency of the system ensured? 
The procedures for attainment the rights and obligations related to health insurance are provided by the Law on General Administrative Procedure. The procedure is being initiated upon an application of the insured persons or a member of their family. The application shall be filed in writing. A regional service of the Fund or the Fund is obliged to bring a decision regarding the filed application and to deliver it to the applicant thereof. The applicant has a right to a complaint to the Minister of Health in the capacity of a second instance authority against the aforesaid decision of the Fund. The complaint shall be lodged within 15 days as of date of receipt of the decision. The Minister of Health shall bring a decision and deliver it to the applicant within two months as of date of filing of the complaint at the latest. The insured person shall be provided with a judicial protection of his rights against the decision of the Minister. Judicial protection is carried out by means of administrative proceedings before the Supreme Court of Macedonia in accordance with the Law on Administrative Disputes. The rights related to pension insurance and the rights related to disability insurance are different because they are acquired depending on the period and amount of investment in the funds for pension and disability insurance. The procedure is provided through the Technical Service of the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund, having regional units throughout the country. The procedure is provided by law and by- laws, which are transparent. The requests, i.e. the applications are not subject to fee. The efficiency of the system is provided by automation of business processes. Unemployed persons exercise their rights related to insurance in case of unemployment in accordance with the Law on Employment and Insurance in Case of Unemployment and with the regulations for general administrative procedure on grounds of applications filed at the Employment Agency where the unemployed person is registered. The procedure for attainment of rights during the period of unemployment shall be conducted and the decision shall be brought by the administrator of the Employment Centre where the unemployed person is registered, which means that the rights determined by the Law on Employment and Insurance in Case of Unemployment are dealt with by the Ministry competent for labour affairs in the first instance. A complaint against the aforesaid decision does not delay the execution thereof. The right to a financial allowance is being exercised by the unemployed person by means of filing an application at the Employment Centre where they are registered as unemployed. The right to a health insurance and to a pension and disability insurance of unemployed persons is realised ex officio. Preparing for employment (training, retraining or additional training) shall be carried out by an employer’s request if it contributes towards employment. The amendments of the Law on Employment and Insurance in Case of Unemployment from July 2004 allow for the possibility of the Employment Agency to provide services of training, retraining or additional training before termination of employment, short term training for employment of unemployed persons, training at work and training for participation of unemployed persons in public works, independently and through public advertisement, under conditions determined by contract between the Employment Agency and the training provider. The employment of disabled persons is regulated by the Law on Employment of Disabled Persons, the Statutes for Criteria and Method of Allocation of Assets from the Special Fund for Providing Conditions for Employment and Work of Disabled Persons, i.e. the method and conditions for training of unemployed disabled person is being determined for the purpose of employment and training for employment of employed disabled persons regarding practicing work of certain types in accordance with the needs of the employer and of the disabled person. Attainment of the aforesaid rights of the unemployed persons is being realised freely, promptly and accurately within the framework of the procedures determined by law. The competent Social Work Centre deals with the rights of social welfare beneficiaries in the first instance, according to the place of permanent or temporary residence of the beneficiary. The Ministry of Labour and Social Policy deals with complaints in the second instance procedures and the judicial protection is provided by means of initialising administrative proceedings before the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia. The Law on General Administrative Procedure applies for conducting of the aforesaid proceedings. Pursuant to the Law on Social Protection, Social Work Centres are responsible for the following affairs within their public authorisations: dealing with the rights related to social welfare regulated by the Law on Social Protection dealing with affairs regulated by the regulations related to family law proceeding upon affairs regulated by regulations related to penal law -  dealing with rights regulated by the Law on Child Care such as child benefit, special allowance and assistance for a newborn child.  Beneficiaries of social welfare may be the following persons: nationals of the Republic of Macedonia having permanent residence in the country, foreigners having permanent residence in the Republic of Macedonia -  nationals of the Republic of Macedonia without permanent residence in the country and foreigners without permit for permanent residence in the Republic of Macedonia exercise the rights related to social care under conditions determined by the Law on Social Protection and other laws. The procedure at the social work centre shall be initiated by filing of an application by a citizen, their legal representative, trustee or ex officio. The social work centre shall initiate a procedure ex officio upon its own initiative, upon an initiative of a citizen, another legal person or authority. Citizens also file other written applications during the procedure (complaints, objections etc.). The first admission of the citizens in the social work centres is realized by the social workers. Consideration of the application and carrying out of the procedure shall be made by a professional team using individual work with the applicant, their family, group work, family visits and other professional and administrative methods. Documents enclosed with the demand shall also be considered. An application of a citizen shall be dealt with by a decision within 30 to 60 days. The right to a financial social assistance shall be attained in accordance with the Law on Social Protection and the Decision on conditions, criteria, amount, method and procedure for determining and exercising of the right to a financial social assistance. The application shall be filed once a year and the beneficiary shall deliver documents for the family income once a trimester. Regarding the documents necessary, citizens obtain them at several institutions; therefore an institutional connection by means of an electronic network is necessary for the purpose of inter-departmental data exchange. Social work centres make inspections in the households four times a year. Data processing regarding acquirement and payment of the right to a financial social assistance in all the social work centres is carried out electronically. Thus the procedure for attaining and exercising of the aforesaid right is kept up to date and the services provided to the aforesaid beneficiaries are improved in many aspects. The decisions specify the amount of financial assistance and the period during which the beneficiary shall exercise the right. Pursuant to the decision brought, payment shall be made by mail delivery to the address of the beneficiary. The access to social welfare is easy and equal for all the citizens. The citizens obtain information on the rights thereof from the social work centres, from the web site of the Ministry, communications, public campaigns, booklets, media etc. The efficiency and the advancement of the social protection system is in correlation with the low initial financial basis of the domain and to the entire economic situation, poor possibilities of the state regarding budgetary funds to meet the needs of the beneficiaries. There is a need for an additional professional human resources in the social work centres and social welfare institutions in order to improve the quality of services for the beneficiaries. Improvement of the working equipment, introduction of electronic connections and software support is also needed, and the aforesaid issue is planned to be overcome by means of cooperation of the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy with the World Bank. The Supervision of the legality of the work of social work centres is carried out by the Ministry, and the supervision of the professionalism with regards to the work is carried out by the Institute for Advancement of Social Activities. 
6. Who is in charge of collecting and processing social data? Are there any specialised social research institutes? 
Social Protection Collection of data is primarily carried out by the social work centres (i.e. social services departments) as well as by social welfare institutions. Others also contribute to the social data collections, as: specialised medical organisations, educational institutions for persons with disabilities, courts, prosecutors’ offices and police. There are no specialised institutes for social welfare research in the Republic of Macedonia. Ministries and institutions determined by the law collect data, which are then finally being accumulated at the State Statistical Office.. 
The Ministry of Labour and Social Policy is competent for the information on the expenditures. According to the Law on Social Protection, the Institute for Advancement of Social Activities is in charge for collection and statistical procession of the data on number and type of beneficiaries and services provided and recorded by the social work centres and social welfare institutions. These information’s are collected once a year in a documented form and are entered in a database thereafter. The database is used for publishing of statistical data in a form of an annual report being delivered to the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, social work centres, social welfare institutions and other interested professional public. The State Statistical Office also collects data on social welfare which are being finally assembled in a National Statistics according to the particular phenomena. Official statistics is presented and published by the State Statistical Office. Regarding the need of researching the social phenomena and problems, the Institute for Sociological, Political and Legal Research also conducts surveys necessary for certain projects, and research reports on mass phenomena. The reports are used by the ministries, the media and the public. There are certain differences between the data published by the aforesaid institutions due to absence of an uniform methodology of data collection regarding separate social phenomena and due to the fact that there are no appropriate and unique regulations for recording of data on social welfare beneficiaries. The Employment Agency of the Republic of Macedonia is in charge for collection and processing of data regarding unemployed persons that are registered at the Employment Agency of the Republic of Macedonia. The Pension and Disability Insurance Fund of the Republic of Macedonia is in charge for collection and processing of data related to pension and disability insurance. The aforesaid competency of the Fund is regulated by the Law on Records of Insured Persons and Beneficiaries of Rights Regarding Pension and Disability Insurance (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 16/04). Except for the needs of the Fund, data on the insured persons, beneficiaries of the rights related to pension and disability insurance and forms for contribution payment are used also for statistical purposes. They are also exchanged with other institutions by virtue of agreements aiming avoidance of keeping parallel records. The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, the Law on Personal Data Protection, the Law on Birth, Marriage and Death Registries and other secondary legislation provide protection of personal data related to pension and disability insurance. The Health Insurance Fund is in charge of collection and processing of data related to health insurance. The Republic Institute for Medical Protection and 10 regional institutes for medical care are in charge for collection and processing of data related to medical care. The Republic Institute for Medical Protection can also practise the role of an institution specialised for carrying out of researches in the field of health care. 
C. Pensions 
Evaluation of the current system 

1. What is the public-private mix in your country? What role do mandatory, occupational and individual pension schemes play for income security in old age (different pillars of the systems)? Is there a universal system for the whole population? Are there any statistics on the composition of income in old age (social transfers, family support, labour income, additional private income)? 
In regard to the income security in the old age, a three-pillar public-private mix pension system has been adopted in the Republic of Macedonia. It is based on:  -  The first pillar – the obligatory pension and disability insurance based on generational solidarity; The second pillar - the compulsory fully funded pension insurance based on individual capital savings; The third pillar - the voluntary pension insurance based on individual components. The obligatory pension and disability insurance of the first and the second pillar, through which financial and social security for the old age are provided represent  compact elements, which can be seen through the following : -  Uniform conditions and eligibility criteria (circle of beneficiaries and other conditions for admission to insurance; Both the first and the second pillars are obligatory; Equal conditions for acquiring the right to age, disability and family pension; -  Correlation between two pillars in the determination of the pension: when pension from the first pillar is attained, an annuity is being attained at the same time, i.e., program drawing of the funds of the second pillar. With regards to security for the old age, the pension from the first pillar is being determined according to the formula established in advance, while the annuity from the second pillar according to the defined payment of contributions. The total amount of the pension from the first and from the second pillars (when it starts to be attained) is estimated to provide income in accordance with the obligations upon the Convention No. 102 of the International Labour Organisation. As for the third pillar, i.e., voluntary pension insurance, it shall be regulated by legislation in the future. Persons insured on grounds of employment and individuals carrying out professional activity independently (such as farmers) are covered by the first and the second pillars of the pension system of the Republic of Macedonia, in accordance with Article 27 of the Convention No. 102 of the International Labour Organisation with regards to the lowest minimum of protection in the field of social insurance. There are no analyses of the income at old age for all bases of social protection and social insurance. Within the framework of the social welfare system, 2.485 elder persons receive permanent financial assistance on grounds of inability for work and material insecurity, and 505 elder persons are accommodated in retirement homes. 
2. Describe the level and structure of benefits: the replacement rate, the pension distribution, adjustment and indexing of pensions and the issue of poverty among pensioners. Do you think that the pension system is adequate with regard to income security in old age, the intergenerational distribution and the reduction of poverty in old age?  
The obligatory pension and disability insurance enables the right to an age pension, disability pension on grounds of lost or reduced working ability and family pension attained after death of the insured person or the pension beneficiary.  Rights related to the pension insurance have been regulated by law, and they are distributed on equal grounds for all  workers, craftsmen, farmers, with the exception of certain categories of insured persons such as military and police insured persons etc. (as of the 1 of January, 1994). The number of pension beneficiaries at the end of a year and the number of employed persons (annual average) according to years are the following: Year Number of employed persons Chain  index  Number of pension beneficiaries Chain  index  1991 534.887 88,9  180.179 108,4 1992 531.083 99,3  193.294 107,2 1993 503.010 94,7  210.537 109,0 1994 468.632 93,2  216.834 103,0 1995 427.658 91,3  219.307 101,1 1996 403.820 94,4  222.727 101,6 1997 381.723 94,5  227.099 102,0 1998 370.869 97,2  232.216 102,3 1999 374.025 100,9 235.839 101,6 2000 367.162 98,2  241.221 102,3 2001 351.009 95,6  247.200 102,8 2002 332.728 94,8  249.421 100,9 2003 327.907 98,6  254.267 101,9 The number of pension beneficiaries has been increasing steadily until 1994, but since then the new Law on Pension and Disability Insurance contributed to a smaller rate of increase due to the changes of conditions for attainment of the right to a pension (cancelling of buying out of length of service, upgrade of the age limit). The number of age pension beneficiaries amounted to 133,008 out of the total number of pension beneficiaries at the end of 2003, i.e., 52,3%. The average age pension in December, 2003 amounted to 8.421,00 MKD, or the ratio thereof is 70,4% to the average salary in the Republic of Macedonia for December, 2003, and the average pension of all the pension beneficiaries amounts to MKD 7.346,00 or the ratio thereof is 61,4% to the average salary. The following table presents data on the number of pension beneficiaries and on the average pension according to types : 
Type of pension Number of beneficiaries Average pension Age 133.008 8.421,00 Disability    52.237 6.425,00 Family   69.022 5.971,00 Total  254.267 7.346,00 The average salary in the Republic of Macedonia amounted to 11.955,00 MKD in December, 2003. 
Ratio of the average pension to the average salary 0,020,040,060,080,0100,0120,0Age pensionDisability pensionFamily pension Average pensionin totalAverage salary
The ratio of the average pension (paid for December, 2003 and the average salary for December, 2003 in the Republic of Macedonia) is 61,4%. The Pension and Disability Insurance Fund also pays the pensions of 2,986 beneficiaries of military pensions taken over from the former Yugoslav Peoples’ Army and 6.773 beneficiaries of a minimal agricultural pension attained by virtue of the former Law on Age Insurance of Farmers from 1978. The table shows that the average age pension is higher than the average disability or family pension, because the age pension is attained at older age and with longer length of service. The average length of service for the age pension is 34 years and the average age for the pension beneficiaries who have attained the right to a pension in 2003 is 60 years, and as for the disability pension beneficiaries, the average length of service is 25 years and the average age is 51. Beneficiaries who have attained pension under more favourable conditions are the following : 
Type of rights  Number of beneficiaries  Average  pension Veterans from World War II  19.687 12.452,00 Police employees   3.381 18.628,00 Penitentiaries’ employees     570  8.195,00 Officers of the former Yugoslav People’s Army   2.986 13.769,00 Administration pensions    1.429 8.900,00 Public Administration Reform   3.038 10.566,00 The funds for payment of more favourable rights are provided by the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. 
Harmonisation (indexing of pensions) Concluding with 2003, harmonisation of the pensions was carried out as of 1 of January and as of  of July of the current year, according to the trend of the average salary of the employed persons in the Republic of Macedonia (except for the period from 1997 to 2000 when the harmonisation of the pensions was carried out according to the increase of the salaries of the non-industrial employees which was increasing more slowly than the increase of total salaries, influencing the harmonisation of the pensions) as follows : as of 1 of January, according to the ratio of trends of the average salary of the workers in the Republic of Macedonia paid in December the previous year, to the average salary paid in June the same year, and -  As of 1 of July according to the ratio of trends of the average salary of the workers in the Republic of Macedonia paid in June the current year, to the average salary paid in December the previous year. harmonisation of the pensions is carried out for shorter terms in case that the growth, i.e., fall of the salaries is higher than 5 % as for one or more months comparing with the month for which the last harmonisation was carried out. During the period since 1996 to 2003, the rate of growth of nominal salaries was higher than the percentage of harmonisation of the pensions, while the ratio of life expenses to the salaries and to the harmonisations had a lower rate, and it can be seen in the following table : Date of harmonisation Salary Life expenses Pensions Salary Index Expenses Index pensions Index  1.7.1996  100,00 100,00 100,00 1.1.1997 1,93  0,78 101,93  100,78 1.7.1997 0,50 2,60 102,44 102,60 100,78 1.1.1998 1,34  - 103,81  100,78 1.7.1998 3,40 -0,01 107,34 102,50 100,78 1.1.1999 3,00  1,94 110,56  102,73 1.7.1999 -1,70 -0,7 8,00 108,68 101,78 110,95 1.1.2000 5,20  1,29 114,33  112,38 1.7.2000 2,10 5,80 0,58 116,73 107,68 113,04 1.1.2001 2,80  1,79 120,00  115,06 1.7.2001 -0,10 5,50 119,88 113,60 1.1.2002 0,69  0,63 120,71  115,78 1.7.2002 5,90 1,8 5,90 127,83 116,80 122,62 1.1.2003 2,97  2,97 131,63  126,26 1.7.2003 2,68 1,2 2,68 135,15 118,20 129,64 
Poverty Due to the fact of lower percentage of harmonisation of pensions than the growth of salaries, certain decrease of the average pension comparing to the average salary happened during certain years. But, the total harmonisation of pensions is 29,64% and, comparing to the salaries growth amounting to 35,15%, it is smaller for only 4,1% and the proportion between the average pension and the average salary amounting to 61,4% is maintained. The following table shows the structure of pension beneficiaries according to groups : Total Age pension  Disability pension Family pension Pension amount Number of beneficiaries Average pension Number of beneficiaries Average pension Number of beneficiaries Average pension Number of beneficiaries Average pension

Among the beneficiaries with low pensions, the majority are beneficiaries who had attained the right to a pension with a shorter length of service and with low bases for insurance (agriculture, textile industry). Persons who had been employed abroad, and had attained a proportionate part of pension in the Republic of Macedonia depending on length of service and receive the other part of pension from foreign insurers, also belong to the total number of beneficiaries of low pensions. In order to protect the beneficiaries of pension receiving low pensions calculated according to length of services and salaries, the lowest amount of pension has been introduced. This guarantees the insured person an amount of pension higher than the pension determined according to length of service and salaries paid. This right is not conditioned by the financial status of the pension beneficiary, and it is provided for all the pension beneficiaries whose pension determined according to length of service and salaries are lower than the minimum amount of pension. The lowest amount of pension is based on the principle of social justice and the amount thereof depends on the length of contribution paid expressed through the length of service. It means that longer length of services draws higher amount to be deemed as the lowest amount of pension. The lowest amount of pension is from at least 3.856,00 MKD up to 5.500,00 MKD. With regards that a higher amount of pension is paid for a longer length of service, the beneficiaries are stimulated to work longer. At the end of 2003, the number of beneficiaries of the lowest amount of pension was 89.910 or 35,4% of the total number of pension beneficiaries. As for the secured income for old age, although big number of pension beneficiaries receive low pension, it may be concluded that the pension beneficiaries receive their pensions regularly, and the payment of pensions has not been late since 1993. Namely, pensions are paid in two groups as follows: the first group of pensions covers 88% of the total number of pension beneficiaries who are paid for the previous month on the 16 day of the current month at the latest, and the second group covers 12% of pension beneficiaries who receive a higher amount of pension and who are paid for the previous month around the 25 day of the current month. In accordance with the Law on Social Protection and with the Decision on conditions, criteria, amount, method and procedure for establishment and attainment of the right to a social financial assistance, a household whose member is a pension beneficiary of an amount lower than the amount of the social financial assistance may apply for a social financial assistance as a socially insecure household, according to the fulfilment of the criteria. 
3. Describe current problems of financing the pension system in your country.  
Current pension and disability insurance represents a pay- as- you- go system, based on generational solidarity, i.e., the current employees are paying the contribution for pension and disability insurance which is distributed to those who are currently retired. As for pensions attained under more favourable conditions, funds are provided by the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. Funds for coverage of the deficit of the Fund are also provided from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. Total expenditures for pension and disability insurance in 2003 amounted to MKD 27.764,35 millions, participating with 10,3% in the gross domestic product. Revenues from the contributions amounted to 17.654,84 millions MKD or 63,7% of the total revenues of the Fund, and 7.740,95 millions MKD or 27,9% of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. Financial problems are not so prominent, because numerous measures for improvement of the financial situation of the Fund were undertaken during the previous period. Namely, the rate of contributions was increased from 18 to 20% in 1993, and a participation amounting to 9,18% of the excise tax for the oil derivatives has been introduced, as an additional finance for the Fund, all of which have contributed towards increase of the Fund total revenues.  As for the part of expenditures rationalisation, by virtue of the Law on Pension and Disability Insurance (“Official Gazette of the RM” Nos. 80/93, 3/94, 14/95, 71/96, 32/97, 24/00,96/00, 50/01, 85/03, 50/04 and 04/05) in force since the 1 of January, 1994, numerous restrictive measures for attainment of right to a pension were taken (increase of the age limit, cancellation of the buying out of length of service, decrease of the substitute rate, determining of the pension base out of the salaries paid during the whole length of service), significantly contributing to the decrease of the new flow of pensioners. Amendments of the Law on Pension and Disability Insurance (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 14/95) omitted some of the rights related to another fields paid by the Fund (compensation on grounds of reduced working ability, assistance and care for another person), thus making the pension system more consistent and effective regarding to the purposes thereof. Aiming improvement of collecting payments of contributions, by virtue of the Law on Amendments of the Law on Pension and Disability Insurance (“Official Gazette of the R” No. 85/03), amendments of the Law were made providing the Fund greater competencies related to bringing decisions regarding unpaid contributions and carrying out collecting of payment of contribution by force. However, due to the general demographic tendencies and the high rate of unemployment, a new multi pillar system has been introduced, based both on generational solidarity (first pillar) and on mandatory fully funded second pillar. The implementation of this new pension system in the practise is envisaged to begin at the mid of 2005. The Fund shall be a competent authority collecting contributions for the first pillar and transferring the obligatory fully funded pension insurance in a single procedure. Data related to payment of contributions shall be obtained monthly, individually for every insured person, contributing to the effective collecting of contribution and enabling exchange of data with other institutions. 
4. What are the economic incentives set by the pension system with regard to labour market participation, employment policies? Are there any other incentives? 
The economic incentives within the Macedonian pension system expressed through the organisation of the pension system have a positive impact on the labour market both from the aspect of the insured persons, and the system as a whole. Seen from the insured person’s aspect, the positive impact on the labour market is expressed through the relation between the length of service, earnings and the contributions paid during length of service, on one side, and the accumulated pension on the other side. Namely, as for the first pillar (pay-as-you-go), pension is calculated in accordance with the salaries paid during the whole length of service. As for the second pillar (obligatory and fully funded), the pension depends on the contributions accumulated and the incomes from the investments attained. That is a stimulus for bigger participation of the beneficiaries in the labour market, i.e., longer work record provides bigger pensions. Looking at the organisational impact on the labour market from the point of view of the system as a whole, the reform significantly contributes to increase of the effectiveness of the Macedonian labour market, as it is expected that in the long term the contributions will be decreased which will directly contribute to the decrease of the labour costs. Therefore, it is logical to expect that such phenomena will influence the participation of labour force, which means decrease of unemployment, as well as influencing the transfer of the employees from the non-formal to the formal sector of the economy. The pension system impacts the labour and its productivity, contributes to the accumulation of the capital and its allocation, and influences the development of the economy as a whole. Therefore, the economic incentives are expected to be especially present in the new pension system of the Republic of Macedonia having capital component, which will start functioning in 2005. The obligatory fully funded pension insurance will influence the increase of savings and strengthen the power for investments as well as stimulate the capital market and the economy growth in the country. Consequently, it will reflect itself in mobility of the labour market from a long-term point of view. 
5. Are there certain groups excluded from the system (coverage)? Is there a possibility of ‘opting out’? If so, are there any problems caused by the exclusion of certain groups? Do you consider the system as equitable with regard to gender equality and other groups of the population? 
There are no groups of population excluded from the pension system of the Republic of Macedonia, nor there is any inequality with regards to it. All the employed persons having established employment or performing activities subject to the obligatory pension and disability insurance are covered by the system for the whole period having the aforesaid status. For the purpose of providing continuity of obligatory pension and disability insurance, there is a type of voluntary insurance - extended insurance within the first pillar. Persons and beneficiaries engaged for certain public works (in actions for rescuing or protection from natural disasters, in organised youth or other actions, at training when summoned by the defence authorities and assisting to the police authorities) are covered by the obligatory pension and disability insurance (right to a pension) (“Official Gazette of the RM” Nos. 80/93, 3/94, 14/95, 71/96, 32/97, 24/00, 96/00, 50/01, 85/03, 50/04 and 04/05). Equality is provided regarding obligatory pension and disability insurance of every individual without any prejudices related to sex or ethnic origin. The aforesaid equality is attained by: equal conditions for retirement, -  equal conditions for payment of contributions and equal percentages of payment of contributions for all the insured persons having same capacity, equal conditions for attainment of right to pension, except for the conditions related to the age limit for age pensions for women being two years lower than the age limit for men, -  equal method of calculation of pensions (for same salary and same length of service- same pension), equal conditions for payment of pension in the Republic of Macedonia and abroad. 
6. Does the public consider your system as transparent and administratively effective? Does the system meet general acceptance in the population? 
Prior to the establishment of the three-pillar pension system, a series of public opinion surveys were conducted with a significant public support . During the adoption of the legal project for the pension system reform, various public appearances, workshops, and media campaigns were organised. The Trade Union of the Republic of Macedonia was also involved in the aforesaid activities. The methods for conducting public opinion surveys in 2001 included : -  basic and periodical surveys, with a surveying sample of at least 1,200 persons, with a geographic coverage of the whole country, as well as balanced coverage of sex and age; focus groups with a geographic coverage of the whole country, as well as balanced coverage of sex and age, and in-depth interviews with the public opinion creators. It might be said that the public considers the existing pay-as-you-go system insufficiently transparent and administratively slow. The lack of transparency was pointed out in the irregularity of information on the payment of contributions by the employers, and in most cases that information is obtained immediately prior to retirement. Regarding the efficiency of the administration, according to the public opinion, there is a need for quicker procedures for attainment of rights related to pension and disability insurance. That is confirmed by the results of the survey, where the transparency of the existing system was evaluated with 3.34 (on the scale of 1 to 5) according to the Basic Survey conducted in July, 2001, and a there has been a negative trend thereafter according to Periodical Survey in November, 2001, when the transparency scored 3.21 points. With regards to the administrative efficiency of the system, the results from the same period indicated a score of 3.38 as for July, 2001, and of 3.0 in November, 2001. The reform of the pension system is planned to provide much higher degree of transparency as well as more efficient administration thereof by virtue of introduction of fully funded pension insurance (the second pillar). These are the highlights of the conducted public opinion surveys, apart from the aforesaid results: -  51% of the respondents believe that the pension insurance shall be improved by the introduction of private pension funds (Periodical Survey, November, 2001 - increase of 9% of the percentage of respondents believing in the improvement in comparison with the Basic Survey from July, 2001) -  65% of the respondents expect that the reformed pension system will provide higher pensions, sure and regular payment thereof and more secure pension system (Periodical Survey, November, 2001) 60% of the respondents have declared they would participate in the reformed pension system (Periodical Surveys, November, 2001: increase of 6.5% of the positive attitude in comparison with the Basic Survey from July, 2001) -  about 70% of the respondents have a positive attitude to the reformed  pension system (Periodical Survey, November, 2001, increase of 25% of the positive attitude in comparison with the Basic Survey from July, 2001) -  Half of the respondent’s responded they knew who is the owner of the funds in the private pension funds (Periodical Survey, November, 2001). The following conclusions regarding the structure of the total number of respondents were pointed out: a) the population segment between the ages of 25 and 44 is most aware of the reforms; b) there is a greater involvement of the urban population; c) there is a greater involvement of the male population; d) there is a smaller involvement and an element of mistrust with the population at the age of 55 and older; e) younger population, at the ages between 18 to 24, is not so informed, but has a positive attitude to the reforms; f) there is a positive trend regarding attitudes to the issue of the reform of the pension system and the solutions proposed. Evaluation of future challenges 

7. Assess the financial sustainability of the system (of each pillar) with regard to demographic, economic and social changes. 
The Macedonian pension system is still in transition, because the age limit for attaining the right to age pension has been increased, i.e. from 63 to 64 for men, and from 60 to 62 for women. By 2007, the age limit for attainment of right to age pension shall gradually increase for women. The calculation period for determining of pensions has been increased, i.e. the pension shall be determined from salaries received throughout the years of service (parameter pension system reforms carried out in 1994). The mentioned future changes shall positively influence the ratio of insured employees against pensioners, as well as the revenues and expenditures of the pension insurance system.  Since 1985, the number of employees is constantly decreasing, which has a negative impact on the contribution rate for pension and disability insurance Thus, the ratio of insured employees against pensioners in 1993 was 2,4:1; in 2000 it fell to 1,5:1 while in 2002 and 2003, the ratio has been 1,3 :1. The pension system sustainability needs an insured employees against pensioners ratio of 3:1. The three-pillar pension system shall overcome the problems caused by unfavourable demographic movements, which quite negatively influences the one-pillar system. The multilayered pension system provides long-term solvency of the pension system. Reducing the volume of the state pension system for the account of introducing a fully funded system shall reduce the obligations of the state system in the long-term, thereby decreasing the public expenditure by lowering pension expenses. Prior to the establishment of the new pension system, several projections had been developed on trends adhering to the pension and disability insurance (the one-pillar system), then projections, i.e. simulations of the situation with an introduced second pillar (individual fully funded saving). Parameters, such as: the influence of age pension, the method of pension calculation, different variants of pension alignment, the future trends as well as other economic and demographic parameters were taken into account. All of these projections were used for the selection of the final pension system model. Based on various types of scenarios of demographic and economic assumptions, the Actuarial Unit at the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund of the Republic of Macedonia (PDIF) has prepared projections on the future financial sustainability of the PDIF, which also reflects the fiscal influence of the mentioned factors on the solidarity system with pay-as-you-go financing, i.e. the first pillar of the pension system.

During the transition, the existing one-pillar system and the new two-pillar system shall function simultaneously. The new system shall be obligatory for the new workers on the labour market, but optional for the insured persons that are already part of the workforce. The reform parameters are set out in such a way that insured people with less than 5 years of length of service shall be motivated to enter the new system, the insured persons with length of service from 5-10 years shall be less motivated for the new system, whereas the insured persons with length of service over 10 years shall have a strong motivation to remain in the existing one-pillar system. Because of this, only young employees are expected to join this system, whereas the older workers will possibly remain in the one-pillar system. The calculations indicate that at the start, between 45.000 and 90.000 insured persons shall transfer into the new system, or approximately 12,5%-25% of the total number of insured persons. Gradually, the workforce participation in the new system will grow as all employees with the first employment shall be obliged to enter the new system in the future. Practically, by 2035, the total workforce shall be participating in the two-pillar system. The first pensioners according to this new system will appear around 2025 (assuming that the workers up to 40 years of age have entered the new system). Gradually between 2025 and 2065, the composition of pensioners will change from 100% pensioners from only one pillar system towards 50% pensioners in both pillars and finally at the end of the estimated year the new pillar system will be composed of 100% of all pensioners. After 2065, all pensioners will receive their pension from the newly introduced two pillar system, by which the transition will be completed.  The chart below shows the transition costs against the GDP ratio depending on the number of beneficiaries to transfer to the two-pillar system.

It may be noted that the costs in the scenario are higher where there is a bigger number of insured persons transferring to the second pillar at the beginning, in which case the duration of costs is shorter as the effects of the second pillar are felt faster. For example, in the basic scenario (19.0%), the highest costs are 2,0% of the GDP for transfer of 67.000  insured persons. In contrast, in the scenario where 88.000 insured persons (25%) transfer, the highest costs are 2,2% of the GDP, whereas in the scenario where 44.000  insured persons (12,5%) transfer, the costs are 1,7% of the GDP. The initial participation of insured persons who will transfer to the new system influences the size and duration of costs, but the total current value of transition costs is same in the three types of scenario. In continuation, there are tables which show some of the projected results.

Economic Assumptions During the next decades, increased economic growth is expected, due to which the reduction of the unemployment rate, greater increase of GDP and salaries are also anticipated. The unemployment te is estimend of the projected period. During the whole projection period, a constant real salary increase of 2% is assumed. Pension Policy Changes 
The retirement age gradually increases to 64 (for men) and 62 (for women), which shall influence the he replacement rate decreases to 72% gradually, in a period of 40 he amendments on the Law on Fully Funded Pension Insurance (Official Gazette of the RM No. ontribution payments for the second pillar in a period of 6 months from the 13,78% contribution rate for the first pillar  entering the new system, whereas the expected replacement rate of the second pillar mainly depends on the private pension funds rring to multi-pillar system is the assumption on the number of insured persons to enter the new system and the speed of their entry. It is assumed that the actual division of contribution art in July, 2005 for all insured persons joining the second pillar. As to the number of insured persons entering the new system, it is estimated that 19% of the labour force voluntarily) during the first year. The most important factors for the assessment were gender, age at the moment of transfer of insured person, and the length of e time for accumulation and investment of funds in the second pillar. On the other hand, the insured persons with greater length of service deciding to  new system. number of new pensioners. Tyears. The method of pension indexation is changing.

The contribution rate shall be: 7,42% contribution rate for the second pillar In relation to the replacement rate, and due to the pension policy changes, the replacement rate is expected to be 30% from the first pillar for insured personsinvestment revenues. One of the most significant assumptions for assessment of transition costs that occur when transfebetween the two pillars shall stshall enter the new system (obligatorily or service. Younger insured persons have mortransfer to the new system shall have only up to 5 years of service considered for calculation of the pension. This means that if insured persons move to the new system, they shall have to denounce part of their rights because of which the length of service also becomes a significant factor for deciding to move to theThe introduction of the second pillar, i.e. the occurrence of transition costs, shall not affect the income of the Fund because the funds’ deficit shall be covered from the national budget, according to the Law. Actuarial Projections The age structure of a given population is an important demographic factor for the workforce formation. The ratio between the working age population (from 18 to 59 years of age) and the old population (over 60 years of age) is an indicator for the aging of the population.

population increases 2100. This means that in the future approximately one third of the from the current 25.5% to 64.4% in 2060 and decreases to 51.5% in population above 18 will be old population..  For a pay-as-you-go system the ratio of insured persons against pensioners is very important because the contributions of the current insured persons are used for pension payment to the current pensioners. The ratio of insured persons against pensioners, decreases in long-term from the current 1,4:1 to 1,0  to 1. This trend of the ratio means that an increasingly smaller on shall pay for an increasingly greater number of pensioners. Such a ratiobased only on pay-as-you-go shall have problems functioning, as the ratiohat the system is not sustainable.  The pension expenditures as percentage of the GDP are an indicator e is the pension system of a country. In 2004, the pension expenditures were 9,5% of the GDP.  The expenditures during the projection period gradually decrease due to the reduction of the replacement rates for insured persons remaining in the first pillar and due to the reduced volume of pensions for sured persons transferring to the two-pillar system, mainly due to the percentage of 30% for the replacement rate of the first pillar for these beneficiaries, and the provision for compensation of the lly increases because the labour force participation in the second pillarse and the contributions outflow to the second pillar shall be higher. Aftedecreasing because of the appearance of the first pensioners from the tworeduce the pension expenditures –because of the lower pensions that theyst pillar, and a greater part, shall be paid from the second pillar. There is a sld 2060 due to the influence of the demographic factors, especially becausertility rate during the first decades in the 21 century, which reflects in a lower number of insured persons in this period. Furthermore, due to maturing of the two-pillar system, when all pensioners receive pensions from both pillars, pension expenditures decrease in the first pillar, and the deficit decreases, too. 9. What are the main challenges for the old-age security of your country in the future?  The longer people live, the longer they can work and enjoy the opportunity for higher pension that number of insured pers indicates that a syste itself is an indicator tof how expensivrest of the pension from the second pillar. The projections of the reformed pension system show that the Fund shall have a deficit which will significantly decrease in long-term, in contrast to the projections of the unreformed system which show continuing deficit growth and possible insolvency of the Fund.

Describe the discussion and status of planned reforms. What are the main political positions? What is the expected impact of these reforms?  
The debate on the planned reforms took place in two separate periods. The first period relates to the  influence and consequences of the demographic changes in the population, as well as the influence of the economic transition period on the system. Right from the start, when out that the payment of their current pensions should not come into question because of the pension uring the second period of public debate, the pension reform legal solutions were presented. The ent companies, the requirements for custodian guard of the pension fund, the investment of funds from the pension funds, i.e. the instruments where these funds could be will be disbursed as lifetime annuity or through programmed withdrawal, upon member’s choice. The funds on the individual accounts are personal property of the beneficiaries. The basic goals are identified through the provision of: Insurance of the short-term and long-term solvency of the Pension and Disability Fund of the Republic of Macedonia, Maximum security and minimum risk, Guaranteeing just pensMeeting these goals will result in positive effects for the functioning of the pension system and the economy as a whole. The additional goals of the establishment of private pension funds will economic growth in the country. The fully funded pensita market. If the capital market is at low level of development, the inveate pension funds may influence the increase of the volume and turnover of the capital market.  first stage of adoption of the legislation during which more attention was paid to clarification of the reasons for reform, thecreating the legal solutions, union organisations and pensioners were included, as well as the Chamber of Commerce and the press, in order to educate them on the reasons for the reform, the model, and the benefits from the future pension system. The position of the Association of the Trade Unions was that reforms were necessary, but not now, as conditions need to be created. Namely, for the reform, the Union approved only a first and possibly a third pillar, without increasing the age limit as pension requirement. The position of pensioners was that they supported the reform, and pointinsystem reform.  open discussion resulted in incorporating certain comments and recommendations in the final adoption of the Law. A debate was also organized with the Management Committee of the Pension and Disability Fund of the Republic of Macedonia, because the new law assigns new functions to the Fund in the implementation of the compulsory fully funded pension insurance.   Within the debate on the Draft Law on Compulsory Fully Funded Pension Insurance, the discussions at the meetings with the banks, insurance companies, and the Ombudsman were extensive, and the participants were mostly interested in the practical implementation of the solutions given in the Law. There were questions and discussion followed on the set out requirements for founders of pension funds manageminvested. In this stage, the attention was also directed towards guarantees and security of investment, i.e. how to protect from insecure investment. The final debate was held with the employers of the bigger enterprises. Most of the questions and discussions were about simplification of certain notions and solutions given in the Law. For this target roup, it was of special importance to point out that by introducing appropriate software for data ll generation were also pointed out.  public support for the eed of the pension system reform which will provide safe pension system for all generations.  sful functioning of the new ension system, especially of the second pillar, which is a novelty in the system. The PDIF, which will s from e second pillar to the private pension funds members, has already developed a design for the new unds management companies, to improve the fully nded pension insurance, and protect the interests of the pension funds’ members. In order to APAS usiness processes has been developed, and the software specifications are being designed. nsioners, i.e. guaranteeing of just pensions for all generations; Gradual reform in order to have easier transition to the new system; arency of the work in this type of pension system is important feature because any individual will know how much funds are available on his account at any time, where are their collection and processing at the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund, it will be necessary to deliver the same software to employers, so that the data processing could be unified. As this reform mostly concerns the younger population, presentations and debates were organized at the University of St. Cyril and Methodius, where special emphasis was put on the part of pension insurance funds which shall be provided on the basis of its capitalisation.  In addition the benefits of guaranteeing just pensions for aDuring the reform, the media representatives were actively involved in the public debates, clearly expressing their understanding for the need and the model of the reform, as well as for the transparent approach to the public. In general, it may be concluded that during the public discussions there wasIn terms of the current status of the reform, after the adoption of the legal framework, intensive activities have been undertaken on the institutional preparation for succescarry out the unified payment of contributions for both pillars and the allocation of contributionprocesses and software specifications. At present, the software application design is being developed. An Agency for supervision of the fully funded pension insurance has been established in order to supervise the work of the pension fprepare the system, the Macedonian Pension Agency for Supervision (MAPAS) has brought secondary legislation on additional organisation of certain system areas, a design of MMAPAS has announced an international public tender for selection of two pension funds management companies, which is underway. Business processes at the National bank of the Republic of Macedonia are being developed, too. The National Bank will have the role of the custodian guard of the pension funds in the first five years. The Ministry of Labour and Social Policy administers the financial support by the World Bank on financing all necessary preparations for implementation of the reformed pension system. This Ministry is also working on the preparations for development of public campaign strategy, which is a very important component for public education and information. Expected Impact -  The multi-pillar pension system helps building a long-term solvent pension system. Namely, by reducing the volume of the state pension system on the account of introduction of a fully funded system, the long-term obligations for pension payment of the state system will decrease, and it will simultaneously decrease the public expenditures for the amount of the pensions. From the aspect of an individual, this system provides better security because the pensions shall be funded from two, i.e. three sources. Thus, the diversification of risks shall be accomplished, every system shall carry its own risk; -  Balancing of the interests of the future generations of pensioners to the interests of the current peThe transpassets invested, and what profit is made from the investments; rease of efficiency of the Macedonian se, which  occurrence to affect the

The peof Macedonia exists for almost 50 years, and it has been grain ecoincreasnumeronumbeother, wf the M No. 80/93) which has been in force from the 1st of January, 1994. This Law contains several ntinued, in order to provide a olvent and stable pension system. The positive effects of all measures taken in continuity are felt mptions when designing the policy. In the projected eriod, relatively stable financial condition is expected in mid-term due to the expected influence of Under such conditions, the Macedonian pension system will become permanently insolvent and cannot pay out the pensions. The pension system could maintain The establishment of private pension funds is expected to have additional influence on the population savings increase in long-term, which will further strengthen the investment power and the growth of economy in the country, and can influence the increase of the volume and turnover on the capital market; In the long run, the pension reform will reflect on the inclabour market, which is currently in disproportion between the labour supply and demand. In the long term, the reform is expected to provide conditions for contribution decreawill reduce the labour price. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect thisincrease of labour participation, which means unemployment reduction and influence on the transfer of workers from the informal to the formal economic sector.

nsion system of the Republic du lly developing and upgrading with time. The socio-economic changes and unfavourable trends nomy from the beginning of the transition to market economy have been a cause of an ed number of enterprises working with losses; having had redundancy discharges and us bankruptcy procedures. Those were the main reasons that influenced the reduction of the r of active beneficiaries on one hand, and an increase of the number of pensioners on the hich led to a lower ratio between beneficiaries and pensioners. All of these problems in the pension system culminated in 1993, when the greatest rationalisation was made by the passing of the new Law on Pension and Disability Insurance (Official Gazette orestrictive measures for attaining the right to pension, among which the most significant are the increase of age limit from 60 to 63 years for men, and from 55 to 60 years for women; calculation of the pension base from salaries of all years of service instead of the most favourable 10 years; percentage decrease for pension calculation from 85% to 80%; elimination of the buying-off length of service as a possibility for early retirement, etc. During 1995, 1996, and 1997 the restrictive policy for this insurance cosince 1997, and now, when a balance of revenues and expenditures is established, the enhanced influx of pensioners slowed down and reduction of pension expenditures, as part of the public expenditures, has been achieved.  The specified parametric reforms showed results in short-term, but mostly in mid-term. Therefore, there was a need for further measures based on long-term actuarial projections of revenues and expenditures taking into account the expected demographic and economic development trends and their variations, depending on the various assuthe economic development, but then deficit will occur, and it will permanently increase in long-term because of the aging of the population. Hence, it may be concluded that the Republic of Macedonia, similar to the other countries with such pension systems, will face demographic changes that will negatively affect the system due to the fall of the fertility rate and the greater life expectancy, which change the population structure. the fiscal balance through increase of the contribution rate, through pension amount reduction or through increase of taxes. These solutions could return the system balance in short-term, but in long-term, the system will not be efficient and solvent. In order to overcome, i.e. to meet the specified expected conditions, there was a need of a thorough reform of the pension and disability insurance in our country. Therefore, the Law on Additions and Amendments to the Law on Pension and Disability Insurance (Official Gazette of the RM No. 24/00) made further rationalisation of the first pillar and at the same time a legal framework was designed of a multi-pillar pension system. In the parametric reforms, the following significant restrictions were made:  Increase of the age limit for retirement – 64 years for men, 62 years for women (with gradual increase until 2007) and minimum 15 years of service; Introduction of a unique requirement for retirement - only by age; cal way. Namely, the structure of the future multi-pillar pension system is based on three types (pillars) of insurance, as follows: generation solidarity (first pillar). This  and disability insurance in art of the age pension, disability sion amount shall be compensated; -  Obligatory fully funded pension insurance (second pillar). This insurance will pay part of the e for a long-term, stable, and solvent pension system in the Republic of Macedonia. In the dsolutionprepareded pension insfunds mmpanies). The establishment of MAPAS is of great importance because it will regrance. MAPAS has been established in uly, 2002, by appointing a Director by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. MAPAS is an  of Macedonia. In order to meet its obligations, physical and technical resources are necessary, as well as trained personnel, which is an on-going activity. Each pension e years from the beginning of the compulsory fully funded pension insurance MAPAS has a right to prescribe additional limitations Reduction of the replacement rate from 80% to 72%, and Change of the pension indexation method. The Law on Compulsory Fully Funded Pension Insurance (Official Gazette of the RM No. 29/02) regulates the provision of financial and social security based on capitalisation of funds in a more methodiObligatory pension and disability insurance based on type of insurance will provide exercising of the rights to pensioncase of age, disability, and death, which means that ppension, family pension, and the lowest penage pension;  Voluntary fully funded pension insurance (third pillar). These changes are expected to providuration of this thorough pension system reform, several global challenges have appeared, but s to cope with them, too. The first challenge relates to capacity building in terms of dness of the institutional infrastructure (Agency for Supervision of fully funura ce - MAPAS, custodian guard, Pension and Disability Insurance Fund - PDIF, and pension anagement coula e, supervise, and develop the fully funded pension insuindependent legal entity, with its own budget. When there is a lack of budget, it is funded by the Budget of the Republicfund will be managed by a separate pension fund management company which has to have strong capital, good management, and experience to be able to provide security of the pension funds members. The security and protection of members’ funds will be achieved, above all, by separating those funds from the funds of the companies managing the pension funds, keeping them on a separate account at the custodian guard of the pension funds. The PDIF, which will carry out the unified collection of contributions for both pillars and the distribution of the contributions for the second pillar for the beneficiaries of the private pension funds, is going through an administrative reform in order to prepare itself for carrying out these functions. Another challenge is coping with the insufficiently developed financial and capital market in the Republic of Macedonia, in order to have enough instruments for absorption of the pension funds. This challenge may be resolved by: diversification of funds of the pension funds in several types of financial instruments, and by the possibility to invest 20% of the funds outside the country, which are requirements for investment of the pension funds, prescribed by the Law on Compulsory Fully Funded Pension Insurance (Official Gazette of the RM Nos. 29/02, 85/03, and 40/04) and the Rulebook on pension funds investment; the process of creating new state bonds for which the Government of the Republic of Macedonia developed and adopted a Strategy for State Securities Market Development and an Action Plan. During the first fivrelated to investment of pension funds, in accordance with the financial market trends. The funding of transitional costs is also one of the major challenges for which a solution should be found. In addition to this, the model of the reform does not encourage entry of numerous employees in the system at the beginning, in order to have bearable path of transition costs. For correct assessment and monitoring of costs, an actuarial model has been developed in co-operation with foreign consultants. The model was a basis to develop a plan for funding of transition costs.

The health insurance system is under the influence of the reforms in other areas of social protection. The Law on Health Insurance provides a possibility for establishment of insurance for the whole population of the Republic of Macedonia, either as beneficiaries or as members of their families. This includes employed persons, persons performing independent activity, persons engaged in agriculture and similar occupations, pension users, and beneficiaries of other rights to pension and disability insurance, temporarily unemployed persons, veterans, war and civil invalids, beneficiaries of social rights, etc. Citizens without health insurance may voluntarily join the obligatory health insurance, and thus provide for themselves and the members of their families the rigThere are no plans for extending or reducing the scope of rights to health insurance.

Having into consideration the fact that the reforms in the other social protection systems will give the expected results in long-term, the social protection is focused on the reforms in order to increase its resources.

The reforms on social inclusion of certain categories of socially excluded persons will be carried out in accordance with the Memorandum on Joint Inclusion. This document is in preparation.

TIRANA, Albania -- Lawmakers gathered on Wednesday (July 4th) evening for the third round of presidential elections. But after lengthy debates -- continuing well past midnight -- failed to result in specific candidates for president, Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli adjourned the session. Lawmakers will meet again on Thursday evening to continue discussions. Early elections would be called if they fail to agree on a candidate in the third round. The ruling Democratic Party and the main opposition Socialist Party have rejected each other's nominees so far. Incumbent President Alfred Moisiu's term expires on July 24th.

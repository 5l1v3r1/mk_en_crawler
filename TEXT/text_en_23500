ANKARA, Turkey -- Media and experts criticised police for failing to take necessary precautions in an anti-terror operation in Istanbul on Monday (April 27th) that left three people dead -- including a 16-year-old civilian -- and seven injured. The operation in the residential neighbourhood of Bostanci turned into a six-hour-long shootout after police raided a safe house belonging to the far-left organisation Revolutionary Headquarters. A neighbourhood teenager, a high-ranking police officer and terror suspect Orhan Yilmazkaya all perished in the shooting, while six policemen and a TV cameraman suffered gunshot wounds. The casualties raised questions regarding the planning of the operation, newspapers wrote. They say police failed to weigh the possible risks and did not evacuate the building before the raid.

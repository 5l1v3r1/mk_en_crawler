TIRANA, Albania -- Resolving the issue of Kosovo's final status requires proper timing, according to Albanian Foreign Minister Ilir Meta. During a news conference Friday (11 April), he said that the solution requires proper internal conditions, de facto functioning of government institutions, a stable co-existence between Albanians and Serbs and greater commitment by the international community.
In other news Friday, the Albanian Defence Ministry announced that a unit of 70 commandos would leave Monday to join US forces in Kuwait. Five others went earlier this month. (ATA - 11/04/03)

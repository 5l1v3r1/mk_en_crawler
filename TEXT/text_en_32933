ATHENS, Greece -- The next parliamentary elections will be held in May 2004 as scheduled, said government spokesman Christos Protopappas. His statement Friday (27 June) came in response to Costas Karamanlis, the president of the second largest party in parliament, New Democracy (ND). Karamanlis favours early elections, given ND's strong showing in recent opinion polls. Prime Minister Costas Simitis, meanwhile, has said he is mulling over a possible cabinet reshuffle, as well as a shake-up of top leadership positions in the ruling PASOK party.
In other news, the man accused of inspiring attacks by the 17 November terrorist group told a local newspaper on Sunday that he was innocent and the government had no case against him. Paris-born Alexander Yiotopoulos and 18 others are charged with carrying out 23 high-profile killings in Greece since 1975. (Kathimerini - 30/06/03; MPA, AP - 29/06/03)

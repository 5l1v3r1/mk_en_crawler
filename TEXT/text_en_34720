PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic said on Saturday (16 August) the relations between Belgrade and Podgorica have never been better. He said Montenegro's interests had been fully protected in the federation, and that the union it entered with Serbia had helped Montenegro restore its international significance and authority. Marovic added that the two republics should not waste time engaging in conflicts that could harm both their individual and collective interests.
In other news, Montenegro's Socialist People's Party (SNP) says it wants to meet with all opposition leaders to discuss ways to resolve the ongoing parliamentary crisis. SNP has been boycotting parliament sessions since May, when live broadcasts were halted. (Tanjug, Pobjeda - 16/08/03)

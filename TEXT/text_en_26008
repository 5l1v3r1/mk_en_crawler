TIRANA, Albania -- The US Embassy in Tirana issued a statement Wednesday (September 16th) supporting the OSCE's final report on the June 28th general elections. "We welcome the improvements from previous elections described in the report, such as an improved legal framework and voter registration process. These areas marked tangible progress over previous elections," the embassy said in a statement. However, it also mentioned some shortcomings. "There were issues noted in vote counting and tabulation, as well as in media bias for the main political parties." The statement also cited questionable actions and pressure by political parties and the government during the campaign. (Shqip, Panorama - 17/09/09; Top Channel, Shekulli, Telegrafi - 16/09/09)

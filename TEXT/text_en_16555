HELSINKI, Finland -- A compromise solution on the future status of Kosovo is unlikely because Serbs and ethnic Albanians remain as far apart as they were when talks began in February, the UN chief mediator said on Monday (October 9th). He said his team would continue to explore all areas where a deal might be struck. The international community wants the Kosovo issue resolved by the end of the year, a point stressed by EU security chief Javier Solana on Monday. 
In other news Monday, Serbian President Boris Tadic met with the Commander of NATO's Allied Joint Force Command Naples, Admiral Harry Ulrich, calling on the Alliance to ensure increased security for Serbs and other non-Albanians in Kosovo. The meeting took place in Italy, where Tadic is on a three-day visit. (B92, FoNet, Beta, Danas - 10/10/06; Reuters, AP, AFP, BBC, UPI, Tanjug - 09/10/06)

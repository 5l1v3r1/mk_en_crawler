ANKARA, Turkey -- The administration of the Southeast Anatolian Project (GAP) announced on Sunday (24 August) that it has sent letters to 31 international financial institutions and organisations, seeking financing for its programmes. The aim is to increase the share of foreign financing, as local funds have proven to be insufficient for meeting demand from the growing number of projects. GAP sent appeals to the Austria Development Agency, the Black Sea Economic Co-operation Agency, the Asia Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank and the US Development of Trade Agency, among others.

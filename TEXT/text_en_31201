PRISTINA Kosovo -- During a regular meeting Friday (April 29th), the government announced the establishment of an institute to document crimes and damages caused by Serbia in the last decade and will send its findings to the International Court of Justice. This Institute for War Crimes Investigations will be public and will function within the Ministry of Justice. Justice Minister Hajredin Kuci said Kosovo will sue Serbia as soon as this is made possible. "To sue a country two conditions have to be met -- to be member of the UN or a signatory party to the Statute of the International Court of Justice. We are neither," Kuci said but added that this does not mean that "we will not be in the future and we have to be prepared." (Zeri, Koha Ditore, Kosova Sot - 30/04/11)

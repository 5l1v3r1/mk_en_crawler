PRISTINA, Kosovo -- During a government meeting Tuesday (June 3rd), Prime Minister Hashim Thaci conceded there is confusion over the future international presence in Kosovo. "There are some dilemmas about the transfer of competencies between UNMIK and EULEX," he said. Kosovo's institutions are ready to assume all competencies after the new constitution enters into force on June 15th, he added. 
At its session, the government adopted five more bills from the supervised independence plan of former UN envoy for Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari. The government also asked UNMIK to stop the creation of parallel municipal assemblies in Serb-dominated areas. Belgrade is planning to create these bodies based on the results of the May 11th Serbian general and local elections.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A videotape showing the execution of Srebrenica Bosniaks was shown at the UN war crimes tribunal during a hearing Wednesday (1 June) in the trial of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Prosecutor Geoffrey Nice presented the tape from July 1995, which he said showed the killing of six Muslims by members of the Scorpions, a Serb paramilitary unit under the command of the Serbian Interior Ministry. 
In Belgrade, Serbia-Montenegro's human rights minister and the chairman of the national council for ICTY co-operation, Rasim Ljajic, announced Wednesday that Belgrade prosecutors have launched a probe into the alleged involvement of members of the Scorpions in the Srebrenica massacre. 
Also Wednesday, Bosnian Serb Branko Grujic surrendered to Serbian authorities. He is charged with 1992 war crimes against Bosnian Muslims in Zvornik. The case was transferred from The Hague tribunal to the Serbian judiciary last year. UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte visits Belgrade Thursday to discuss war crimes co-operation.

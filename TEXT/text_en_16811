VIENNA, Austria -- The fourth round of UN-mediated talks on Kosovo's decentralisation ended in Vienna on Friday (5 May) without any compromise between negotiating teams from Belgrade and Pristina, deputy UN envoy Albert Rohan said at a news conference. Rohan, chairman of the two-day meeting, said the Serbian side insists on the establishment of 14 new municipalities to be run by ethnic Serbs in the province, and on border changes for five others. The Kosovo Albanian side wants three new Serbian municipalities. While no breakthroughs were reached, Rohan described the exchange of opinions as an important step towards the final definition of Kosovo's status. The next round of talks, planned for 23 May, will focus primarily on economic issues. (Politika - 07/05/06; Blic - 06/05/06; Interfax, People's Daily, KosovaLive, UPI, AFP - 05/05/06)

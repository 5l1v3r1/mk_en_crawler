CERNAUTI, Ukraine -- President Leonid Kuchma and his Romanian counterpart, Ion Iliescu, signed a bilateral treaty Tuesday (17 June) on the state border regime, capping five years of negotiations. Iliescu told reporters that the agreement would allow his country to meet its EU obligations by ensuring better protection of the outer border of the region covered by the Schengen visa agreement.

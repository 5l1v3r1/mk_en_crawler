SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), which received the largest number of ethnic Albanian votes in the 5 July parliamentary elections, does not rule out possible participation in the future cabinet, according to statements by DUI representatives Monday (10 July). Earlier in the day, senior DUI officials met with a delegation from VMRO-DPMNE, the party that won the parliamentary vote and is expected to form the new government. Local media reports suggest the talks included the possibility for a coalition government that would include both DUI and the Democratic Party of Albanians, rivals now for months.

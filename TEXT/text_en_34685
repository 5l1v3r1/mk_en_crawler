SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A US military delegation led by Senator James Inhofe completed its visit to Bulgaria on Wednesday (20 August). The team of military experts visited several local bases to explore the possibility of use by US and NATO forces for training exercises. Inhofe, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said the visit marked the end of the first phase of a US strategy to relocate military bases to Central and Eastern Europe. The final decision on base locations is expected next year. (Dnevnik, Info Radio, Trud, 24 Chassa - 21/08/03; BTA, bTV, BNT - 20/08/03)

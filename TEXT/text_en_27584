SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Mayor Alija Behmen asked the police on Wednesday (April 28th) to ban a commemoration of the May 3rd, 1995 attack against a Yugoslav National Army (JNA) convoy that left more than 40 soldiers dead. Behmen says there is a high risk of violence or disorder during the planned gathering and that holding such a commemoration would amount to rewriting history, as the siege of Sarajevo started at the same time. Bosnian Serbs say they plan to mark the anniversary with a peaceful march. (RTRS, Srna, Nezavisne Novine, RTS - 28/04/10)

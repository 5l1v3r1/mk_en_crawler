PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Montenegro's President Filip Vujanovic appealed Saturday (26 February) for Serbia to take a "democratic" approach toward Podgorica's suggestions for overhauling the federal union, saying that dialogue would be in the interests of both republics and their bilateral ties. Earlier this week, Montenegro formally proposed that Serbia and Montenegro form a commonwealth of independent states. (Tanjug - 26/02/05)

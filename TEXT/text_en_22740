ZAGREB, Croatia -- Relations between Croatia and Serbia are currently stagnating, Croatian President Stipe Mesic warned on Saturday in Zagreb (November 8th). "I cannot deny that all channels of communication are still open, but they are empty," Mesic told journalists at the annual Igman Initiative, a regional reconciliation conference. The two countries still maintain regular contacts, but a real discussion on mutual relations and the situation in the region is missing, the president said.

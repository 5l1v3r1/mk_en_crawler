ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said in a speech Monday (5 April) that Turkey's full EU membership would not constitute a burden for the Union. Speaking at a symposium organised by the Maastricht Management Sciences Academy and Koc University, Gul discussed reforms being implemented to meet the Copenhagen political criteria for EU membership. He said implementation would continue for the benefit of the Turkish people, regardless of the progress of the membership bid.
That bid will be the focus of a two-day meeting of the Presidential Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. The panel meets in Istanbul on Tuesday. Izmir, meanwhile, will host the 52nd Turkey-EU Joint Parliamentary Commission. (Anadolu Agency, TRT 2 - 05/04/04; Anadolu Agency, NTV - 04/04/04)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Minister for International Economic Relations Milan Parivodic urged the IMF to delay the country's pension reform. In an interview published on Wednesday (31 August), Parivodic promised that Belgrade would fulfil its commitments to the Fund, but argued that doing so at this time could result in public unrest and the fall of the cabinet. The IMF has made its support for Serbia-Montenegro conditional on an overhaul of the pension system and the privatisation of the local oil monopoly. Withdrawal of IMF support would jeopardise Belgrade's $3 billion debt write-off deal with the Paris Club of creditors. (FT - 31/08/05)

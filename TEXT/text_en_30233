BUCHAREST, Romania -- The ruling coalition has decided to initiate an accountability procedure over the labour code in an effort to speed up the approval process, Prime Minister Emil Boc said on Monday (February 21st). The procedure is an emergency method by which a bill is adopted without parliamentary debate or votes. While it accelerates the process, it allows the opposition the opportunity to initiate a no-confidence motion against the cabinet.
Labour unions, meanwhile, announced on Monday they plan a general strike on February 28th, when President Traian Basescu is expected to receive the draft Labour Code and Social Dialogue Code and debate on the legislation is set to begin. (Mediafax, Cotidianul, Realitatea, Adevarul - 21/02/11)

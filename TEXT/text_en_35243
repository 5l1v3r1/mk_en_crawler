BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian police detained 10 illegal immigrants from Albania and one from Kosovo near the border with Serbia-Montenegro late Saturday (19 June). They were caught while riding in two taxis. The Bosnian drivers have been charged with smuggling people. The immigrants will be deported to their home countries.

A spokesman for the peacekeepers described it as part of "an ongoing campaign to remind the local population that support to persons indicted for war crimes is illegal".

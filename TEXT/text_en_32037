PRAGUE, Czech Republic -- On Thursday (21 November), NATO members formally invited seven new countries to join the alliance: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. NATO Secretary General George Robertson extended the invitations during the opening session of the two-day enlargement summit in Prague. The seven countries will become members in 2004 after they sign and ratify the North Atlantic Treaty, the founding act of NATO, and after the 19 current member states ratify their accession protocols. For his part, Czech President Vaclav Havel urged the alliance to reassure other Balkan countries - including Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia - that they would be offered membership "sooner or later". Havel's Albanian counterpart, Alfred Moisiu, said Wednesday that Tirana remains highly motivated to achieve its twin goals of NATO membership and EU integration. (NATO website, Mediapool, BTA.

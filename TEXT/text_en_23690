SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The US administration has extended by one year sanctions against individuals from the Western Balkans, including Macedonia, who are suspected of involvement in extremist violence in the region, local media reported Tuesday (June 23rd), citing a White House statement. The sanctions were introduced in 2001. The US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control published a list last week of those banned from entering US territory. Among them are 11 Macedonian citizens, including former Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski, Democratic Party of Albanians leader Menduh Thaci and Democratic Union for Integration official Xhevat Ademi.

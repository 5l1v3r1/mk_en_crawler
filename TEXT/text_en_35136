SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- At a news conference Tuesday (27 April), SFOR spokesman Dave Sullivan said SFOR would not compromise on standards in the appointment of the general staff of the future BiH armed forces. Commenting on recent criticism by the BiH presidency's Bosniak member, Acting Chairman Sulejman Tihic, over SFOR's decision to reject six Bosniak candidates, Sullivan said all SFOR decisions were made in compliance with the Dayton Peace Agreement. He also said the main reason for the decision on certain nominees was the need to appoint reliable candidates who enjoy the support and respect of all sides involved, including the international community.

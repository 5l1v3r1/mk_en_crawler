ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament adopted a law Friday (30 June) envisioning the restructuring of the state security services. Under the new legislation, the Intelligence and Counterintelligence Agencies would merge and function as a single body, alongside the Military Security and Intelligence Agency. Opposition parties and NGOs had voiced concerns about the supervision and control of those agencies, so the original government proposal was amended. It now introduces a Citizens' Council that will also participate in the control of secret services. (Vjesnik - 01/07/06; HRT - 30/06/06)

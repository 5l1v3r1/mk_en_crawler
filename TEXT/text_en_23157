NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias of the Greek Cypriot community and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat agreed in principle Tuesday (July 1st) on single sovereignty and common citizenship for the future Turkish-Greek federation envisioned to resolve the island's long-standing division. Agreement on the key issue came during a meeting in Nicosia, said UN envoy Taye-Brook Zerihoun. Talat and Christofias agreed to meet on July 25th to prepare for new direct talks on reuniting the island. Negotiations were to begin in June but were delayed by disagreements on key issues such as property, sovereignty and citizenship within the proposed bi-zonal, bi-communal federation.

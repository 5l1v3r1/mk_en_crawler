ZAGREB, Croatia -- Serb drug lord Sreten Jocic will not testify at the trial that is currently under way in Zagreb for the murder of prominent Croatian publisher and journalist Ivo Pukanic, Zagreb's District Court ruled on Wednesday (March 17th). The judges noted that Jocic will face charges stemming from the murder in Belgrade. Prosecutors say Jocic masterminded Pukanic's murder, paying 1.5m euros to kill the journalist, who had been reporting on smuggling. Pukanic, co-owner and editor-in-chief of the weekly Nacional, died in a car bombing in downtown Zagreb on October 23rd 2008, along with the newspaper's marketing director, Niko Franjic.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO HQ Commander in BiH General Steven P. Schook and EUFOR Commander Major General David Leakey met with members of the BiH presidency on Friday (13 May) to discuss recent incidents involving the Republika Srpska (RS) Army. According to the presidency's Bosniak member, Sulejman Tihic, Schook and Leakey reiterated their strong dissatisfaction with the response of RS authorities to army conscripts' behaviour during oath taking ceremonies last month. The Office of the High Representative set a new deadline -- 24 May -- for RS to come up with adequate action. (Dnevni avaz, PBS BiH - 14/05/05)

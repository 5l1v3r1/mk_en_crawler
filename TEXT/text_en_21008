WASHINGTON, United States -- Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher met with Bulgarian Interior Minister Rumen Petkov on Monday (March 3rd) to discuss the fight against organised crime, corruption and piracy, as well as measures to protect intellectual property rights. They agreed to form joint investigation teams that will bring together prosecutors and police officers from the two countries. Fisher reiterated Washington's support for the establishment of a centre to combat organised crime in Bulgaria and said Washington is ready to send US experts to train Bulgarian security officials there. The centre is part of a joint project between Bulgaria and the European Commission. It will also be used as a training base for security officials from the Western Balkans.

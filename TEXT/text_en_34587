BENIDORM, Spain -- Ronald Noble, the secretary general of Interpol, said Tuesday (30 September) that the assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic could have been prevented if international police co-operation had been better. Interpol has discovered that the chief suspect in the slaying, Milorad Ulemek, also known as Milorad Lukic Legija, used a stolen Croatian passport to travel extensively through Austria, Macedonia, Greece, Singapore and Croatia. It was one of 100 blank passports stolen from Croatia's consulate in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Interpol keeps a database of stolen documents but very few countries ever submit data to it. The inference is that Ulemek would have been apprehended during his travels if Interpol had known about the stolen passport. (Reuters - 30/09/03)

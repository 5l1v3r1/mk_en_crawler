ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government is ready to fulfil all requests made by The Hague war crimes tribunal, to achieve full co-operation with the court, Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor assured Hague chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz on Monday (September 28th). They discussed efforts Zagreb is making to locate the so-called "artillery diaries" that could be used in trials against several Croatian war crimes indictees, including former General Ante Gotovina. UN prosecutors are seeking wartime documents related to the 1995 Operation Storm, but Croatian authorities insist they have delivered all the files they have. The tribunal's assessment of Croatia's co-operation is essential to the country's EU integration process. (HRT, HINA, Dnevnik, AP - 28/09/09)

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Prosecutors at The Hague war crimes tribunal on Tuesday (August 5th) asked the judges in Radovan Karadzic's trial to define the rules under which he can conduct his own defence. The request came after Karadzic presented a document in which he expressed doubt about the fairness of the court and accused the media of bias. This occurred during his first court appearance on July 31st. The next session is scheduled for August 29th. (AP, RTS, Dnevni Avaz, SRNA - 05/08/08)

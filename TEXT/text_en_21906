SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Heads of state from six countries in Southeast Europe participated in the fifth annual Regional Economic Forum on Friday (November 21st) in Ohrid. The presidents of Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia and Montenegro discussed joint ways to cope with the global financial and economic crisis. Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski urged his counterparts to find a "common response to new economic challenges" resulting from the crisis. Participants warned the global crisis would slow economic growth and halt foreign investment in the region. The forum also focussed on regional infrastructure projects involving construction, roads and telecommunications, and energy markets in the Balkans.
In other news, Greece's parliament adopted a 28 billion-euro aid package to help the country's banking sector cope with the international financial crisis. Lawmakers approved the bill despite opposition from the left-wing party PASOK which described the plan as "ill-conceived".

ATHENS, Greece -- Kosovo should be given special status, George Papandreou, leader of Greece's leading opposition party PASOK, told the BBC in an interview Friday (September 14th). Asked about the possibility that Kosovo might unilaterally declare independence from Serbia, Papandreou said "these connections have been broken anyway. Kosovo should gain a special status until its full independence is achieved". This, he said, could help the province draw needed financial support and foreign investment. Regardless of how the status issue is resolved, the entire region should have a European perspective, Papandreou added. (RTS, NTV Hayat - 15/09/07)

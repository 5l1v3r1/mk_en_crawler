BUCHAREST, Romania -- The continuing conflicts between Romania's main political parties could turn investors away, US Ambassador to Bucharest Nicholas F. Taubman warned on Thursday (March 29th). "We need to be realistic and recognise recent political turmoil has raised doubts beyond Romania's borders", he said, adding that investors are trying to determine which way Bucharest is heading. "It is very important for Romania to continue to make progress on key areas like justice reform and in fighting corruption", he said. He was referring to a continued feud between President Traian Basescu and Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu. (AP, UPI, Mediafax, Rompres, DPA - 29/03/07)

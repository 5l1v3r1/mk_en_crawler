PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The US state department on Thursday (May 28th) named career diplomat Christopher William Dell as ambassador to Kosovo. He previously served in Angola, Zimbabwe and Bulgaria. Until 2007, he headed the US mission in Afghanistan. His nomination requires senate approval.
In other news Thursday, Germany's lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, voted to extend the mandate of its peacekeeping mission in Kosovo by another year. But it slashed the maximum number of its troops there from 8,500 to 3,500. Currently, 2,280 German troops are deployed. (Makfax, RTS, Alsat, Bundesregierung, Tanjug, BTA, MIA - 28/05/09)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government will have zero tolerance for organised crime and human trafficking, Deputy Interior Minister Fatmir Xhelili told a conference on strategies to combat human trafficking Thursday (December 11th). As a result of the authorities' increased efforts, in 2008 police arrested 101 people involved in human trafficking, a 30% increase over last year, Xhelili said. Representatives of the OSCE, which was a co-organiser of the conference, stressed it is crucial for Kosovo to implement its action plan for the fight against human trafficking in coming years.

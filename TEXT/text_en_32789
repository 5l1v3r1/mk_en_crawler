PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- UNMIK chief Michael Steiner says it is high time Belgrade and Pristina begin talks on resolving Kosovo's problems. In an interview in Saturday's (7 December) edition of  Novosti , Steiner noted that more people are returning to the province than are leaving it and predicted a major refugee return next year. Steiner says Kosovo Albanians now realise that every individual should be allowed to return home, as only a multiethnic Kosovo would be allowed to join European structures.

PARIS, France -- Meeting in Paris last week, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe's (PACE) Legal Affairs Committee endorsed a draft report recommending the establishment of a Human Rights Court in Kosovo, according to a CoE press release issued Friday (17 December). The report, prepared by the British rapporteur Tony Lloyd, notes that UNMIK and KFOR have achieved positive results in fulfilling security duties, but warns that serious concerns remain about protecting human rights in the province.
Also Friday, UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen visited Skopje. He urged that differences over demarcation of the Macedonia-Kosovo border be settled before talks on Kosovo's status begin.
Belgrade media, meanwhile, are reporting that Jessen-Petersen has sent a letter to Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, inviting him to talks on Kosovo's decentralisation and security and the issue of missing persons.

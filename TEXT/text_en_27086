SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Train drivers in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) ended their strike Sunday (August 2nd) after trade unions and the state-controlled railway company struck a deal on the payment of back wages. Vernes Buljugija, president of the train drivers' union, told local media that the workers' salaries for May will be paid this week, while those for June will be paid by August 21st. Train drivers went on strike Thursday to protest non-adherence to the collective labour agreement, as well as government plans to cut salaries in the sector by 10%.

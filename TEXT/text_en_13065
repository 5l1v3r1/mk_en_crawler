VARNA, Bulgaria -- Defence ministry official Ivan Milanov said on Wednesday (28 September) that Bulgaria would participate in an EU rapid reaction combat unit along with Greece and Romania. Milanov, speaking at an international seminar in Varna, added that Cyprus might also take part with medical personnel. The unit would include around 150 members and participate primarily in peacekeeping missions. 
In other news, the EU has donated four new monitoring cameras to the Bulgarian border police. The equipment would help secure the borders with Macedonia and Turkey. 
Also Tuesday, Bulgaria's Chief Prosecutor Nikola Filchev asked parliament to lift the immunity of member Stefan Sofianski. The former mayor of Sofia has been on trial on abuse of office charges, stemming from the sale of the capital's central shopping mall. The trial was suspended in July, when Sofianski joined parliament. He insists he is innocent. (Sega - 28/09/05; BNR, Monitor, bTV, Mediapool - 28/09/05)

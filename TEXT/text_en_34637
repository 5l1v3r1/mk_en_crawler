PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Former Finnish Prime Minister Harri Holkeri formally took up the post of UNMIK chief on Monday (25 August) at a ceremony attended by President Ibrahim Rugova, Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi and foreign diplomats. Holkeri promised to work for Kosovo to become "a place for all people to live in peace and dignity". He also attended a memorial service for Sergio Vieira de Mello, the UN representative killed in an explosion in Baghdad last week. Rugova said he would honour the diplomat, who once served in Kosovo, with the province's medal for civil service. (AFP - 25/08/03)

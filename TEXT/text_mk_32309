THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Croatian President Stipe Mesic took the witness stand Tuesday (1 October), testifying about Slobodan Milosevic's role in starting a series of wars in the Balkans. Mesic, the last president of the former Yugoslavia, described how Milosevic took control of the army, the budget and the federal institutions in 1991, transforming them into Serb entities. He went on to explain that the defendant planned to create a greater Serb nation and was ready to go to war to attain this goal. He described Milosevic as a man driven by ambition who displayed no human emotions. Mesic said the Serbian leader could have averted war, but did not try. Prosecutors hope the testimony underscored Milosevic's concentrated power before the start of the conflicts in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and how he may have used it to assist Serb separatists in the two countries.

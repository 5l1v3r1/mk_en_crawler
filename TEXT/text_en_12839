TIRANA, Albania -- Sali Berisha, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party (DP), urged parliament Monday (3 January) to call an extraordinary session and pass the revised election law. Under an agreement signed by the DP and the ruling Socialist Party last month, the amendments to the law must be adopted during the first parliamentary session of the year. Berisha says they already have enough signatures to call an extraordinary session. (ATA - 03/01/05)

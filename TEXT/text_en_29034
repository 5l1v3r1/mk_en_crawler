PRISTINA, Kosovo -- International Civilian Office (ICO) head Pieter Feith said on Thursday (October 7th) that the mission is busy with preparations to establish the Mitrovica North municipality and work on elections in the area. He added that such efforts will continue regardless of other processes, such as possible talks between Kosovo and Serbia. Mitrovica North municipality was supposed to be established a year ago when Kosovo held municipal elections, but lacked organisation and structure due to the domination of Serb parallel structures in the area.

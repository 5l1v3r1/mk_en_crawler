SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government expects a stronger reaction from the European Commission (EC), the International Civil Aviation Organisation and other competent structures that have been informed about Greece's ban on the Macedonian air carrier MAT, government spokesman Ivica Bocevski said on Monday (May 5th). He expressed hope that Greece will give up its policy on the issue and said it does not contribute to good neighbourly relations. 
"Macedonia has always been a good neighbour and an active and constructive member of the international community. We expect to be treated in the same way by exactly those countries that belong to the family associated with Western values of freedom, democracy and a free market economy," Bocevski said. The EC has expressed concern about the policy, saying it may contradict agreements between the EU and Western Balkan countries. (Vreme, Utrinski Vesnik - 06/05/08; MIA, Netpress - 05/05/08)

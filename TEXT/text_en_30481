PRISTINA, Kosovo -- One of the basic preconditions for Kosovo's potential EU accession is the integration of minority Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian (RAE) communities in social and institutional life, according to participants of a conference on these communities held in Pristina on Wednesday (May 11th). Pierre Mirel, European Commission director for the Western Balkans, emphasised that these communities should be integrated in the country's education, shelter, social and health assistance sectors. Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said the government is aware that the full integration of RAE communities is crucial to EU membership. (RTK, Kohavision, KLAN Kosova - 11/05/11)

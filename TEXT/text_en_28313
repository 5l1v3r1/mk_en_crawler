ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said on Friday (October 15th) that parliamentary elections will be held at the end of 2011, as previously announced. She was refuting suggestions by some opposition parties that the vote take place in March or April. Kosor urged the opposition to co-operate with the government in wrapping up EU accession talks as fast as possible.
Meanwhile, the leader of the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP), Zoran Milanovic, said that his party will call next week for parliament to discuss its confidence in the government. Kosor says that could stem from former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader's request to re-activate his status as a lawmaker. Kosor reiterated that the ruling coalition is stable.

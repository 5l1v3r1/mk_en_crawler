BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Rasim Ljajic, the head of Serbia-Montenegro's national council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, said Thursday (2 September) that he would call a meeting of senior officials to determine the priorities for war crimes co-operation. He said that the federal and republican governments should work together to ensure better co-operation, adding that the extradition of indicted individuals is a top priority. 
In other news Thursday, judges at the trial of Slobodan Milosevic asked two British lawyers to represent the accused. Steven Kay and Gillian Higgins, who were monitoring the proceedings to ensure a fair trial, have not said yet whether they would accept the case. Milosevic objected to the appointment and vowed to appeal it. His continuing health problems prompted the judgesâ€™ decision. (AP, The Guardian - 03/09/04; B92, AFP - 02/09/04)

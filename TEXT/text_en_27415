BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Roma Civic Alliance in Romania urged European countries on Monday (August 30th) to boycott French products and start protests on September 6th against Paris' policy regarding the Roma community. "We realise that most Romas don't have high purchasing powers, but we believe that this action will be useful," David Mark, president of the Alliance, said. "We will stop the call for boycott when France stops the mass expulsion and criminalising a whole group of the society." 
Separately Monday, Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Baconschi said that France's decision to repatriate Roma voluntarily by giving them some financial compensation is not a solution. He urged dialogue between the two countries and specific programmes to improve the lives of the minority. 
France, however, said on Monday it will step up deportations of foreigners caught stealing or begging aggressively. Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux noted that one out of every five thefts in Paris is by Romanian citizens. (Romania Libera - 31/08/10; AFP, Realitatea, Ziare - 30/08/10)

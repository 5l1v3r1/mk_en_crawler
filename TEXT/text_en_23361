LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- The government has sent a protest note to the Croatian Embassy in Ljubljana over alleged violations of Slovenia's airspace, media reported on Friday (June 26th). According to the Slovenian foreign ministry, two Croatian fighter jets accompanying a foreign delegation violated the country's airspace on June 19th. The ministry said the matter is being treated as an incident rather than a threat or provocation. It added, however, that a report would be sent to NATO's High Command. Bilateral ties have been strained since December 2008 when Ljubljana blocked Zagreb's EU accession talks. (Javno, STA, Dnevnik, B92, Glas Srbije - 26/06/09)

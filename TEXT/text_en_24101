SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Security forces have arrested Serb war crimes suspect Stojan Perkovic on a warrant issued by the BiH's state prosecutor's office, media reported on Thursday (January 15th). Perkovic, who commanded a Bosnian Serb military unit in the village of Ladjevina, faces charges of crimes against humanity for the murder, rape and persecution of non-Serb civilians during the 1992-1995 conflict. He was also allegedly responsible for abusing, assaulting and murdering several dozen Bosnian Muslim civilians in the municipality of Rogatica.
In other news Thursday, the European Parliament chose July 11th as the day to commemorate the 1995 Srebrenica massacre in which Bosnian Serb forces murdered over 8,000 Muslim civilians. The European Commission threw its support behind the initiative. EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner said proclaiming the day of remembrance "should be a step in the right direction for reconciliation in BiH and the region".
Meanwhile, The Hague tribunal announced on Thursday it had transferred Bosnian Serb general Stanislav Galic to Germany to serve his life sentence for war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. In 2006, The Hague Appeals Chamber handed down the sentence in connection with the shelling of Muslims in Sarajevo from 1992 to 1994. (Beta, B92, RTS, BalkanInsight - 15/01/09)

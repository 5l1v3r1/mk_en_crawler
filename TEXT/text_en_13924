SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Archeologists have unearthed more than 15,000 golden pieces of Thracian royal jewelry dating back to the third millennium BC, the director of the National Historical Museum, Bozhidar Dimitrov, said Wednesday (17 August). "There is only one find that rivals these extremely well-crafted pieces -- the golden treasures found in ancient Troy," the AFP quoted him as saying. Digging started near Dabene a year ago after an archeologist saw a farmer's wife wearing a necklace of golden rings, assembled by her husband from pieces he had found on his farm. (AFP - 17/08/05)

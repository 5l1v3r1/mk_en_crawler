PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier said on Wednesday (April 22nd) that he sees elements of the six-point plan for Kosovo being implemented by the country's institutions. The plan, proposed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and approved by the UN Security Council in October, gives more competencies to the Serb minority. Kosovo authorities have largely disagreed with it, saying it may result in more division between the country's communities. Zannier had a long meeting with President Fatmir Sejdiu on Wednesday to discuss both implementation and UNMIK's reconfiguration. "Things are on the right track," said Zannier.
After their meeting, Sejdiu asked UNMIK to end its mission in Kosovo, saying its presence is no longer required after ten years. Separately, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci agreed, contending EULEX and the International Civilian Office make UNMIK unnecessary.
In other news Wednesday, government officials said they will show flexibility in implementing the decentralisation process but will not discuss new models of decentralisation, such as the Serb community in Bosnia and Herzegovina. "We are talking about implementation flexibility and not about the design," Minister of Local Governance Sadri Ferati said at a meeting with representatives of the Serb community in Gracanica.

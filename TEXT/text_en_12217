SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Independent candidate Trifun Kostovski, who is backed by Macedonian opposition parties, declared victory in the second round of the Skopje mayoral race, several hours after the polling stations closed Sunday (10 April). The State Election Commission (SEC) is to release final results late Monday. Kostovski's spokesperson, Maja Muhic, noted that early returns, based on 77 per cent of the ballots, suggest he trounced incumbent Risto Penov of the ruling coalition. In other municipalities where runoffs or revoting took place Sunday, SEC data suggested that the opposition bloc won seven mayoral seats, while the ruling coalition "For Macedonia Together" and junior government partner Democratic Union for Integration each won five seats. The vote was described as largely free of the irregularities that surfaced in previous rounds. (Nova TV - 11/04/05; A1 TV, Makfax - 10/04/05)

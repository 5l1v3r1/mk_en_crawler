PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The top US diplomat in Kosovo is urging the province's Serbs to join the local parliament and other institutions. In an interview with Voice of America on Monday (22 August), Philip Goldberg blamed the government in Belgrade for failing to play a constructive role in helping Serbs achieve self-government. He was equally critical of local ethnic Albanian leaders, saying they had done nothing to prepare for talks on Kosovo's final status. Whether they start in the fall, as anticipated, depends on a report UN special envoy Kai Eide will submit to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. 
Eide was in Belgrade Tuesday, where he met with Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and voiced dissatisfaction with the stalemate in the decentralisation process. His weeklong visit to Serbia-Montenegro is the last before he submts his report. (VOA - 24/08/05; Beta, B92 - 23/08/05; VoA Web site - 22/08/05)

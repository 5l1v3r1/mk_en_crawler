PRISTINA, Kosovo -- At a debate on decentralisation in Gracanica, just outside Pristina on Thursday (June 5th), International Civilian Office (ICO) chief Pieter Feith said the process benefits local Serbs, in part by creating five new municipalities in which they would be the majority. Feith assured them decentralisation would follow the scheme proposed by former UN envoy for Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari. "It is important to help the citizens and offer better services and improve the daily lives of Serbs and other minorities. This process enables the Serb minority to be integrated into society," he said.
Implementation of Ahtisaari's plan also got a boost from parliament Thursday. Lawmakers adopted five more laws stemming from his blueprint for supervised independence, bringing the total number to 30. (Zeri, Koha Ditore, Express; KTV, RTK - 05/06/08)

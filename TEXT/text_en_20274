SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak and NATO Commander of the Allied Joint Force Command in Naples, Admiral Mark Fitzgerald, met on Friday (January 11th) in Sarajevo. They expressed satisfaction with NATO's decision to allow BiH to develop an Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP). The next step is to develop an IPAP Presentation Document as the basis for co-operation with NATO, Fitzgerald said. In addition to recognising the success of defence sector reforms in BiH, the IPAP puts the country on firmer footing for the next phase of defence reforms -- the Membership Action Plan.

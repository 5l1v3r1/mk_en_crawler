SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Mostar City Council elected Bosnian Croat Ljubo Beslic as the city's mayor on Friday (December 18th). Beslic, who is a representative of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), won with 17 votes. His contender -- Muslim Suad Hasandedic -- was backed by 15 members of the council. Three members abstained from voting. Beslic's first task as mayor of Mostar will be to propose and guarantee support for the city's 2009 budget. The election of the new mayor came after High Representative Valentin Inzko decided to change the rules and allow the council to elect a mayor via a simple majority, rather than a two-thirds majority. The inability to reach a larger majority kept the mayoral post vacant for more than 14 months. (RTRS, Srna, Sarajevo-x.com, BHRT, Dnevni Avaz - 18/12/09)

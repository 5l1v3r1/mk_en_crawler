BELGRADE, Serbia -- A Belgrade court on Friday (February 16th) convicted several defendants charged with the 1999 murders of four officials with the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) along the Ibar Highway, and the attempted murder of Vuk Draskovic, SPO leader at the time. Former special police unit chief Milorad Ulemek, also known as "Legija", was sentenced to 15 years in prison, as was Nenad Ilic, another former member of the Ulemek-run unit. Four more defendants received 14-year sentences. Former State Security chief Rade Markovic was sentenced to eight years in prison, while three other officials got sentences ranging from nine months to 2.5 years. Two of the defendants, Branko Djuric and Milan Radonjic, were acquitted. Verdicts in the first trial involving this case were overturned due to numerous procedural violations. (Beta -- 16/02/07)

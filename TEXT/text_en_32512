WASHINGTON, United States -- The EU and the United States voiced disappointment Tuesday (11 March) over the failure of UN-sponsored talks on the reunification of Cyprus. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher praised UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan's "commitment and creativity" and blamed the Turkish Cypriot leadership for the foiled reunification. In Strasbourg, EU Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen also praised the UN plan. "I am wholly convinced there will never be a better offer, nor a better solution for the Turkish Cypriots," he said. Greece, current holder of the rotating EU Presidency, signaled, meanwhile, that absence of progress on Cyprus may hamper the start of Turkey's accession talks with the European Commission. That sparked immediate protests from Turkish leaders. (AP, AFP, Reuters, Anadolu Agency, Hurriyet, AFP, CNA, ANA, MPA - 11/03/03)

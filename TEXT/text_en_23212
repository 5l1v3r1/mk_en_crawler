PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci sacked Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Naser Osmani on Monday (June 30th), saying the constitution permits him to change members of government without parliamentary approval. The decision followed a heated debate in parliament between Osmani and Transport and Telecommunications Minister Fatmir Limaj, a vice president of Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo, over the Kosovo Procurement Supervision Authority. In particular, Osmani argued that Limaj had no right to speak on behalf of the government. The debate deteriorated into an exchange of insults. Limaj and Osmani are members of the two main parties forming Kosovo's coalition government. Osmani's Democratic League of Kosovo refused to comment on the matter.

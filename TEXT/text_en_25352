ATHENS, Greece -- Hundreds of fire fighters -- backed by foreign teams and equipment -- managed on Monday (August 24th) to contain most of the blazes that have threatened Athens since Thursday. "The situation is improving, there is no longer a big active front in the region of Athens," except for one in Porto Germeno, about 60km west of the capital, fire fighting service spokesperson Yiannis Kapakis told reporters. However, all teams remain on alert.
While the situation improves, residents of two villages in western Cyprus were evacuated from their homes Monday because of forest fires in the region. One, near the town of Paphos, started by the road connecting the villages of Hulu and Lemona, and quickly grew, prompting evacuations.
In Turkey on Monday, a forest fire erupted near the village of Djuzuren in the southern Antalya province. High winds complicated fire fighting efforts. (AFP, Phileleftheros, NTV - 24/08/09)

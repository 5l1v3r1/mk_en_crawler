SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj said on Saturday (August 2nd) that BiH does not recognise the new Kosovo passport that went into distribution on Wednesday. Holders will be denied entry into BiH until the tripartite presidency decides otherwise, Alkalaj told reporters, adding that his ministry has instructed all BiH's consulates and embassies to accept the more familiar "passports issued by UNMIK".

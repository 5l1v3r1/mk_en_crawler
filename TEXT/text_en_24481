SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The lame duck government went ahead and named political appointees to various diplomatic posts Thursday (July 9th), despite a warning from the Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), which won Sunday's parliamentary elections. The government of outgoing Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev also approved about 77m euros worth of financing to various digital broadcasting projects, even though GERB leader Boyko Borisov, the prime minister-elect, made clear he would overturn such decisions. Stanishev's government appointed ambassadors to Japan, Morocco, Macedonia and Kosovo, as well as general consuls at other diplomatic missions. (Sega, Trud - 10/07/09; Dnevnik, Darik, bTV - 09/07/09)

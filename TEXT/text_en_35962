TIRANA, Albania -- The country Monday (12 January) observed a national day of mourning for the 21 victims of Saturday's boat accident, as rescuers continued the search for at least 15 people reported missing by relatives. Hundreds gathered in front of the government building in Tirana to light candles and lay flowers in memory those who died trying to get to Italy. A group called "Enough" staged a protest against what it describes as government indifference to the problem of human trafficking. Prime Minister Fatos Nano, meanwhile, called a meeting of the country's top security officials and ordered them to strike at criminal networks.
In other news Monday, the government and the IMF signed a new Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility memorandum. Under the three-year programme, Albania is to draw up to $39m, of which it has already drawn $11m. (Koha Jone, Shekulli - 13/01/04; AFP, AP - 12/01/04)

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- France has promised to help Montenegro achieve its goal of EU membership, French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said during a visit to Podgorica on Friday (March 23rd). He was wrapping up a two-day trip to the region that included stops in Pristina and Belgrade, aimed at underscoring France's support for the UN-sponsored plan for Kosovo. He praised what he described as Montenegro's "stabilising role" in the process and vowed to lobby French investors to consider Montenegrin opportunities. 
Also Friday, Russian Ambassador to Podgorica Jakov Gerasimov said that his government regards Montenegro as one of its key partners in the Balkans. Moscow was one of the first to recognise Montenegro's independence last year and to establish diplomatic relations with the new country. (Pobjeda, Vijesti - 24/03/07; AP, Mina - 23/03/07)

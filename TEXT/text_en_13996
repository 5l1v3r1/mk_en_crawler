ZAGREB, Croatia -- Former Foreign Minister Mate Granic has warned that any further postponement of EU accession talks beyond 2005 would bring negative consequences for the country, both domestically and abroad. In an interview with Novi list published Tuesday (16 August), Granic said that unless the negotiations begin this autumn, there would be a weakening in the government's position and a decline in public trust. At the same time, Croatia risks downgrades by international credit rating agencies, he added. (Novi list - 16/08/05)

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat met again on Thursday (October 22nd) to discuss reunifying the divided island. This session focused on property issues, after Wednesday's talks on external relations. The leaders meet again on Tuesday about the competencies of a federal government. 
Meanwhile, media reported on Thursday that UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will not visit Cyprus as part of his European tour scheduled for early November. A source says the reason is insufficient progress in those reunification talks. (UN News Centre, ITAR-TASS - 22/10/09)

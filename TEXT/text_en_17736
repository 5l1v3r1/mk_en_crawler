ANKARA, Turkey -- Voters went to the polls on Sunday (July 22nd) to elect the country's next parliament. Local television showed empty beaches as people cut short or delayed their vacations to exercise their right to vote. Fourteen political parties and 700 independent candidates are vying for the 550 seats. But only three parties are expected to reach the 10% threshold for getting deputies elected. The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), is considered the clear favorite. The opposition Republican People's Party and the Nationalist Action Party are also expected to land seats, along with a large number of independent candidates, mostly supported by Kurdish groups. 
The elections were called four months early after the opposition refused to accept the AKP's candidate for president, Abdullah Gul, saying his Islamic background posed a threat to Turkey's secular status.

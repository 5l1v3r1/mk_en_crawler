PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Citizens of Kosovo are going to the polls on Sunday (December 12th) to choose their representatives in the 120-seat parliament. It is the first general election since since Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008. About 1.6 million people are eligible to vote. The snap vote was called after former President Fatmir Sejdiu stepped down in September, triggering the collapse of the ruling coalition.
Twenty-nine political parties, coalitions and citizens' initiatives, including eight representing Kosovo Serbs, are competing in the race. According to the Kosovo Electoral Law, Serbs are guaranteed ten of the 120 seats in parliament, regardless of turnout. More than 30,000 observers will monitor the election process.

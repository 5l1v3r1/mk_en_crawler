SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The General Secretary of the Interior Ministry, Boyko Borisov, has launched a series of meetings with chief officers of the National Security Service to discuss structural reforms aimed at plugging information leaks. Gen Borisov told state national radio Friday (27 December) that he would also discuss a package of reforms with President Georgi Parvanov and Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg in the coming weeks. Borisov expressed concern that the recent scandal involving the wiretapping of opposition leaders, judges and media officials would send the wrong signal to NATO members and might impede Bulgaria's entry in the alliance. He will recommend that the functions of the secret services be restricted to two areas:counterintelligence and protection of classified information. (Mediapool, National Radio - 27/12/02)

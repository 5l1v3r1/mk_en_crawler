ATHENS, Greece -- Following the deadly crash of a Cypriot airliner in Greece earlier this month, authorities were again put on alert Tuesday (30 August) after a Czech charter plane failed to respond to air traffic controllers in Athens. Local media reported on Wednesday that the plane, bound from Cairo to Bratislava, entered Greek airspace at about noon, but failed to respond to repeated calls by traffic controllers. Just as the Civil Aviation Authority was preparing to scramble two Air Force planes, the pilots of the Czech aircraft contacted Athens, reporting problems with their headsets.

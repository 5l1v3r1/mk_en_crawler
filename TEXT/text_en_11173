ZAGREB, Croatia -- Three out of the 13 candidates in Sunday's (2 January) presidential election failed to submit campaign financing reports to the State Election Commission (SEC) by the 25 December deadline. The SEC identified the three as Ante Kovacevic, Slaven Letica and Tomislav Petrak. Polls show that incumbent Stipe Mesic has a solid lead over the rest of the pack. (Vecernji list, Hina - 26/12/04)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Three UN vehicles and a private car were destroyed by an explosion in the centre of Pristina Monday (February 19th) evening. A group calling itself the Liberation Army of Kosovo says it was in response to police handling of a protest ten days ago in which two demonstrators were killed. Earlier Monday, Norway's Trygve Kalleberg was appointed acting UN police commissioner in Kosovo. He replaces Stephen Curtis, who resigned last week after that deadly clash.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Constitutional Court approved amendments to the Referendum Act, stipulating that a president may be sacked if the majority of referendum voters say so, without a 50% turnout. Though very popular, President Traian Basescu faces an impeachment referendum on May 19th, after Parliament voted to suspend him last month for unconstitutional behaviour. His Democratic Party insists the new amendment cannot be applied retroactively. A new poll by ISOMAR agency finds 71% of voters will answer 'NO" to the referendum question "Do you agree President Basescu should be suspended?" Turnout is expected to be 79%.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney said Wednesday (25 May) that his country would be the first to come up with a proposal for BiH's admission to the Partnership for Peace programme once the set requirements are met. He spoke at a roundtable titled "NATO -- Advantages and Challenges", held in Banja Luka. McElhaney repeated that the most important condition remains BiH's full co-operation with The Hague tribunal.
In other news Wednesday, the EU Police Mission in BiH said it was disappointed with Republika Srpska (RS) police chief Dragomir Andan's failure to retract his allegations that terrorist groups were operating on Bosnian territory and had links to last year's train bombings in Madrid. Andan stopped short of that, apologising this week only for causing public anxiety. (Dnevni avaz - 26/05/05; Fena, RTRS, NTV Hayat, PBS BiH - 25/05/05)

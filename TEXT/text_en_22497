BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu said on Wednesday (November 12th) he plans to appoint a prime minister whom he can trust and who would be able to form a parliamentary majority. Commenting on his plans for a new government after the November 30th elections, Basescu made clear he trusts neither main opposition Social Democratic Party leader Mircea Geoana nor incumbent Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu of the National Liberal Party. Basescu said he prefers Theodor Stolojan of the Democratic Liberal Party for the position, but is looking at others as well. According to the constitution, the president picks the prime minister and parliament must respect his decision or risk being dissolved.
In other news Wednesday, Tariceanu unveiled a four-year action plan aimed at limiting the impact of the global economic crisis. "Over the next four years, we will grant at least 10 billion euros in investments to key sectors of the Romanian economy," Tariceanu said after a session of the country's banking association. He added the plan envisions a "tax bonus" of 5% for those who pay their taxes on time. (Evenimentul Zilei, Cotidianul, Gardianul, Nine o'clock - 13/11/08; AFP - 12/11/08)

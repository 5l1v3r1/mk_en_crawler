ATHENS, Greece -- Transport workers in Athens launched a fresh 24-hour strike Wednesday (February 2nd) causing more traffic gridlock in the capital. Buses, trolleys and the railway are stopping service to protest a controversial bill to restructure debt-ridden state-controlled companies. Subway workers went ahead with their protest Tuesday despite a court ruling declaring it illegal. About 600 union activists joined a peaceful rally in Athens against the restructuring bill.
Meanwhile, a 40% hike in the prices of public transport tickets took effect on Tuesday. The 1-euro 90-minute ticket for all modes of public transport now costs 1.20 euros and is only valid for single rides, while the multiple-ride ticket costs 1.40 euros. (Kathimerini, AP, ANA-MPA - 01/02/11)

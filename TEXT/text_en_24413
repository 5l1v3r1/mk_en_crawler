ZAGREB, Croatia -- Farmers ended their protest Thursday (June 11th) after the government accepted most of their demands. About 300 demonstrators used tractors to block parts of Zagreb on Wednesday to protest the spotty payment of state subsidies, low prices for their products and the overall poor state of agriculture in the country. Deputy Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said the government and the farmers have reached an agreement on a minimal buy-out price of milk at 0.30 euros per litre, compared to the current 0.26 euros. Ivica Miketek, leader of the Milk Producers Association, said he was satisfied with the negotiations and said those who aren't should go home anyway. Grain-growers fall into that category, because no agreement was reached on wheat buy-outs. (HINA, Vjesnik, HRT, BTA - 11/06/09)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK urged Serbia on Wednesday (March 12th) to stop interfering in areas of northern Kosovo that are predominantly populated by Serbs. "We are trying to re-establish the courts and trying to re-establish customs control" in an area where Serb protestors torched facilities last month, said Alexander Ivanko, spokesman for the UN mission in Kosovo. "I assume this will take time," he added. 
As for Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic's speech to the UN Security Council on Tuesday, in which Jeremic said Belgrade insists on full implementation of UN Resolution 1244, Ivanko said "we expect them to put their money where their mouth is". He said this includes curtailing "any further enhancement of parallel structures in Kosovo that are not authorised by UNMIK".

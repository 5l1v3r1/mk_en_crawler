SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Constitutional Court President Mato Tadic said Thursday (9 September) that the court plans to discuss Republika Srpska's (RS) failure to implement a decision on municipalities' names. He said the issue would be addressed during the court's next session, later this month. According to Tadic, RS has ignored a court ruling that found the use of "Srpski" ("Serb") in the names of 13 RS municipalities was unconstitutional and should be changed.
In other news Thursday, the BiH House of Peoples passed the law on missing persons. It defines the term "missing person" and envisions measures to bolster the search process, as well as the rights of missing persons' families. Since the draft adopted by the upper house differs from one approved by the House of Representatives, a committee must now reconcile the bills. (Dnevni avaz - 10/09/04; FENA - 09/09/04)

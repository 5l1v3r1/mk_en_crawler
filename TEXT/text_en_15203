ZAGREB, Croatia -- The latest opinion poll by the Vecernji List, published on Monday (28 August), suggests a razor thin margin between the ruling HDZ party and the main opposition SDP. The HDZ got 20.6 per cent of support, compared to SDP's 20.2 per cent. The HSP was third with 6.6 per cent. Croatia's next parliamentary elections are scheduled for the end of 2007, but the two largest parties already are exchanging harsh rhetoric. Vecernji List noted that this seems to have confused eligible voters, as the share of undecided climbed from 28 per cent in July to 38 per cent in August. (Vecernji List - 28/08/06)

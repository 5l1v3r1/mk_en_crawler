THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Anton Nikiforov, a spokesman for the chief UN prosecutor reminded Serbia on Wednesday (26 April) that the international community expects Ratko Mladic to be arrested by the end of April. He denied media reports claiming that Belgrade had been granted another extension. The EU has warned it would suspend negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia-Montenegro if the country fails to keep its promise to arrest the fugitive Bosnian Serb general. However, it postponed an earlier end-of-March deadline following pledges by Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica that Mladic's arrest is imminent. 
In Belgrade Wednesday, Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Zoran Stankovic said Mladic is not being protected by the military and that his ministry has met all tribunal requests for archival information. (Blic - 27/04/06; Reuters, Tanjug - 26/04/06)

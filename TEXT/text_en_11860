SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown denied Sunday (19 December) that he is considering the abolition of Republika Srpska (RS). In a statement for the media, Ashdown said he had never mentioned such a possibility, adding that the existence of the Serb entity in BiH is guaranteed by the Dayton Agreement. At the same time, he emphasised that RS must fulfil its obligations under the accord, including the arrest and extradition of indicted war criminals. He said he had to take decisive action because of repeated violations and obstruction by local officials. 
Ashdown's imposition of sanctions Thursday was followed by the resignation of Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic. BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic, a member of Mikerevic's Party of Democratic Progress, has also stepped down. RS President Dragan Cavic has called for leaders of the Serb political formations to meet on Monday to discuss the appointment of a new cabinet.

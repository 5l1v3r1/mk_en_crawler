BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu on Wednesday (September 24th) criticised the government for the poor absorption of EU funds allocated to modernise the country's transport infrastructure. In an address to parliament, Basescu said that since the beginning of the year, Romania could have absorbed over 1bn euros in structural and cohesion funds, but the country failed to line up enough projects aimed at upgrading road and railway networks to make good use of the funds. He warned that a lack of investment in the infrastructure is hindering the country's economic and social development. He also blamed lawmakers for failing to take efficient measures against corruption. (Evenimentul Zilei, Adevarul - 25/09/08; Mediafax, Agerpres, Ziare - 24/09/08)

If possible, provide a breakdown by size of enterprise in each of the sectors considered. 
The Macedonian industry is charaterized by high concentration in several sectors. According to the data for 2003, the situation is as follows: Eight biggest industrial sectors (one third of the total number) create 15.13% of the total GDP and employ 18.88% of the total number of employees in the Macedonian economy. The same industrial sectors are principal exporters which create for more than 80% of the export of the industry. The food industry is the biggest industrial sector with contribution of 3.83% of the total GDP. This sector employs 3.67% of the labour force in the entire economy and createalmost 16% of the export of industrial goods. Thus, a conclusion can be drawn that the food industry is mostly oriented towards the domestic market. Exactly due to this reason, the food industry is one of the most vital industrial sectors in the recent years. Nevertheless, with the trade liberalization and the accession of the country to the WTO (World Trade Organization), as well with the signing of numerous bilateral free trade agreements, the food industry is faced with a growing competition on the domestic market, which imposes a need for its restructuring and improvement of the competitiveness. The investments, depending on the year, vary between 5% and 10% of the total investments in the economy. The production of electricity is the second largest industrial sector with participation of 3.81% in the total GDP. Due to the capital-intensive character of this sector, it employs only 1.98% of the labour force in the entire economy. At the same time, it is the largest investor absorbing 13.54% of the total investments in the economy. As a result of the lack of electricity for domestic needs, this sector is exclusively oriented towards the domestic market.  Although the textile industry has a relatively lower participation in the total GDP (1.98), it employs 7.38% of the labour force in the entire economy and create30% of the total industrial export. The textile industry is mostly export oriented and is the second biggest export industry. Due to the labour-intensive character of this industry the investments are relatively small and amount to 1.63% of the total investments in the economy. The production of basic metals, although it contributes 1.09% of the total GDP of the industry, represents the largest export sector with a participation of 30% in the total industrial export. This sector is exclusively export oriented and is almost entirely in foreign ownership.

4. Sector-specific standards and technical regulations, including sector-related requirements for environmental protection 
With the Law on standardisation from 1995 ("Official Gazette of RM" No. 23/95), 11.610 standards were accepted as macedonian standards – S, as well as technical provisions (rulebooks on quality, orders on compulsory attesting, rulebooks on technical normatives etc.). Most of these regulations have not been abolished and are still in use, i.e. they are enforced by the authorized ministries and bodies within the ministries. Most of the standards were compulsory. With the new Law on Standardisation ("Official Gazette of RM" No. 54/02), all Macedonian standards are voluntary. In accordance with the Law on prescribing  technical reqiurements for products and conformity assessment ("Official Gazette of RM" No.55/02), chnical provisions are under authority of the respective ministries. The standards in Macedonia are grouped within 18 main branches, as follows:   Branch A: Basic and common standards (6 main groups) – total of 101 standards   Branch B: Mining and processing of minerals, oil and petroleum (10 main groups) – total of 1138 standards   Branch C: Metalurgy and metal processing technology (13 main groups) – total of 1079 standards   Branch D: Forestry, wood industry and processing of wood materials (11 main groups) – total of 559 standards   Branch E: Agriculture, food and tobacco industry (9 main groups) – total of 397 standards   Branch F: Textile and apparel (8 main groups) – total of 321 standards   Branch G: Leather industry, rubber and plastics (8 main groups) – total of 446 standards   Branch H: Chemical industry (14 main groups) – total of 1724 standards   Branch I: Information technology and data processing (7 main groups) – total of 62 standards   Branch J: Energy (1 main groups) – total of 2 standards   Branch K: Tools and equipment industry  (16 main groups) – total of 842 standards   Branch L: Industry for measuring and other devices and precise mechanical devices (10 main groups) – total of 100 standards   Branch M: Production of machinery and metal processing industry (15 main groups) – total of 1726 standards   Branch N: Electrical equipment (15 main groups) – total of 1784 standards   Branch O: Railroad vehicles, devices and parts (10 main groups) – total of 367 standards   Branch P: Shipbuilding, devices and plants for river traffic and maritime traffic  (1 main groups) – total of 1 standards   Branch U: Civil construction (12 main groups) – total of 533 standards   Branch Z: Standards not classified in any particular group (10 main groups) – total of 428 standards Actual Macedonian standards are not harmonized with European standards, except for the branch  U: Civil construction, where five European standards in the field of thermal insulation are adopted as Macedonian standards (See   20H01_I_C_3Environment protection from pollution caused by technological processes of industrial plants in Republic of Macedonia is regulated by various laws and regulations. Most important laws being: “Law on Air Quality” (“Official Gazette of RM” no. 67/2004), “Law on Physical and Urban planning” (“Official Gazette of RM” no. 4/96, 28/97, 18/99, 93/01, 45/02) and Law on Waters (“Official Gazette of RM” no. 4/98), while most important regulations are: “Rules for maximum allowed concentration and quantities of harmful substances which can be released in the air from various sources of pollution” (“Official Gazette of RM” no. 3/90), which regulates the emission norms for quality of exhaust gases from various industrial plants pertaining to total dust, organic materials in form of solid particles, emission of organic compounds and emission of carcinogenic substances. These Rules also determine the emission norms from power dependant (1-50 MW; 50-300 MW; and above 300 MW) combustible plants for thermal energy for heating and industrial processes, as well as  norms for emission of harmful compounds from other technological processes, such as:    cement factories;   furnace of boxit, dolomite, gypsum, heat, magnesit, quarcite, chamotte;   furnace of clay ceramic products;   plants for transformation of mineral raw materials primarily basalt, and processing of dross;  glassworks;   plants for production or melting of mixtures of bitumen or tar with mineral materials, asphalt bases;   production of nitric acid    production of sulphuric acid;  chlorine production;   production of fertilizers;    production of substances for protection of plants;   refineries for mineral oils;   plants for grinding and drying of carbon   car polishing  printing houses   plants and sections for impregnation of glass and mineral fibres   plants for production of wood, fiber and linked plates (including and plywood sheet   plants for wood processing    plants for agglomeration of iron ore   plants for gaining of cruel colored metals   plants for gaining of iron alloys with electric thermic or other procedure    plants for gaining of steel in convertors, electrical furnaces, plants for melting in vacuum, steel melting and cruel alloy   plants for melting ferro-alloys (by electro-thermal melting processes and others)   aluminum production    plants for aluminium melting    plants for melting and refine of ferro-alloys and their compounds except aluminium    plants for metal rolling, furnace for heating and thermal processing;    casting of ferro-alloys    plants for hot coating with zinc   plants for surface processing of metals with nitric acid   plants for production of lead batteries This Rules will be revised according to the new directives of EU. Special Regulation, according to the Law of Physical and Urban Planning, determines the standards and norms for environment protection in design of structures, as well as the preparation of reports for evaluation of impacts upon the environment (“The Rulebook on standards and normatives for physical arrangement” – Official Gazette of RM no. 2/2002, 50/2003). This regulation classifies industrial objects into 5 categories, depending on technological processes applied, or on their expected impact upon the environment:    Class I:    Crude oil refineries;   production of chemicals and warehouses for chemical products    production of pesticides and pharmaceutical products   production of lead batteries    production of artificial mineral fibers   production of asbestos and products that contain asbestos   production and storage of gunpowder padding, explosive amunition   terminals for cancelling and combustion installations, recycling and chemical treatment of industrial, dangerous and waste materials    terminals for nuclear waste   bloomeris and steel mills, blacksmith shops, rolling mills, metal casting,    production and processing of ferro-alloys   mines and exploitation of metals and non-metals    thermal power plants   production of cement, heat, etc.   production of glass and glass wool   leather and leather clothing factories    farms for breeding of poultry, pigs, cows, cattle, sheep, goat  slaughter houses  pounds   waste water refining stations above 5000 ecological units per inhabitants Class II:   factories for cleaning, grease removal and bleach of wool and fibers    production of vegetable and animal butterfat   production of fiberplate, plywood sheet and plywood    production of wood mass and paper   production and procession of cellulose   station for refining of waste waters from 2001 to 5000 ecological units per inhabitant Class III:   packing and preservation of animal products   production of alcoholic beverages, vine, beer and malt   production of industrial starch   production of asphalt, concrete   station for refining of waste waters up to 2000 units per inhabitant Class IV:  dairy farms   packing and preservation of vegetable products   production of non-alcoholic beverages   production of sugar, pastry and syrup    processing of tobacco and production of cigarettes   brick production, ceramics products, porcelain and majolica    cemeteries and crematory Class V:  pipelines   warehousing of pig iron    production of knitted fabrics, carpets, spin, cotton fabrics, flax, wool  mills  bakeries A sanitary protection zone - minimal distance between objects and dwelling settlements - is determined for every class of objects, for objects from the Class I being above 1200m, for Class II 801 – 1200m, for Class III 501 – 800m, for Class IV 201 – 500m, and for Class V 50 – 200 metres. Apart from that, evaluation of impacts during the preparation of technical documentation is conducted for every project of these classes.   The Law on Waters (“Official Gazette of RM no. 4/98”), sets the base for enactment of norms for emission of pollution substances in surface waters from various industrial sources, but until today they have not been prepared. Control of pollution is conducted via special waste water emission permits issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy, performed on the basis of case by case evaluation of objects.  New legal acts: Draft Law on Environment Protection , Law on Air Quality (“Official Gazette of RM no. 67/2004”); Draft Law on Waters, Law on Waste Management (“Official Gazette of RM no. 68/2004”) and Law on Nature Protection (“Official Gazette of RM no. 67/2004”), stipulate the base for revision of above mentioned Rules in context of contemporary European standards encompassed by Best Available Technologies (BAT) for reduction, prevention and elimination of pollution (Directive no. 96/61/EEC for Integrated Precluding of Pollution – IPPC), for revision of objects for which evaluation of their impact on the environment is performed according to the EU Directive no. 85/337 (for evaluation of effects from private and public projects upon the environment), as well as for strategic evaluation of impacts.   The new Law on Waters, which is undergoing the Parliamentary enactment procedure, sets the base for adoption of norms which will be prepared according to European Directives. This Law approximates the EU Directive (no. 2000/60/EEC ) concerning water policy and other relevant Directives within the field encompassed by the EU Regulatory Framework.  Related to waters the liabilities of the industrial sector are derived by a need to receive integrated waste water permission for objects stipulated by the Draft Law on Environment Protection and Law on Physical and Urban Planning.  The Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning is preparing an Order in a form of a Proposal for prohibition of production and sale of powder detergents which contain phosphates on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia. According to the Action plan, the Order it is planned to be implemented as of September 2005.  In this context, the Draft Law on Environment Protection introduces issuing of integrated ecological permissions for banning and control of pollution and permissions for harmonization followed by operating plans. Namely, activities of new and existing installations may be performed only after receiving an integrated ecology permission A (to be issued by  Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning) and integrated ecology permission B (to be issued by the unit of local self-government). New installations may apply for integrated permissions immediately  if they have already been harmonized with new standards for environment protection, whereas existing installations should submit a request for harmonization followed by an operating plan as a condition to continue with the work. The operating plan is a document which contains measures, phased solutions and deadlines for fulfillment of conditions for acquiring integrated ecological permission. Activities should be realized within the given period (agreed through negotiations between the ministry and the installations operator), and at the end the installation should acquire an integrated ecology permission A. The agreement will be obligatory for the operator and disrespect will cause certain sanctions. The period of three years starting from 01.01.2006 up to 30.12.2008, which is envisaged for applying is divided in six semesters, in which period all industrial plants separated into six sectors, can apply for permissions. The first semester is reserved for the production and processing of metals industrial sector. In this context, few legal acts pertaining to certain industrial sectors are in final phase of preparation, and they will be enacted after the enactment of the Draft Law on Environment Protection: 1.  Decree for determination of installations for which integrated ecological permission is issued with time schedule for submittion of operating plans, contains the following installations:   Installations for which A integrated ecology permission is issued   Installations for which B integrated ecology permission is issued 2.  Rules for arrangement of procedure for acquiring of A integrated ecological permission and permission for harmonization with operating plan.  3.  Decree for determination of projects for which evaluation of environmental impact is performed, by which the projects are separated as to ones for which compulsory evaluation is needed and ones for which only a need for evaluation is determined  
5. Incentives  

) Tax and customs incentives and exemptions for investment The Profit Tax Law (“Official Gazette of RM” no. 80/1993, 51/2003) stipulates the following tax incentives and exemptions for the taxpayers - legal entities: 
1. According to Article 33, the calculated tax of the taxpayer where funds of foreign entities are invested is reduced proportionally with the participation of the foreign capital, conditioned that the participation of foreign capital is at least 20% of the total fixed assets. Purchase of shares by a foreign entity is also considered as funds invested by foreign entities. The tax exemption also refers to taxpayers established fully with  foreign capital. The tax exemption refers only for a period of the first three years commencing from the year in which the profit is generated, conditioned that the taxpayer which used this exemption will operate for at least additional three years after the expiry of the last year in which it used the right to tax exemption.  If the taxpayer ceases its operation before the expiry of the period of six years, he looses the right to tax exemption, and based on that, is obliged to pay the tax which is revalued by applying the rate of increase of the retail prices in accordance with the data issued by the State Statistical Office.. 
2. According to Article 31, the tax base of the taxpayer is reduced for the amount of the investments in immovables and movables up to Euro 100.000 in denar equivalent, in the current year, except for investments in vehicles, furniture, carpets, works of art from the fine and applied art, and other ornaments for equipping administrative premises. If the taxpayer fails to use the tax exemption by the end of the current year, it is entitled to carry it forward to the next period, until it is fully utilized.     The tax base of the taxpayer is reduced up to 30%, for the amount of the investments in  real estate and movable property exceeding Euro 100.000 in denar equivalent in the current year, except for investments in vehicles, furniture, carpets, works of art from the fine and applied art, and other ornaments for equipping administrative premises, but not more than the unused amount  of the investment. In order to realize the tax exemption right, the taxpayer is obliged not to alienate the estate within the period of three years, commencing from the year in which the investment is incurred.  
3. According to Article 30, tax exemption is also entitled on the base of accelerated depreciation of fixed assets, in cases of technological modernization or procurement of environment and natural protection goods, but up to an amount of 25 percent above the depreciation calculated according to one of the methods for depreciation calculation. 
4. According to Article 32, the tax base of a taxpayer investing in economically underdeveloped municipalities as well as in specific regions (mountainous regions, border region and compactly underdeveloped regions) is reduced by the amount of the invested funds, but at most up to 50% of the base. 
5. According to Article 32-a, taxpayer beneficiary of a free economic zone  is exempt from profit tax payment for period of ten years, from the commencement of the performance of the activity in the free economic zone, on conditions and in a procedure determined with the Law on Free Economic Zones.  
6. According to Article 35, the tax base of the taxpayer is reduced for the amount of the funds invested in environment and nature protection.  
7. According to Article 36, business start-ups  that generate profit in first year of their operation, are entitled to reduction of the calculated tax by 50%.  Taxpayer which has undergone statutory changes (merger, acquisition, division, ownership transformation, etc.) shall not be deemed as a new entity.

8. Likely developments, and time-scale a) Investment envisaged (public sector, private sector, foreign) b) Present or envisaged restructuring or modernisation plans 
a)  The envisaged investments, particularly in the public sector, infrastructure (roads, railway,energy sector) will contribute in boosting not only of the construction sector, but also to all other complementary sectors. Investment in electrical energy is of special importance being a driving force for future development and attracting foreign investors. This sector is undergoing structural reforms and transformation of the integrated monopoly (ESM-Electric Power Company of Macedonia) through separation of the distribution system operator  which will remain in state ownership from the other parts of the company which will be privatized through sale to strategic partner.   Transformation (restructuring) and privatization in the railway sector is also planned, also being considered as attractive sector to foreign investors. More detailed information on investment incentives can be found in the answer of point 5 in this chapter.

9. Approximation of national legislation to Community legislation a) List of measures, either planned or already adopted b)Timetable 
a)   A National Programme for Approximation of Legislation (NPAL) for 2004 has been adopted which includes The Action Plan for  Technical Standardization Harmonisation and Technical Regulations with EU Legislation. The NPAL also includes the technical regulations from other ministries that are responsible for harmonisation of legislation and are  in correlation with the industrial sectors in the field of industrial policy. 
 A.  The existing relevant technical regulations for raw materials, non-ferrous metals, ferro-alloys, cement, glass, ceramics, paper and wood, publishing activities (18 rulebooks and 6 decrees) which are being used in this field have not  been harmonised with the European regulations yet. By-laws  of the Law on prescribing  technical reqiurements for products and conformity assessment (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 55/02) will be passed  and will be harmonized with the Council Directive 93/68/EEC of 22 July 1993 amending Directive 89/106/EEC (building materials). It is planned A Law on Minerals to be passed which will be harmonised with the Council Directive of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment and Council Directive 97/11/EC of 3 March 1997 amending Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment.  See 22H15_I_II_A_3, point 9. 
B.  The field of chemical products and rubber is regulated by the existing regulations.  The national legislation differentiates the chemicals according to the requirements of each law respectively. Rulebook on Marketing Products of General Use  (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 26/83)   Law on Production of Toxins(“Official Gazette of RM” No. 18/76)   Law on Traffic of Toxins (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 13/91)   Law on Transport of Dangerous Materials (“Official Gazette of RM”   No. 12/93)   Law on Pharmaceutical Drugs, Supplementary Treatment Substances and Medical Devices (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 21/98)   Law on Precursors (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 37/2004)   Rulebook on labelling toxic substances which are on sale on the domestic market  (Official Gazette of the SFRY  No. 32/86)   Rulebook on the way of destroying unused poisons and wrapping material used for packing poisons and on the way of withdrawing poisons out of sale (Official Gazette of the SFRY No. 7/83).

The pneumatics (tyres) intended for use of road vehicles fulfill the regulations determined by Homologation Order UN ECE R54 - Order on Mandatory Homologation of tyres of Commercial Vehicles and their Trailers, except for Passenger Vehicles  (Official Gazette of the SFRY No. 11/85) which was renewed and adopted by the Homologation Order for compulsory A-Test of vehicles on wheels, equipment and parts which can be built in and/or used in  vehicles on wheels (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 89/2000, 95/2001, 21/2002, 45/2002, 35/2004) The pneumatics (tyres) for tractors and their trailers are regulated by Commission Regulation (EC) No 106/2000 of 18 January 2000, and repaired tyres for motor vehicles and their trailers from vehicle categories M, N, O must meet the requirements of EC Guidelines No. 108 and 109 in the previously stated Guidelines. Commission Regulation (EC) No 106/2000 is planned to come into force, which refers to the pneumatics (tyres) for tractors and their trailers and it means there is a legal base for harmonization of national regulations with the requirements of the stated Guidelines. Within this field a new Law on Chemicals is envisaged to be adopted  as well as bylaws originating  from this Law.  In the Law on Chemical the following Directives will be harmonized: Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967, Commission Directive 2001/59/EC of 6 August 2001.  See 23H15_I_II_B_1, point 9.

D.  Bylaw relating to telecommunications terminal equipment in which the Directive 98/13/EEC will be harmonised and it will be transposed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications in 2005/2006; Directive 98/48/EEC amending Directive 98/34/EC laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations for information services  (will be transposed with the Law on Electronic communications which is in Parliamentary procedure);    
E.  The State Inspectorate for Technical Inspection (a body within the Ministry of Economy) is  competent for enforcement of the laws and regulations which regulate this field in :   construction and reconstruction of steam boilers;    construction, reconstruction, embodying, production and use of water heating boilers, stable pressure vessels, as well as all equipment considered as devices under pressure,    technical features and structure of material used for processing, production of steam boilers and  pressure vessels,    fulfilment of working conditions for employees who  operate with steam boilers,    fulfilment of conditions of legal and physical entities, dealing with designing , construction, manufacture and installation and use of steam machines and boilers. Our national legislation regulates all procedures for medical aids (devices)  with  Law on Pharmaceutical Drugs, Supplementary Treatment Substances and Medical Devices (“Official Gazette of RM” No.  21/98). At present, a working group is preparing  a  new Rulebook on Medical Devices  in accordance  with  the European directives. The following bylaws will be adopted in accordance with the Action Plan within 2005/2006:   Bylaws relating to pressure  vessels  where the Directives 87/404/EEC, 90/488/EEC and 93/68/EEC will be harmonised.   Bylaw  relating to appliances burning gaseous fuels  90/396/ЕЕС, 93/68/ЕЕС  Bylaw  relating hot-water boilers will be harmonized with Council Directive 92/42/EEC   Bylaw concerning medical devices will be harmonised with Council Directive 93/42/EEC.   Bylaw on diagnostic medical devices where the Directive 98/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council  will be harmonized. 
F.  In this field, 51 regulations are valid (one law, 4 orders i.e  decrees and 46 rulebooks) which have not been harmonised with the EU standards yet.  The Law on Construction with accompanying bylaws are in their final stage of preparation, and their adoption and implementation is expected in 2005; The preparation of Law on Building Materials and Bylaws will begin in 2005, and its adoption is expected in 2006.  These legal acts are completely harmonized with Council Directive 89/106/EEC relating to building materials. 
G.  In this field 22 regulations are being implemented which have not been harmonised yet. The Republic of Macedonia has been maintaining the continuity in the homologation of road vehicles since 1962 based on succession from SFRY through  adoption of the Geneva Convention from 1958, which was also adopted by the Republic of Macedonia on 17th November 1991 (“Official Gazette of RM” No.  89/2000).  Several Orders on Homologation have been enacted based on the Geneva Convention:    Order for compulsory attesting (homologation) of vehicles on wheels, equipment     and parts which can be built in and/or used for vehicles on wheels (“Official Gazette of RM” No.  89/2000; 95/2001; 21/2002; 45/2002; 35/2004).    Order for compulsory attesting (homologation) of the vehicles on wheels of the equipment  and parts from motor vehicles (“Official Gazette of RM” No.  84/2001; 21/2002; 31/2002; 52/2002; 26/2004; 35/2004).   By passing the Additions and Amendments to the Law on  Road Transport Safety (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 14/98; 38/2004) and the Law on Prescribing  Technical Requirements for Products and Conformity Assessment (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 55/2002) a legal base is created, through the adopted ECE homologation Rulebooks for vehicle categories L, M, N, O and the corresponding ECE Directives to implement the directives relating to the homologation of the vehicles as a whole. Automatism is also implemented in the procedure of adopting the ECE Rulebooks, and in the national legislation dynamics is introduced for certain Rulebooks through the ECE Rulebooks i.e through EEC Directives  to become completely harmonised in the implementation of the European Directives in this field.  
H.  In the preparation of the Law on  Safety of Foodstuffs and Product and Materials in Contact with Foodstuffs (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 54/02), the  Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council is taken  as a basis. The law is normative-technically prepared to be internationally acceptable, having both horizontal and vertical regulation (Basic Law and a large number of Bylaws).   The analogy of this law is found in the structure of Codex Alimentarius and in the structure of the European Food Legislation. The national legislation of the Republic of Macedonia in the area of health safety of food has not yet been completely harmonised with international standards. With adoption of the Law on  Safety of Foodstuffs and Product and Materials in Contact with Foodstuffs the process of harmonization of the legal framework with the EU regulations has been initiated.

9. Approximation of national legislation to Community legislation a) List of measures, either planned or already adopted 
The main act that regulates the field  of mineral raw materials and extractive industries is the Law on Mineral Resources (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 18/99 and 29/02). Constitutional basis for passing this law is article 56 paragraph 1 from the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, according to which the goods for general use determined by law, are goods of public welfare and they are under  special protection, as well as under paragraph 3 from this article according to which by law are determined the manner and conditions under which these goods can be transferred for utilization.  Other laws that regulate this area are:   Law on Concessions (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 25/2002,24/2003)   Law on Technical Inspection (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 48/99)   Law on Construction of Investment Objects (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 15/90, 11/91, 11/94, 18/99,)   Law on Units of Measurement and Meters (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 23/95)   Law on Protection at Work (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 13/98, 33/00, 29/02)         Law on Agricultural Land (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 25/98,  18/99   2/04)   Law on Construction Land (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 53/01  97/01)   Law on Forests (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 47/97, 7/2000)   Law on Protection from Explosive Materials (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 4/78, 10/78, 51/88, 36/90  12/93)   Law on Traffic of Explosive Materials (Official Gazette of SFRY No. 30/85, 6/89  53/91 and Official Gazette of RM No. 12/93) In  respect of the Law on Concessions it is important to emphasize that this Law regulates the method and procedure for gaining concessions in the mineral area, as well as all other areas for which concessions are required.  New draft proposal to the Law on Mineral Resources is prepared because the implementation of the National programme on approximation of the legislation of the Republic of Macedonia to the EU legislation requires additional provisions to this Law. The new provisions are in direction of creating conditions for sustainable development with the exploitation of mineral raw materials which are non-renewable natural resource. Additionally, the new provisions envisage optimal protection of the environment. These objectives will be achieved implicitly through the Law on Environment Protection, Law on Waters and by including provisions from five directives of the European Union and two international agreements in the area of natural resources management in the Law on Mineral Resources. These are:  Directive 85/337/ЕЕС and the provisions to Directive 97/11/ for assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment;  Directive 96/61/concerning integrated pollution prevention and control Directive 2001/42/ for assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment;   Directive  2003/4/ for public access to environmental information;   Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy;   Aarhus Convention of the United Nations on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to the rights in Environmental Matters    Kiev Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment.  For implementation of the targets for sustainable development in the mineral sector within industry, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, in accordance with the provisions of the draft proposal of the Law on Mineral Resources, will prepare National Programme and long term plans for sustainable use of the more significant mineral raw materials. These strategic documents will determine the intensity and dynamics of exploitation of the mineral raw materials by respecting the features and size of the ore reserves of separate mineral raw materials, as well as the need for their valorization on the domestic and international market.  
b) Timetable Time limit for enforcement of the draft proposal of the Law on Mineral Resources is March 2005. Administrator of the project is the Ministry of Economy. In the course of 2005 seven rulebooks that are envisaged in the draft proposal of the Law on Mineral Resources will be prepared while the rest of the rulebooks will be completed during 2006 and 2007. The Ministry of Economy is the administrator for preparing the rulebooks.

1) c) domestic demand and 1) d) national self-supply ratio:  "For calculation of 1) c) and 1) d), import-further processing and export-further processing are deducted from the import and the export.„ 1) d) national self-supply ratio:  "Negative values occur in cases when there is no domestic production, or when it is by far lower than import. Negative values are due to export of previously imported goods (re-export). 2) c) exports / production ratio and import / production ratio:  "For calculation of 2) c) import-further processing and export-further processing are included in the import and the export„. 2) c) exports / production ratio:  "Indices over 100 occur in cases when there is no domestic production, or it is very low, while the country imports goods, out of which part is exported to third countries (re-export)„. 2)c) import / production ratio:  "Indices over 100 occur in cases when there is no domestic production or when it is by far lower than the recorded imports.  3) d) Structure of enterprises:  "State Statistical Office does not possess data for plant and machinery and plant and machinery in active use„. 3) f) Largest enterprises: "Gross output has been used as a indicator for the production of the enterprise„. 3) f) Largest enterprises: "The symbol * next to the name of the enterprise indicates that the presented NACE activity is auxiliary to the enterprise. The enterprise is not registered for the auxiliary NACE activity at the State Statistical Office. These data have been prepared by the Ministry of Economy“. 3) f) Largest enterprises: "The symbol ** next to the figures for gross output and number of employed indicates that the data is for 2002.

Because of this, it is not possible to calculate productivity per hour worked. Productivity per employee is calculated as a ratio between the Gross value added and the number of employees„. 
4. Sector-specific standards and technical regulations, including sector-related requirements for environmental protection  
With the Law on standardisation from 1995 ("Official Gazette of RM" No. 23/95), 11.610 standards were accepted as macedonian standards – S, as well as technical provisions (rulebooks on quality, orders on compulsory attesting, rulebooks on technical normatives etc.). Most of these regulations have not been abolished and are still in use, i.e. they are enforced by the authorized ministries and bodies within the ministries. Most of the standards were compulsory. With the new Law on Standardisation ("Official Gazette of RM" No. 54/02), all Macedonian standards are voluntary. In accordance with the Law on Prescribing  Technical Reqiurements for Products and Conformity Assessment ("Official Gazette of RM" No.55/02), chnical provisions are under authority of the respective ministries. Based on the Law on Standardisation ("Official Gazette of RM" No. 54/02), the Institute for Standardisation established a commission that made 8 draft standards which are translated and are identical to the European standards from the area of cement: N 196 – 1; N 196 – 2; N – 196 – 3; N 196 – 4; N 196 – 5; N – 6; N – 21; N 197 – 1 cement – part one and N – 197 – 2. Their adoption is expected. In relation to technical regulations (rulebooks on quality, decrees on compulsory attesting, rulebooks on technical normatives etc.) in the area of construction and construction products, there are 46 regulations, nd some of them apply in other areas too. More significant regulations (rulebooks) are: Rulebook on technical normatives for construction of high-construction objects in seismic areas (Official Gazette of SFRY No. 31/81, 49/82, 29/83, 21/88, 52/90), Rulebook on technical norms for reinforced concrete and concrete products (Official Gazette of SFRY No.15/90, 26/88), Rulebook on technical normatives for designing and performance of final works in construction (Official Gazette of SFRY No. 14/89) etc. On the sector-related requirements for environmental protection, See 62H15_I_II_A , point 4.

9. Approximation of national legislation to Community legislation a) List of measures, either planned or already adopted With the purpose of approximation of national legislation to Community legislation in the area of cement, we will start making a Law on Building Materials and by-laws that will be completely in accordance with the requirements of the Directive 89/106/C for construction products. The Law on building and the by-laws that derive from this Law are in preparation (this Law is being prepared by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning). The control of cement quality will be done by certifying, inspection bodies that will be accredited in accordance with EU requirements – accreditation standards from EU series U 45000 and ISO 17000. 
b) Timetable The Law on building with its attending by-laws is in the final phase, and its adoption and enforcement is expected in 2005. The Law on Building Materials and by-laws will be made starting from 2005, and its adoption and enforcement is expected in 2006.  B. Chemicals and rubber

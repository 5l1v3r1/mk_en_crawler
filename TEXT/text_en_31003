NEW YORK, United States -- Greece should immediately move migrants from overcrowded and inhumane detention facilities in the Evros region to an empty facility on the Samos Island and protect 120 unaccompanied children among them, the watchdog group Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Monday (December 6th), after a weeklong fact-finding mission to northern Greece. According to the organisation, the number of migrants from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iraq, Algeria, Syria, Iran and Morocco crossing into Greece from Turkey has risen sharply this year. Some facilities are so overcrowded that migrants can hardly find a place to sleep, HRW reports. Women and children are in the same cells as men, and toilets are limited. The organisation recommended sending detainees to facilities on the islands, separating women and children from men while respecting family unity, and seeking alternatives to detention when possible.

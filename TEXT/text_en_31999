DIYARBAKIR, Turkey -- On Saturday (23 November), the government commuted the death sentences of 180 terrorist organisation members, changing the sentences to life imprisonment. The EU requires that Turkey abandon the death sentence entirely, but most Turkish political parties oppose the EU position. Related changes in the constitution contributed to the fall of Bulent Ecevit's government. Those who received the commuted sentences Saturday were members of either the Kurdish Workers' Party or Hezbollah. (Anatolia Agency, BBC - 23/11/02)

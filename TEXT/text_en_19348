ANKARA, Turkey -- President Abdullah Gul decided on Monday (February 25th) to postpone a planned visit to Africa, in light of Turkey's ongoing ground operation against the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in northern Iraq. The four-day visit, set to begin on Tuesday, included stops in Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo. Gul decided to put off his trip after consultations with the General Staff. No new dates for the visit have been set. 
Meanwhile, the Turkish Army announced that 41 PKK terrorists and two Turkish soldiers died in clashes in northern Iraq on Monday. Since the operation was launched last Thursday, 153 PKK terrorists have been killed along with 17 Turkish troops. (ITAR-TASS - 26/02/08; AFP, Reuters, Zaman, Anadolu news agency - 25/02/08)

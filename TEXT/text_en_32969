ZAGREB, Croatia -- The presidents of Croatia and Romania, Stipe Mesic and Ion Iliescu, agreed Monday (26 May) that their countries should work together for EU membership. Mesic told reporters that Zagreb and Bucharest shared "the same strategic interests, which are integration into EU and NATO as well as the development of their economies". Iliescu praised the exceptionally good ties between Romania and Croatia, but noted that more must be done to boost trade. To that end, the presidents attended the opening of a bilateral economic forum in Zagreb. (Mediafax, Rompres, Vjesnik - 27/05/03; AFP, HINA - 26/05/03)

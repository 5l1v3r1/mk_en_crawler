NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Secretary-General's special adviser on Cyprus, Alexander Downer, said on Friday (June 11th) that ongoing talks to reunify the island should not lose their "momentum". Speaking to journalists at UN headquarters in New York after he briefed the Security Council on the latest developments in Cyprus, Downer said the UN "is very pleased" with the Council's continuing support in assisting the two parties in the negotiations process. Talks to reunify Cyprus resumed in late May after a break for the April presidential elections in the Turkish dominated north, which were won by hardliner Dervis Eroglu.

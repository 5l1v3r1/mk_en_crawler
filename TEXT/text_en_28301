TIRANA, Albania -- Public interest groups criticised a decision that the government took last week to import waste from EU countries and recycle it. The Regional Environmental Centre (REC), speaking on behalf of 29 environmental organisations, condemned the decision Saturday (October 16th). "At a time when Albania expects high environmental pollution and when we expect a law on urban waste, the Council of Ministers takes an unacceptable decision to import urban waste," the REC said in a statement, urging the government to review the legislation. 
The opposition Socialist Party criticised the decision as criminal, and promised to overturn it as soon as it returns to power. The SP itself faced criticism on the same issue in 2004. Back then, the former leader of the party, Fatos Nano, signed a contract to import waste from Italy and recycle it in a factory near Tirana. Public interest groups, however, protested the move on environmental grounds and made the government break off the deal several months later. (Shekulli, Ora News, NOA, Top Channel - 17/10/10)

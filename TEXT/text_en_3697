Parliament passed nine laws related to the Ahtisaari plan on Wednesday (February 20th), covering areas that relate directly to statehood. Former UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari's 12-point plan contained a legal framework that Kosovo began to implement with these laws. 
While ten drafts had been proposed, the assembly passed nine. These include laws on diplomatic immunity, statehood, establishing a police force, establishing a police inspectorate, travel documents, state symbols, special protected zones, local governance and administrative borders of municipalities. 
At the government's recommendation, a law to establish a ministry of foreign affairs was withdrawn. 
The law on diplomatic immunity was presented by Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, who said that Kosovo -- as an independent state â€“ urgently needs functional laws on its books. 
US Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns welcomed the new laws that safeguard the rights of Serbs and other minority populations. He said the United States also considers their safety a priority, adding, "We believe Kosovo's future should be multi-ethnic and multi-religious." 
Twenty-three more laws are expected to be approved by the assembly, whose members say they are committed to implementing provisions of the Ahtisaari plan. 
Parliament's regular session was delayed by 90 minutes, because an ad hoc commission responsible for reviewing and evaluating amendments to legislation did not initially agree with some wording. 
However, following consultations with other members of parliament, they agreed to the modifications. 
Ad hoc commission chief Fehmi Mujota acknowledged that his panel had faced some difficulties during the amendment process, especially in altering terminologies. However, he added, "The laws are in accordance with Ahtisaari's plan and with European standards."

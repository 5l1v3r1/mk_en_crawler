SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Campaigning for the October 3rd general elections officially begins on Friday (September 3rd). The Central Election Commission says it will carefully monitor whether candidates stick to campaign rules and will sanction any use of hate speech or activities instigating violence. More than 8,000 candidates plan to run for office, including 19 hoping to become a member of the tripartite presidency. The rest will run for state and entity parliaments, as well as the assemblies of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina's ten cantons. The candidates represent 50 parties and coalitions, and 13 are independents. A total of 3.1 million voters are eligible to cast ballots next month. (Fena, Nezavisne Novine - 02/09/10)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In a statement released on Monday (April 23rd), High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling scolded the Republika Srpska (RS) Parliament for falsely interpreting the state-level education law. He stressed the state-level law does not contradict the entity's own higher education law and does not require the transfer of responsibility from entity to state level. 
Schwarz-Schilling urged RS lawmakers in both entity and state assemblies to support the draft. Otherwise, he said, BiH would be the only member of the Bologna Process without a state-level higher education law. That would mean BiH's academic qualifications would not be recognised by European employers or higher education establishments.

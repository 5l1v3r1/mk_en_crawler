SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The three leaders of the ruling coalition, Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), Ahmet Dogan of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms and Simeon Saxe-Coburg of NDSV, were scheduled to hold a long-awaited meeting Friday (July 13th) to discuss proposed cabinet changes. If approved by parliament next week, Petar Dimitrov, chairman of parliament's committee on budget and finances, will replace fellow BSP member Rumen Ovcharov as minister of economy and energy. Ovcharov resigned at the beginning of May, after being implicated in a huge corruption scandal. Miglena Tacheva will take over the Justice Ministry from fellow NDSV member Georgi Petkanov, who resigned recently citing health issues.

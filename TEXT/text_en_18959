SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Defence Minister Vesselin Bliznakov said on Saturday (March 3rd) that within ten days, he would submit a proposal to the government for the deployment of more Bulgarian troops to Afghanistan, to guard the airport in Kandahar. Together with the unit serving in Kabul, the number of Bulgarian peacekeepers serving in the International Security Assistance Force would total 400 by the summer. Deployment decisions require approval by the Council of Ministers, not the Parliament. (Monitor - 04/03/07; Darik, Sega - 03/03/07)

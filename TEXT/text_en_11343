SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government on Thursday (26 May) approved a bill related to the definition of symbols at municipal levels. Under the proposed legislation, municipalities would be given the right to choose which symbols are going to represent them. Specifically, the flag representing the ethnic Albanian community could be used in municipalities where they constitute more than 50 per cent of the population. Tetovo, Struga, Gostivar, Cair and Aracinovo are among the 17 municipalities where this rule could be applied. In these municipalities, the Albanian flag could be displayed along with the Macedonian one. (A1 TV - 26/05/05)

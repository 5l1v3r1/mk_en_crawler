BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A spokeswoman for the Bosnian Serb government acknowledged Wednesday (23 October) that investigators have uncovered evidence that a local company exported military material to Iraq in violation of the UN arms embargo. The government is considering penalties for those responsible from the Orao firm, the military headquarters and the defence ministry, she added. The Bosnian Serb Supreme Defence Council will hold an emergency meeting next week to discuss the situation.
The Yugoslav and Serbian governments, meanwhile, have widened the probe into involvement by defence contractor Jugoimport in deals with Iraq. The company apparently acted as an intermediary in Orao's exports of spare aircraft parts to Baghdad. Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica praised the federal government for taking immediate action and predicted that its quick response would preserve both the country's image and international financial assistance.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The war crimes prosecution office has filed charges against six people suspected of helping indictee Stojan Zupljanin evade justice, deputy war crimes prosecutor Bruno Vekaric announced on Tuesday (December 14th). The six allegedly sheltered Zupljanin between May 1992 and June 2008. While on the run, the wartime Bosnian Serb Security Service Centre chief hid at 26 locations in Serbia, also spending time in Moscow, Paris and Nigeria under a false identity, Vekaric said. Arrested in 2008, the UN war crimes tribunal charged Zupljanin with war crimes against Muslim and Croats in the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. His trial started in September 2009.

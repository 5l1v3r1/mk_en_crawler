PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- A UN police spokesman announced Wednesday (9 October) that Milan Ivanovic, chairman of the Serb National Council for northern Kosovo, surrendered to international authorities earlier in the day. He was charged for his alleged role in organising a violent demonstration in Mitrovica on 8 April, which injured 22 police officers. In July, an international judge indicted Ivanovic on charges of attempted murder. The Serb politician, who maintains he is innocent, refused to surrender, insisting that the case against him was politically motivated. There were unconfirmed reports that he changed his mind when he learned that the charges were reduced to participation in rioting. Ivanovic is considered a top Serbian candidate in Kosovo's elections later this month. (FoNet - 10/10/02; B92; AP, Reuters, AFP, Tanjug, BBC, B92 - 09/10/02)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Hungary, Italy and Slovenia -- which with Croatia form the so-called Quadrilateral Group -- backed a quick launch of EU accession talks with Croatia during a meeting of the four countries' foreign ministers in Budapest on Friday (13 May). According to a joint declaration adopted by the participants, the Quadrilateral Group supports Euro-Atlantic integration processes in the region as factors for enduring security, stability and progress. The document noted the importance of the EU assessment task force's role in the Union's final decision about starting membership negotiations with Croatia. Accession talks were delayed in March over the issue of war crimes co-operation. (HINA, HRT - 13/05/05)

STRASBOURG, France -- The European Security and Defence Assembly condemned the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) on Wednesday (December 3rd) and called on the European Council and the Council of the Western European Union (WEU) to be more careful about PKK activities in member countries. At its session Wednesday, the assembly unanimously approved a report on the PKK's activities along the Turkish-Iraqi border. The document urged the EU to firmly implement policies and rules to fight terrorism. The report said members of the EU and the WEU should be sensitive to PKK activities conducted on their territory, such as money laundering, drug trafficking, weapon smuggling, human trafficking and propaganda via TV broadcasts.

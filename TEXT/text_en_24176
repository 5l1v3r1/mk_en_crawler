PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Political leaders in Kosovo expressed their concerns Monday (December 15th) that opening a EULEX office in Belgrade would make Serbia a factor in Kosovo's domestic affairs. EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon said on Sunday that a Belgrade office is planned. Deputy Kosovo Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci stressed that the approach aims to guarantee regional co-operation with the governments of Macedonia, Montenegro, Albania and Serbia. But Ibrahim Makolli of the opposition Alliance for New Kosovo said EULEX is giving Belgrade hopes of involvement in Kosovo's internal affairs. EULEX officials say the office in Belgrade would be completely technical in nature and would not replace UNMIK's co-ordination centre there. (Koha Ditore, Lajm, Express, Zeri, Kosova Sot - 16/12/08)

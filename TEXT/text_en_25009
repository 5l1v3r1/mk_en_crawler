PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The newly established Serb-dominated Gracanica Municipal Assembly held its first session on Tuesday (December 29th), following the November local elections. Mayor Bojan Stojanovic said he is happy to take on the task and welcomed Pristina's support. The Independent Liberal Party holds a majority with 12 of the 19 seats in the local assembly, which is being boycotted by two independent members who are protesting alleged manipulations in the election process.

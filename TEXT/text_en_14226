BUCHAREST, Romania -- The European Commission (EC) has approved the amendments proposed by Romania for the Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development (SAPARD) funding conditions. Samoila Szabo, director of Romaniaâs SAPARD Agency, made the announcement Thursday (11 August). The changes relate to an increase in the co-financing degree; an increase in the eligible amounts of projects; and the inclusion of more beneficiaries -- such as companies in which the state is a minority shareholder and investment projects in urban areas. Szabo said that in light of the decision, he expects SAPARD projects in the country to rise 30 per cent to 50 per cent and the development of the agricultural sector to accelerate.

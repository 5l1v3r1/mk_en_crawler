BELGRADE, Serbia -- While noting general improvement in Serbia's level of co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte reportedly continues to insist that full co-operation requires the arrest of four remaining high profile fugitives. 
She met with the head of the national council for war crimes co-operation, Rasim Ljajic, in Belgrade on Thursday (October 25th), and praised other aspects of the process, such as access to Serbia's military archives. She meets with President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica on Friday, before wrapping up her two-day visit. The assessment she makes will be used by the EU to decide whether to proceed with the initialling of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia.

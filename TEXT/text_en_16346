SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The second round of technical talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between BiH and the EU took place in Sarajevo on Friday (12 May). The primary focus was on issues related to trade liberalisation. At a news conference afterwards, Dirk Lange, head of the EU Enlargement Directorate General unit for Albania and BiH, noted that finalising the SAA talks by year's end depends largely on BiH's progress in reforms, particularly police sector restructuring in line with EU-set principles. The next round of talks will be held in a month. (PBS BiH, Pincom.info - 12/05/06)

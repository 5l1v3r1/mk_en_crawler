BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Fifteen candidates are eligible to run in Serbia's presidential election next month, the republic's Electoral Commission announced Friday (28 May). Among them are ultranationalist Tomislav Nikolic, the Democratic Party's Boris Tadic, Dragan Marsicanin of the ruling coalition, Ivica Dacic of Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist party, and Serbia's richest man, Bogoljub Karic. Princess Jelisaveta Karadjordjevic has also been approved as a candidate. Nikolic, Tadic, and Marsicanin are considered the frontrunners in the 13 June race, according to a new poll by the Faktor Plus agency. Serbia has been without a president since December 2002. Three earlier attempts to elect a head of state failed due to low voter turnout. (Tanjug - 29/05/04; AFP - 28/05/04)

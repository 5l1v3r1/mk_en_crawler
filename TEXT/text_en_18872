ANKARA, Turkey -- Police used tear gas and fired warning shots into the air against several hundred Kurdish protesters on Wednesday (April 4th). The clash occurred while some 4,000 people headed for the native village of jailed Kurdistan Workers Party leader Abdullah Ocalan to celebrate his 58th birthday. Some of the protesters attacked police with stones at a roadblock. Several demonstrators and one officer were injured in the scuffles. In the nearby southeastern town of Birecik, authorities handed out food and toys to keep children inside their schools as demonstrators gathered outside, marking Ocalan's birthday. (AP - 04/03/07)

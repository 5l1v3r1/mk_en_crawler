ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivica Racan was expected to officially submit the completed European Commission (EC) questionnaire to EC President Romano Prodi in Brussels on Thursday (9 October). Parliament endorsed the government's answers to the lengthy EC questionnaire last month, although some questions were left open due to unavailable data. The document is considered crucial for the EC's future decision concerning Croatia's readiness to advance in the EU accession process. The <I>Financial Times</I>reports that Racan will likely be told Croatia could open negotiations to join the EU as early as next year, if it co-operates fully with the UN war crimes tribunal.

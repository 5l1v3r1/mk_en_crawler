PARIS, France -- The rhythm and outcome of talks for Turkey's accession in the EU are closely related to the country's efforts to fulfil the necessary reforms, EU Enlargement Commissioner Rehn told a conference in Paris on Friday (October 3rd). The overwhelmingly Muslim Turkey, with its active diplomacy and democratic, secular system, is a significant actor and an important element of stability in its region, Rehn noted. He also praised Ankara for sending troops to peacekeeping operations in Europe and contributing to the EU's fight against terrorism and drug and human trafficking. Turkey's EU accession would offer significant trade prospects to EU member states, Rehn added. (Hurriyet, Milliyet, Radikal - 04/10/08)

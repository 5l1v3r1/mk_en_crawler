BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro's national council for co-operation with UN war crimes tribunal convenes Monday (1 November) despite a boycott by the Montenegrin representatives. Panel chairman Rasim Ljajic says the Council will discuss issues related to documentation requested by tribunal prosecutors, relieving witnesses from their duty to keep national and military secrets, and aid for the families of indictees. 
 In other news, Serbian presidential adviser Jovan Simic says the government has not yet submitted an official request to prosecute certain war crimes cases in domestic courts. He added that, due to a lack of commitment in Belgrade, chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte's November report to the UN Security Council would likely be negative.

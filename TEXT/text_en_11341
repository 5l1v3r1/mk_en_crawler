BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A letter purportedly written by wartime leader Radovan Karadzic was faxed to the media in Republika Srpska (RS) on Wednesday (22 December). The document, sent from Belgrade and carrying Karadzic's signature, implied he may be considering surrender after years on the run. Local media has recently speculated that Karadzic might turn himself in. Karadzic's wife, however, said Wednesday that the letter was not written in his style, and RS President Dragan Cavic has questioned its authenticity.

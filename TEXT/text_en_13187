BUCHAREST, Romania -- An 82-year old woman, hospitalised in the southeast Romanian town of Galati with bird flu-like symptoms, has tested negative for the disease, according to preliminary test results released Saturday (28 January). However, the final results must come in before bird flu is completely ruled out, doctors said. The woman is from one of villages where avian influenza poultry cases were registered late last year. 
In neighbouring Bulgaria, meanwhile, environment inspectors reported the discovery of about 300 dead birds in protected ecological zones in the country's northeast, near the border with Romania. Initial tests suggested that the wild birds died from freezing temperatures and hunger, rather than bird flu. (Evenimentul Zilei, Focus, BNR - 28/01/06)

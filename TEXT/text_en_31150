PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Brussels and Belgrade are waiting for Pristina to start the dialogue on practical issues in Kosovo. Media reported on Tuesday (January 4th) that Brussels is sending clear signals that it wants talks soon, as is Serbian President Boris Tadic. Belgrade has prepared a platform and selected its team that will lead the talks. The hold-up is in Kosovo, where the December 12th elections process has not yet been completed, so new institutions are not yet established. (Telegrafi, Koha, Alsat - 04/01/11)

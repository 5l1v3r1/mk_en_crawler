TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition parties requested on Thursday (23 February) that another no-confidence vote be held against Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli, warning that they would boycott legislative work until their demand is met. On Wednesday, the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and its coalition partners voted down the first motion against Topalli, a DP member. Four left-wing opposition parties rejected the results, however, as the vote was conducted electronically, rather than by secret ballot. (Albanian News - 24/02/06)

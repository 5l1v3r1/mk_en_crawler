BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn called for a solid and comprehensive political agreement on crucial police reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), following a meeting with BiH parliamentarians in Brussels Tuesday (10 May). Rehn repeated that the European Commission (EC) expects the successful completion of ongoing talks on the issue and fulfillment of commitments made by the main parties during a recent conference in Vlasic. The EU assessment taskforce visits BiH on 19 May. Its findings will help the EC determine whether to open negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with BiH. 
Also Tuesday, the nationalist Serb Democratic Party (SDS) board rejected the principles of mapping future police regions that were agreed upon in Vlasic. According to press reports, the issue might result in a serious rift within SDS. (Nezavisne novine - 11/05/05; Fena, RTRS, PBS BiH - 10/05/05)

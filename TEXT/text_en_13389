ZAGREB, Croatia -- The country's chief negotiator with the EU, Vladimir Drobnjak, explicitly rejected on Wednesday (29 March) allegations by local media that the government lied to the EU during the screening process in the field of education. The publications, citing an unidentified member of the Croatian negotiating team on the education chapter, said Croatian representatives introduced false information -- including inflated figures regarding annual spending on education -- meant to paint a rosy picture of the situation in the sector.
In other news, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili visited Zagreb on Wednesday. Meeting with counterpart Stipe Mesic, Saakashvili said his country was ready to boost ties with Croatia, which he described as a model for transition and successful integration into Euro-Atlantic structures.

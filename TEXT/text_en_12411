TIRANA, Albania -- The OSCE Presence in Tirana issued a statement Thursday (9 December) praising the efforts of the Albanian people, state and political forces in their fight against corruption. The statement came on the occasion of International Anti-Corruption Day, which was observed for the first time in Albania. The same day, however, hundreds of people gathered in Tirana's central square to protest what they describe as pervasive corruption. One of the organisers, Kreshnik Spahiu, told the crowd that graft "is not just a government problem â¦ it has become a mindset". Despite the OSCE statement, Transparency International ranks Albania as still having one of the world's highest levels of corruption. (ATA, OSCE press release, Reuters, AFP - 09/12/04)

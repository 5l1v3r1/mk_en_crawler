SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Lawmakers will vote Thursday (April 10th) on a proposal to dissolve parliament and hold new elections, a move that is unprecedented in the 17 years since independence. The effort began after NATO last week refused to offer Macedonia an invitation to membership until the country resolves its long-running name dispute with Alliance member Greece. The ruling VMRO-DPMNE supports early elections, first proposed by the Democratic Union for Integration, as does the Democratic Party of Albanians. The holdout is the opposition Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia. If the measure is approved, elections must be held no later than June 10th. (Utrinski Vesnik - 10/04/08; Makfax, A1 - 09/04/08)

STRASBOURG, France -- In a report released Thursday (17 October), the Council of Europe (CoE) strongly condemned crimes against Serbs and other non-Albanian minorities in Kosovo. The CoEnoted that while most of the 850,000 ethnic Albanian refugees have returned to the province, only a few thousand of the 230,000 displaced Serbs have returned home. CoE Commissioner on Human Rights Alvaro Gil-Robles reiterated that the UN resolution on Kosovo calls for equal rights for all refugees, regardless of their ethnic identity. (B92 - 17/10/02)

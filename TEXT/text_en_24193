SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov will give the election-winning Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) the mandate to form a government Thursday (July 16th), Boyko Borisov, informal GERB leader and future prime minister, said Tuesday after meeting with Parvanov. Under the constitution, once a mandate is given, the cabinet must receive a vote of confidence from parliament within seven days. Borisov said he expects strong support from all political parties. GERB Chairman Tsvetan Tsvetanov said consultations on a new cabinet are possible with every party in parliament except the two members of the outgoing ruling coalition, the Bulgarian Socialist Party and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms.

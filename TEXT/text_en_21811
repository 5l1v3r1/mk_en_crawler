ANKARA, Turkey -- The Constitutional Court reportedly will debate next week whether to annul the constitutional amendment that allows women to wear the Islamic headscarf in universities. Parliament approved the amendment on February 9th, and President Abdullah Gul ratified the legislation on February 22nd. Polls conducted over the past few years suggest the majority of the public wants the headscarf ban lifted. But eight of the 11 supreme justices were appointed by Former President Ahmed Necdet Sezer, a staunch secularist. Hasim Kilic, president of the Court, is quoted in Wednesday's (May 21st) edition of the local newspaper Bugun as saying the Constitutional Court's decision will strengthen secularism and democracy, and the public should not worry about the consequences. The verdict also is expected to affect a pending case aimed at closing down the ruling Justice and Development Party. (Bugun - 21/05/08)

TIRANA, Albania -- The Socialist Party (SP) officially expelled on Monday (August 27th) the six "rebels" who broke ranks last month and backed Democratic Party official Bamir Topi for president. Their support, despite calls for a boycott by the SP, tipped the election his way. Gazeta Shqiptare reports that the meeting lacked heated debates, as two key opponents of SP leader Edi Rama -- Arben Malaj and Pandeli Majko -- were absent. 
During the meeting, SP leaders also approved the party's new political programme, which covers September to June. They discussed the work required by the end of this year and projects for 2008. (Kohajone, Shekulli, Gazeta Shqiptare - 28/08/07; Balkanweb - 27/08/07)

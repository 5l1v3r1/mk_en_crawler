TALLINN, Estonia -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Sunday (November 11th) that Serbian authorities' aim to obtain EU candidate status by 2008 is ambitious, but attainable. At a news conference in Tallinn, Rehn explained that once Serbia proves full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU would be signed. Serbia initialled its SAA last week. Full co-operation requires the arrest of remaining fugitives, including Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic.
Meanwhile, Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic told the Sarajevo-based Dnevni Avaz newspaper that he would resign unless Mladic is arrested soon. In an interview Sunday, Vukcevic said Mladic has inflicted "great moral damage" on Serbs. (Beta, Tanjug, B92, Dnevni Avaz - 11/11/07)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Radical Party deputy chairman Tomislav Nikolic filed a libel suit Tuesday (28 June) against an NGO leader, Natasa Kandic, as well as the editor-in-chief of the local B92 TV, Veran Matic. Earlier this month, Kandic went on B92 and accused Nikolic of involvement in war crimes committed against civilians in Antin, Croatia, in 1991. Nikolic has explicitly denied the accusations and is now suing Kandic and Matic for spreading false information. Kandic said on Tuesday that the lawsuit would help determine what really happened in Antin. (Politika - 29/06/05; Tanjug - 28/06/05)

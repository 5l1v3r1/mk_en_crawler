ATHENS, Greece -- The second annual report on economic competitiveness -- presented by Development Minister Dimitris Sioufas on Monday (16 May) -- highlights the need for intensified structural reforms in the economy and the labour market. According to the document, prepared by the Centre for Economic Planning and Research, Greece's lack of competitiveness in comparison to other EU member states is due to market dysfunctions and structural problems in the economy. Experts' suggestions include preserving labour cost increases in both private and public sectors on a par with increases in productivity, the introduction of new work-time regulations and full privatisation of the banking sector. 
Also Monday, Greece's Armed Forces General Staff announced that 37 Greek officers will take part in the NATO exercise "Allied Action 2005", which will be held in Spain and France from Tuesday until 1 June. The exercise will assess the operative capability of the Lisbon Allied Command to mobilise and deploy NATO's Rapid Reaction Force. (Kathimerini, Xinhuanet - 17/05/05; ANA - 16/05/05)

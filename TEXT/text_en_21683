PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Independence is irreversible and Washington supports Kosovo's sovereignty and economic development, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Rosemary DiCarlo said on Thursday (May 22nd) in Pristina. "We are happy to see the approval of the constitution of Kosovo and the work towards minority communities," DiCarlo said. During meetings with President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, she said UNMIK's future role is still under discussion, in light of the planned deployment of an EU police and judicial mission. 
Also in Pristina, Ramush Haradinaj, head of the opposition AAK party, called on local leaders Thursday to declare UNMIK's presence illegitimate after June 15th, when the constitution enters into force. "The constitution, which was approved in April ... does not foresee any role for UNMIK," Haradinaj said, during a speech to law students in Pristina. (KTV, RTK, TV 21, Telegrafi - 22/05/08)

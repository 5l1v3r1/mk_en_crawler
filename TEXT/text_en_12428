ATHENS, Greece -- Foreign Minister Petros Molyviatis briefed parliament Thursday (7 April) on bilateral relations with Turkey and his visit to Ankara next week. Molyviatis said the government is working to ensure that issues of Greek interest are recorded in all texts drawn up ahead of EU accession negotiations with Turkey, expected to begin in October. He noted that in December, the European Council clearly included the promotion of good neighbourly relations in Turkey's criteria for starting entry talks. (ANA, MPA - 07/04/05)

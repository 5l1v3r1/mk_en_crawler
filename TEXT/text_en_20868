SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The opposition announced plans Tuesday (February 5th) to submit a no-confidence motion against the government later this week over a scandal in the Republican Road Infrastructure Fund. Two senior fund officials were caught taking a large bribe late last month. A subsequent investigation showed that the fund's director, Vesselin Georgiev, awarded contracts worth 61.4m euros to a company in which his brother holds a senior position. Georgiev has resigned. Another reason for the planned no-confidence motion is the recent interim report by the European Commission, which criticised Bulgaria for a lack of progress in fighting corruption and organised crime.
In other news, Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev met on Tuesday with visiting Hungarian President Laszlo Solyom. They discussed their countries' positions on current issues, such as the status of Kosovo and the EU's policy regarding the Western Balkans. Stanishev and Solyom expressed similar views on both issues. (bTV, News.bg, Netinfo, BGNES, Dnevnik, BNR - 05/02/08)

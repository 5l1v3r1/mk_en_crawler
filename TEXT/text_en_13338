ZAGREB, Croatia -- Tensions between Zagreb and Ljubljana are rising, after the Slovenian government endorsed a draft proposal establishing a protected environmental zone in the Adriatic Sea. The government forwarded the measure to parliament for adoption. That caused strong reaction in Croatia, which believes the eco-belt would stretch to -- and violate -- Croatian territory. On Friday, Zagreb lodged a formal protest with Slovenian Ambassador Peter Bekes. The Croatian Foreign Ministry also officially notified ambassadors of EU member states of its position, as well as the European Commission. (HRT, Novi list - 27/08/05; HINA - 26/08/05)

TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Fatos Nano said Saturday (2 October) he opposes political balancing of the Central Electoral Commission (CEC), saying the ruling Socialist Party (SP) does not have control over the body. The main opposition Democratic Party advocates an OSCE-proposed balancing of the CEC's composition, but SP officials have rejected the idea, saying the CEC is a constitutional body and parties should not amend it. Nano said the SP is open to any other proposals to resolve the current deadlock in the work of the bipartisan CEC. He reiterated the government's commitment to ensuring fair and free elections.

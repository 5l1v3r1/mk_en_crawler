BUCHAREST, Romania -- The opposition plans a no-confidence motion against the government over the latest package of health reform bills. Parliament was due to meet on Monday (13 February) to debate the legislation's final version. The opposition announced its intention after over 300 amendments to the government drafts were introduced last week. 
Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu suggested on Sunday that he might seek a vote of confidence himself, if the senate fails to pass a crucial decree on restructuring the state anti-corruption body. Last week, the bill failed to win approval by parliament's upper house. Tariceanu has asked President Traian Basescu to resubmit it for senate approval. (Nine o'clock, Mediafax - 13/02/06)

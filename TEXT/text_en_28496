LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Milan Balazic says Slovenia has no more reservations concerning the opening and closing of negotiation chapters in Croatia's accession talks with the EU. During a press conference Wednesday (April 14th) in Ljubljana, he also voiced regret that Zagreb will close only one negotiation chapter during next week's inter-governmental conference, and will not open any of the three remaining chapters. For months, Slovenia slowed its neighbour's accession bid due to a maritime border dispute. An arbitrated border agreement will be subject to a public referendum in Slovenia in June.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government on Monday (31 July) completed the disposal of a mobile phone network, the country's largest privatisation deal to date, which analysts say should boost investor confidence. Telenor, the Norwegian mobile telecommunications company, made the winning 1.5 billion-euro bid for the state-controlled Mobi 63 network, surpassing government expectations for the sale of the company. Formerly named Mobtel, it recently came under state control after its private sector main shareholder, Bogoljub Karic, fled Serbia amid accusations of corruption. (FT.com, AFP -- 31/07/06)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The National Anti-Corruption Prosecutors' Office asked Justice Minister Catalin Predoiu to allow the arrest of an opposition lawmaker Tuesday (March 9th). Procedurally, Predoiu must notify parliament of the request. Social Democratic Party member Catalin Voicu is suspected of accepting 260,000 euros in bribes from a businessman to use to pay off judges. The bribes were allegedly received between July and September of last year. Voicu denies the allegations. (Ziare, Cotidianul, Evenimentul Zilei - 10/03/10; AP, Hotnews.ro, Realitatea - 09/03/10)

TIRANA, Albania -- Flooding swamped the main road leading to the biggest city in the north, Shkodra, on Thursday (January 7th) as water levels rose in the Drini River delta. A governmental emergency committee announced that 8,680 hectares of land in the area are under water, while more than 2,000 homes are flooded. Nearly 600 residents have been evacuated from the area, while another 3,000 are waiting for help. Authorities have been urging them to evacuate for days, in light of persistent torrential rains. Prime Minister Sali Berisha urged the emergency committee to establish a flood relief fund and says he will contribute his full salary to the effort. Opposition parties have insisted on an immediate investigation to identify those responsible for the increasingly drastic situation.

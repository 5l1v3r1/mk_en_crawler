SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Senior Liberal Democratic Party official Petar Gosev says the new government's policies will be based on three priorities: security, sustained economic development and fighting corruption. Gosev's party is a member of the For Macedonia Together coalition, which won the elections, and he is considered the most likely choice for finance minister in the new cabinet. His comments Thursday (10 October) represented the first official statement on the future government's strategy - which, according to Gosev, will provide for a stable economic system, competition and transparency.
Meanwhile, talks between For Macedonia Together and the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) are continuing. According to media sources in Skopje, the negotiations have reached a difficult point. DUI reportedly wants a key ministerial post, such as foreign affairs, defence or security.
On another note, the State Census Commission announced Thursday that 9,000 local inspectors will be involved in next month's census, along with 45 foreign observers who will monitor the process. The preliminary phase of the census is already underway among prisoners and army personnel. (Vest, Utrinski Vesnik, Nova Makedonija - 11/10/02)

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The stage has been set for a new large-scale trial at the war crimes tribunal in The Hague on Monday (10 July). Former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic, former Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic, former Chiefs of General Staff Dragoljub Ojdanic and Nebojsa Pavkovic, former Pristina Corps Commander Vladimir Lazarevic and ex-police chief Sreten Lukic are to stand trial on charges of participating in a joint criminal enterprise aimed at changing Kosovo's ethnic character and strengthening Serbian control over the province. 
Although none of the defendants is charged with genocide, they will all have to answer for the forcible deportation of 800,000 ethnic Albanians, the murder of civilians by forces under their control, and persecution on ethnic and political grounds. The prosecution has said it will need at least one year to present its case; the defendants are certain to get at least that much time. (BBC - 08/07/06)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU leaders agreed on Friday (December 14th) to send a 1,800-strong administrative and police mission to Kosovo -- the Union's biggest and most ambitious operation of this kind to date. The European leaders tasked their foreign ministers with working out the details of the mission after the New Year. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown told reporters that the mission could be launched as early as February. The European leaders supported the view of UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon that the status quo in Kosovo cannot continue and underlined that a solution to the problem is necessary for the regional stability.
At the meeting, French President Nicolas Sarkozy hinted that Serbia's future depended on its respect for Kosovo's independence. His remarks were taken as a suggestion that Belgrade could get a fast track to membership in the EU if it softens its stance on Kosovo. Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic ruled out such a deal. "The trade-off is out of the question. We cannot exchange our territory for our European future," he said. 
In related news, Romania will not recognise the unilaterally declared independence of Kosovo, Romanian Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said on Friday. According to Tariceanu, Bucharest has serious concerns about the way the status should be co-ordinated and the possible consequences for the whole Western Balkans.

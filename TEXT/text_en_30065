BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Emil Boc's government survived another no-confidence vote on Thursday (December 23rd) over the so-called single wage law, which aims to make public sector wages more uniform by cutting bonuses. The motion, filed by the opposition, was the fourth faced by the cabinet this year. Its failure will allow the government to press on with reforms necessary to keep a 20 billion-euro bailout agreement with the IMF. 
Debate was briefly suspended earlier Thursday, after a man working in public television jumped from the hall's balcony to protest austerity measures, seriously injuring himself. Opposition lawmakers filed out after the incident, leaving 247 members of the ruling coalition in the hall. None of them, however, cast a ballot. The motion needed 236 votes to succeed.

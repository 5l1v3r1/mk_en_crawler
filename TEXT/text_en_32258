NOVI SAD, Yugoslavia -- Presidential candidate Miroljub Labus says Serbia will need early parliamentary elections to boost its political and economic development. Labus made the remarks during a lecture on Yugoslavia's political and economic transition which he gave Friday (4 October) at Novi Sad University. He argued that the results of the first round of the presidential elections indicate the public expects new political leaders. He added that only early elections held shortly after the 13 October second round could satisfy that demand. Labus said the only open issue was whether the elections should be held before or after the new Serbian Constitution is adopted.
In Nis meanwhile, the other frontrunner, Vojislav Kostunica, accused a large number of media agencies in Serbia of favouring Labus. According to Kostunica, some of the media behaved as they did towards former President Slobodan Milosevic. (Tanjug, Bel Ami - 04/10/02)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Retired Bosnian Croat General Slobodan Praljak told the BiH newspaper <I>Dnevni Avaz</I> on Sunday (14 March) that he expects to be indicted formally by the UN war crimes tribunal within the next ten days. He said the international court has already delivered the indictment to Croatian authorities. A former film director, Praljak at one time commanded the military forces of the self-proclaimed Croat republic in BiH. Troops under his command destroyed the famous 16th-century bridge in Mostar and expelled Muslims from the area. Praljak, who now lives in Croatia, says he is ready to surrender to the tribunal.

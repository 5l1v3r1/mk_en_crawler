BUCHAREST, Romania -- Police announced on Sunday (January 16th) that since the beginning of the month, they have tracked down 192 people internationally using the Schengen information. In addition, more than 60 goods, including cars stolen in France and Germany, were seized. Although Romania is not a member of Schengen, it has access to some of its database. Romania and Bulgaria were hoping to join Schengen in March of this year, but France and Germany have publically opposed the move as too hasty. (AFP, Financiarul, Hotnews.ro - 16/01/11)

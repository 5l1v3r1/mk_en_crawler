ATHENS, Greece -- Germany's Supreme Court has postponed the extradition of a former top manager at Siemens, who is suspected of large-scale bribery in Greece, the justice ministry announced on Monday (August 17th). The court requested additional time to study arguments in support of extraditing Michalis Christoforakos, who headed Siemens' Greek operations between 1996 and 2007. His extradition was expected Sunday. Greece charges him with offering bribes to local politicians and the managers of public companies to secure lucrative contracts for his company. Christoforakos fled Greece three months ago and was arrested in Munich. (Kathimerini - 18/08/09; RIA Novosti, DPA, ANA-MPA - 17/08/09)

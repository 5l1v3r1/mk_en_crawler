PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said Tuesday (August 3rd) that Kosovo is 100% independent, and the partition ideas coming from Belgrade are "insane". Serbian President Boris Tadic's suggestion for negotiations on Kosovo's status and the plan for autonomy for north Kosovo are unrealisable, Thaci told BBC. He reiterated that there can be interstate co-operation between Kosovo and Serbia, but stressed there will be no talks on Kosovo's internal issues.

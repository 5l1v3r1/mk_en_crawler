PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The ruling Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) holds a convention Sunday (October 24th) to elect new leaders and to review the party's work during the last five years, PDK representative Enver Hoxhaj told a press conference Saturday. Hoxhaj said he has no information whether there will be other candidates for PDK leader besides the incumbent, Hashim Thaci. The party is also expected to discuss the institutional crisis provoked by the Democratic League of Kosovo's decision a week ago to pull out of the ruling coalition.

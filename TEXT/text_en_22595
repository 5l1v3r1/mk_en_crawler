ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis met with his Serbian counterpart, Mirko Cvetkovic, in Athens on Tuesday (November 11th) and predicted Serbia would receive EU candidate status very soon. Serbia has Greece's full support for its European integration, Karamanlis added after the meeting. He said Greece is satisfied with Serbia's level of co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, which is why he believes Belgrade will receive candidate status in the not-too-distant future. Cvetkovic said Serbia is grateful for Greece's support and for its refusal to recognise Kosovo's independence. The two prime ministers also discussed bilateral economic co-operation and signed a protocol to amend an agreement on avoiding double taxation.

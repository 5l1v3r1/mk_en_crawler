ZAGREB, Croatia -- Three people were injured in a car explosion in the Adriatic town of Sibenik on Tuesday (July 21st). Two of them -- Austrian tourists -- suffered slight injuries; the third is Croat and is in serious condition. The explosion in front of the Sibenik district government building was apparently caused by a hand grenade planted under a car. Tourism Minister Damir Bajs described it as an isolated incident that does not change the fact that Croatia is a safe destination. (HRT, Vjesnik, HINA, Dnevnik, UPI, DPA - 21/07/09)

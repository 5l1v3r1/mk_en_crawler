NEW YORK, United States -- Reforms are stalled in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), where leaders have failed to move the country towards EU membership in the past year, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Thursday (November 8th) in a report to the UN Security Council. "There has been almost no progress in addressing the reform agenda, and BiH has moved no closer to initialling a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU," the report said. Ban noted that while technical SAA negotiations were completed long ago, initialling the document is impossible due to the failure of police reform.
Meanwhile, High Representative to BiH Miroslav Lajcak continued his trip to Brussels, meeting on Thursday with Deputy Supreme Commander of Allied Forces for Europe General John McColl and the head of the EU Police Mission General Vincenzo Coppola. He also briefed the EU Political and Security Committee on the situation in BiH.
On Wednesday, Lajcak met with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn who urged BiH's ruling parties to move forward on the Mostar Declaration they adopted in late October, regarding police reform. (Dnevni Avaz - 09/11/07; Fena, DPA, OHR website, RTRS, PBS, NTV Hayat - 08/11/07)

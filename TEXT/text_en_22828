BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu dismissed Education Minister Cristian Adomnitei on Tuesday (October 7th) and replaced him with Anton Anton, head of the National Authority for Scientific Research. Adomnitei had voted in favour of a measure granting teachers a 50% salary hike, which in turn has prompted demands for equivalent raises from other state employees who have threatened full-scale strikes otherwise.
Also Tuesday, Tariceanu invited representatives of the country's four trade union confederations to discuss the issue of wage hikes Friday. More than 10,000 workers and union members marched around the parliament Tuesday demanding higher salaries and better working conditions.

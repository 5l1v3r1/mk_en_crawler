Kumrovec is a small village in Croatia, 48km from Zagreb. The birthplace of Josip Broz Tito, it is one of the most visited places in former Yugoslavia.
Tito, who ruled Yugoslav for 35 years, became a hero for fighting the Nazi occupation during the World War II. He served as president until his death in 1980.
The house where Tito has spent his childhood still stands in the village -- along with other relevant buildings, comprises the Staro Selo (Old Village) open-air ethnographic museum.

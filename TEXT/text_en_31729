THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal announced on Tuesday (8 April) that it has indicted the editor of a Montenegrin newspaper for revealing the identity of a protected witness who testified against members of his unit in the former Yugoslav forces. This marked the first such action against a journalist. Dusan Jovanovic revealed the name of a witness for the prosecution who had only been known as K-32. The man, a Muslim who served with the Yugoslav forces in Prizren during the Kosovo conflict, testified that members of his unit had been involved in executions of ethnic Albanian civilians. He received phone threats after his name appeared in the <I>Dan</I> newspaper. (AP - 08/04/03)

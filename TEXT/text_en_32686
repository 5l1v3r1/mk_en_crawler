SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Police announced Saturday (21 December) that they have broken a counterfeiting operation and seized more than 1m euros in fake notes in the town of Kyustendil. Authorities believe the money was printed in Plovdiv and was to be smuggled into Austria via Macedonia. Eight people were taken into custody in Bulgaria, while Austrian police reported two additional arrests. Investigators say the group had also been counterfeiting passports, visas, and excise tax stickers.

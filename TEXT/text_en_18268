NEW YORK, United States -- The United States and the EU on Friday (May 11th) distributed at the UN Security Council a draft resolution on Kosovo that backs UN envoy Maarti Ahtisaari's proposal for internationally-supervised independence, according to media reports. 
Russia, however, continues to oppose granting Kosovo independence against Serbia's will. In a statement Friday, Russian UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin criticised the West for trying to impose hasty deadlines for the settlement and applying double standards. On Saturday, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mikhail Kamynin, said there would be further talks on the draft submitted by the United States and the EU. He added that certain parts of the document were clearly unacceptable to Moscow. (Tanjug, Beta, B92, AP, Reuters - 12/05/07; RTS - 11/05/07)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Supreme Court decided on Wednesday (May 20th) to suspend the trial of former Labour Minister Paul Pacuraru on corruption charges, media reported. The court decided to send the file to the Constitutional Court, which will assess the legality of the proceedings against Pacuraru. In September 2008, he was suspended by presidential decree for his alleged involvement in a corruption scheme. A court indicted him a few months later. Prosecutors say his son's company received a contract with a state-owned company in return for Pacuraru keeping an official with the Gorj Labour Inspectorate at his post.

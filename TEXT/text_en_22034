BELGRADE, Serbia -- Outgoing Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica reiterated on Wednesday (April 16th) that any Stabilisation and Association Agreement that Serbia signs with the EU must include a sentence confirming Kosovo as an integral part of Serbia. He said it would be the only way to make the agreement acceptable to everyone in Serbia. If signed in its current form, the agreement might be interpreted as recognition of Kosovo's independence, Kostunica and his Democratic Party of Serbia have argued. EU officials quoted by the Beta news agency responded that Serbia should sign the SAA in the form in which it initialled it. (Beta, Tanjug, B92 - 16/04/08)

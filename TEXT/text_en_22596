BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Holy Synod of the Serbian Orthodox Church on Tuesday (November 11th) declined to accept the resignation of ailing Patriarch Pavle, deciding instead he will remain in the post for life, Serbian press reported. There was no official statement after the Synod's regular autumn session, which lasted all day long behind closed doors. Pavle, 94, asked to resign at the weekend due to ongoing health problems. He has been at the Military Medical Academy in Belgrade for the past year. According to media reports, the Holy Synod will hand off part of Pavle's duties to the Montenegrin metropolitan Amfilohije, the oldest and most influential of the 46 bishops in the Synod.

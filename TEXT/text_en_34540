BUCHAREST, Romania -- Leaders of the political parties should agree on a truce over the next two weeks until the 19 October referendum on a new constitution, Prime Minister Adrian Nastase said Saturday (4 October). Nastase, the leader of the ruling Social Democratic Party, suggested that the focus of political debate should shift towards the essence of the proposed constitutional changes and away from intra-party bickering.

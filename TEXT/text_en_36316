STRASBOURG, France -- The Council of Europe's (CoE) Congress of Local and Regional Authorities decided on Tuesday (25 May) to grant one seat in the Cypriot delegation to a representative of the Turkish Cypriots. That follows the practice of the CoE Parliamentary Assembly, which decided in late April "to involve more closely Northern Cyprus representatives in the work of the assembly". However, Turkish Cypriot officials say they do not want to participate as part of the Greek Cypriot delegation. (CoE press release, Anadolu Agency - 25/05/04)

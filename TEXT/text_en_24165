BELGRADE, Serbia -- There is still no consensus in the EU regarding Serbia's integration, Czech Ambassador to Serbia Hana Hubackova, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, said on Thursday (January 15th). Hubackova says Prague favours unblocking the interim trade agreement and is in constant contact with partners in the EU, including Dutch authorities. The Netherlands insists Serbia must capture Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic before implementing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement Serbia signed with the EU in April. 
In Brussels meanwhile, Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek urged the governments of Croatia and Slovenia to resolve their border dispute at an international court or through arbitration. Speaking to the European Parliament on Wednesday, Topolanek said the issue should remain bilateral and the EU should not take part. Last month Ljubljana blocked Croatia's EU accession talks over the long-standing border dispute. (Beta, B92, Glas Srbije, HINA, Nacional, Index, MIA - 14/01/09)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Peace Implementation Council is the only institution that can decide on use of the so-called Bonn powers, High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said on Sunday (October 28th). He spoke to Glas Javnosti ahead of Monday's session of Republika Srpska's (RS) parliament, which plans to discuss the latest set of measures imposed by Lajcak. The envoy says the measures will strengthen the functionality of state institutions, but RS officials insist they violate the Dayton Peace Accords. (RTRS, PBS - 28/10/07)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The sixth anniversary of KFOR's arrival was marked at a formal ceremony in Pristina on Saturday (11 June). The commander of KFOR, General Yves de Kermabon, stressed that NATO is determined to preserve security in the province, as well as offer continued assistance to UNMIK in transferring responsibilities to the Kosovo civil authorities. De Kermabon also called on the public to reject violence and work for a better future. 
The same day, however, representatives of the Kosovo Serbs said they are dissatisfied with the results of the international community's activities in the province thus far. They state that many Serb refugees remain unable to return to their homes and that freedom of movement is not guaranteed for returnees. (Politika - 12/06/05; Tanjug, Beta - 11/06/05)

TIRANA, Albania -- Democratic Party (DP) Parliamentary Caucus Chairman Bamir Topi said Thursday (March 8th) he will be the party candidate for president in the elections this summer. Christian Democratic Party (CDP) Chairman Nard Ndoka and Republican Party (RP) head Fatmir Mediu said Topi's candidacy is acceptable and their parties would probably support him. 
In related news, Prime Minister Sali Berisha is expected to launch a public debate to change the presidential election system. According to the constitution, the country's president is elected by parliament in a five-round procedure. Berisha, however, says popular vote should be introduced. Due to time constraints, the change could not happen before this year's polls. (Albanian News - 09/03/07)

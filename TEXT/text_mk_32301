SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament on Wednesday (2 October) revised the government's position on decommissioning the older units at the Kozloduy nuclear plant. Lawmakers now argue that the plant should be closed after Bulgaria becomes a member of the EU. The European Commission (EC) has always insisted that Bulgaria should decommission its nuclear power units by the end of 2006, while EU membership is not expected until at least 2007. On Tuesday, the government announced it would agree with the EU deadline - provided a new assessment of the units is made - in order to close the energy chapter in accession negotiations as soon as possible. President Georgi Parvanov agreed with the government's position, although he expressed some reservations. Parliament's revision is particularly awkward, in light of EC President Romano Prodi's backing of the government's position.
In other news, Bulgaria plans to resume the destruction of its Soviet-era missiles Thursday, this time focusing on Scud warheads. The deadline for decommissioning all Scud, Frog and SS-23 missiles is 30 October. (Dnevnik, Sega, Pari, Standart - 03/10/02; BNT, bTV, BTA - 02/10/02)

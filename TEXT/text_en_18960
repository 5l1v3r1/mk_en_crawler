SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The international community's High Representative to BiH, Christian Schwarz-Schilling, said on Friday (March 2nd) that he would use the remaining time in office to advance key reforms. In his regular weekly press column in BiH newspapers, Schwarz-Schilling noted that the Peace Implementation Council recently followed his advice and extended the mandate of the Office of the High Representative by one year, until mid-2008. Until his own term ends this summer, he says his focus would be helping authorities with police and constitutional reforms. 
In other news Friday, US Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns said in Washington that the Dayton Peace Agreement must be updated this year. Noting its importance 12 years ago, he said the Dayton deal cannot be expected to determine BiH's future. (Dnevni avaz, RTRS, Srna - 03/03/07; OHR Sources, PBS BiH - 02/03/07)

ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in Ankara decided on Tuesday (September 29th) that two lawmakers from the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) should be forcibly brought by police to testify at two separate trials involving them. The lawmakers, Emine Ayna and Selahattin Demirtas, are suspected of propaganda on behalf of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). They have refused to testify, arguing that proceedings are unfair since the court has failed to act against other legislators with similar activities. The court ruled on Tuesday that should the two fail to appear in court on December 29th, police should bring them there by force. 
In other news Tuesday, government spokesperson Cemil Cicek announced that the cabinet will officially ask parliament to support a one-year extension of the army's operation against PKK militants in northern Iraq. The current mandate expires on October 17th. (Vatan - 30/09/09; Hurriyet, AP, Reuters - 29/09/09)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The coalitions led by the Democratic Party (DS) and the Serbian Socialist Party (SPS) could soon form a government, Vlajko Senic, an official in G17 Plus, a junior member of the DS coalition, said on Tuesday (June 17th). Senic confirmed that the two sides have talked and that "much was negotiated during informal consultations".
Yet the SPS insists it has not broken off talks with the nationalist Serbian Radical Party, the populist Democratic Party of Serbia and New Serbia. The SPS indicates that in regards to a future ruling coalition, it is more concerned with implementing its manifesto than with the exact distribution of cabinet posts.

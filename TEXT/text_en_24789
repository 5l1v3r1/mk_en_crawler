ZAGREB, Croatia -- Marin Ivanovic, the lawyer representing retired Croatian General Ante Gotovina, is responsible for hiding documents related to past war crimes, the Veritas documentation-information centre said in a statement Sunday (January 4th). In an interview Friday with the Zagreb-based daily Vecernji List, Hague war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz had accused Croatia of intentionally hiding evidence against three Croatian generals: Gotovina, Mladen Markac and Ivan Cermak. They are under indictment for their alleged roles in war crimes committed during 1995's Operation Storm. Veritas Director Savo Strbac told the Banja Luka-based daily Glas Srpske on Sunday that Ivanovic is the leader of a group suspected of hiding and stealing documents related to Storm. Strbac added that Ivanovic is under suspicion of having "bought" his way onto Gotovina's defence team by hiding the documents. (Beta, Glas Srpske, B92 - 05/01/09)

NEW YORK, United States -- An ethnic Albanian man from Kosovo pleaded guilty on Wednesday (October 31st) to helping five suspects who planned a terrorist attack on a US military facility in New Jersey. Agron Abdullahu, 25, admitted to letting five co-conspirators use his handgun and rifle at a firing range. According to prosecutors, he refused to take part in the planned attack on Fort Dix and tried to dissuade the others by telling them that killing people was against Islam. He could be sentenced to up to five years for conspiracy to provide weapons to illegal immigrants. The other suspects include three ethnic Albanian brothers from the former Yugoslavia, a Turk and a man born in Jordan, all in their 20s. (AP, DPA, AFP - 31/10/07)

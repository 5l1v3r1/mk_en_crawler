ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian government is ready to provide the required guarantees for the provisional release on bail of General Ante Gotovina, who is waiting for the start of his trial before the UN war crimes tribunal, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said Monday (July 9th). Sanader said the cabinet approved the guarantees for the other Croatian generals in The Hague as well. Gotovina, who has been in detention in The Hague since his arrest in 2005, is charged alongside Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac of committing atrocities against Serbs during the 1995 Storm operation.

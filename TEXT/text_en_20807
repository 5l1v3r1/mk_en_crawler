SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prime Minister-designate Nikola Spiric asked on Friday (January 4th) that the six parliamentary parties in the state-level ruling coalition submit their candidates for cabinet ministers and deputy ministers. He hopes the process would be finalised by late January or early February. Spiric resigned on November 1st to protest measures proposed by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak in response to failed police reform. At the end of December, however, he was again nominated to the post of prime minister and received a mandate to form a new government.
In an interview Sunday with SRNA, Spiric stressed his support for the work of the ad-hoc commission on police reform. Establishing a state-level police structure remains the key condition for the signing of a pre-membership agreement with the EU. 
In other news, the War Crimes Chamber of the BiH Court confirmed an indictment Friday against retired Serb General Novak Djukic. He is charged with ordering the 1995 shelling of Tuzla, which killed 71 civilians and wounded hundreds. Djukic was a commander of the Bosnian Serb army in the region at the time. He was arrested two months ago in Banja Luka. (RTRS - 06/01/08; Nezavisne Novine, Dnevni Avaz - 05/01/08; RTRS, PBS, NTV Hayat, Fena, Reuters, Jurist.com - 04/01/08)

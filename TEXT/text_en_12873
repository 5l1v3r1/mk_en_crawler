WASHINGTON, United States -- US officials said Tuesday (1 February) that Washington is in close communication with Ankara about issues related to Iraq. "We have a useful, strong, deeply-rooted alliance with Turkey and it will continue," US Undersecretary of Defence Douglas Feith said, stressing that the United States would remain committed to preserving Iraq's territorial integrity as a condition for peace and stability in the entire region. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, meanwhile, emphasised that the United States has never supported the activities of Kurdish extremists in northern Iraq and is committed to fighting terrorism. He was responding to reported criticism by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. (NTV - 02/02/05; AFP, NTV - 01/02/05)

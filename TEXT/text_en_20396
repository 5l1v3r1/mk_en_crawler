PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Montenegrin Ambassador to Brussels Slavica Milacic said on Sunday (August 12th) that the country plans to sign an agreement for readmission and visa relief with the EU on September 18th. "The rough plan of Brussels is the agreements with the western Balkans states are to be signed after the conference of the ministers of justice and interior affairs," Milacic said. He described the agreements as a stage in the establishment of a duty-free regime between Montenegro and countries from the Western Balkans and the EU. He also said the Stablisation and Association Agreement with the EU will be signed on October 15th. (Antena M, MINA - 13/08/07; Tanjug - 12/08/07)

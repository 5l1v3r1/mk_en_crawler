ZAGREB, Croatia -- The leaders of Croatia's main opposition parties, Ivica Racan of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Josip Friscic of the Croatian Peasants' Party (HSS), met on Monday (5 June) to discuss co-operation. The possibility of a post-election coalition was reportedly on the agenda. In comments afterwards, however, Racan said the meeting had led to no major decisions, other than SDP's agreement to back an HSS initiative for a fishing-ecological zone in the Adriatic Sea.

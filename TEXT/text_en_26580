NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greek Cypriots on Sunday (January 10th) rejected a proposal by the Turkish Cypriots regarding power-sharing on the divided island. Last week, Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat presented the plan on the future power structure as part of ongoing reunification talks. "These proposals are unacceptable," government spokesperson Stefanos Stefanou said, adding they are far from a previous agreement to base talks on the model of a bi-communal bi-zonal federation. No details of Talat's proposals were officially announced. He and Cypriot President Demetris Christofias are scheduled to resume talks Monday. (RIA-Novosti, Xinhua, Makfax - 10/01/10)

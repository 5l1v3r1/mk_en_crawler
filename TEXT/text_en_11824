BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown again voiced his disappointment with the failed political talks on BiH police reform. In an interview published in Nezavine novine on Thursday (19 May), Ashdown suggested that imposing sanctions would be unnecessary, as loss of international investment and the suspension of BiH's progress towards EU accession already constituted a form of sanctions.
Meanwhile, Republika Srpska (RS) President Dragan Cavic has said he will call a parliamentary session by 30 May to address the situation. While arguing that the proposed police system amounts to a departure from the Dayton Accord, he also cautioned that rejecting the reform would show a lack of readiness to enter the EU accession process and would lead RS into isolation.
Also Wednesday, Ivo Miro Jovic was formally sworn in as the new Croat member of the tripartite BiH presidency. Jovic, a member of the Croat Democratic Party, takes over the post following Ashdown's dismissal of Dragan Covic due to an embezzlement scandal.

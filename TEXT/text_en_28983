PRISTINA, Kosovo -- European Commission (EC) officials on Monday (November 8th) denied government claims that Kosovo has met the criteria for visa liberalisation strategy. Michele Cercone, spokesperson for EU Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom, said that Pristina has yet to meet the readmission and reintegration criteria, something Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi and Integrations Minister Besim Beqaj dispute. They say in fact that the EC had promised to hand over the strategy by September. Cercone denies any such deadline.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia signaled on Thursday (January 24th) that President Boris Tadic must abandon his pro-EU stand if he wants its support in the upcoming election run-off. The party insisted that Serbia should integrate into the EU only if territorial integrity is maintained. It views the planned deployment of an EU mission to Kosovo as a violation of Serbia's sovereignty, and asked the president not to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Union if it goes ahead with plans to assume supervision of the province from the UN. 
Tadic immediately rejected the conditions saying they amounted to blackmail. He said he would never deny Serbia and its people a European future. In the first round of voting, he came in second behind nationalist Radical Party candidate Tomislav Nikolic. Many observers in Serbia believe the supporters of Kostunica's party will determine the outcome of the second round. (Danas, Politika - 25/01/08; AP, Beta, RTS, Tanjug - 24/01/08)

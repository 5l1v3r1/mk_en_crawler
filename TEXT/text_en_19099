SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Presidency's Serb member and incumbent Chairman Nebojsa Radmanovic has announced plans to convene a meeting of the main BiH party leaders on Wednesday (January 3rd), to form a new BiH government. Top officials with the Serb Union of Independent Social Democrats and the Party of Democratic Progress, the Bosniak Party of Democratic Action and Party for BiH, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) of BiH and HDZ 1990 are expected to attend. Criticism both inside and outside of BiH is growing, as more than three months have passed since the general election and no central government is in place.

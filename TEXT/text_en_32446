SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Employees of money-losing companies staged protests in front of parliament on Wednesday (19 March), demanding the government resolve their status and that of their companies. Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski and Finance Minister Petar Gosev met with protest leaders, but said the main demand -- adoption of a special law enabling employees with 25 years experience to take early retirement -- could not be met. That would violate an agreement with the IMF, the government says. The workers have vowed to put up roadblocks across the country. (Utrinski Vesnik, Dnevnik - 20/03/03; MIA, A1 TV - 19/03/03)

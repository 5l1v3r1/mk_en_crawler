BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Serbian Democratic Party (DSS) said on Thursday (January 3rd) that it would support New Serbia's (NS) leader, Velimir Ilic, in the January 20th presidential elections. The DSS says Ilic has proved his qualities as a minister in two governments and has struggled for the establishment of a democratically and economically strong Serbia. The backing of the DSS would help Ilic reach the second round of elections, NS Vice-President Dubravka Filipovki told the Beta news agency. The DSS had been expected to support incumbent President Boris Tadic's re-election bid. 
Ilic, the current minister of infrastructure, visited Serb-dominated areas in Kosovo on Thursday, where he told residents that the province "will remain part of Serbia forever". (Blic, Danas - 04/01/08; RTS, Beta, Tanjug - 03/01/08)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic predicted on Monday (October 13th) that Serbia will receive EU candidate status next year. "I believe that in 2009, Serbia will pass the most difficult political hurdle on the road towards full-fledged EU membership; that is, gaining candidate status," Jeremic said. "Afterwards, everything is up to the candidate state, as it must fulfil all of the Copenhagen criteria for membership. I believe that Serbia has the capacity to meet those criteria in record time," he added. The Netherlands is apparently the only EU member state that refuses to unblock the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia unless Belgrade arrests remaining war crimes fugitives Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic.

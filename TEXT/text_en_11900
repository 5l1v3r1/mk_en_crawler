WASHINGTON, United States -- The United States is planning a new strategy to resolve the future status of Kosovo. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the strategy would be "consistent with the goals of promoting regional stability and protecting the rights of all of Kosovo's citizens", including the Serb minority. Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns will discuss the US plan on Wednesday (18 May) with the House International Relations Committee, the spokesman added. The UN will conduct a review this summer of Kosovo's progress in achieving standards for democracy and multiethnicity. "If that review is positive, the international community will launch a diplomatic process to determine Kosovo's future status," Boucher said. 
Visiting Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos, meanwhile, lauded the Serbian government's initiative for a dialogue with Pristina. He said that during a meeting with Serbian President Boris Tadic, the president expressed his readiness to meet Kosovo counterpart Ibrahim Rugova. (Politika - 18/05/05; Beta, AP - 17/05/05)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Justice Minister Margarita Popova proposed on Monday (September 7th) that three special units, representing a task force among the Interior Ministry, the Prosecutor's Office and the National Security Agency, be established to target organised crime, high-level corruption and fraud involving EU funding. The goal is to guarantee constant supervision and combine resources to combat crime more effectively. In addition, Popova called for more guidance from the Supreme Judicial Council. Popova also said measures would be adopted to accelerate the confiscation of illegally acquired property, a process that now can take years. (Mediapool, 24 Chasa, Focus - 07/09/09)

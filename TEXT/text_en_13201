ANKARA, Turkey -- Police on Monday (28 November) arrested two members of a paramilitary unit in connection with a bomb blast that triggered violent protests by Kurds in the town of Semdinli earlier this month. One other member of a gendarmerie unit and a former Kurd rebel who turned police informer were detained on 9 November shortly after the explosion. Parliament launched an investigation into the incident to assure local residents there would be no cover-up if military personnel were involved in the bombing.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said on Friday (February 25th) that an independent UN-led probe into organ trafficking allegations in Dick Marty's report is the only way to avoid questions of double standards and cover-ups. In an interview with the Belgrade-based daily Vecernje Novosti, Jeremic said that as with previous crimes investigated by the UN war crimes tribunal, accusations of organ trafficking in which Serbs were the main victims should also be investigated. France and the UK have opposed an UN-led investigation, arguing that the ongoing one by the EULEX mission in Kosovo is enough. (Tanjug, B92 - 26/02/11; Vecernje Novosti, B92 - 25/02/11)

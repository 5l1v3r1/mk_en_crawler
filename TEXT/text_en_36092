SOFIA, Bulgaria -- European Affairs Minister Meglena Kuneva said on Thursday (18 March) that further changes are needed in the country's judiciary system to make it more efficient. Kuneva was commenting on a report by EU Enlargement Commissioner Gunter Verheugen on judicial reforms in Bulgaria and Romania. The report notes that both countries need to convince the EU that they meet all Copenhagen political criteria, as no compromises will be made. Kuneva interpreted this as a warning that Bulgaria and Romania may not be admitted into the EU on 1 January 2007, as expected. (BTA, bTV, Mediapool, BNT, BBC - 18/03/04)

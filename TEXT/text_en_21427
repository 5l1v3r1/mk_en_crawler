WASHINGTON, United States -- US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has urged Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdish autonomous region in northern Iraq, not to shelter members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) within the region, according to media reports Wednesday (October 29th). During a meeting Tuesday in Washington, Rice called on Barzani to co-operate with Turkey against the PKK, which uses northern Iraqi bases to launch cross-border attacks in Turkey. She also asked the Kurdish regional administration to take additional measures to oust the PKK from the region.
In other news, the PKK abducted a village guard and a postal worker in eastern Turkey on Wednesday. Turkish security forces are working to find the two hostages. (Hurriyet, Zaman, AFP, Anadolu news agency, Dogan news agency - 29/10/08)

ATHENS, Greece -- Greek officials on Sunday (1 August) welcomed a decision by the Greek Cypriot government to ease travel and trade between the two parts of Cyprus. The new measures allow Turkish Cypriots to import goods directly, without having to go through Greek Cypriot middlemen. The Greek Foreign Ministry said the move is part of efforts to reunify Cyprus and boost the Turkish Cypriot economy. (AFP - 01/08/04)

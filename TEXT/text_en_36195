PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic called Sunday (7 March) for the separation of Serbia and Montenegro along the Czech-Slovak model. He said that such a separation would be appropriate a year from now, when the Belgrade Agreement expires. Marking the second anniversary of the agreement, he said that if there is no consensus on separation, a referendum should be held. (Beta, B92, Tanjug - 07/03/04)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A draft resolution of the Council of Europe (CoE) Political Affairs Committee calls on Macedonia and its neighbours to intensify efforts to resolve open issues. The document was sent to the Macedonian government on Tuesday (7 June). Among other things, the CoE panel urges Macedonia and Greece to step up diplomatic efforts and resolve their ongoing name dispute. It also urges Macedonia, UNMIK, Kosovo's interim authorities and Serbia-Montenegro to complete the border demarcation process between Macedonia and Kosovo before the start of Kosovo status talks.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Anti-corruption prosecutors announced on Tuesday (6 June) that they have indicted former deputy prime minister and current Conservative Party Senator George Copos with tax evasion. At issue are over 1m euros in taxes, stemming from a series of real estate transactions between July-December 2004. One of the most controversial members of the cabinet, Copos resigned last week after the government refused to adopt his incentive proposals for the new version of the fiscal code. A wealthy businessman, Copos owns one of the most popular football teams in Romania, Rapid Bucharest.
In other news Tuesday, the Chamber of Deputies adopted the new Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code. The legislation is key to the country's EU membership bid. (Ziua, Adevarul - 07/06/06; Rompres - 06/06/06; Rompres - 05/06/06)

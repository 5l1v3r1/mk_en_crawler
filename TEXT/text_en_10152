BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- State television says the Belgrade District Court issued warrants Wednesday (29 September) for the arrest of four Serbian Army and police generals sought by the UN war crimes tribunal for crimes committed during the Kosovo conflict. The generals -- Nebojsa Pavkovic, Vladimir Lazarevic, Vlastimir Djordjevic and Sreten Lukic -- failed to respond to a court deadline to appear before judges to receive indictments from The Hague tribunal. 
In other news, Serbia-Montenegro's President Svetozar Marovic and the federal government separately insisted Wednesday on an urgent meeting of top state and government officials from both republics, to resolve the deadlock over co-operation with the UN tribunal. Montenegrin representatives withdrew from the federal council for co-operation with The Hague tribunal last week. (Danas - 30/09/04; Beta, B92, Tanjug - 29/09/04)

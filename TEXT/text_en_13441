KABUL, Afghanistan -- Romanian President Traian Basescu visited Kabul on Thursday (22 December) and said his country is ready to donate a battalion of T 55 upgraded tanks to the Afghan Army. Basescu is leading a delegation making a Christmas visit to Romanian contingents in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In other news Thursday, two Romanian television stations were fined for showing a gun-packing Santa Claus. Antena 1 and National were fined 1,437 euros for broadcasting an ad for a local arms manufacturer in which Santa hands out guns to journalists for testing. The chief of Romania's media watchdog organisation said children could misinterpret the ad as legitimising the use of firearms.
Also Thursday, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu again said his government would not change legislation banning foreign adoptions. They were halted last year amid pressure by the EU. (Nine O'clock - 23/12/05; Rompres - 22/12/05; Reuters, RFE/RL, AFP - 20/12/05)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Military prosecutors have indicted eight soldiersthat were held by rebels of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) for two weeks last month. A lawyer told reporters on Sunday (November 11th) that the recently released servicemen were charged with dereliction of duty, and at least two of them had been charged with "escaping abroad". The troops were taken prisoner after their unit was ambushed by guerrillas on October 21st. Twelve other soldiers were killed in the battle. The soldiers have defended their actions claiming that they ran out of ammunition and some of their weapons malfunctioned. Justice Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin appeared to set the stage for a trial last week when he said the troops should have fought to the bitter end rather than allowing themselves to be captured.

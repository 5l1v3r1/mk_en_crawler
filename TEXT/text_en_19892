ATHENS, Greece -- The Balkans continued to be hit by heavy rains and flooding on Monday (November 19th). The situation was most critical in Greece, where severe flooding claimed two lives. A state of emergency was declared in many regions. Torrential rains also struck northwest Turkey, where floods are expected near the swollen Maritsa, Tundja and Arda rivers. Rivers are also cresting in Bulgaria, while around 100 families living in the town of Eregli in northwest Turkey were evacuated. Romania was also hit by the bad weather; strong winds forced authorities to close all Black Sea ports. (Naftemporiki, Vecer - 20/11/07; CNN Turk, BNR - 19/11/07)

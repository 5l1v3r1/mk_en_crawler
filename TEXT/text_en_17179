TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu appointed one more member of the Central Election Commission (CEC) on Monday (31 July), choosing the opposition Socialist Party's Fatmir Kumbaro. There have been three vacant seats in the seven-member election panel since spring. By law, the president, parliament and the High Judicial Council (HJC) must name one member each. Later Monday, it was announced that the main election body formally accepted Kumbaro's nomination, as well as that of Flamur Qato, named by the HJC earlier in July. Thus, six of the seven seats are filled. (Albanian News, Korrieri, Shekulli - 01/08/06; Albanian President Web site - 31/07/06)

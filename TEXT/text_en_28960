PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Bratislava still has no plans to recognise Kosovo's independence, Slovakian Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak said on Thursday (April 8th), during a visit to Pristina. "No, we will not recognise it, and this is our position," Lajcak said after meeting with Kosovo counterpart Skender Hyseni, who worked to downplay this key disagreement. "These differences are not a problem to meeting and discussing all issues," Hyseni said. 
In other news Thursday, Behxhet Pacolli, leader of the New Kosovo Alliance party, announced that the Kingdom of Swaziland has recognised Kosovo's independence. The Kosovo tycoon showed a letter of recognition he said he had received, although foreign ministry officials say they have received no official confirmation. Pacolli also said that Papua New Guinea recognised Kosovo in mid-December, but foreign ministry officials have not made it public yet. (Zeri, Express, Koha Ditore, Kosova Sot - 09/04/10)

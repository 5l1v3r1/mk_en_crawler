SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament approved the appointment Thursday (April 12th) of Arifhikmet Xhemaili from the junior coalition ally, the Democratic Party of Albanians, as the new minister of culture. Xhemaili succeeds Ilirijan Bekiri, who resigned recently after trying to ban a theatre production about Tito's life.
In other news, the Macedonian government has adopted a draft law on nepotism and conflicts of interest. It would broaden the list of civil servants' family members if that could be investigated in case of suspected embezzlement, and would bar civil servants from accepting gifts worth more than 50 euros.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The most popular opposition party, the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), said on Thursday (March 25th) it will organise mass protests in Belgrade to force the government to call early elections. The party has collected 1 million signatures in support of the vote over the course of the past month, and believes it could quickly raise 300,000 more. The SNS says it wants snap elections to get the parliamentary representation it deserves. The petition drive is largely symbolic, as neither the prime minister nor the president is obligated to dissolve parliament based on petitions. (Beta, EMPortal, Mondo, RTV, Glas Javnosti - 25/03/10)

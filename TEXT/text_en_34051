WASHINGTON, United States -- Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic predicted on Saturday (26 July) that Serbia-Montenegro would join the NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme by the end of this year or early next year. Zivkovic, in Washington for talks, told Voice of America that participation in PfP would hinge on several conditions, including the extradition of former Bosnian Serb Army chief Ratko Mladic to the war crimes tribunal in The Hague. The prime minister next travels to New York and a meeting with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.
Meanwhile, Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic, commenting on the country's hopes for EU accession, stressed that conditions for signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement include military reforms and a reduction in organised crime.

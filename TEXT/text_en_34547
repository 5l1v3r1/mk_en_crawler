ROME, Italy -- European Commission President Romano Prodi expressed regret Saturday (4 October) over Croatia's unilateral move to establish an ecological and fishing zone in the Adriatic. Lawmakers in Zagreb approved the controversial decision Friday, at the request of the government. Prodi said he had expected action would take place only after talks with Slovenia, in accordance with the EU policy of dialogue aimed at resolving disputes. Other senior EU officials also voiced disapproval, including security chief Javier Solana and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Malta announced on Thursday (August 21st) that it is recognising Kosovo's independence and sent a letter of confirmation to Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci. The letter states that through this action, Malta joins other European countries and the West in deciding there is no alternative, given events in Kosovo over the past decade. A total of 45 countries have recognised Kosovo's independence so far, including the United States and 20 of the 27 EU member states. 
Meanwhile, Austria on Thursday joined the list of countries that will accept Kosovo's new passports. Upon viewing these new identity documents, Vienna's embassy in Pristina will be able to issue visas to those travelling to Austria. (AFP, Kosovapress, RTS, Koha Vizion, RTK, Blic, Beta - 21/08/08)

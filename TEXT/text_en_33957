ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Constitutional Court appointed an ethics commission Wednesday (5 November) to oversee those involved in the 23 November parliamentary elections. As envisioned by law, authorities nominated prominent public figures -- not members of political parties -- as members of the commission. The ruling coalition and the opposition suggested three candidates each. Ivo Padovan, president of the Croatian Academy of Arts and Sciences, will serve as chairman.

TRIPOLI, Libya -- The Supreme Judicial Council met on Monday (July 16th) but did not discuss the death sentences of five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor, despite earlier announcements that it would. Officials said the Council was busy with other cases. A new meeting is planned for Tuesday. The medics were sentenced to death for infecting more than 400 children in hospital with HIV, despite scientific evidence suggesting that poor sanitary conditions were to blame. The Council, Libya's supreme judicial authority, is expected to either commute or pardon the medics following an agreement between the al-Gadhafi Foundation and the families under which compensation of $1m would have been paid for every infected child. Still unclear is whether every family will accept the offer. (Darik, Sega - 17/07/07; AP, AFP, BNR, Reuters - 16/07/07)

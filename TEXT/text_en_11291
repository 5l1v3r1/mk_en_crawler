NEW YORK, United States -- Croatia and Turkey are among a group of countries criticised by a UN panel for maintaining sexist laws. The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women said Thursday (27 January) that its experts had examined the recent records of eight member states and found that they maintained sexist laws. The group also includes Italy, Algeria, Gabon, Laos, Paraguay and Samoa. The panel will recommend ways to revise specific laws. (HINA - 28/01/05; UN Web site - 27/01/05)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia's Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski said Friday (25 November) that he and his Croatian counterpart, Ivo Sanader, will meet on Tuesday to discuss concerns about Macedonian Army Chief General Miroslav Stojanovski. Press reports in Zagreb have suggested he was involved in war crimes committed in Vukovar in 1991, and Croatian State Attorney Mladen Bajic has requested a probe into the allegations. On Friday, Macedonian Defence Minister Jovan Manasievski insisted Stojanovski's file was "clean" and that he passed a NATO check in 1998.

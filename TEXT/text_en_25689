NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias has sent a letter to the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and the EU heads of state, briefing them on recent developments in reunification talks for the divided island. Dated January 11th, the letter was made public on Wednesday (January 20th). It describes the Greek Cypriots' decision to reject recent Turkish Cypriots proposals, explaining they "contravene the agreed basis and the sensitive balances which have been shaped during decades of negotiations". Furthermore, Christofias explained that even if the proposals were accepted by authorities, they would certainly "be rejected in a new referendum". He and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat resume talks on Monday.(Cyprus Mail - 21/01/10; CNA, Xinhua - 20/01/10)

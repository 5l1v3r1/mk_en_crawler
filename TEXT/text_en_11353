SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The defence ministry reportedly has begun talks with several foreign banks on a huge external loan, intended to finance ongoing reforms. The newspaper Dnevnik reported Friday (27 May) that the ministry already has held talks with five banks -- Dresdnerbank, Deutsche Bank, ABN Amro, Citigroup, and Societe Generale. The amount of the financing sought by the ministry is believed to be around 2 billion euros. According to the army's restructuring programme, the military must become completely professional and modernised by 2010. 
On Thursday, meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Plamen Panayotov said the government is pressing ahead with plans for an "election lottery", as an incentive to boost turnout during the 25 June parliamentary elections. Amid criticism in some quarters, Panayotov stressed the importance of these elections and the government's intention to get out the vote. (Dnevnik, Sega, Standart - 27/05/05; bTV - 26/05/05)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said on Sunday (May 16th) that the government is working to resolve the long-standing name dispute with Greece as soon as possible, while protecting state and national interests. He was reacting to EU envoy to Macedonia Erwan Fouere, who had warned that if the cabinet fails to focus on EU-required reforms and to resolve the name issue quickly, it could threaten EU membership. Ali Ahmeti, leader of ethnic Albanian junior coalition partner Democratic Union for Integration, and Branko Crvenkovski, leader of the opposition Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia, have also warned of a potential delay in Euro-Atlantic integration over the row with Athens.

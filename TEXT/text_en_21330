PRISTINA, Kosovo -- An OSCE envoy is criticising Kosovo's lack of readiness to encourage different nationalities to start living together. "The reconciliation process can start when there is readiness to overcome ethnic divisions. For now, neither Albanians nor Serbs are ready to take such a step," Knut Vollebaek, the OSCE's high commissioner for national minorities, said on Tuesday (May 27th) in Pristina. He added that past inter-ethnic tensions are holding Kosovo hostage. The statistical office estimates from new information that 92% of citizens are Albanians.

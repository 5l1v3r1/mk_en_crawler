TUZLA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Representatives of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Tuzla said on Thursday (August 16th) that they and residents of the town plan to stage rallies and boycott all Serbian products and services. They are protesting a recent decision by the Serbian Supreme Court to extend the confinement of Ilija Jurisic -- a former Bosnian fighter who is being held in Serbia on suspicion of involvement in the 1992 Tuzla Column war crimes case. "What we don't understand is why BiH authorities do nothing concrete for his release," the SDP in Tuzla said in a statement. The party intends to organise peaceful protests in Tuzla later this month.

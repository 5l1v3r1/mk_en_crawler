TIRANA, Albania -- The Interior Ministry announced Monday (14 October) that two tonnes of cannabis and one kilogram of heroin were seized in a raid on a villa in Brostar over the weekend. Two brothers who owned the house were arrested. In a separate case, police at the Kakavie border crossing with Greece detained an Albanian who allegedly concealed more than 100 kilograms of cannabis in his truck. An Interior Ministry spokesman says these latest finds were part of the new government's clampdown on trafficking in drugs and humans in the country.
In separate news, the Albanian government issued a statement saying that officials in Tirana and Rome were working out the details of an unprecedented football match between the two national sides. Silvio Berlusconi suggested it during a meeting with Fatos Nano last month. (AP, AFP - 14/10/02)

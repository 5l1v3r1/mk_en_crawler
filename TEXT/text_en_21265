LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- The foreign ministry on Thursday (August 28th) denied claims by Bosnia and Herzegovina's main Party of Democratic Action (SDA) that it has "cooled" relations with Sarajevo because of Serbia. The SDA recently accused the Slovenian government of "participating in attempts to dismember Bosnia and Herzegovina". The party based its claims on recent meetings between Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik and Slovenian counterpart Janez Jansa, as well as between Slovenian Interior Minister Dragutin Mate and his RS counterpart, Stanislav Cadjo. The SDA said those meetings were clear proof that Slovenia "is pro-Serbian". In its statement, the Slovenian ministry vehemently denied these claims, adding that during its recent EU presidency, Slovenia supported BiH's European integration process.

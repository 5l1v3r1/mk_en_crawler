MOSCOW, Russia -- New President Dmitry Medvedev criticised UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his unilateral decision to reconfigure UNMIK, thus allowing a broader role for the EU police and judicial mission dubbed EULEX. In an interview on his official internet site Thursday (July 3rd), Medvedev said he believes Ban exceeded his authority. "At a minimum, these are decisions that the secretary-general must not take on his own. They must be taken by the UN Security Council. And it's quite strange when the Security Council hasn't made any pronouncement but the secretary-general speaks out on the issue". He reiterated Russia's view that Kosovo's independence sets a dangerous precedent that will trigger separatist movements around the world. (Reuters, Guardian, B92, Beta - 03/07/08)

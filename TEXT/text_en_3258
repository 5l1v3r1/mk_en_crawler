Despite improving economic figures, extreme poverty still exists in Serbia. It affects a significant part of the population and is found mostly in the southeast of the country, according to official data. 
"This is a problem we have to solve, and we will solve it by creating new jobs," President Boris Tadic said earlier this year, marking the UN's World Day to Overcome Extreme Poverty. 
During an open parliamentary discussion on the issue, the chairperson of the Committee for Reduction of Poverty, Snezana Stojanovic-Plavsic, told MPs that the situation is getting better. The rate has dropped slightly over the past three years -- from over 10% to 9.8%. 
Lence Clark, the UN's permanent co-ordinator in Serbia, says one out of 14 persons in the country lives below the poverty line, and the figure is double in rural areas. Around 70% of Serbia's disabled are in danger of poverty, and only 13% are able to find a job. 
Refugees, displaced persons, the Roma, people with special needs and people who lost their jobs in the transition period are among the most vulnerable, experts suggest. People in the Roma community have a poverty rate that is six times higher than that of any other group -- mainly because only 19% of Roma graduate from high school, Clark says. 
Groups at risk for extreme poverty are often cut off from the benefits of an improving economy, at a time when conditions are getting better for society at large. 
Salaries, for example, have been on the rise. Data from the Bureau of Statistics shows that in 2002 the average net monthly salary was 9,208 dinars (the equivalent of 121 euros). It was 11,500 dinars in 2003, 14,108 dinars in 2004, and 17,443 dinars last year (229 euros). 
Employment remains flat, however. A little over 2 million citizens have jobs -- a number that has remained essentially unchanged since 2002.

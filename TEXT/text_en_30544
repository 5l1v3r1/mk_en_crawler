BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) warned Greece on Wednesday (February 16th) that unless it changes it tax amnesty legislation, it may face a lawsuit at the European Court of Justice. According to the Commission, the current law favours Greek residents holding their money abroad. Taxpayers who voluntarily disclose their money kept in foreign banks and transfer the funds to local institutions are taxed at lower rates on those sums than those citizens who keep their money in Greece. "The Commission considers these discriminatory provisions to be incompatible with the freedom to provide services and with the free movement of capital," the EC said in a statement, giving Greek authorities two months to react.

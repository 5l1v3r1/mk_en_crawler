STRASBOURG, France -- The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted a resolution Tuesday (January 26th) on the functioning of democratic institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). The document expresses concern for the lack of progress in the country. Presented by Kimmo Sasi of Finland, the draft notes that the so-called Butmir process involving leaders of the main Bosniak, Serb and Croat parties has produced no results in constitutional changes. PACE urges all parties in BiH to engage fully in a constructive dialogue over amendments to the constitution before this year's parliamentary elections.

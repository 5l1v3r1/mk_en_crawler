PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Zeljko Ivanovic, editor of Montenegrin newspaper Vijesti was attacked early Saturday (September 1st), after a celebration marking the 10th anniversary of the paper. Ivanovic said three men beat him with iron rods and wooden sticks. He suggested the attack was organised by people who did not like the investigative journalism published by the paper -- specifically, he said, former Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic and his associates. Vijesti is the first independent newspaper in Montenegro. (RTCG, Vijesti, RTRS, SRNA, Makfax, Reuters, DPA, BIRN - 01/09/07)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Several thousand people had to be evacuated Monday (24 April) when dikes in two areas burst, threatening to flood several villages. Some 2,800 people left their homes in Bistret, Spantov and Oltina. Authorities said another 4,000 people would also have to be evacuated as the Danube continued to rise. Prime Minister Calin Popescu-Tariceanu toured one affected area, while President Traian Basescu toured another. (Rompres - 25/04/06; Reuters, Mediafax, Focus - 24/04/06)

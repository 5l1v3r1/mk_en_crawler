BUCHAREST, Romania -- Former Economy Minister Codrut Seres confirmed on Thursday (December 21st) that he has been accused of espionage and treason stemming from the privatisation process. Seres made the statement while leaving the Prosecutors' Office within the Supreme Court. He insisted he was innocent and said he hoped an investigation would prove this. Reportedly at issue is whether Seres and others provided classified commercial information related to the sale of state companies. Prosecutors have detained eight people, including two foreign consultants. (Ziua - 22/12/06; Mediafax, AP, Reuters - 21/12/06)

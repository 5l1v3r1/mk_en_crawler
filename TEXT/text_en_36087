SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski said on Saturday (20 March) that local authorities are co-operating with KFOR to prevent armed groups in Macedonia from crossing into Kosovo to join the conflict there. So far, Buckovski said, the co-operation has yielded results, with no infiltration reported. He warned however the situation in Kosovo is dangerous and possibility of a spillover exists. Co-operation among the defence ministry, the interior ministry and the state intelligence agency has been raised to the highest possible level. (Sitel TV, A1 TV - 20/03/04)

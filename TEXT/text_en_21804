NEW YORK, United States -- Bosnia and Herzegovina is poised to take significant steps on its path to EU integration, High Representative Miroslav Lajcak told British Foreign Secretary David Miliband, on the sidelines of a UN meeting in New York. "The country must now focus on the implementation of the Stabilisation and Association agreement, which comes with obligations as well as benefits," Lajcak said on Tuesday (May 20th). Concerning the transition of his Office of the High Representative to an EU-led mission, Lajcak said that the faster objectives and conditions are met, the sooner it would take place.
In other news Tuesday, Fausto Pocar, president of the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague, visited the Foca prison with Bosnian Serb Justice Minister Dzerard Selman. Inmate Radovan Stankovic escaped from the facility last year. He was convicted of rape and crimes against humanity committed in 1992, and was the first Hague tribunal indictee whose case was transferred to a national court. Pocar said he wanted to see what measures were taken to investigate the escape and to prevent any others. (Nezavisne Novine - 21/05/08; RTRS, Fena, OHR website - 20/05/08)

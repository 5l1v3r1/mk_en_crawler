ANKARA, Turkey -- A series of media reports Thursday (April 5th) suggested that Turkey has decided to freeze negotiations with the French company Gaz de France over a major European gas pipeline project, Nabucco. At issue is the French legislature's adoption of a bill making it crime to deny that the former Ottoman Empire committed genocide against Armenians in 1915. The Turkish government had warned that there would be economic implications if the measure passed. 
The Nabucco project involves the construction of a 3,300-km pipeline that would carry natural gas from Turkey to Austria, via Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary. It is seen as crucial to reducing Western Europe's dependence on Russian energy supplies. (Zaman, Radikal, Dnevnik - 06/04/07; NTV, Reuters - 05/04/07)

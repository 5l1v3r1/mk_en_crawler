PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Kosovo is observing a day of mourning Monday (22 March) in memory of the 28 people killed last week in violent interethnic clashes. With tensions still high, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer is due to visit the province. On Sunday, an estimated 7,000 people gathered in the village of Cabra for the funeral of two children whose deaths sparked the riots. No incidents were reported. UN police are continuing to investigate the case, in which a group of young Serbs allegedly chased three ethnic Albanian children into a local river. The third child is missing and presumed drowned.
In mainland Serbia, meanwhile, flags flew at half-staff Sunday to mourn the victims of the riots. During a Sunday liturgy, Patriarch Pavle appealed for calm. Belgrade and a few other cities were also shaken by riots. Big weekend rallies were reported in Montenegro as well. UNMIK chief Harri Holkeri said Sunday that the situation has improved.

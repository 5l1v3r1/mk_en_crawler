SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A court in Skopje on Wednesday (October 21st) sentenced Gjorgi Gjorgieski, driver of late pop legend Tose Proeski, to two years in prison for causing the traffic accident in which the singer died. The court ruled the crash was a result of violating traffic rules, insufficient distance between vehicles and high speed. Gjorgieski's lawyer vowed to appeal. Proeski, 26, died on October 16th 2007 on a motorway near the eastern Croatian town of Nova Gradiska, after his car collided with a truck. (A1, MIA, Makfax - 21/10/09)

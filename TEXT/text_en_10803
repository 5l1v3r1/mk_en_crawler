SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO-led peacekeepers launched an operation in the Bosnian Serb town of Pale on Friday (5 November). A spokesman for SFOR said the troops were looking for people who may be helping Radovan Karadzic evade justice. Local media identified the targets as Ranko Cicovic, Karadzic's driver during the war, and Radomir Kojic, the wartime commander of the Bosnian Serb forces in Pale, now a businessman. 
In other news, forensic experts completed the excavation of the second-largest mass grave in BiH on Friday. Some 456 bodies were recovered from the site near the village of Kevljani. The experts have determined that most of the victims were Bosnian Muslims and Croats from the Prijedor area. (AP, AFP, Reuters, NTV Hayat, PBS BiH - 05/11/04)

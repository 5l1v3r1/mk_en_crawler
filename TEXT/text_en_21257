TIRANA, Albania -- Corruption remains a problem in Albania and the government should do more to fight it, said Edward Landau, director of the USAID mission in the country. "More efforts are needed to reduce opportunities for corruption, to allow businesses to be registered without any problem and citizens to pay taxes electronically without dealing with tax agents, who may ask for bribes," Landau said on Thursday (August 28th) in a TV interview.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sali Berisha has appeared in an advertisement video urging the public to fight corruption and bribes in the administrative services. It marks a first for any Albanian prime minister. (TVSH, News 24, BalkanWeb, Shqip - 29/08/08)

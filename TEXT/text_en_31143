SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Appeals Court rejected on Tuesday (January 4th) Macedonia's request to extradite Jovan Vraniskovski, a controversial former bishop of the Macedonian Orthodox Church. The court also revoked his detention and a ban on leaving the country. Border police detained him in November based on an international arrest warrant issued by Macedonia. He has been sentenced there to two and a half years in prison for misusing donations at the diocese he previously headed. (BTA, Dnevnik, MIA, Makfax, A1 - 04/01/11)

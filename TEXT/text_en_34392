ROME, Italy -- Turkish State Minister Ali Babacan attended an informal meeting of EU ministers on regional cohesion policies Monday (20 October). They discussed EU financing for prospective members and candidates. Babacan said he was positive about prospects of significant EU funds coming to Turkey in the near and medium term, given the rapid growth of European investments in countries with membership aspirations. He assured other delegates that Turkey is rapidly reforming its legislation to allow for the proper use of EU funds when they come. The Union's financing for Turkey in 2003-2005 amounts to 1 billion euros. The first tranche was received last week. (Anadolu Agency, NTV - 20/10/03)

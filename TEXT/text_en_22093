THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal granted provisional release Tuesday (April 15th) to two former Serb generals and one former senior activist in the unrecognised entity Herceg-Bosnia, which existed on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) between 1991 and 1994. One of the generals, Vladimir Lazarevic, is charged with conducting a campaign of terror against Kosovo Albanians and other non-Serb civilians in 1999. He was granted provisional release for humanitarian reasons between April 25th and May 1st. 
The second indictee is Serb General Pavle Strugar. He is to be released for six days, starting Wednesday or Thursday. In the early 1990s, Strugar was a commander of the Yugoslav People's Army, which seized the Croatian city of Dubrovnik. Strugar has been convicted of a deliberate attack on civilians and the destruction of buildings but is appealing that verdict.
On Monday, the tribunal agreed to the provisional release of Bosnian Croat Berislav Pusic. He will be released for two weeks, starting on Thursday. Pusic and five other people are charged with crimes against Bosnian Muslims and other non-Croats in southeast BiH between 1992 and 1993. (RIA Novosti - 16/04/08; UN website, ITAR-TASS - 15/04/08)

TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha responded on Thursday (September 16th) to a comment by Greek counterpart George Papandreou, regarding protecting the Greek minority in Albania. Following some incidents by nationalists, Papandreou suggested such acts may create serious problems in relations between the two countries, even support for Albania's EU integration. In response, Berisha said on Thursday "I don't think Greece could take a position to block integration, as it has supported all integration processes in the region." He was in Brussels attending a summit of the European People's Party. (Lajmifundit, Alsat, Klan, Balkan Web - 16/09/10)

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Authorities arrested notorious organised-crime boss Safet Kalic on Saturday (August 30th), local media reported. Kalic underwent questioning at the Rozaje police station before special organised-crime prosecutors took custody of him. Police say the charges against him involved "property violations" but released no further details because of the ongoing investigation. Kalic, leader of the so-called Rozaje Clan, is allegedly one of the biggest drug bosses in the Balkans. Police sources say Kalic has supplied the Zemun Clan with hundreds of kilograms of drugs for years. His name surfaced as police investigated the 2003 assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, but authorities did not file charges against him.

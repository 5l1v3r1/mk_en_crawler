BELGRADE, Serbia -- Three opposition parties held a big rally in the town of Krusevac on Monday (June 28th), demanding early elections. The Serbian Progressive Party, the Democratic Party of Serbia and New Serbia say this was only the first in a series of demonstrations they plan throughout Serbia. Earlier this year, the three parties collected one million signatures in support of their initiative and forwarded them to the government in a symbolic show of dissatisfaction. The three lack enough votes in parliament to topple the cabinet. (Tanjug, RTS, B92 - 28/06/10)

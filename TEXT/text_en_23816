ATHENS, Greece -- Police arrested two Bulgarian nationals Sunday (June 21st) carrying guns and explosives in Prokom, near the Promahonas checkpoint along the Greek-Bulgarian border, media reported. The two allegedly tried to sell to an undercover police officer four guns with silencers, an AK-47 machine gun, 1.4kg of TNT, and 5.4kg of ammonia nitrate, which is used both as a fertilizer and in making bombs. Police also discovered a small quantity of cocaine. Authorities believe the suspects intended to sell weapons and explosives to a local organised crime group.
In other news, police in Athens said they are questioning a suspect who turned himself in claiming responsibility for the killing of a policeman in December 2004, local media reported Saturday. Officer Haralambos Amanatidis was shot dead outside the British defence attachÃ©'s residence in the northern Athens suburb of Kifissia. The 32-year-old suspect gave himself up on Friday following his release from prison where he spent 17 months for other crimes.

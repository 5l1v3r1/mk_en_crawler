BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Constitutional Court ruled on Friday (June 25th) that the government's decision to cut pensions by 15% as of mid-year is unconstitutional, as is the decision to end the practice of offering higher pensions for certain professions, including law enforcement and judicial posts. However, the court allowed the 25% cut in salaries of civil servants. The opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) had challenged the cost-cutting measures in court after the cabinet managed to get them passed by parliament. Friday's decision means that the government's austerity plan must be sent back to parliament for revisions. This could delay disbursement of the next tranche under Romania's agreement with the IMF. Deputy Prime Minister Marko Bela said the government must comply with the ruling and will consider other options to narrow the budget deficit, such as raising taxes. The PSD immediately vowed to challenge those in court as well. (Reuters, AFP, AP, DPA, Mediafax, Agerpres - 25/06/10)

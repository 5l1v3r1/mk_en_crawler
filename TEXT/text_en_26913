TIRANA, Albania -- Nine illegal Albanian immigrants were arrested by Greek border police on Sunday (March 7th) after they became stuck in deep snow. After crossing the border illegally, the nine found themselves stranded without food and ended up calling police for help. Rescued by Greek authorities, the group was then transferred to Albanian police on Monday. (VoA, Koha Jone, Shekulli, Lajmifundit - 08/03/10)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Chief Secretary of the Interior Ministry Valentin Petrov resigned on Tuesday (May 20th). Petrov was appointed late last year, after his predecessor was forced to resign due to a scandal involving illegally issued passports. Petrov was implicated in a more recent scandal, involving information leaks to crime bosses, which eventually led to the resignation of his former boss, Rumen Petkov. Incumbent Interior Minister Mihail Mikov has said he would prefer not to work with Petrov, which likely affected his decision to resign. (Dnevnik, Sega - 21/05/08; BNT, bTV - 20/05/08)

NEW YORK, United States -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on US firms Tuesday (27 January) to invest more money in his country and promised to streamline cumbersome bureaucratic procedures that discourage investors. "My government is conscious of the problems US companies face," he said, adding that he wants the level of business between the two countries to match that of their military co-operation. His comments to an audience of US and Turkish businessmen in New York will likely be echoed Wednesday in meetings with officials in Washington.

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Slovenia and a number of other NATO members are against downsizing the NATO troop presence in Kosovo, Slovenian Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar said on Friday (March 6th). Slovenia and many other NATO countries agree the alliance must continue its involvement in the Western Balkans, the minister said. Earlier this week, KFOR commander General Giuseppe Emilio Gay said KFOR would reduce its contingent in Kosovo because of the country's improved stability. 
In other news, Sweden's Lars Lage Olofson took office on Friday (March 6th) as Kosovo's new auditor general, media reported.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Chief UN war crimes tribunal prosecutor Carla del Ponte says the tribunal will issue an indictment on one of the two investigated cases related to the 2001 security crisis in Macedonia by the end of this year. Speaking in London on Tuesday (21 October), she refused to provide details. Macedonia's public prosecutor's office also declined to comment. But press reports suggest the first case involved a police action in the village of Lyuboten in which 10 ethnic Albanian civilians were killed. The second case reportedly refers to the kidnapping of 12 Macedonian civilians by members of the now defunct National Liberation Army.
In other news Tuesday, prosecutors in Kumanovo officially charged nine ethnic Albanians with terrorism for two bombings this year. The indictees include fugitive extremist leader Jakup Avdil-Cakala. (Utrinski Vesnik, AFP - 22/10/03; MIA, A1 TV - 21/10/03)

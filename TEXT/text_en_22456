SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The foreign ministry on Tuesday (October 14th) delivered a note of protest to the head of the Greek Liaison Office in Skopje, Alexandra Papadopoulou, following the detention of four Macedonian journalists in Greece earlier in the day. "Macedonia considers [the journalists' detention] an inhumane act," the note read, calling on Greek authorities to take appropriate measures and prevent such incidents in the future. Police detained the journalists -- two reporters and a cameraman from the A1 and A2 TV stations and a correspondent from the Nova Makedonija daily -- in the village of Zabrdani, near the northern town of Florina. They underwent questioning for over one hour at a police station and had to present special permits issued by Greece for taking photographs. Later, police released them but barred them from talking to local residents. Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski described the episode as "outrageous".
The Greek government responded, describing Skopje's statements as yet another "provocative attempt at the utter distortion of reality" and "an unacceptable attempt to interfere with Greece's internal affairs".

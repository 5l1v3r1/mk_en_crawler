ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu leaves on Monday (August 30th) for a trip to Iraq and Syria in an effort to ease strained ties between them. Each government recalled their ambassadors after a double terrorist attack in Baghdad's centre earlier this month. Iraq has demanded Syria extradite two Iraqis suspected of involvement in the August 19th terror attacks that left 95 people dead and another 600 injured. Davutoglu will meet with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Foreign Minister Walid Moallem in Damascus and will then travel to Baghdad for talks with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari. Davutoglu will also visit Egypt this week to discuss the situation in the Middle East. (Hurriyet, AFP, Turkish Weekly, Kuna - 29/08/09)

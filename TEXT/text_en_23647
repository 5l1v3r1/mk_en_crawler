PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Lawmakers on Monday (January 26th) approved a decision to dissolve parliament, clearing the way for early elections this spring rather than next year. Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic requested early elections, arguing his government needs a full four-year mandate to ensure the country becomes part of the EU family. Recent polls suggest Djukanovic's Democratic Party of Socialists enjoys the majority of public support. (AP, AFP - 26/01/09)

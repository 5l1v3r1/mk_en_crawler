In other news, the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned Albania on Tuesday that it is nowhere near securing a vaccine against the swine flu virus. Head of the WHO for Albania Anshu Banerjee said pharmaceutical companies prefer bigger countries and those that have more cases of the H1N1, rather than "small clients" like Albania.

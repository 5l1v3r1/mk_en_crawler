TIRANA, Albania -- Bulgaria and Albania signed three co-operation agreements on Wednesday (26 March). The accords in the trade, transport and education areas were signed during Bulgarian Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg's visit to Tirana. He met with his Albanian counterpart, Fatos Nano, as well as with President Alfred Moisiu and Parliament Speaker Servet Pellumbi. The leaders discussed the fight against organised crime, bilateral economic and political ties, and regional infrastructure projects.
In Brussels meanwhile, the European Commission's (EC) Stabilisation and Association report on Albania criticised the pace of economic reforms, persistent corruption and organised crime, and still fragile political stability. The EC acknowledged the level of economic growth but said it was lower than expected. (Shekulli, Koha Jone, Zerri I Popullit - 27/03/03, BTA, European Commission, ATA - 26/03/03)

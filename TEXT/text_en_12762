ARLINGTON, United States -- General James Jones, the top US commander in Europe, confirmed on Thursday (3 March) that the Pentagon plans to establish military facilities in Bulgaria and Romania, as part of the repositioning of US forces in Europe. The general told Stars and Stripes that brigade-sized rotational units from Europe and the United States would be sent to new bare-bone "forward operating sites" in Romania and Bulgaria. Jones also said he hopes to establish a brigade-size storehouse for equipment on the Black Sea, to augment existing sites in Italy and Norway. (Stars and Stripes - 03/03/05)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The federal parliament adopted on Friday (29 August) the action plan to harmonise the respective Serbian and Montenegrin economic structures and legislatures into a common market. In all, 47 Serbian members of parliament and 26 Montenegrin deputies voted in favour, while 18 Serbian lawmakers, including MPs from Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia, voted against it. The European Commission delegation in Belgrade praised the outcome, saying lawmakers had overcome the last obstacle to preparing a feasibility study on opening talks regarding an EU Stabilisation and Association Agreement.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Forensic experts reported on Wednesday (20 August) that they have recovered the remains of 150 people from a mass grave in BiH and expect to find hundreds more. Documents and clothing found at the scene indicate that the victims were killed by Bosnian Serb troops in the area of Zvornik between April and June 1992. Most of the victims were civilians. The bodies of ten women and three children have been recovered so far. The remains were brought to Crni Vrh from other sites sometime near the end of the conflict. A witness tipped off authorities about the existence of the mass grave two months ago. (AP, AFP - 20/08/03)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- In a gesture aimed at strengthening bilateral relations, high-level delegations from Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro met on Monday (2 August) at the St Prohor Pcinjski Monastery in southern Serbia. Macedonia, which celebrated its national holiday on Monday, links the site to the foundation of its state. However, the monastery has been inaccessible to Macedonian politicians for more than a decade, due to disputes between the churches of the two countries. Last year, Serbian priests turned a top Macedonian delegation away from the monastery. This year, after President Branko Crvenkovski laid a wreath at the site, Serbian officials led by Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica crossed the Macedonian border and attended ceremonies there.

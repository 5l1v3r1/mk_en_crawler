PARIS, France -- Just days before the release of the European Commission's (EC) key progress report on Turkey, leading politicians from France's ruling conservative party are calling for a French referendum on Ankara's membership bid. Finance Minister Nicolas Sarkozy said Monday (27 September) that such an important decision "could only be taken after a referendum in France". He was also quoted as saying EU membership could not happen for at least 15 years, given the size of Turkey. French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier also backed the idea for a referendum but said it should be held after membership negotiations with Ankara are finalised.

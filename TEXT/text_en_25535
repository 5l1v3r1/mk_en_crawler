PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu marked on Wednesday (March 24th) the 11th anniversary of NATO's military intervention against Slobodan Milosevic's regime, describing the date as one of the most important in Kosovo history. NATO airstrikes continued for 78 days and "ended the systematic intentions for ethnic cleansing and genocide against citizens of Kosovo", Sejdiu said. He also praised the resistance efforts of the disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army. 
Serbs in northern Mitrovica staged a protest on the anniversary. Waving Serbian flags and shouting slogans against NATO's intervention and current Kosovo institutions, hundreds of Serbs gathered near the bridge that divides Mitrovica in the Serb-dominated north and the ethnic Albanian south.

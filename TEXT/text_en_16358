STRASBOURG, France -- Europe's top human rights body urged Albania on Wednesday (13 July) to significantly improve its treatment of prisoners. Experts inspected 20 correctional institutions and police stations as well as four prison hospitals in 2005. At several, the report cited conditions that "could easily be considered as inhuman or degrading". The Council of Europe says Albania has made little progress in the three years since a similar inspection. (AP - 12/07/06)

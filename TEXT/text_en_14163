SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia must reform its "crippled" judicial system if it wants to make progress in its negotiations with the EU, according to a new report released by the International Crisis Group. The think tank also urged Skopje to reform its police force, devote more resources to stamping out police abuse and corruption, and improve co-ordination between the police and other government institutions. 
Meanwhile, several NGOs in Macedonia -- including the Open Society Institute and Transparency Macedonia -- are criticising the country's new draft law on access to information. In an open letter published Friday (13 January), the NGOs charged that the bill has serious shortcomings, including failure to establish a body to deal with appeals concerning denial of access to information.
In other news, Macedonia's ruling coalition partners and the opposition met on Friday to discuss issues related to electoral reform. Media reports said the two sides agreed on the nomination process for State Election Commission chairman. (Dnevnik, Utrinski Vesnik, Vest, Vecer, RFE-RL - 14/01/06)

ANKARA, Turkey -- The government decided Tuesday (9 December) to launch an investigation into alleged financial misconduct by former Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and five former ministers. Yilmaz is accused of rigging the privatisation of a state-owned bank in favour of a local businessman. The scandal resulted in the collapse of his cabinet in 1999. Three former ministers would be investigated in connection with the same bank, the other two, former ministers of energy, would be probed for irregularities in tenders held by their departments.
In other news, the Turkish government said Tuesday that it would amend a recent regulation regarding student training in the Koran. The rules, adopted in November, sparked controversy and suspicions that the state was encouraging the teaching of Islam. (AP, AFP - 09/12/03)

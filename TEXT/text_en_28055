STRASBOURG, France -- The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted a resolution on Kosovo Tuesday (June 22nd), urging Pristina authorities, EULEX and UNMIK to demonstrate more commitment to strengthening the rule of law, required for Kosovo to meet EU standards. The resolution also reiterates PACE's neutrality in terms of Kosovo's status. The document's author, Bjorn von Sydow, said it takes into account the situation in Kosovo and noted that "courts do not function; the judges are too old; there are allegations of corruption, and EULEX can only investigate a fraction of those allegations." 
He added that the market economy must be based on open businesses, not on secret, corrupted businesses. Von Sydow also said that the resolution focuses on improving living standards for all citizens. He added that Kosovo can apply for membership to the Council of Europe but must first demonstrate sufficient progress. The resolution also calls on authorities in Pristina and Belgrade to find a "constructive and pragmatic attitude" in order to resolve practical problems affecting Kosovo Serbs and other minority communities in or from Kosovo.

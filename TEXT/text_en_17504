BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Supreme Court on Monday (June 25th) postponed by three months the initial hearing in the case against former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase. Prosecutors accuse him of blackmail, taking bribes worth 1.4m euros and promoting an official to a senior post in the state anti-money laundering agency in order to stop an investigation into a $400,000 bank account belonging to his wife. In other news Monday, the Chamber of Deputies rejected a no-confidence motion against Health Minister Eugen Nicolaescu. The Democratic Party blames him for perceived failures in the healthcare sector. (Romania Libera - 26/06/07; BIRN, Reuters - 25/06/07)

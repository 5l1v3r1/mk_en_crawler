THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal expressed dissatisfaction with the co-operation of Serbian authorities in the case against Slobodan Milosevic. Trial prosecutor Geoffrey Nice said Tuesday (3 June) that the Serbian government is obstructing access to important documents that would be instrumental to presenting evidence in the case. Nice said that out of hundreds of requests, only a few documents were transferred. Belgrade authorities said it is inappropriate to accuse local authorities of not co-operating, as they delivered Milosevic in the first place.
Meanwhile, UNMIK police arrested a Kosovo Serb policeman accused of committing war crimes in 1999. Reportedly, the man comes from Mitrovica and the arrest was made on a warrant issued by an international prosecutor. Neither the detainee's identity nor any details concerning the charges have been disclosed. (AFP, B92, Tanjug, FoNet - 02/06/03)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan defended plans by the ruling Justice and Development Party to adopt legislation outlawing adultery. In an interview published Saturday (4 September), the Turkish leader said the measure was intended to strengthen families. He also warned that his country should not blindly imitate Europe as it moves toward membership in the EU. However, a spokesman for EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen said Saturday that the plan "could harm Turkeyâ€™s image" and cast a shadow over its EU bid. Verheugen is visiting Turkey until Thursday, ahead of the expected release of the European Commision's annual report on Turkey's progress in the EU integration process.

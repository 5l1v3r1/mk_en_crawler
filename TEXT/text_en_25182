STRASBOURG, France -- Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn urged the EU on Wednesday (November 25th) to keep the membership door open to countries in the Western Balkans, as well as Turkey and Iceland. Bildt, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, confirmed that visas for Macedonian, Serbian and Montenegrin citizens will be abolished and said he expects that Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Albania would catch up soon. Enlargement has proven to be one of the most successful of all EU policies, he told the European Parliament, while presenting the European Commission's enlargement strategy.
Rehn said Croatia is moving towards its EU membership goal but urged Zagreb to accelerate reforms, especially in fighting corruption and organised crime. He added that Macedonia's progress is convincing but that BiH faces serious problems. Rehn urged Bosnian leaders to agree on reforms needed to bring the country closer to the EU. Turkey, he said, has made progress but has a long way to go before joining the bloc. (B92, Beta, Tanjug, RTS, Fena - 25/11/09)

BURSA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul denied on Monday (26 December) that tensions had surfaced between the government and the business community over election reform issues. Gul's remarks in Bursa followed media reports of strained relations between the cabinet and the Turkish Industrialists' and Businessmen's Association (TUSIAD) following the latter's proposal last week to lower the current 10 per cent election threshold to 7 per cent or 8 per cent. President Ahmet Necdet Sezer attended the TUSIAD board's session and backed the idea. (TurkishPress.com - 26/12/05)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- On Tuesday (17 December), the Supreme Administrative Court upheld its decision to annul the privatisation of the country's tobacco monopoly, Bulgartabac. The judges also ordered the four bidders to submit new and improved bids. In October the court cancelled the government's decision to sell 80 per cent of the company to a Deutsche Bank-led consortium for 110m euros. The three losing bidders appealed the sale on procedural grounds.
In other news, Bulgaria's ruling National Movement Simeon II announced in parliament Tuesday that it is ready to organise a referendum on judicial reforms. The suggestion follows a decision by the Constitutional Court to reject 44 amendments to the judicial law. President Georgi Parvanov expressed scepticism, due to the large number of issues involved.

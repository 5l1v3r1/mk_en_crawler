BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said on Monday (January 26th) that he is asking the EU to send an observer mission to assess Serbia's level of co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal. After a meeting with ministers from the United Kingdom, Germany, Romania and other EU member states in Brussels, Jeremic said Serbia has nothing to hide and wants the EU to "see firsthand what Serbia is doing". He also said his Dutch counterpart, Maxime Verhagen, had accepted an invitation to visit Serbia soon to discuss whether the Netherlands will allow ratification of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Serbia and the EU. The Dutch have been blocking it, pending the capture of war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic. (B92, Tanjug, Beta - 26/01/09)

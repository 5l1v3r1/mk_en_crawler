PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha on Thursday (15 June) urged Kosovo's institutions and its ethnic Albanian population to respect the rights of the Serb minority, and to improve the group's living conditions. Berisha was in Pristina for talks with Prime Minister Agim Ceku and outgoing UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen, and was due to address parliament. In a meeting with Ceku, the two agreed on the need to enhance communications between the two governments and to step up implementation of bilateral agreements. Berisha also backed Kosovo independence, saying it would contribute to security in the Balkans.
In separate talks with Jessen-Petersen, Berisha said Albania will comply with the decision of the international community on Kosovo, and agreed that the statute of the province should be determined as soon as possible. Jessen-Petersen lauded Albania's signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, saying that the event is important for the whole region. (Albanian News - 16/06/06; AP - 15/06/06)

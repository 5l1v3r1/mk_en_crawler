BELGRADE, Serbia -- War crimes indictee Vojislav Seselj, who is currently in custody at the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, was re-elected as leader of the Serb Radical Party at the party congress Sunday (October 8th). The delegates also re-elected Tomislav Nikolic as party deputy leader. After the voting, Nikolic urged voters to support the country's new constitution -- which describes Kosovo as part of Serbia -- during a referendum later this month. Seselj echoed that sentiment in a letter sent to the congress. Indicted for war crimes allegedly committed during the 1991-1995 conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, his trial starts later this year.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic said on Wednesday (May 26th) that Serbia may stop co-operating with EULEX following the mission's decision to ban unauthorised visits by Serbian officials. They have been travelling there to campaign ahead of Sunday's unauthorised elections in northern Kosovo. Bogdanovic accused EULEX of taking the side of Kosovo Albanians. "Our patience and our demonstrated constructive approach have their limits," he warned. (RTS, DPA, Tanjug, Beta, B92 - 26/05/10)

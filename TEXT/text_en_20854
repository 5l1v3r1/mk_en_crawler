BELGRADE, Serbia -- Minister for Infrastructure Velimir Ilic cancelled his visit to Podgorica on Wednesday (September 5th) to protest Montenegro's decision not to allow a Serbian bishop into the country. Serbian Orthodox Church Bishop Filaret was banned from visiting Montenegro in late July after his name appeared on a list of people suspected of helping war crimes indictees escape justice. He started a hunger strike nine days ago. (Vijesti, Danas - 06/09/07; Tanjug, RTS, AP, AFP - 05/09/07)

WASHINGTON, United States -- The US administration is ready to commit $30m in assistance to the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" (TRNC) this year, officials said Thursday (8 July). The aid is being seen as a reward for efforts to reunite Cyprus, particularly the Turkish Cypriot vote to support a UN plan for integrating the divided island. News of the US aid comes after the European Commission adopted a package of measures aimed at relieving the TRNC's economic isolation. (NTV, Anadolu Agency - 08/07/04)

ATHENS, Greece -- The government wants an explanation from German Chancellor Angela Merkel's office, following what seemed like a controversial statement regarding Greece's veto of Macedonia's NATO membership, Greek media reported on Saturday (March 28th). Last week, Merkel told German lawmakers that NATO's enlargement is of the utmost importance and stressed the Alliance "should not have allowed certain countries to introduce its own rules by resorting to veto". Some in Athens viewed that as a reference to Greece's decision to veto Macedonia's NATO bid at the Alliance's summit in Bucharest last April. But sources in Merkel's office say she was instead referring to Russia and its opposition to Ukraine and Georgia's membership in NATO. (Kathimerini, Eleftheros typos, Makfax - 28/03/09)

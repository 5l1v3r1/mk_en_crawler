VIENNA, Austria -- President Heinz Fischer said on Sunday (10 July) in a radio interview that Croatia and Turkey cannot be compared as regards their EU entry bids. He explained that Croatia has worked hard to meet its EU obligations and has made remarkable economic progress. Acknowledging the problem of full co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal, Fischer said he believes the country's prospects for full EU membership are generally very strong. Fischer continued that Turkey's is a different case and among other things, the EU should take into account the country's large population. 
In Berlin, however, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said the EU could not risk closing the door to Turkey, noting the country's geographic proximity to crisis regions of the world and the role Ankara frequently plays in regional security. (Zaman - 11/07/05; HINA - 10/07/05)

Approximately 280,000 Macedonians will see an average 15% increase in their pensions this month. The decision, reached earlier this month by the government, replaces the planned 10% across the board hike. 
The new increases -- between 20% and 10% -- will equalise the payouts, Minister of Labour and Social Policy Ljupco Meskov said at a press conference. 
The government will raise the lowest pensions by 20%; those amounting to 100 to 170 euros by 15%; pensions of up to 240 euros by 12%; and pensions of more than 240 euros by 10%, according to Meskov. 
The first group includes about 120,000 pensioners, the second 110,000, the third 35,000 and the fourth group has around 12,000 pensioners, the minister said. 
About 97% of pensioners began receiving the increase last week, and the rest will receive the increase beginning in July. 
Meskov described it as a huge step for the government since the average pension had been based on average salaries. "Through this harmonisation, pensions will approximate to the dynamics of the salary increase," Meskov said. 
The increase was made possible by a 9.4% surplus in the Pension and Invalidity Insurance Fund. That surplus is expected to increase further this year. 
Other contributing factors were the introduction of the flat tax and the reduction of the gray economy in the country. Tax collection has increased, as has the government's financial discipline. 
The pension increase was carried out with the consent of the IMF. Fund representatives say that as long as the budget deficit is kept within the projected 1.5% of GDP, the costs are believed to be within the IMF's low-inflation and low-interest policy. 
The raise -- the first in 15 years -- was welcomed, especially in light of rising prices for basic necessities. As a token of the pensioners' appreciation, the Dostoinstvo (Dignity) Pensioners' Association presented Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski with a certificate of gratitude.

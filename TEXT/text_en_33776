BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Federal Defence Minister Boris Tadic laid out conditions Tuesday (25 November) for his agreement to lead Serbia's Democratic Party (DS) into next month's early general elections. The most important condition is that he be allowed to approve the list of candidates, insisting none have "skeletons in the closet". He wants Finance Minister Bozidar Djelic on the ticket, but not DS Deputy President Cedomir Jovanovic.
In other news, NATO Secretary General Lord George Robertson visits Belgrade on Wednesday. In an exclusive interview Tuesday with Serbian TV, he said Serbia must fulfill the political conditions to be better integrated in Euro-Atlantic structures, especially the Partnership for Peace programme. The chief condition is the arrest and extradition of war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic. (Beta, Tanjug, B92, BBC - 25/11/03)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX insists on concrete evidence before it starts investigating Council of Europe Rapporteur Dick Marty's allegations against former Kosovo Liberation Army members. "We have opened a preliminary investigation. Of course, we cannot act only on suspicions, but rather based on evidence. We will continue to seek evidence, not only from Marty, but from everyone who has evidence," deputy head of EULEX Andy Sparkes told public RTK TV on Monday (April 11th). Marty published a report in December implicating many political figures in crimes and wrongdoings during and after the 1998-1999 war in Kosovo. (RTK, TV 21, Indeksonline - 11/04/11)

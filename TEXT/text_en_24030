SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Leaders of the Bosnian Party of Democratic Action (SDA) held an extraordinary session Wednesday (June 17th) to discuss Republika Srpska (RS)'s latest move. The RS parliament refuses to withdraw its resolution obliging entity institutions and officials to oppose any future transfer of power to BiH. The resolution was published Monday in the Official Gazette, despite calls from High Representative Valentin Inzko to drop it. He argues the resolution violates both the Dayton Peace Accord and BiH's constitution. The SDA presidency unanimously supported leader Sulejman Tihic, who refused to attend a meeting with the main political parties in Banja Luka. The talks were part of the so-called "Prud Process", which calls for regular meetings among key leaders. (Fena, Dnevni Avaz, Srna - 17/06/09)

MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The government of the BiH Federation decided to reduce the length of military service for conscripts recruited in April of this year. The government made the decision during its regular session in Mostar on Thursday (14 August). Officials said the past four months provided sufficient training for the recruits and they would be released 30 days ahead of schedule. The move is seen as a cost-cutting measure for the cash-strapped army. (BHTV1 - 14/08/03)

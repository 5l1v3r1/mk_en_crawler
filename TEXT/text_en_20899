BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) kicked off a campaign Sunday (November 4th) to promote its concept of military neutrality for Serbia. The party says this would be "the best and most reliable way for Serbia to preserve its state sovereignty, integrity and independence". DSS Vice-President Milos Aligrudic says neutrality would make Serbia similar to Switzerland and Austria. The DSS opposes NATO membership for Serbia, saying the Alliance is largely responsible for the current crisis in Kosovo. (Tanjug, B92 - 04/11/07)

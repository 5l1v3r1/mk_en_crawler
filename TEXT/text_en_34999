SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) welcomed Monday (8 December) the decision of the BiH government to finally appoint a head of the Indirect Tax Administration. Following two previous failures due to wrangling between the Bosniak and the Croat sides, the BiH cabinet eventually decided to appoint Kemal Causevic to the post. Despite concerns the move was prompted by external political pressure from the European Commission, the OHR said it was pleased that direct international intervention was avoided. Causevic, 37, has held various posts at the BiH Finance Ministry. (RTRS, Onasa - 08/12/03)

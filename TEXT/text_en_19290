ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police arrested retired General Mladen Markac Saturday (December 29th) following a request by the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague, police spokesman Krunoslav Borovec said. Croatian authorities have confirmed the general breached his house arrest a week ago in order to join a hunting trip with several high ranking Croatian officials, including Interior Minister Ivica Kirin. Local media subsequently published a photo of Markac, Kirin and their catch, a dead wild boar.
Kirin has submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Ivo Sanader. In a statement he said he feels a moral obligation to step down, given that he was the person supposed to guarantee that Markac complies with his provisional release rules. The 52-year-old Markac is on trial for war crimes allegedly committed during 1995's Operation Storm.

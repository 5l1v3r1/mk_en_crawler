SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prime Minister Nikola Spiric threatened on Sunday (March 30th) to step down if the police reform package fails to muster the necessary support in parliament for a second time. "If the laws fail, political parties will know why and they better then search for some actor to put on the top of the Council of Ministers because I will no longer be interested in occupying the seat," Spiric was quoted as saying by the Nezavisne Novine newspaper. He equated a rejection of police reform bills with a vote of no confidence against the government. Spiric stressed that his Party of Independent Social Democrats wants to proceed with EU integration, as it believes there is no alternative for BiH.
At their weekend meeting in Slovenia, EU foreign ministers said they are prepared to seal a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with BiH on April 28th provided the police reform package is approved on time. Parliament is to vote on the bills Wednesday. (Nezavisne Novine, RTRS, Focus - 31/03/08)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov announced on Thursday (April 2nd) he will schedule the elections for the European Parliament (EP) on June 7th, which is the last possible date within the legal period set by the EU. Brussels has agreed to this date, Parvanov said. He urged Bulgarian lawmakers to quickly decide on the election rules. He also announced that the elections for national parliament will occur between June 28th and July 5th, thus preventing the possibility of holding the two elections on the same date.
In other news on Thursday, the parliament approved amendments to the penal code to double the maximum jail term for vote fraud, a move prompted by EU calls for stepped-up anti-corruption measures for the European elections. People who organise vote-buying schemes will now face a six-year jail term. (BTA, Darik, Sofia news agency, BNT, BNR, Nova TV, bTV, Reuters - 02/04/09)

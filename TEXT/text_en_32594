PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Michael Steiner sent a letter Monday (3 March) to the leaders of Serbia, inviting them for talks on what he described as "practical issues". Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic and his deputy, Nebojsa Covic, were asked to send a delegation next week to discuss questions concerning trade relations, energy, transport and recognition of license plates and personal documents. Steiner stressed, however, that the future of Kosovo would not be on the agenda. The UN Security Council has said the question of future status will be addressed only after sufficient progress has been achieved in several important areas. Covic expressed his government's readiness to participate in the talks while raising issues of its own, including refugee returns. (AP, AFP, Blic, B92, Tanjug, FoNet - 03/03/03)

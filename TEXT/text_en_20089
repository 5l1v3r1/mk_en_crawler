PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A Ukrainian police officer deployed as part of UNMIK died late on Monday (March 17th) from injuries received during clashes with Serbs in Mitrovica earlier in the day, the Kosovo Police Service announced on Tuesday. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry says a total of 20 police officers and troops were injured, with two remaining in critical condition. About 80 Serbs were wounded in the unrest, which erupted after UNMIK police and KFOR raided a court building the Serbs had seized. 
Belgrade is now consulting with Russia about ways to halt violence in Kosovo. Both Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and President Boris Tadic have urged KFOR and UNMIK not to use force against Serbs. 
Leaders within the international community called for calm Monday. "This violence leads nowhere and does not benefit anyone," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said during a visit to Ljubljana, Slovenia. Separately, NATO spokesman James Appathurai said the Alliance "condemns in the strongest way the violence we have seen in northern Kosovo".

MITROVICA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- KFOR has decided to remove fixed security checkpoints in Mitrovica as the security situation in the region improves, Brigade Northeast Commander Gen Marc Bertuchi said Friday (1 August). He told Tanjug news agency that escorts would no longer be provided, while checkpoints would be lifted in less strategic locations. However, he stressed that KFOR patrols would react quickly should problems arise.

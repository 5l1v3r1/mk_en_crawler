PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The Kosovo Central Electoral Commission announced on Thursday (September 13th) that 65 parties and coalitions will participate in the November local and parliamentary elections. The commission added that eight Serbian political groups will participate, despite the call for a boycott by Belgrade. For the first time, a coalition of NGOs will assess candidates' backgrounds, to determine any involvement in illegal activities. 
Also Thursday, the Serbian government reiterated its call for a boycott, saying UNMIK has failed to ensure even basic conditions for Serbs and other non-Albanians in Kosovo.
Moderate Kosovo Serb leader Oliver Ivanovic weighed in, saying a boycott would be tantamount to supporting the partition of Kosovo. Ivanovic said that if the 60,000 Serbs living in Kosovo do not vote, they will lose any chance of influencing the future.

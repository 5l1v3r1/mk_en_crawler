PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu warned on Tuesday (August 14th) that Pristina may reconsider its participation in negotiations on future status, if the notion of partitioning the province is proposed. Kosovo's territorial integrity is inviolable, local media quoted him as saying.
Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha also criticised the idea of partition, saying territorial changes would threaten regional security. "Further divisions in the Balkans under the motif of creating ethnically-based states will open a set of crisis and dangerous conflicts not only for our peninsula but also for Europe," Berisha warned. 
In Skopje, Vlado Popovski, an adviser to Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, voiced concerns that partitioning Kosovo could lead to a similar split in Macedonia, federalisation or another, more radical Ohrid Agreement. The government stopped short, however, of issuing an official statement on the matter.
Meanwhile, Kosovo Serb leader Momcilo Trajkovic told the daily Dnevnik on Tuesday that Serbia would never participate in any effort to partition Kosovo. "Even supervised independence is better than the scenario envisaging partition of the province, as heretical as it may sound," Trajkovic said. 
Moscow has also rejected partition. Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko, Russia's representative in the troika mediating new talks on final status, described any mention of partition as "spurious".

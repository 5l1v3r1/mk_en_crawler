SLUNJ, Croatia -- A two-month long international military exercise ended Monday (21 June) in Slunj, northwestern Croatia. Participants included the United States and eight of the countries of the South-Eastern Europe Brigade -- Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Macedonia, Romania and Turkey. US Ambassador to Zagreb Ralph Frank said the exercise confirmed Croatia's commitment to becoming an active member of NATO's collective defence.
Also Monday, Croatia signed a financing agreement with Germany to fund mine-clearing operations near the Hungarian border. Germany has already provided more than 4m euros for such projects. (HINA, HRT - 21/06/04)

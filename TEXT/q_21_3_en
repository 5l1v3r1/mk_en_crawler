III. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 
A. Policy 
1. Please describe the policy for the development of the information society in your country. If a strategy document exists, please provide a copy in an EU language. Is there any policy initiative similar to the eEurope initiative? 
The strategic goal of eEurope is to move fast towards a global information society. The modern trends are the introduction of broadband, convergence of the existing networks, the integration of services, a digital economy, digital administration and a knowledge based society. The strategic goal of the Republic of Macedonia is membership of the EU. Development of an information society is an intrinsic part of the long-term reforms that the country has initiated, in order to achieve EU standards.  Initiatives for IS development: 
The challenges Macedonia is facing, in its development of an information society, are low internet penetration (<5% of population), a low level of ICT literacy, the absence of motivational legal regulation for the expansion of e-commerce, lack of IT system integration in the public institutions and on-going institutional reforms. In addition to the transitional shocks and poor economic climate, the country is facing a ‘digital divide’.  To encourage activities to drive the country towards an information society and a digital economy, the “e-Macedonia for all” initiative was started by the former president Boris Trajkovski in July 2000. It was followed by the preparation of the “e- Declaration 2002”, a document with specific recommendations for accelerating the development of an information society and digital economy in the country. This declaration was officially adopted by Parliament in July 2002 (see 19_Annex_02
and is recognised as a national priority. 
The following six gaps that the country needs to close have been identified: (i) bringing together the private sector and the Research and Development community; (ii) creating an enabling environment for a pro-active adaptation and use of ICT by government and businesses; (iii) establishing new e-government services for citizens and businesses; (iv) improving the regulatory framework; (v) protecting intellectual property rights; and (vi) developing the necessary competencies and skills. The document recommends specific actions to be undertaken by all actors – the Government, Businesses, ICT companies, Universities, Units of local self-government (LG) and the Media. Therefore, the document itself calls for a form of “strategic bonding” for the development of an ICT Society in Macedonia and offers a shared vision for harnessing ICT for development (ICTD).  On the regional level, within the Stability Pact, the country is committed to the eSEE regional initiative, as a signatory of the “eSEE Agenda for the Information Society” in Belgrade 2003, and has reaffirmed its commitments by signing the “Joint statement for Building Information Society” in Budapest in 2004.  European Partnership Framework, the platform for streamlining the key national priorities of the EU integration process, including the information society development, fully incorporates the regional eSEE agenda, thus giving the EU dimension to the initiative.  On the global level, the country has also committed itself to the Declaration of Principles and Plan of Action, adopted during the first phase of WSIS (World Summit on the Information Society) in Geneva in December 2003. Committee for Information Technology (CIT): 
Following these initiatives and its commitments, at the end of 2002 the government established the Committee for Information Technology (CIT). Its strategic considerations were: 
  ICT should foster the economic development of Macedonia, decrease the number of unemployed and enable the establishment of new markets;   Macedonia should join the developed countries in research and the development of new technologies, and foster their use in the creation of new products and services; and   There is an urgency for the development of digital administration, that will satisfy the needs of citizens and companies; The  CIT’s Work Programme for the period 2003-2007 (see 19_Annex_03), and a corresponding Action Plan, describe the goals, priorities and activities of the Committee:   Advise the Government in formulating information society policies and creating an environment for ICT development. Initiate, promote and coordinate the activities in ICT domains;   Ensure open and participatory work of the Committee: -  Establish a web site, www.kit.gov.mk, and open communication with the public; -  Establish the Information Centre of the Committee with registers of all issues related to sustainable ICT development policy and strategy; and -  Initiate panel discussions with the key stakeholders: ministries, economic, educational, cultural and scientific institutions as well as the donor community, in the analysis of the current situation of ICT in Macedonia.   Assess the current situation: -  Assess the current IT situation, and initiate a survey, in order to select clear indicators for benchmarking with eEurope+; -  Review good practice and experiences elsewhere ( countries in the region and developed countries); -  Review the legislation, and all legal, administrative and technical obstacles that exist in the public sector; and -  Take into consideration the current decentralisation reform and assess the opportunities for balanced central/local development initiatives.   Prepare the environment for the development of a NISP and an Action Plan for its implementation: -  Establish teams to develop the NISP and the Action Plan; -  Define a clear organisational structure and clear roles and responsibilities for the implementation of the IS Action Plan; -  Review and establish mechanisms for incorporating ICT projects into the state budget, and establish appropriate financial management mechanisms.   Correlate the ICT priorities with the European Partnership Action Plan priorities and streamline the donor community projects; create an integrated framework for planning, priority target areas and strategic projects.   Coordination of the priority projects in the national interest: -  Implementation of strategic ICT projects focused on improving the confidence of the citizens and the accountability of the government. These are: (1) EU integration process; (2) Integrated cross-border management system; (3) Integrated customs system; (4) Integrated justice system; (5) Social protection; (6) Education and science; and (7) Public procurement. -  Macedonia gov.mk - The Government must offer a web page which will provide comprehensive information about its work including routine information; budget information; grants etc; -  E-business (initiate projects focused on economic growth, e-business, promotion of the ICT sector); and -  Internet public access points - the Committee will initiate a project for the installation of public access pointstaking into account the very limited resources of citizens.   Defining the Committee’s strategies for joint action outside Macedonia, within the frameworks of regional and global initiatives; Based on the work programme, the CIT has initiated, facilitated and supported a number of activities in order to foster information society developments.  

Progress Report on the country commitments to develop information society: 
Two of the main objectives of the Committee for Information Technology are to prepare environment for development of national policies for information society, and increase in the speed of implementation of actions according to the eSEE Agenda and the WSIS Agenda commitments. These initiatives are in strong correlation with the EU integration process and the national priorities of the Republic of Macedonia. 
The Republic of Macedonia is committed to the following:    To develop National information society policies and strategies;    The adoption of a legal and regulatory framework;    The establishment of regional and national implementation mechanisms;    The promotion of an active IS for development; and  ICT benchmarking 
The following is a progress report on the key activities, in the light of country commitments to develop an information society: 
1.1 Development of NISP and the Action Plan 
The CIT presented its Conceptual Framework of principles, actions and priorities for e-government at a round table in November 2003. (see 19_Annex_04). The following key strategic factors have been identified for assessment: (1) the institutional framework; (2) the legal and regulatory framework; (3) human resource capacity; (4) budgetary resources; (5) the flow of information between institutions; (6) telecommunications and informatics infrastructure; (7) current connectivity and ICT usage within the government; (8) the e-business climate; (9) readiness for change within the government at all levels; and (10) other factors determining the society’s readiness, including national infrastructure, political stability, economy, social situation, education, information policies and private sector developments. During 2004, the relevant activities for the formulation of the NISP have been intensified. The CIT has signed an agreement with UNDP and the Foundation Open Society Institute Macedonia (FOSIM) to develop a National Information Society Policy (NISP) and Strategy (see 19_Annex_05). The short term project objective is the formulation of the NISP and an associated Action Plan, through a truly inclusive and open consultation process. The long term objective is to ensure that ICT is harnessed in addressing poverty and strengthening and expanding e-governance based practices, and supporting the processes towards EU integration. The project strategy is based on the eSEE Common Guidelines for NISP, prepared by the UNDP Regional Support Centre (Bratislava, Slovakia), and the South East Europe Telecommunications and Informatics Research Institute (INA, Thessalonica, Greece).  In order to coordinate and communicate the process of formulation of the NISP and the implementation the Action Plan, a Project Advisory Board (PAB), Donor Coordination Board (DCB) and Task Force (TF) have been established. The  NISP Task Force, consisting of representatives from the Government institutions, Universities and Research Centres, Chamber of Commerce, NGOs, MASIT (Macedonian Association of IT companies), Media and other relevant institutions, had a series of brainstorming and consultation sessions on 3 & 4 December 2004 in Skopje. In addition, a one-week training course at the e-Governance Academy in Tallinn – Estonia has been organised (13-17 December 2004). The TF shaped the initial framework of the NISP strategic document which is built around the following pillars:  ICT Infrastructure;  e-Citizens;  e-Business;  e-Education;  e-Health;  e-Government;   Information Society and Sustainable Development; and    Regulatory environment and Legal Aspect as a Cross-cutting issue. For each of these pillars there will be an assessment of current positions, a definition of strategic directions and policy measures and the roadmap for the implementation of key strategic projects as well as the main indicators for benchmarking will be defined.  The main NISP principles are: 
  The NISP should be a nationally driven process;   The strategy be consistent with national priorities;   Targets must be achievable, in line with the actual human and financial capacity;   The vision must be built on the confidence and trust of the citizens and should have a clear orientation towards improving the quality of life;   It should be an open and participatory process, including stakeholders from different areas;   It should follow the eSEE guidelines, the eEurope, eEurope+, eEurope 2005 action plans and benchmarking standards;  The ICT sector is a key factor for economic growth and increasing employment opportunities; and  EU integration process is the transformation vehicle to bring Macedonia from its current position to the EU society based on ICT and knowledge. 
The NISP should be supported by: 
  Strong political commitment;   A public campaign for the promotion of NISP, raising awareness of the potential role of ICT in national development;   A clear institutional infrastructure to coordinate and implement the NISP Action Plan;   Budget provision (national) and strong support from the donor community; and   Employment of ICT specialists in government institutions at an appropriate managerial level.. In parallel, the CIT has been working continuously in close cooperation with the donor community, taking into consideration their priorities, recommendations and experiences. The Draft NISP and the Action Plan will be communicated to the Donor Coordination Board for comments, suggestions and possible contributions. The NISP will be developed by March 2005 and will be presented for adoption by the Parliament no later than June 2005. 1.2 ICT Related Legal and Regulatory Framework 
Establishing a predictable legal and non-discriminatory regulatory framework in line with EU standards is the main precondition for attracting foreign investments and obtaining significant benefits from ICT. In general, the legal framework for the development of the IS, is in an advanced draft stage. The following is the current status of the legislation (at January 2005). Legislation related to IS EU measures Status Law on electronic communication 32002L0019; 32002L0020; 32002L0021; 32002L0022; 32002L0058; 32002L0077;  32002D0676; 32000R2887; 31998L0048; 31998L0034; 31998L0084;   Advanced draft (government) enactment expected 2005 Law on broadcasting 31989L0552; 31997L0036;   Advanced draft (ministry); enactment expected 2005; Law on postal services 31987L0067; Initial draft (ministry) Protection of personal data 31995L0046;   Enacted, January 2005  Protection of consumers 31984L0450; 31985L0374; 31985L0577; 31987L0357; 31988L0378; 31992L0059; 31993L0013; 31994L0047; 31997L0007; 31997L0055; 31998L0006; 31998L0027; 31999L0044; 32001L0095;   Enacted, 2004 Copyright and related rights 31984L0450; 31985L0374; 31985L0577; 31987L0357; 31988L0378; 31992L0059; 31993L0013; 31994L0047; 31997L0007; 31997L0055; 31998L0006; 31998L0027; 31999L0044; 32001L0095;    Enacted, January 2005; Access to information 31990L0313;   Advanced draft, 1 phase; (parliament), expected enactment 2005 Electronic signature 31999L0093;   Enacted, 2001 Electronic commerce/ business 32000L0031 NO Amended criminal code Yes Convention on Personal Data Protection Signed; ratified; Ratified: 24.01.2005 Convention on Cyber Crime Signed; ratified; Ratified: 15.09.2004; Independent regulatory body of telecommunications Yes/No; planned for 2005 Government structure dedicated to IS development CIT; Sector for Informatics within the government; ICT centre within the Ministry of education; IT departments within the ministries; Agency for Civil Servants; State Statistical Bureau In progress In parallel, activities related to the increasing of the institutional capacity for implementation of legislation, have been intensified. Progress has been made in:    Intensifying the activities related to the telecommunication sector and liberalisation of electronic communications; operational Directorate for Telecommunications (planned for 2005);   Establish Data Protection Directorate (planned for 2005);   Activities in the field of regulation, organisational structure and technological environment to implement the digital signature and e-commerce legislation; and   Further cooperation with the eSEE countries on security issues and implementation of the ratified Cyber Crime and Personal Data Protection Conventions. 
1.3 ICT Benchmarking 
The introduction of some benchmarking system has been identified as a key factor for appropriate positioning and comparison of IS developments with the eEurope benchmarking standards. The CIT has facilitated and supported a number of surveys on the current ICT situation in the Republic of Macedonia. Data has been collected on different target groups and data analysis from different aspects has been conducted:  SEED/PSP, supported by GTZ Strategy to develop information technology in Macedonia, with special reference to the Software Development Sector, July 2003 http://www.gtzpsp.com.mkUNDP – Local e-Governance ICT assessment of Macedonian municipalities. The analysis is a basis for local community development programmes in line with the current process of decentralisation, 2003 http://www.undp.org.mkFOSIM  General Data about the situation regarding ICT, July 2004. Data and results on knowledge about ICT technologies, their usage, and the actual state of ICT in the companies in general http://www.soros.org.mkCBS  IT baseline statistics survey 2002-2003, with the goal of identifying the capacity and trends in the ICT Sector, July 2004 http://www.cds.com.mk
Although no consistent benchmarking methodology is implemented, data collected are valuable resources for the assessment of starting and current ICT positions and key indicators. To ensure that the NISP and the Action Plan are in the line with EU standards, and to relate with the eEurope benchmarking indicators, the CIT initiated a statistical review of ICT usage in the Republic of Macedonia, to be conducted by the State Statistical Bureau, according to EUROSTAT methodology: (1) non-financial enterprises; (2) financial enterprises; (3) households; and (4) government bodies and the public sector. Data will be collected on hardware equipment, networking, Intranet, web usage, presentation and connectivity, operating systems, databases, software, searching engines used, human resources related to ICT, trainings and investments in ICT. Data collection is underway. The NISP TF will select a set of indicators in order to ensure consistency with the eSEE and eEurope benchmarking standards. The result will be incorporated into the e-Readiness component of the NISP and the Action Plan, March 2005 – June 2005. 
1.4 Establishment of regional cooperation and national implementation mechanisms 
The eSEE initiative builds its agenda from both, the Stability pact specific targets for co-operation and regional development: economic prosperity, democracy, social cohesion, stability, and regional security, and the eEurope and eEuorpe+ processes for building inclusive information society, taking into account specific situations of the region’s countries.  All of these specific targets are translated into the European Partnership Framework (EP) priorities and the national priorities of the Republic of Macedonia.  The integration of ICT development programmes into this framework plays an important role in meeting EU objectives and those of the broader information society agenda. The NISP will strongly correlate these priorities in the national policies for developing information society. The Republic of Macedonia has been working on the following priorities: (1) education and research; (2) development of local democracy; (3) fighting organised crime and corruption, drugs, migration, border management and security issues; (4) entrepreneurship and employment; and (5) Other key priorities: financial, social, health, culture, agriculture, statistics and the environment sector. These priorities reflect long-term reforms and in-depth programmes that the country has initiated in order to achieve EU standards. All these reforms have incorporated both, the regional cooperation and the national implementation mechanisms.   In light of the information society developments, the ICT systems incorporated into the reforms present the building blocks of the information society, on national,  regional  and  broader level. Building the information systems and networks within the sector reforms are the groundwork for bridging the ‘digital divide’, and ‘European divide’, for establishing information society for all. The ICTs integrated into these priorities can serve as vehicles for economic growth and as tools for development, thus accelerating the pace of sector reforms and maximising the benefits of information technology.  Careful  phasing of the reforms, creating the institutional building blocks and the gradual incorporation of ICT should make progress towards European integration. Currently, there are significant efforts on both national and regional levels, and partial results have been achieved in the following selected areas: 
EDUCATION & RESEARCH Educational reforms (2005-2015) Establishing a schools network for all primary and secondary schools Computerisation of all primary and secondary schools; establishing computer labs; access to internet; result 57pupils/PC for primary, and 24.5 for secondary schools; introduction of broadband to underserved areas; (For more details see 18_I_C_3)  Upgrade of Macedonian Academic and Research Network (MARNet), connection to ERA, GEANT Connecting the Skopje universities campuses; connection to GEANT and ERA; continuation in the FW6; (need national budget contribution); (For more details see 19_III_C_3Educational programmes Training of teachers, pupils, introducing modern technological tools; VET educational programmes, ROMA educational programme; University reforms Curricula, research of new technologies, e-libraries; e-business; university networks;  These projects are in line with the ongoing process of reforms in the educational system (2005-2015). The main goal is create a technological infrastructure to enable access, increasing the knowledge and skills of the younger generation, which is necessary in the modern competitive world. The vision of the former President Trajkovski “computerisation of all schools, enabling access to the Internet, increasing computer literacy, and introducing modern technological learning tools” is becoming a reality. Upgrading of the MARNet, and connection to regional networks, ERA, and GEANT. It is of outmost importance for the researchers; a critical challenge is the financial contribution of the country in participation of FW6 programme; EP/NISP pillars: ICT infrastructure; e-Education; 
DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW  Reforms (2005-2007) (Police, Judiciary, Customs, Finance) Regional cooperation Established MARRI regional centre (migration, asylum regional cooperation);  Regional cooperation and exchange of information in the fight against corruption, terrorism, drugs and migration and asylum; ICT support. Police reforms Establishing a network for the Integrated Cross Border Management System, connecting responsible institutions;  ICT support to the Data Protection Directorate and the Department for the Fight Against Organised Crime, including computer crime; Implementing Data Protection and Cyber Crime Conventions; Judiciary reform Integrated Judiciary Information System; computerisation of courts, prisons, prosecution offices; The goal is increasing the courts effectiveness, decrease the bottlenecks; Establishing integrated network, and exchange of information between the courts, prosecutors and prisons; capacity building; Customs reform Establish  an Integrated Customs Information System;  a network on border lines and connection to the border management system; Connect to the New Transitional Transport Centre; Financial sector reform ICT Support for the Procurement Office,  Audit Office,  Tax Office;  Financial Police; increase financial capacity. The goal is to strengthen the capacity of the state to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria of democracy and the rule of law. Reforms are focused on strengthening the institutional capacity of the state to fully implement the rule of law, on both national and regional levels. From the ICT aspect, the goal is to establish the technical infrastructure, networks and data infrastructure, in order increase effectiveness, the exchange of information, and the development of integrated functions between the relevant institutions, as well as regional cooperation in the fight against corruption, terrorism, drugs, asylum migration, etc. EP/NISP pillars: ICT infrastructure; eGovernment; 
LOCAL DEMOCRACY Decentralisation (2005-2007) Development of local democracy Local e-Governance; establishing PAP (19ICT centres), and citizen information centres (17CIC); establishing different forms of communication with the citizens; introducing basic services (tax, birth certificates); established 27 web sites of the communities;  UNDP: http://www.undp.org.mk/ictc/CIC: http://www.lgrponline.com/LSG: http://www.logincee.org/;  Increase the capacity to perform  new responsibilities Set of programmes/projects to be developed, in line with the detailed decentralisation plan that should be completed in March 2005: transfer of responsibilities in education, urban, cultural, social, environment and financial sectors. Network of LSG and cooperation Cooperation in the regional Network of Local Governments from SEE: http://www.nalas-see.org/The goal is the development of local democracy and balanced regional development; creating an environment for economic growth and poverty reduction.  From the ICT aspect, the goals are to: bridge the digital divide gap, enable internet access to local communities, improve ICT literacy, enable different forms of communication with the citizens; and introduce services. The design of balanced central/local infrastructure and the development of services with a consistent data infrastructure requires careful design in order to avoid the development of fragmentary IT systems and the duplication of services. Therefore, the design and implementation of replicable models should be considered.  The activities related to ongoing decentralisation reform and the transfer of responsibilities to the local communities, are critical challenges for the country. There is a need to focus projects on increasing the administrative capacity of the municipalities to perform the new functions. A gradual phased approach is needed, in order to achieve balanced regional developments. EP/NISP pillars:ICT infrastructure;  eGovernment; eCitizen; ENTERPRENEURSHIP AND EMPOLYMENT Economic growth, competitiveness, knowledge and skills, job creation and poverty reduction  Business portals Regional business portal (SEEbiz.net): http://www.seebiz.net.mkEuro Business Trade portal: http://www.eurobc.com.mkChamber of Commerce: http://www.mchamber.org.mkRegional Euro info correspondent centre: http://www.euroinfo.org.mkTourism Portal: http://www.exploringmacedonia.comJob seeking/offering portal: http://www.zvrm.gov.mkIndustry clusters Establishing industry clusters (IT, wine, tourism, lamb and cheese) to attract investments;  Cluster ICT companies; Digital Media Focus Claster; MCA: http://www.mca.org.mk/Competitiveness Projects to increase the competitiveness of SMEs and create jobs; training programme for SMEs; knowledge and skills development.

Job creation is a top priority for Macedonia's economic development activities.  ICT is a proven contributor to economic growth, enabling improved efficiency in business processes and increased access to markets, for example for SMEs. Using ICT potential for improving skills, innovative activities and different ways of communication will enable job creation. ICT cabling, telecommunication networks, broadband services, new technologies and new partnerships should be recognised as investments. The following policy areas should promote the adoption of ICT in the economy: (1) investments in knowledge and skills; (2) enhancements to the flexibility of the labour market and competitiveness; (3) fostering innovative activities; (4) improving the regulatory framework for e-business; and (5) promoting and investing in new forms of partnership (incubators, clusters, technological parks, transfer of technology centres etc.).

EP/NISP pillars: e-citizen; eHealth; eGovernment; ICT infrastructure; All these projects are in line with the European Partnership short and long term priorities (2003-2007), and national priorities. The synergy between these key areas and ICT projects is obvious.  Although  there is progress, the complexity of the issues and the national context call for careful incorporation of targeted ICT projects into the sector reform priorities, aligned with the broader national priorities.  The critical challenge is to integrate the ICT systems, taking into consideration the limited capacity of the country. The Government must consider and balance the limited national budget and institutional capacity for implementation against the national priorities and broader International Community priorities. Streamlined, long term International Community (IC) support is of utmost importance in order to pave the way for long term sustainable development, sector reforms and information society developments, reflected in the EU objectives. Key supporters of the IC assistance are: EC, EIB, EBRD, UNDP, USAID, WB, UNESCO, UNECE, GTZ, DFID, bilateral and multilateral assistance programmes and grants (Netherlands, Norway, Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Japan, China etc).  The NISP Action Plan will appropriately relate these priorities and ask the IC for support. 1.5 Active promotion of IS for development 
The government is the initiator and is responsible for establishing the environment for IS development and the e-government. Some of the important initiatives are:   In December 2003, a strategic partnership agreement has been signed between the Government and the Microsoft Corporation, aiming to: (1) regulate software licensing; (2) develop IT knowledge and stimulate the IT industry; (3); ensure enforcement of intellectual property law; and (4) increase the use of electronic media to serve the government’s needs.  This is part of the government strategies to build partnerships, in order to promote and attract investments for information society developments and economic growth.    In September 2004, the Government established the new Sector for Information Technology within the General Secretariat, with responsibility for implementation of the NISP Action Plan.   In October 2004, the Concept of e-government has been presented to the Government. 
e-Government: Conceptual framework The broad concept of the e-government includes many aspects of the society, and calls for partnership between the government, businesses and citizens. But, the e-government calls firstly for a fundamental transformation of the way the government works and people think. Therefore, the state administration has a key role in the implementation of e-government. The transformation of the administration towards the e-administration is intrinsic part of the public administration reform. Some of the benefits expected from the e-government concept and the IS developments are responsible and democratic government, greater confidence amongst citizens, and more efficient and transparent work of the administration, with services oriented towards users and businesses. The current situation within the government institutions is not suitable to introduce ICT solutions for e-administration and services. There are a number of issues: Fragmented ICT systems, lack of IT staff, not completed government network, low level of ICT literacy, paper/stamp oriented administration, resistance and administrative obstacles at all levels. Such a poor situation requires a deep, long term reform process of transformation of the administration towards e-administration. 
The critical challenges for e-government/e-administration are:  
  Consistent long term policy measures;    Planning, budgeting and monitoring capabilities;   Institutional capacity;   ICT capacity;    Linkages between the governmental institutions, both horizontal and vertical; and    The legal framework and procedures. These critical challenges are all components of the public administration reform agenda. It is clear that the transformation of the administration is not a simple, one-off project, but a long term process that requires the involvement and collaboration of all.  The complexity, synergies and other aspects of e-government, internally (the back-office) and externally (the front-office), call for the careful design of  essential target projects for public administration reform that should also address these challenges. There is a need for a phased approach and the gradual implementation of ICT projects,  in parallel with building the institutional, technical and managerial capacity and the transformation of the administration itself. 
e-Government – recent achievements Sector for Information Technology – General Secretariat The government recently established the new Sector for Information Technology, in line with the eSEE guidelines for NISPs and TOR for governmental structure to implement these policies.  Sector for Information Technology (SIT) is one of the 9 sectors in the General Secretariat of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia.  The Sector for Information Technology comprises of the following units:    Unit for Organisation, Planning and Development;    Unit for Information Structure and Exploitation and    Unit for Web Page Support and Multimedia.  SITs responsibilities are:    prepares, enforces and follows the e-Government guidelines; organisational, methodological and analytical affairs in the field of designing of the information system of the Government; provides expert opinions concerning the information technology procurement requirements; monitors the development of new information technologies and studies the requirements for introduction of new information services;    provides expert opinions and training in respect to planning and development of information systems, project management, monitoring, maintaining of the required quality of the prepared application solutions and standard tools; proposing standards in the field of information and communication technologies;   info-security of the information system; manages the information system technical base; prepares the joint bases and standards for Internet maintenance in the Government and the General Secretariat, and maintains the up-to-date communication of the General Secretariat with the citizens through the government portal. According to the Rulebook on Systematisation of Job Posts of the General Secretariat of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, 31 job positions are foreseen in the Sector for Communication Technology.  The Sector has two employees and the activities for its further staffing have commenced (with employment of new persons through public announcements and re-assignment of appropriate personnel from other state institutions). The Plan for its relevant upgrading is being prepared along with the ongoing equipping activities. WG –ICT: Working group (building capacity) A working group, ICT_WG consisting of ICT staff from all of the ministries has been established. It works within the Twinning project – Slovenian Government, focused on the national legislative process across the state institutions.  Supporting projects focused on different aspects of the public administration, are as follows: DFID PAR-UK Government; NORMAK-Norwegian Government; and UNDP. The aim is to ensure a common framework for the overall ICT situation within the state administration, problems, needs and possible solutions, prerequisites for the introduction of e-administration, ensuring collaboration between institutions and team building, and increasing the general ICT capacity across institutions. Specific objectives are as follows: ICT_WG Activities : (http://www.sei.gov.mk/twinningIncreasing the ICT capacity in the institutions (1) ICT equipment, critical needs; (2) Training of ICT staff, system administration (50 trainees); (3) Training of target user groups – legal departments, on basic ICT skills, and specific related to the legislative process (200 trainees); ICT support to the legislation process (1) Analysis of the legislative process, including the necessary legal changes; (2) establish single in/out point for information/document flow across the institutions; (3) Support the NPAL/ interfaces and the register; ICT departments; government network (1) Analysis of current ICT systems, critical problems and needs within the state administration; (2) organisational issues; (3) managerial issues; (4) position of ICT staff within;  (5) government network, problems, solutions; ICT standardised procedures (1) Technical guidelines and standardised procedures for maintenance of LANs; (2) Public procurement procedures, maintenance contracts and legal aspects; ICT project management (1) Matrix of current/ planned ICT projects, harmonise priorities with the EP; (2) ICT structured expenditure; (3) Incorporate the ICT plans into the budget plans; The outputs of the ICT_WG should serve for further analysis, legal changes, government decisions, and the design of new projects, in order to increase the administrative capacity and create an environment (the back-office) for the implementation of e-government/ e-administration services.  e-Government services  It is the responsibility of the government to play a pro-active role in developing e-government services and promoting IS developments. The government is pressed to present its work on-line, in an open, participatory and user/ citizen oriented manner.  The government has made initial steps in order to present its work on-line and introduce the provision of basic services on-line (the front-office):  Web presentation of government institutions Improved web sites of the ministries, offering basic information services, with initial advanced services, such as: downloading forms, applications, call centres; In progress Ministry of Finance http://www.finance.gov.mkForum; Audio; Photo; Survey; Forms Download;  In progress Call centers http://www.customs.gov.mkhttp://www.mvr.gov.mkCall centers of the Ministry of Interior, and the Customs; Video; Interactive Tariff; Download; Guidelines; Interactive MAKCIS In progress Job seeking http://www.zvrm.gov.mkPortal for job seeking of the State Employment Agency;  In progress Web presentation of SEI http://www.sei.gov.mkInteractive web site of the SEI; email, forum, quiz, interactive (NPAL) system to support the national program for approximation of legislation; Searchable donor assistance database (CDAD); In progress Web presentation of Parliament http://www.sobranie.mkThe parliament improved its web site, offering basic services, and audio recording from the sessions; Parliamentary questions; In progress Government portal (www.gov.mk) Establishing base for governmental portal (priorities);  Questions to the Government; Annual Government Programme; Government Session; Services, Jobs, Police/ application; Planned/ priority; design/ testing TAX system http://www.ujp.gov.mkTax information system;  Planned/ priority Public procurement Design of public procurement portal, to put all government tenders on line; Planned/ priority; Both parts of the e-government paradigm, the back-office and the front-office, are under pressure from internal and external factors: the citizen, businesses and the administration itself. Therefore, the widespread adoption of e-government services will set the pace for moving information society developments and e-government forward. In that respect, it is very important to select and prioritise e-government projects, in the national context and within the actual capacity for implementation. The expectations of emerging results and the goals of qualitative change should be very careful balanced. The e-government is a building block of the NISP and of the Action Plan. Strategies, policy measures, sequenced actions proposed in NISP, as well as priority projects, will be the cornerstone of e-government developments. 
2. What body is in charge of this policy, including its implementation? 
The government is obligated to create institutional structure and administrative capacity in order to implement the NISP Action Plan. Some of the critical challenges are as follows:   Strong Cabinet-level leadership, with long-term political commitment and explicit support reflected in decisions, actions and long-term financial support;  Collaboration, building support and shared understanding between different levels of officials, executives and administration, within and across governmental institutions;  Building planning, budgeting and monitoring capabilities; Building ICT projects management, including financial management;   Building capacity to manage, implement and maintain the e-government service, including organisational, technical and staffing issues;  Building of skills, knowledge within the administration, and building transfer of knowledge, between different levels, within and across governmental institutions; Currently, there are several public bodies that represent the institutional infrastructure and administrative capacity for planning, implementation and supporting the IS development:   The top Cabinet level officials, policy and decision makers;  The Committee  for Information Technology IT (CIT), a body, with responsibility to advise the Government on strategic transformation from the current position to the e-government, established in December 2002;   The recently established Sector for Information Technology( IT) within the General Secretariat of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, responsible for implementation of the NISP Action Plan, September 2004;  The Sector for Informatics Logistics, in the Ministry of Education of , responsible for maintenance of the government network, and implementation of ICT projects related to common functions;   The IT departments within the line ministries, responsible for planning and implementation of ICT projects;  The Ministry of Transport and Communications, and the Telecommunications Directorate, responsible for telecommunications infrastructure and market regulation;   Civil Servants’ CS’ Agency (ACS), as in-service training centre for civil servants’ capacity building;   State Statistical Office   Data Protection Directorate (PD), Bureau for Classified Information (CI), Public Procurement Office, State Auditing Bureau; Several other institutions and bodies are also involved in the development and implementation of the IS:   Several other ministries responsible for IS development, e.g. Ministry of Education, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of  Defence, etc;   Sector for European Integration, as key body for co-ordination and monitoring of the European Partnership Framework, responsible for strategic planning and directing of projects related to the EU process;    The universities play an important role (“Ss. Cyril and Methodius” University, “St. Kliment Ohridski” University, and South East European University (SEE University)).   Professional IT organisations, MASIT  NGOs  Media The clear institutional structures, responsible for coordination and implementation will be completed as one of the outcomes of the NISP and the Action Plan (June 2005).


3. What is the budget allocated to the policy and what are the implementation mechanisms? 
The budgetary policy and coordination of the budget on the state information systems is performed by the Government, the Ministry of finance and the state institutions. A new administrative body, the Sector for Information Technology, within the General Secretariat of the Government is in charge of activities on the operational side of the ICT policy. Administratively, those activities are financed with the budget of the General Secretariat of the Government. In additional for 2005, there is a separate budget line within the Budget of General secretariat of the Government, of 14 million MKD aimed towards supporting of the implementation of NISP and the Action Plan. Furthermore, the Sector for Informatics Logistic, in the Ministry of Education and Science, has a separate budget for maintaining the governmental network and the common functions of the ministries. 5 million MKD were allocated in the 2005 budget. Each of the ministries plans its own budget. ICT costs for development, implementation and the running expenses of ICT systems, are included into the budgetary items. It is very difficult to estimate the precise budget allocated for ICT in the national budget, due to the implicit nature and synergy effects of ICT usage, as well as the non-consistent planning framework and structured ICT expenditures. The budget allocated for development, implementation, and maintenance of ICT projects within the state institutions, is roughly estimated to be around 0.4% of the annual national budget, with declining tendency each year. Continuous budgetary restrictions led to inability for long-term planning and appropriate  maintenance of the current ICT systems, up to a critical level, with long-term consequences. For comparison, developing countries, allocate around (1-3%) from the annual budget. The  long-term reforms, that the country initiated in order to move forward with the European integration process, are associated with risks and costs, overloading the limited national budget. In that respect, the important challenge for the government is to increase the national ICT budget, in a short period.  The Republic of Macedonia is programming and streamlining the International Community financial support, taking into consideration these challenges. Therefore, integration of ICT projects within the sector reforms should ensure long-term International Community (IC) support for development, long-term focusing on ICT projects and sustainability of the information society developments. Furthermore, in order to promote and attract investments, the government builds strategic partnerships that should contribute to the economic growth and the information society developments.  Gradual implementation of ICT projects, associated with appropriate policy measures for IS development, and at the same time increasing of the institutional capacity to plan, manage and implement projects, should create space for gradual increasing of the national ICT budget. The incentive for further funding of ICT projects should be: successful implementation, taking into consideration the impact and benefits of ICT usage, reflected in overall progress of the reforms against the EU requirements, as well as IC and national broader objectives. In the NISP Action Plan, a coordinated action is planned for the promotion of the budget needs for its implementation. This is to be presented to the Prime Minister Cabinet and the Ministry of Finance. Budget policy for supporting NISP Action Plan and appropriate implementation mechanisms are intrinsic part of the process of building of needs. These needs-related activities are being considered in strong correlation with the national priorities and the European Partnership framework, as well as interventions made or planned from the donor community.

C. Research 

2. What is the specific public policy for promoting and supporting research on Information Society Technologies (ISTs)? If a strategy document exists, please provide a copy in an EU language. 
The extraordinary ICT potential for transformation of the society is the groundwork for R&TD to translate that potential into the valuable development component of the Information Society and ‘knowledge based society’ reflected in the EU objective.  During the process of formulation of the National Information Society Policies (NISP), ISTs have been identified as strategic factor for development.  In the part of eEducation, one of the NISP pillars, a special attention is being paid to the research and development in the IST sector.  The NISP and the correspondent Action Plan will be completed not later than June 2005. 
Educational reforms and ICTs: The Ministry of Education and Science (MES) prepared a Draft National Program for Education (2005-2105), a platform of reform programs within the overall education system. The ICT is an important building block of the reforms. On the basis of the Draft National Programme for Education, under the Title “Improvement of the competitiveness of the Macedonian society”, special Chapter is dedicated to the development of the Information Society with recommendations that “the ICT should become a part of all segments of the society”.   The following is foreseen with the other elements of the Programme:   ICT literacy of young generations;    Introducing custom oriented programs;    Computerization of educational institutions and their connectivity through information systems,    Supporting network establishment;    Supporting the initiatives for creating transparent and complete database of the educational system, services and transfer of cultural heritage through new media; and   Access to the international and national information systems and databases; R&TD (Outlines) (For more details on R&TD see chapter 17Macedonian researches have given priority to the following technological fields: ISTs, new materials, environment, biotechnology, high quality food production and earth sciences and engineering.  The institutional infrastructure for R&TD consists of: Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, universities, higher schools, public scientific institutes, R&D units within the industry, regional scientific associations, and consulting agencies and offices. The vast majority of R&TD is carried out in universities and public research institutes.  Transitional shocks, industry reconstruction and poor economic climate caused deep consequences to the R&TD institutions and research community, which resulted in decreased number of researches and decreased role of R&TD within the overall national context. In the course of the on-going reforms, special attention will be paid on modernisation and building of a new R&TD structure.  Yet, although seriously weakened, the R&TD community has good potential for technological development. The R&TD community is active participant in many projects, national, regional and international level. In last two years, 200 young researches have entered the universities and scientific institutions.  In the framework of the on-going educational reforms, the MES is making efforts for successful transformation of higher education aimed towards better transfer of knowledge within the scientific and business sector.   As a part of these efforts, the Ministry prepared several Programmes for R&TD support (2002-2006):   Programme for encouraging and supporting national R&TD projects;   Programme for granting fellowships for post-graduate and doctoral studies both in the country and abroad;   Programme for supporting researches for preparation at international meetings;   Target research programme for coordination of R&D activities within the governmental bodies;   Programme for encouraging and supporting technological development for the period 2002-2006;   Programme for development of R&TD infrastructure Summary of the recent achievements in ISTs in the educational reforms: The cornerstones of current activities related to ICTs, are the two essential building blocks for the Information Society in the educational system, the networks:  Building of schools’ network (computerization of all primary and secondary schools; Internet access, deploy broadband to remote areas; building the schools’ network);   Building the universities’ network (upgrading of the Macedonian Academy and Research Network (MARNet), and build connectivity towards the ERA,  In addition, a number of synergized projects are focused on the on-going reforms of the educational systems, building capacity, ICT training of teachers and pupils, introduction of modern learning tools, improving skills, and research activities, including ISTs.  The evident progress in building the network infrastructure of the educational institutions, in already initiated long-term reforms, encourages all efforts that the Republic Macedonia is making to build solid foundation for the educational system, including R&TD in ISTs. These efforts have been recognized, and strongly supported by the International Community relevant institutions, organizations and associations.  Macedonia supports these reforms, by allocations from the national budget, and by programming the sector targeted, long-term International Community financial support, taking into account the national priorities and budget limitations.  Schools network: All primary, secondary and VET schools are included in the activities for building of schools’ networks:    USAID “e-School project”, completed installation of Computer labs – a new concept of ICT usage, in 100 secondary schools (20PC/School); activities in 300 schools (10PC/school) are on-going. Two-year teacher training program has started in selected schools in August 2004;    The objective of USAID “Macedonia Connect” project is to establish a nationwide Internet broadband network, and provide broadband services for approximately 400 schools and selected university dormitories, until 2007. It is expected that the broadband network, as an add-in value, will result in commercial provision of competitive, affordable broadband services to other customers in underserved areas, including public and private sector institutions in remote areas.   A number of ICT related projects are focused on VET reforms, including provision of ICT: PHARE/VET1-VET3 delivered 229PC, training courses, teacher trainings; GTZ provided Modernisation of three-year training programs in 8 VET schools. The current progress is impulse for building ‘knowledge’ of young generations, encouraging further efforts, and support. The results are as follows: 57Pupils/PC for primary schools, and 24. 5Pupils/PC in secondary schools. Half of the secondary schools have internet access. The ICT teaching exam has been introduced from the V grade.  (For more details see 18_I_C_ 3Universities’ network: A number of projects are focused on building the Macedonian Academic and Research Network (MARNet). The goal is to upgrade the current internal capacity and connectivity, and step-by-step to acquire connectivity towards the research space of ERA.    The capacity of MARNet has been upgraded by few synergized projects: MARNet SKOMAN (NATO scientific program), SEEREN (FW5); the on-going SEEGRID (FW6);    There are few initiatives by the Greek Academic Networks (GRNET), one of the PoPs of GEANT.    Macedonia is also included in two multilateral projects within the FW6: (SEE-ERA NET), and (ERA-WEST-BALKAN) aimed to improve interregional research cooperation and integration into the SEE-ERA.Net  Macedonia is considering these initiatives and applied projects for FW6, and makes additional efforts to facilitate the building of MARNet connectivity. 
TEMPUS has been the key Programme for supporting higher education reforms in the country, since 1996.  A number of TEMPUS supported projects, are focused on the research in ISTs, in the following fields:    Curriculum Development in Information Sciences,    Computer science and software engineering;    Multimedia in Music’s; Information Technologies in Teacher Training;    Modernisation of University Services and Support to University Management;    Development of Virtual University;

More detailed elaboration of the ISTs research is presented in the answer of the next question. 
3. What are the main universities, research institutes or centres active in IST research? In which domains? 
IST research is concentrated in the following Universities: “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” University, “St. Kliment Ohridski” University , and South East European University (SEE University). 
 University “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” University in Skopje with 24 faculties, 10 scientific institutions and 6 associative members; Established 1949. 
 Faculty of Electrical Engineering (http://www.etf.edu.mk) 
 Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics - Institute of Informatics (http://www.ii.edu.mk) 
The Faculty of Electrical Engineering (FEE) employs around 50 professors and 53 teaching and research assistants, out of which 58 holders of PhD and 28 holders of MSc degrees. In addition, it has 10 technical assistants and laboratory technicians. IST research is active in two of its four departments: the Department of Electronics and Telecommunications and the Department of Computer Engineering, Computer Science and Automatics. 
On yearly bases, FEE participates in 20 wide research projects and its contribution to the scientific publishing society is about 200 research papers realized in many scientific magazines, technical journals, meetings and conventions.  Since its foundation, the Faculty promoted 3.358 BSc graduates, 88 MSc graduates and 30 PhD degree holders. Around 25% of these are in IST-related domains. To these numbers a part of academic and research activities of the Department of Electronics and Telecommunications should be added. 
Out of the current scientific projects funded by the Ministry of Education and Science, five are of IST-related domains:  Wireless local networks,   Design of mobile Internet networks for heterogeneous traffic,   Digital compression of video-sequences,   User interfaces for medical practice,   Web-based modelling and presentation of 3D archaeological objects. 
There are several ongoing international projects in the framework of different programmes for international cooperation. In the framework of the Tempus program, the institution is actually a coordinator of three Joint European Projects in the domains of:   Virtual Digital libraries and Digitalization   International Technology Transfer Model and   Wireless Campus for Student Services. There are numbers of international projects in which the institution took active participation and a comprehensive list of past projects can be found at http://www.etf.edu.mk/zavrseni_proekti.htm. Besides national and international funded research projects, the scientific research and application activities also include cooperation with companies and institutions, laboratory tests and measurements. The institution makes development plans, expertise, analysis, project revisions and grading and organizes professional and scientific meetings and conventions. Academic rules for awarding academic titles are determined by corresponding laws of the Ministry of Education and Science and contain legal tools determining the obligation of verifiable scientific research as a condition for obtaining academic titles. Thus, IST-related research is being realized in all main IST domains present at the contemporary Computer Engineering / Sciences University curricula. 
Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics - Institute of Informatics 
The research in the IST domain at the Institute of Informatics is mainly concentrated around domains that are subject of majoring specialties of the BSc undergraduate studies offered at the Institution: Educational Informatics, Applied Informatics, Software Engineering and Informatics and Industrial Mathematics. The institute offers MSc and PhD degrees in Computer Sciences. A program on Distance learning is in preparation, with already prepared software environment (“shkolka”) WEBCT and three web-oriented courses developed. The project was funded by PHARE and the National contact point for Distance learning was established in 2000 (http://odoserver.ukim.edu.mk), as well as two study centres - at the Faculty of Pedagogy – Bitola of the “St. Kliment Ohridski” University, and at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Skopje. The equipment was partly funded by the Ministry of Education and Science and from the funds of two Tempus projects. Online testing system was developed and is available at http://twins.pmf.ukim.edu.mk. Research is financed primarily through performance, management and coordination of international and domestic research projects. The average annual value of the research projects over last three years was over 0,5 million EUR. The main fund sources were PHARE program, TEMPUS, IST program, Swiss SNSF and the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Macedonia. There were also donations from the Ministry of Education of Greece, Taiwan, Macedonian Telecom, Ericsson, Open Society Institute of Macedonia and others. Most of the funds were allocated for equipment, mobility, specialization and staff training. Research in IST domain is done in two administrative units: Theoretical Informatics and Software Engineering. There are more than 15 PhD holders in Computer Sciences and related fields and more than 20 research assistants with MSc degrees or following MSc studies. There are two technical assistants for the computer laboratories. 
From the current scientific projects, funded by the Ministry of Education and Science and TEMPUS Programme, the following are of the IST related domains:   Application of algebraic structures in communication and other processes   Discrete correlated probability models and application in the theories of queuing, risks and insurance   Pattern recognition models using Neural Networks   Design and development of time series prediction algorithms   Contact point for Distance learning   Integrated library information systems   Distributing Information Technologies   Memory aspects of ILP   Development of educational software  Parallel processing Comprehensive list of past projects can be found at http://www.ii.pmf.ukim.edu.mk/LinkoviLevo/Istrazuvanja/proekti.htm. Within the framework of the institution, there are five research and applicative laboratories where the IST-related activities are concentrated:   Wireless Application Laboratory (sponsored by Ericsson)  Parallel Processing Laboratory   Parallel and Distributed Systems Laboratory   Laboratory for Virtual Digital Libraries   National Contact Point for Distant Education http://www.ii.pmf.ukim.edu.mk/LinkoviLevo/Istrazuvanja/laboratorii.htm. Academic rules for awarding academic titles are determined by corresponding laws of the Ministry of Education and Science and contain legal tools determining the obligation of verifiable scientific research as a condition for obtaining academic titles. Thus, IST-related research is being realized in a wide range of the main IST domains present at the contemporary Computer Sciences University curricula. In addition, at this institution, research areas also cover mathematical and theoretical aspects of IST. 
 “St. Kliment Ohridski” University in Bitola with 5 Faculties, one Advanced school and 3 Institutes. Established 1979. 
 Faculty of Technical Sciences - Department for Mathematics and Computer Sciences (http://www.uklo.edu.mk) 
The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science employs six professors, PhD holders, and four teaching and research assistants - MSc holders or follows MSc studies. The institution and its researchers are participating in many national and international research projects. The academic staff participates in international scientific conferences and publishes papers in international scientific journals. There are actually two joint European projects funded by the Tempus program under the partner - country coordination realised by the Department, one of which is from the ISP domain on the subject of development of the University Information System. Thus, IST-related research is being realized in a range of the main IST domains present at the contemporary Computer Sciences University curricula which, in this case, is 6 semester studies in Technical Informatics.  
 SEE University in Tetovo with 5 faculties and two academic units; Established 2001. 
 Faculty of Communication Sciences and Technologies (CST) (http://www.seeu.edu.mk)  The CST Faculty benefits from the new and Europe-oriented organisational structure teaching, administration and research and has attracted a corresponding interest in the academic environment in the country and the region. The institution takes advantage of the second biggest ICT installation in the country and a campus organized in a rich IST environment. The research fields and results are generally brought by the number of experienced professors teaching at the institution on  part-time basis and by many partnerships that the institutions built with relevant institutions in European and USA universities. The SEE University is in a process of institutionalising its research and publishing activities and several phases of this process have already obtained relevant affirmative independent reviews. The CST Faculty is already an active member, as a partner institution, in several Tempus implementation projects and for the first time is proposing coordination of one of them. The IST research actually consists of individual membership of the academic staff in Communication Sciences, Technologies and Computer Sciences related national and international projects. Certain clusters of scientific expertise are being detected and the research and applicative activities are planned to converge around the following fields in the future:   Digital Media in Communications   Digitalisation of Cultural Heritage   Artificial Intelligence and Neuro-computing   Network Security and Wireless technologies   Data Bases and Knowledge management   Natural languages processing  Computational Intelligence 
Numbers of IST-related activities are ongoing around the Macedonian Academic and Research Network (MARNet) within which, currently, 4 major projects are ongoing. The “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” University, computer network (UCN) in Skopje was established in 1993. With foundation of the MARNet and with the Internet connection at the University there is a growing need for upgrade and extension of the network capacities, which was done on several occasions in the previous period. The older DIGITAL direction equipment was replaced with modern CISCO equipment, and DECnet directed protocols were replaced with modern ones, based on TCP/IP equipage of protocols. The Internet connection is 1Mbps and the intra-communication is very good. Some faculties have re-built their web sites and have started with some courses based on e-education. Under the UNESCO, the project should improve scientific cooperation between SEE countries and propose a general reconstruction of the network, reaching a speed of 622 Mbps – 2 GB. 
 SEEREN project  (http://www.seeren.org). The objective of this project is establishment of international connection of academic and research networks in the countries from the region of Southeast Europe (Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, Albania, Bulgaria and Bosnia and Herzegovina) to the pan-European academic and research network – GEANT, thus creating conditions for their future full-pledged accession in GEANT. This project is carried out under auspices of the academic network of Greece – GRNET, one of the points of presence of GEANT. The set speeds of the links are going from 2 - 34Mbps, and the duration of the project is one year. In regard to Macedonia, an international link with Athens with a capacity of 4MBps was established. By the activation of this link, the capacity of international connection on MARNet increased 5 times, which represents significant improvement of the performances of now congested network. During this project the academic networks – users and participants in the project – should consider all the possibilities, i.e. they should provide sustainability of the connection after termination of the financing of the project within the frameworks of the planned budgets of responsible institutions in the countries. 
 MARNet SKOMAN (Skopje Metropolitan Area Network) project of the NATO scientific program. As the title itself suggests, this is a project for construction of communication-information data network in the area of the city of Skopje, and it should be used for improvement of the connection inside the University network. It is well known fact that neither the quality nor the accessibility of the current links within the frameworks of “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” University, meets the current needs, and besides, there is a great number of unconnected members. The realization of this project should give an answer and solution to this problems through:  Construction of wireless radio network on the University Purchase and installation of active network equipment -  The grant by the Austrian government for construction of optical infrastructure on UKM and MARNet in the city of Skopje the TEMPUS Project for modernization of the public administration at the University  
The  Institute for Earthquake Engineering and Engineering Seismology (IEEES) – Skopje (http://www.iziis.ukim.edu.mk), carries out a large number of applied and development research projects and provides consulting services for design and analysis of more sophisticated civil engineering structures. The highly-qualified personnel and the equipment of the IEEES Laboratories, the computer centers and the developed aplicative software are a guarantee of its successful performance.  In addition, a permanent and intensive international co-operation has been developed and maintained. Such international co-operation with universities, scientific institutions and centres worldwide is a prerequisite for more efficient and more complex scientific research within the Institute. A best illustration for regional cooperation is the recently completed Tempus supported project for postgraduate studies in Earthquake engineering involving students from Albania, Croatia and Macedonia. Synergy with DAAD financed postgraduate studies project was achieved bringing together students from the three above mentioned countries, as well as students from Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina and from Serbia and Montenegro. 
In September 2002, an e-Business Department (http://www.ebusiness.edu.mk), was started on the Faculty of Economics within “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” University, to prepare students for career in international business, giving emphasis on disciplines in which Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays crucial role, such as: Internet Marketing, Web Presence and Management of e-business. It is expected that this institution will become more important partner in projects from IST-related fields in the country. 
Educational centres for the Xpert program of the German Academic Union are organized in 7 different locations in the respective branches of so called Workers’ Universities. About 250 trainees from republic of Macedonian passed the Xpert courses, starting from October 2002 year through the branch office of the Institute for International Cooperation of the German Adult Education Association. 
The fact that on the web-site of the National and University Library “St. Kliment Ohridski” in Skopje, (http://www.nubsk.edu.mk) there is a possibility for on-line search through a system for search of mutual database COBIB.MK, or of databases available through COBISS/OPAC, represent an important link in IST research activities nationwide. Professional IT and IST programs on different levels are also held by the above-mentioned Universities and by a number of private companies and authorized training centres, such as: Microsoft authorized training centre, Autodesk authorized training centres, Cisco Academy etc. 
Some international donor institutions based in the country have a significant contribution in improvement of computer literacy in the country. UNDP through 19 ICT Centres established in 19 different municipalities in the country (5 of them in rural municipalities) has trained about 17.000 trainees of basic and advances computer courses. Beneficiaries are the municipality's administration, youth, unemployed and students. Besides the role of the IT education, these 19 ICT Centres play a role of free Internet Access point in their communities. 
D. Public sector 
1. What are the public services offered currently on-line to citizens and businesses? 
The concept of e-Government is in its initial phase both in the aspect of services to citizens and to businesses. An in-deep research has been done in the area through an UNDP financed project on e-Government (http://www.undp.org.mk/e-governance), and the results, are an excellent basis for the future steps to be defined and implemented by the realisation of the National Information Society Policy (NISP) which is foreseen to be completed in June, 2005. Preconditions in terms of actual ICT usage status in governmental institutions on central and local level are being established in the above mentioned project. The recent Law on Decentralization of the government services has deep implications on the organisational and back-office structure of the services to be provided.  However, many initiatives have already resulted in Web presence of a part of the government services through 153 governmental domain names (gov.mk).  The government and the ministries are offering with different level of interoperability and interactivity set of information, application templates, information on laws and procedures on the correspondent sites of the ministries and government agencies.  The public services offered on-line to citizens and business can be classified as being provided by:  (i) Central Government (http://www.gov.mk), the Ministries, the Parliament 
http://www.sobranie.mk)   (ii) Governmental agencies (Information, Employment, Supervision of Fully Funded Pension Insurance, Agricultural Development, Emigration, Civil Servants,  (iii) Other governmental institutions (Commissions, Directorates, Archives, Offices, National bank, State Statistics Office, Projects etc.) and (iv) Municipalities - Out of 124 municipalities, 27 are presented with their own Web site/page offering variety of information and services. For this category of public services, in-deep research has been done in order to determine the capacities and equipment available for developing on-line offer. Several international agencies have completed the correspondent research and built the municipalities web sites / presentation through pilot-project activities. According to the recent Law on Decentralization the services to be offered on local government level are to be revised and correspondent changes in the Web presentations are to be expected.  
The services offered can be classified in the following categories (Table 1.):

The level of offered on-line interactivity and on-line availability of the public services is different for various governmental institutions - there are segments of public services that are offered with a high level of on-line availability. Tables 3.1 through 3.4 present some examples and services offered by category of governmental institutions.

On a local level the initiatives of the local municipalities and the variety of financing sources for realisation of the web-oriented services result into variety of service solutions and levels of interactivity. The recent Law on Decentralization and the correspondent redefinition of the services to be offered by the local municipalities will have significant influence to the number and quality of the services to be offered on-line. Actually, out of 124 local municipalities 27 are presented through own web site or page.

2. What are the penetration/usage rates of these services? 
It is difficult to give a reliable penetration / usage rate of these services - a methodology for scanning the actual penetration / usage rate has just been adopted by the State Statistical Office.  In particular sectors (such as the Customs Authority, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economy, Chamber of Commerce and State Universities) the penetration / usage rate is very high and according to some research results is approaching 40% on the average. On the country level, according to some research methodologies, the penetration / usage rate is as low as 4%. This data is to be taken into consideration with high reserves due to the disproportion of the service usages by sectors and by population groups.  In the IT cluster of companies the penetration / usage of the services provided by the companies is much higher that the country average.  In the private sector, in the biggest private high educational institution (SEE University http://www.seeu.edu.mk) the penetration / usage rate of ICT services is higher than 80% in respect to 5000 students and more than 200 staff.  In order to relate more reliable data with eEurope benchmarking indicators, the Committee for Information Technology (CIT) initiated statistical review to be conducted by the State Statistical Office. The survey is on ICT presence and use, according to EUROSTAT methodology. It consists of four questionnaires: (i) for companies; (ii) for companies from the finance sector; (iii) for households and (iv) for the government and governmental organisations, public sector and agencies.  Data will be collected on: hardware equipment, networking, Intranet, web usage presentation and connectivity, operating systems, databases, software, searching engines used, human resources related to ICT, trainings and investments in ICT.  The survey is to be realised in the period January - March 2005, as a part of NISP  
E. Private sector 
1. What is the rate of companies conducting e-business, per size and sector if possible? Which applications? 
The requests by the citizens for e-business and e-commerce solutions are low, due to the small penetration of the Internet among the citizens in Macedonia.  Leaders in offering and practicing e-business solutions are the companies of the IT sector in Macedonia. This sector recorded annual growth of 11,44% (data for 2002/2003). Statistics and research in this sector are  provided mainly from the Ministry of Economy, Economic Chamber of Macedonia, State Statistical Office, Macedonian Association for Information Technology (MASIT) http://www.masit.org.mk, UNDP and GTZ-PSP (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit GmbH - Private Sector Promotion) http://www.gtzpsp.com.mkSecond ranged sector in the category of sectors performing e-business is the financial and banking sector. Some banks providing Internet electronic keys for their clients facilitate online review of the state of their accounts, such as: Stopanska banka (http://www.stb.com.mk), Komercijalna banka http://www.kb.com.mk/), as well as the possibility offered by Tutunska banka http://www.tb.com.mk/) for conducting on-line transactions in the domestic and foreign payment operations through Internet. There are also information about the transactions, credits, deposits, foreign currency market, services and analyses. Downloadable forms are offered on all banking sites. Access to the account information and domestic transactions has been recently opened to customers.   IT baseline Statistic Survey for 2002 and 2003, CDS - Center for Business Co-operation, July 2004 According to the National domain name registry office (MARNet - Macedonian Academic and Research Network) the registered domain names in Macedonia are given in Table 1.

C2C Client to Client 
Still, at the moment B2B segment is at a very low level and is only available as a provision of a price list, information and prospects for business partners and associates. In regard to this, there are several business portals, such as Macedonian Business Portal http://www.seebiz.net.mk, the portal of Trade Point (http://www.eurobc.com.mk), the ICT Trado Portal (http://www.trado.org), and the portal of the Economic Chamber of Macedonia (http://www.mchamber.org.mk),  which offer information and tools for improvement of the way one business is led, as well as contacts and promotion of the companies locally and internationally through the efficient use of advanced information technology and trade-related services.Some of the companies, as it is the case for JSC Macedonian Telecommunications http://www.mt.com.mk), several companies from the IT sector and other companies, are offering complete portals with content that includes: Web portal, on-line shopping (www.ekupisi.com), search and documentation retrieval tools, interactive catalogues and subscription model offers, user registration, SMS and WAP service, m-commerce and similar.  A Comprehensive survey on the companies’ competitiveness in terms of available resources and ability to do business in foreign markets is given in the recent study on Competitiveness of Western Balkan Companies (Brussels, 2004) supported by the Economic Chamber of Macedonia. Extracts of the several parameters from the study are given in Table 3.  
Table 3. Extracts from the survey on equipment and e.mail accessibility for the registered companies Parameters for Macedonian companies Percentage of companies Companies having one PC for each office employee 15% Companies having e-mail address for each employee  9% Companies having e-mail address for key employees  40% 
There are several new initial stages in regard to the usage and application of M-commerce solutions mainly in the purchase of Internet subscription time, and there are no indications whatsoever for the usage of the mobile phones for "Small Payment". Specialized search engine for Macedonian sites (http://www.najdi.com) has been introduced as a private initiative in search engines for documents from Macedonian sites.  In regard to the computer usage in the companies, 88,2% of the asked companies are using computers for the finances, while 82,4% of them are using computers also as a tool in some phase of the production process. 66% of the asked companies are using professional consultative services of other organisations in regard to the usage of the computers, e-mail and Internet.
2. Are there any incentives offered to companies using ICTs? What kind of incentives? 
While there are still no elements for speaking about incentives offered to the companies using ICT, there are remarkable activities of the companies and business association of companies from the ICT sector (http://www.masit.org.mk) and activities undertaken from the Macedonian Chamber of Commerce (http://www.mchamber.org.mk) in promoting training and implementation of ICT standards in the business activities in Macedonian companies. It is expected that after the adoption of the National IST development strategy and the realisation of the several projects undertaken on behalf of the Macedonian Chamber of Commerce, a set of incentives to companies using ICT will be initiated and put into function.  The Chamber of Commerce proposed a project (April 2003) on e-Business in Macedonian businesses introducing EANCOM standard and XML format usage recommendations. After adoption of the Law on Electronic Signature, a set of practical recommendations and guides will be prepared by the Chamber of Commerce introducing the usage and archiving of digitally signed documents. A workgroup is being proposed to work on standardization of the financial transactions.  In the framework of the Chamber of Commerce an Infocenter for e-commerce is created, which is assisting the companies through seminars, training and consulting services.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A report by a group of Western intelligence services says former Bosnian Serb President Mirko Sarovic, the current chairman of the central tripartite presidency, was politically responsible for illegal sales of military hardware to Iraq. "Sarovic bears significant responsibility for Republika Srpska's (RS) defence industry violations of UN Security Council resolutions against Iraq," the report says. The paper was presented to the Peace Implementation Council for BiH in Brussels on Friday (28 March). The intelligence analysts said several senior military officials were fired to protect the political leaders who must have authorised the sale of spare parts by the Bosnian-Serb state-run firm Orao. The report also accuses current Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic of knowing about the illegal sales but doing nothing to prevent them while he was prime minister of RS. Both Sarovic and Ivanic have denied any responsibility, stressing they were not aware of Orao's dealings. According to sources in the Office of the High Representative, Sarovic would be removed from his post if he does not resign by Wednesday.

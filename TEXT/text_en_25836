PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The head of the International Civilian Office, Peter Feith, reiterated on Wednesday (February 17th) that Belgrade-backed parallel structures in northern Kosovo must be dissolved. Feith is determined to make progress in the north, via a strategy that he and Kosovo institutions have worked out. "It is not a document on which the EU has agreed, but I think it is fair to say that I have explained the contents ... and I found out there is a positive interest in the development of further steps in the EU to move forward in the north, parallel to the approach which we have drafted with the government," he told Radio Free Europe. Serbia has harshly criticised the strategy. (Kohavision, Telegrafi, KLAN Kosova, RTK - 17/02/10)

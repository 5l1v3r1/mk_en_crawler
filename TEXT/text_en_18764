SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH commission for citizenship revision is asking parliament to extend its mandate, which is set to expire next month, according to commission head Vjekoslav Vukovic. He said that during seven months of work, the panel reviewed around 900 suspected cases of citizenship illegally granted to foreigners between 1992 and 2006, stripping citizenship from 330 individuals. Another 500 cases must still be investigated, he said.
In other news, outgoing BiH Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic hailed on Monday the reforms implemented in the BiH armed forces over the past three years. He said the military is nearly free of political influence. Restructuring will result in some 2,000 layoffs this year. (Dnevni avaz - 09/01/07; PBS BiH, RTRS - 08/01/07)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The new Kosovo Security Force (KSF) will be part of NATO in the near future, says its commander, General Sylejman Selimi. Speaking on Thursday (January 22nd), he added that the KSF serves all citizens and is ready to co-operate with all neighbouring countries. The KSF began operation on Tuesday, minutes after the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC) disbanded as scheduled. 
About 100 former KPC officers rejected by the KSF protested in front of the government building Thursday. They insist that the testing and selection processes were fraudulent and warned of more radical protests if the government fails to come up with a solution. Later that evening, an explosion rocked the KSF barracks in Peja. It caused heavy damage but no injuries. (Deutsche Welle, Telegrafi, Kohavision, TV 21 - 22/01/09)

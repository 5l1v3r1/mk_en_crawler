ATHENS, Greece -- Greece might accept the name "Northern Macedonia" as a solution to the long-standing name dispute with Skopje, Alternate Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas said Monday (April 5th). If Macedonian authorities reject the name, they should explain to their people why they are depriving them of European perspective, Droutsas said. Greece is willing to find a solution to the name conflict, but Skopje needs to demonstrate political will, he added. (MIA, Sitel, Makfax, Tanjug, B92, Beta - 05/04/10)

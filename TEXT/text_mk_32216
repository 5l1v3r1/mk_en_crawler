WASHINGTON, United States -- The US administration will not impose sanctions against Croatia for insufficient co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, according to David Scheffer, former US Ambassador at Large on War Crimes Issues. In an interview Monday (7 October) with Voice of America, Scheffer said that Washington would seek a diplomatic solution to the case involving indictments against retired Croatian Gen Janko Bobetko. He noted that chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte may not appreciate the US position, as she expects the larger UN members to pressure Croatia.

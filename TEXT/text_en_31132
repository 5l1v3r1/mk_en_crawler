ANKARA, Turkey -- Thousands of people -- journalists, members of trade unions, representatives of opposition political parties and NGOs -- gathered on Friday (March 4th) in Ankara and Istanbul to protest recent detentions of journalists. Ten people, most of them journalists, were detained on Thursday as part of the so-called Ergenekon investigation, into a suspected plot to topple the government. Among those detained are Ahmet Sik and Nedim Sener, known for their critical reporting on the justice system and police. On Sunday, a court in Istanbul remanded the two into custody. EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele voiced concern Thursday over police actions against journalists in Turkey, stressing that freedom of expression is a fundamental principle in democratic societies.

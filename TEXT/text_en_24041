PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Vetevendosje (Self-Determination) movement requested on Sunday (March 15th) the arrest of all Serb officials in Kosovo who are part of parallel structures operated by Belgrade. Vetevendosje suggested pressing charges against those Serb officials whom it accuses of inciting violence and breaching Kosovo laws. The movement also mentioned names of Serb officials and municipal mayors who received their appointments after the Serb elections in Kosovo last May and whom the Kosovo government and UNMIK declared illegal. According to Vetevendosje, Serb officials in Kosovo, who receive assistance from Belgrade, earn 50% higher salaries than officials in the Serbian government.
In other news Sunday, the Humanitarian Law Centre (HLC) for Kosovo criticised the decision by EULEX judges to release ethnic Albanian Florim Ejupi as hurried. Ejupi received the maximum 40-year prison sentence in connection with an attack on a bus in February 2001 near Podujevo, which killed ten Serbs and injured 11 others. He received his acquittal from EULEX judges last week after spending five years in custody. According to the HLC, the EULEX decision "is incomprehensible from a judicial point of view".

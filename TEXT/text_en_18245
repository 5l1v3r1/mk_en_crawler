SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling said on Thursday (June 14th) that the leaders of the main political parties have agreed to continue talks on constitutional reform. They met with Schwarz-Schilling about the issue last week. "This process must be set on track now, so that results can be delivered within this legislative period," Schwarz-Schilling said. His own mandate ends later this month. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 15/06/07; Fena, RTRS, NTV Hayat - 14/06/07)

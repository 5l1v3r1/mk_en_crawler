ATHENS, Greece -- Over 1,000 public contract workers rallied outside of parliament and the Supreme Court in Athens on Thursday (September 23rd) against austerity measures the government has launched in response to the financial crisis. Participants in the peaceful protest demanded permanent contracts and full employment benefits. Public contract workers are taking their case to the Supreme Court, with a hearing scheduled for January 20th. Thursday's rally was held amid ongoing protests by truck owners and workers at the state railway company against labour reforms. (Kathimerini - 24/09/10; AP - 23/09/10)

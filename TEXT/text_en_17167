ANKARA, Turkey -- President Ahmet Necdet Sezer has vetoed portions of the new social security reform law, which was finally endorsed by parliament on 13 April, after months of delay. According to an announcement from Sezer's office on Friday (28 April), the president disagrees with some procedural provisions, related to appointing board members of the newly established Social Security Institution. Sezer maintains members should be appointed with the approval of the president, while the current text grants full authority and responsibility to the cabinet. (Turks.US - 29/04/06)

STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament adopted a resolution Thursday (January 18th) in support of the five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor sentenced to death in Libya for allegedly infecting children with HIV. The document urges Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi to order the immediate release of the medics, given scientific evidence introduced at their trials and the use of torture in extracting their "confessions". 
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi visited Sofia on Wednesday and said he is working to win the medics' release. He plans to meet with Qadhafi later this month. (Sega, Monitor- 18/01/07; Bulgarian Government website, BNR - 17/01/07)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary General George Robertson is visiting Albania and Macedonia on Friday (29 November) in a bid to boost their efforts to join the alliance. In Skopje, he will meet with President Boris Trajkovski and Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski, among others, and is expected to reiterate NATO's "open door" policy following last week's Prague enlargement summit. Media in Skopje report that Robertson's visit is also aimed at clarifying details of the mission that is to replace Amber Fox when its mandate expires on 15 December.

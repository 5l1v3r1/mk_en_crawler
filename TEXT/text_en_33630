BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Visiting Belgrade Thursday (11 September), EU External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten said the European Commission (EC) would prepare, by late March, the feasibility study on Serbia-Montenegro's chances of entering the Union. Fully harmonising economic legislation between Montenegro and Serbia is the last condition that must be met before work on the study can begin, Patten said. After meeting with government officials, Patten said that the EU has met all its promises to the country, adding that the EC is considering increased financial assistance. As for an upcoming donor's conference, Patten said he favours investment over donations. (B92, Tanjug, BBC, Beta - 11/09/03)

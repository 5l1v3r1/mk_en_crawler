ZADAR, Croatia -- The OSCE Mission to Croatia opened its new office in Zadar on Thursday (9 December). The head of the mission, Ambassador Peter Semneby, described Croatia's progress in reforms over past few years as very significant. He added that changes in the mission's structure prove that Croatia has made important steps in solving problems related to the OSCE mandate, including judicial reforms, refugee returns, and the electoral process. As part of the overhaul, OSCE envisions a smaller number of regional offices. They will be located in Split, Zadar, Vukovar, Osijek, Sisak and Gospic. (HINA, HRT - 09/12/04)

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal decided Tuesday (30 September) to reduce the number of hearings per week in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic after it received a new medical report, showing that the defendant's health is deteriorating. The court had been holding four or five morning sessions per week until now. The judges decided to reduce the number of sessions to three per week. Prosecutors also renewed their request for a lawyer to be appointed to defend Milosevic in his absence.

Other more serious charges against Miroslav Deronjic, 49, were dropped and prosecutors recommended a 10-year sentence. He is accused of ordering an attack on the Muslim village of Glogova in May 1992 which killed 60 civilians. (AP, AFP - 30/09/03)

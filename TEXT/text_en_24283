SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) â The Party of Democratic Action (SDA) decided on Thursday (December 11th) to initiate talks with the other main Bosniak party, the Party for BiH (SBiH), in an attempt to resolve outstanding issues. Relations between the two parties have been tense this year, with clashes over energy issues, telecom sector privatisation and other reforms. At a party board meeting Thursday, the SDA also repeated its calls for a federation-level cabinet reshuffle â a move rejected so far by the SBiH. It praised a proposal by Prime Minister Nedzad Brankovic, an SBiH member, to trim the number of ministries. 
In other news, former Serb Democratic Party (SDS) leader Dragan Cavic has announced he is forming a new party. He said it would have the same political profile as the right-wing SDS, currently the main opposition party in Republika Srpska. (Nezavisne Novine, Fena, Press Online, Blic, Glas Srpske -- 11/12/08)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government announced on Monday (October 2nd) that it would decide on a nominee for Bulgaria's EU Commissioner after the October 22 presidential elections. Local media reports suggest that the ruling coalition is willing to wait to see whether incumbent Georgi Parvanov wins a second term before starting negotiations on a commissioner, who would go to work in early January.

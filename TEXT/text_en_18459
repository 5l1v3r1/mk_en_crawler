THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal's appeals chamber decided on Wednesday (July 11th) that the wartime leader of a Bosnian Serb militia must be prosecuted at The Hague rather than in Sarajevo. The ruling reverses an earlier decision by the tribunal to transfer Milan Lukic's case to the war crimes court in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As leader of a paramilitary group known as the "Avengers" or "White Eagles", Lukic is charged with the murder of more than 100 Muslims in the Visegrad area. The appeals chamber said he should be tried by the UN tribunal because of the gravity of the crimes with which he is charged. (Reuters, Tanjug - 11/07/07)

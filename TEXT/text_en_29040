NEW YORK, United Nations -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Saturday (August 7th) named representatives of Turkey and Israel to the UN panel that will probe the raid against a Turkish-led aid flotilla to Gaza that left nine people dead on May 31st. Joseph Ciechanover will be the panel member from Israel, while Turkey's representative will be Ozdem Sanberk. Both men have "distinguished records of public service", Ban said. 
Ciechanover served as director-general at the Israeli Foreign Ministry, while Sanberk is a diplomat who has held senior positions in the Turkish Foreign Ministry and the UN. The panel will be chaired by former New Zealand Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer, with outgoing President of Colombia Alvaro Uribe serving as vice-chairman. The commission is set to start work next week and will deliver its first report in mid-September. (AFP, AP, Reuters, DPA, Jerusalem Post, Istael News - 07/08/10)

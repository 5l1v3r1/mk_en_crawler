ANKARA, Turkey -- The government has dismissed the head of the Istanbul police's intelligence department, Ahmet Ilhan Guler, over the assassination last month of prominent Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink. The Istanbul Governor's office issued a statement Tuesday (February 6th) saying Guler was fired for the sake of the investigation. But according to local media reports, he was sacked for failing to act after being tipped about an assassination plot against Dink a year ago. The dismissal took place amid strong media criticism of the authorities. "Only Hrant Dink did not know he was going to be murdered," the daily Radikal claimed in a report.

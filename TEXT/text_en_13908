VIENNA, Austria -- The second round of Kosovo status talks between delegations from Belgrade and Pristina ended in Vienna on Friday (17 March). According to deputy UN envoy Albert Roan, the meeting focused on issues related to decentralisation and financing of municipalities. The Serb negotiators argued for financing Serb municipalities from the Serbian state budget, while the Kosovo Albanian side said the funding should come from the Kosovo budget. Although the sides were unable to reach agreement, all participants described the talks as constructive. The next round is scheduled for 3 April.

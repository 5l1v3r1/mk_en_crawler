THESSALONIKI, Greece -- Authorities have deployed 15,000 police, soldiers and coast guard officers to guard the EU Summit in the northern resort of Neos Marmaras. Patriot batteries and troops carrying Stinger missiles have been deployed around Thessaloniki to protect EU leaders while they helicopter from the city's airport to the summit venue. Dozens of coast guard boats manned by 1,000 sailors are patrolling the coast, while hundreds of soldiers are reportedly checking nearby woods. Athens views this as a major test of security arrangements it will use during the 2004 Summer Olympics.
In advance of the summit, foreign affairs committee chairmen from Macedonia, Albania and Croatia met on Wednesday in Skopje to co-ordinate their stances on European integration. They sent a joint letter to summit participants, requesting a clear political message on the European future of the three countries. (AFP, MIA - 18/06/03)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prominent writer and Nobel Prize winner Orhan Pamuk said in an interview with the German weekly Der Spiegel on Sunday (June 1st) that football in his homeland stokes nationalism. "Football in Turkey has turned into a machine for the dissemination of nationalism and xenophobia and the formation of an authoritarian way of thinking," Pamuk said. As evidence, he cited a qualifier for the 2006 World Cup between Turkey and Switzerland that ended in a massive brawl in Istanbul. "That was unethical and unacceptable, especially how the Turkish newspapers reported it. Failure is blamed on the referees and some sort of conspiracies. Terrible," Pamuk said. 
As punishment for the incidents, FIFA instructed the Turkish Football Federation to hold six domestic matches without fans. The federation incurred a heavy fine, as did many individual players. In the interview, Pamuk described the coach of the Turkish national football team, Fatih Terim, as an "ultra-nationalist". Nevertheless, Pamuk said he would support his team in the 2008 European championships, which start on Saturday. (RIA Novosti, DPA - 02/06/08)

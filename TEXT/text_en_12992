THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The appeals chamber of the UN war crimes tribunal on Monday (28 February) upheld the sentences of four former Bosnian Serb prison guards. Miroslav Kvocka, Mladjo Rdaic, Zoran Zigic and Dragoljub Prcac were the first people to be convicted by the tribunal in 2001. They received prison sentences ranging from five years to 25 years. The five appeals judges acquitted two of the convicts of several murder and sexual assault charges but confirmed the sentences of all four men. Kvocka and Prcac will be released because they have served their time. (AP - 28/02/05)

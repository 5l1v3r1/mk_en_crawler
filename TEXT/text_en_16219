TIRANA, Albania -- A ceremony commemorating the victims of the 16 July helicopter crash in the Adriatic Sea was held at the Palace of Congresses in Tirana on Friday (11 August). The ceremony was a symbolic one, as the bodies of the victims -- former Albanian Deputy Prime Minister Gramoz Pashko and five others -- could not be retrieved despite several weeks of intense searches. Hundreds of government and political officials and citizens paid their last respects to the victims. (Albanian News - 12/08/06)

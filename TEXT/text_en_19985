TIRANA, Albania -- The OSCE representative in Albania, Robert Bosch, welcomed on Tuesday (December 18th) the extension of the mandate of the parliamentary commission on electoral reforms. The ruling Democratic Party (DP) and the opposition Socialist Party (SP) agreed on the extension Monday. Bosch, however, urged the political parties to co-ordinate their actions to achieve electoral reform as soon as possible, as it is a key condition for NATO and EU accession.

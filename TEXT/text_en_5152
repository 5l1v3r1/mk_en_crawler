Ndue Paluca, 48, started making filigree pieces when he was ten years old, in a small family shop. Since then, he has handcrafted countless millimetres of silver into necklaces, rings, houses, bridges and small globes. 
 Filigree consists of twisted threads, usually of gold and silver, to make jewellery and crafts. 
 "Filigree is art. It means a lot to me. It is like sculpture or painting, but more complicated," said Paluca. 
"There is a market for filigree, though almost 80% of the customers are foreigners," he said. According to Paluca, Kosovo should export the country's arts and crafts with a government stimulus that would abolish export taxes. 
Paluca has had his work displayed at the Pristina Handicraft Fair, sponsored by the Kosovo Ministry of Culture as part of Kosovo Cultural Heritage Week. Vases, ships, jewellery, tobacco boxes and other unique filigree objects were on display. 
"It is not a profitable business, but the whole family can make a living from filigree work," Paluca says. 
On the crossroads of major trading routes -- Dubrovnik, Croatia to Shkodra, Albania and from Skopje, Macedonia to Nis, Serbia -- Prizren dominated the filigree market and became one of the biggest hubs for the artwork in the Balkans. 
Like Paluca, his son, Liridon, 18, also began filigree work at an early age. He has achieved a level of mastery now designing original filigree pieces. He also runs most of the family business and their website, and thinks Kosovo filigree should spread beyond the country's borders. 
"It would be nice to have a filigree fair abroad," he says, while exhibiting his filigree "sculptures" to visitors in Pristina's main square. 
Residents say the town can again become a historical and cultural centre by reviving its filigree tradition, which would help the city become a major player in cultural co-operation with other cities in the Balkans and beyond.

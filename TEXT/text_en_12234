BRUSSELS, Belgium -- An EU task force has concluded that Croatia is not co-operating sufficiently with the UN war crimes tribunal and that accession talks should again be postponed, international media reports said Sunday (12 June). The commission, consisting of officials from Luxembourg, Britain, Austria and the European Commission, noted that Zagreb has made some progress. But panel members sided with UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte, who said it would take a few more months to find out if the Croatian authorities are truly committed to arresting fugitive General Ante Gotovina, one of the UN war crimes tribunal's three most-wanted suspects. The EU foreign ministers are meeting on Monday to study the recommendation. (Reuters, HINA, HRT - 12/06/05)

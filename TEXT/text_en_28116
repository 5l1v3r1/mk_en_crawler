THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal has ordered an independent investigation into allegations of witness intimidation on the part of prosecutors. Tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier said on Wednesday (August 18th) that judges ordered the probe after claims by people testifying at the trial of Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj. He faces charges for crimes committed against non-Serbs in Croatia, Vojvodina and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 1993. The prosecutor's office declined to comment. An independent investigator will report back to the court within six months.
In other news, the tribunal has decided to give former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic two weeks to review recordings found months ago in the apartment of fugitive Ratko Mladic's wife. Karadzic had asked for three weeks. He will get the additional time after two more witnesses testify at his trial. (B92, Beta, AP, AFP, Guardian - 18/08/10)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Gavrilo Grahovac, who was serving both as the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina's (FBiH) deputy prime minister and as its minister of culture and sports, stepped down from both posts Thursday (April 1st). He also tendered his resignation as vice president of the Party for BiH (SBiH). Speaking to local media, Grahovac cited "reasons of principle" but gave no further details. Political analysts say the minister disagreed with his party's decision to vote against a bill regulating the wages of state functionaries. The bill would have changed the current system, under which lawmakers make a higher salary than ministers. (Hina, Radio Free Europe, Nezavisne Novine - 02/04/10; BHRT, Fena, FTV - 01/04/10)

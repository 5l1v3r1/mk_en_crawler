BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic said Friday (22 October) that there was no alternative for RS and Serbia but to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal. According to Mikerevic, the entity government will do everything possible to ensure a positive report by UN war crimes head prosecutor Carla del Ponte on 23 November, which would pave the way for BiH's entry into the NATO Partnership for Peace programme. Mikerevic made the statement upon his return from the United States, where he paid a five-day visit last week. During the visit, Mikerevic met with senior State Department officials and international financial institutions and was assured of continued US support for reforms in BiH. 
In other news, a five-day meeting of the BiH police restructuring commission and senior EU representatives was expected to start in Brussels Monday, according to BiH Deputy Security Minister Dragan Mektic, a commission member. He confirmed that, among other things, the participants would also discuss establishing a single police structure in BiH. (Pincom.info - 24/10/04; RTRS - 22/10/04)

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Croatia has made no major progress in its search for the so-called artillery diaries related to 1995's Operation Storm, war crimes tribunal Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz has concluded in his latest report to the UN Security Council. Parts of the document were leaked to Croatian media on Tuesday (December 1st), ahead of its presentation to the UN Security Council on Thursday. Hague prosecutors seek the diaries for use in trials against several Croatian indictees, including former General Ante Gotovina. In his report, Brammertz is expected to praise Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor's decision to establish a working group to address the issue. (HINA, HRT, Vecernji List, Javno - 01/12/09)

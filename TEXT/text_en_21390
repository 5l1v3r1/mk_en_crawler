BELGRADE, Serbia -- War crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic said on Thursday (October 30th) he would request an investigation of seven people who allegedly helped war crimes suspect Stojan Zupljanin avoid arrest. Vukcevic added that he believes 30 people could eventually face prosecution. The seven allegedly provided false IDs to Zupljanin before his arrest in June. While at large, the former Bosnian Serb police commander travelled freely to a number of countries under a false identity. (AFP, AP, B92 -30/10/08)

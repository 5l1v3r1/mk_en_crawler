WASHINGTON, United States -- President George W. Bush told visiting Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis on Thursday (20 May) that he was sure Greece has made good progress in protecting the upcoming Summer Olympics against terrorist attacks. Unable to attend the Games himself due to his re-election campaign, Bush said his father, former President George Bush, would attend the Games in Athens in August -- a move Karamanlis later described as a clear vote of confidence about security issues. On Capitol Hill meanwhile, FBI Director Robert Mueller told a Senate panel that Greece is working to address the security gaps identified in the past six months.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The teachers' trade unions are staging a two-hour warning strike Monday (November 10th) to protest the government's decision to postpone a promised salary hike for six months. The protesters also plan to picket the government's headquarters in Bucharest. The unions threatened to start an open-ended nationwide general strike on November 18th unless the government meets their demands. On Friday, Romanian Ombudsman Ioan Muraru referred the 50% pay hike postponement to the Constitutional Court.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- A meeting between Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos and his Turkish Cypriot counterpart, Mehmet Ali Talat, may be held very soon, according to recent statements from both sides. Greek Cypriot government spokesman Giorgos Lillikas confirmed on Friday (31 March) that such talks would probably take place, but specified that they would focus only on issues related to missing persons.

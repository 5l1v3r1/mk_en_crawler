NEW YORK, United States -- The four indictees of The Hague war crimes tribunal still at large are within the reach of Serbian authorities, tribunal Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz said on Wednesday (June 4th) in his first address to the UN Security Council. He replaced Carla del Ponte at the beginning of the year. "We strongly believe that the remaining fugitives -- Ratko Mladic, Radovan Karadzic, Stojan Zupljanin and Goran Hadzic -- are near the Serbian authorities and that Serbian authorities could do more to locate and arrest them," Brammertz said. In the regular six-month report, he suggested that local authorities were exploiting political uncertainty in Serbia to justify their insufficient co-operation.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu has suggested that a regrouping within the ruling coalition and the election of a new government is quite possible after Romania's EU accession in January. During a TV statement broadcast on Monday (October 2nd), Basescu said it is not advantageous to keep the current coalition, as the Conservative Party gets barely 2% of public support, according to recent polls. Basescu voiced his belief that a restructured minority cabinet would be the best possible solution. (Ziua, Cotidianul - 04/10/06; Rompres, Mediafax - 03/10/06)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu urged Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu on Tuesday (March 11th) to scrap a fee charged when used cars imported from abroad are first registered in Romania. The EU has disputed it as well, launching punitive procedures against Romania over the issue last year. The European Commission says the fee amounts to a breach of Romania's EU Accession Treaty. "The government must stick to its commitments to the EU and therefore I insist that the tax should be removed immediately," Basescu said in a letter to Tariceanu. He also argued that those who have already paid the fee be refunded. Tariceanu has defended the fee, saying Romania should not turn into a "trash bin" for Europe's old cars.

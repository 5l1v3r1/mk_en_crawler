SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Recently strained relations between the two largest Bosniak parties, the Party for BiH (SBiH) and the Party of Democratic Action (SDA), proved no obstacle to reaching an agreement Thursday (June 5th) on joint participation in the local elections in Republika Srpska (RS). BiH holds local elections on October 5th. The two parties said that in municipalities where no agreement exists, they would form candidate lists based on the results of the 2004 municipal elections or 2006 general elections. The parties also agreed that the SDA would pick a candidate for mayor of Srebrenica, while the SBiH chooses one for mayor of Prijedor. They are the two RS towns with large Bosniak populations.

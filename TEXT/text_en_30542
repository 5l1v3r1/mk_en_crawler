PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci heads a "mafia-style" Albanian group responsible for trafficking weapons, drugs and human organs through Eastern Europe, according to an investigative report by the Council of Europe (CoE), which will be presented by CoE Special Rapporteur Dick Marty in Paris on Thursday (December 16th). Local media published some of the information from an article in The Guardian, which obtained the report, where Thaci is identified as the boss of a network that began operating criminal groups in 1998 and has held powerful sway over the government ever since. The report is based on a two-year investigation, citing FBI and other intelligence sources. It says Thaci has exerted "violent control" over the heroin trade for the last decade. Figures within his inner circle are also accused of taking captives across the border into Albania after the war, where a number of Serbs are said to have been murdered for their kidneys, which were then sold on the black market. The Kosovo government reacted immediately, dismissing the charges as defamation. 
In other news Tuesday, EULEX and Kosovo Police arrested two Albanians in Prizren suspected of committing war crimes in July 1998. The charges allege intimidation and terror; dislocation and displacement of civilians in Rahovec/ Orahovac and nearby villages.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Republika Srpska (RS) Parliament will hold an extraordinary session on police reform on 30 May, according to an announcement from the legislature's presidency Friday (20 May). The reform, considered crucial to BiH's EU accession prospects, was blocked after RS representatives disagreed with a draft proposal for mapping the future BiH police regions earlier this month.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini is urging authorities to strengthen the fight against corruption, especially at high level. He comments came during a meeting with Bulgarian EU Affairs Minister Meglena Kuneva on Monday (23 January), the first day of his two-day trip. Frattini reiterated that the European Commission (EC) strongly supports efforts to restructure the Bulgarian judiciary. In a few months, the EC will issue a decisive monitoring report that would determine whether Bulgaria joins the EU in 2007 or is delayed by a year. (Sega - 24/01/06; BNR, Mediapool - 23/01/06)

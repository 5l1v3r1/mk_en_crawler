BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The World Bank Country Manager for BiH, Dirk Reinermann, voiced concerns over the slow pace of economic and social reforms in the country, in an interview in Friday's (11 August) Nezavisne novine. He said that while progress has been made in reforms related to the EU integration process and defence sector restructuring, the economic situation remains unfavourable. Reinermann called for fast adoption of the law on the BiH National Fiscal Council, stressing that a state-level institution needs to make and enforce decisions concerning fiscal policy, as well as accelerate the privatisation process and measures aimed at improving the business climate.

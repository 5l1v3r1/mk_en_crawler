PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The opposition Vetevendosje Movement is asking the government to provide more information on the Kosovo-Serbia talks being held in Brussels. The movement's leader, Albin Kurti, said that many topics are being kept secret, as are transcripts of the meetings that have taken place so far. Kurti was speaking at a press conference Sunday (April 10th) based on a briefing the Kosovo delegation gave to parliament's foreign affairs committee. The dialogue is expected to resume this week.

ANKARA, Turkey - Three soldiers were injured on Saturday (June 12th) when a mine believed to have been planted by the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) blew up in southeast Turkey. It happened near the town of Baskale, in Hakkari province, the Anadolu news agency reported. 
On Friday, the army says PKK rebels launched two separate attacks on soldiers in the southeast. One soldier was killed in the first clash, in which PKK rebels opened fire on troops in Hakkari province. In the second incident, a roadside bomb believed to have been detonated by the PKK wounded 14 soldiers in Tunceli province. That sparked a large-scale military operation to track down the rebels.

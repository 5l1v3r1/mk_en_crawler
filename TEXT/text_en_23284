ANKARA, Turkey -- Six soldiers were killed in a landmine explosion in the Hakkari province early Thursday (May 28th). Eight were injured. Authorities suspect the remote-controlled mine was planted by members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
Meanwhile, the Anadolu news agency reports that around 30 people were arrested in a broad-scale operation against the PKK in Izmir, Ankara, Istanbul, Manisa and Van. The operation targeted suspected attempts by members to organise PKK structures within some NGOs and other associations. Police raided homes and businesses, seizing a large amount of documents and CDs.
In other news, authorities arrested another ranking army official Wednesday for alleged links to the ultra-nationalist organisation Ergenekon. Colonel Mustafa Turkan Ecevit was detained in Istanbul after a secret weapons cache was found in the city. Investigators say the Ergenekon group planned murders and other attacks aimed at inciting a coup.

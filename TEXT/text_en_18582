BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The new leader of the conservative caucus in the European Parliament said on Wednesday (January 10th) that he opposes the admission of Turkey as a full member of the EU. Joseph Daul, head of the European People's Party group, suggested that Ankara should be offered some form of privileged partnership instead of membership. Daul stressed, however, that he does not oppose the ongoing negotiations between Brussels and Ankara. 
Also Wednesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul insisted that the government would not give up on reforms -- even though its EU talks were partially suspended in December -- and that 2007 would not be a lost year for Turkey. (Radikal, Sabah - 11/01/07; AFP, dpa - 10/01/07)

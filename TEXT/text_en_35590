PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Harri Holkeri announced on Saturday (10 April) that he has sacked the international chief of the privatisation process in the province. Marie Fucci will be replaced as head of the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA). The KTA has so far sold 16 public companies, with another 500 state-owned firms awaiting privatisation. The process has been stalled by disputes between UN officials and local authorities. A recent round of tenders was cancelled due to irregularities. Fucci's replacement has not been announced.

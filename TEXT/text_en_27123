TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition parties are continuing their boycott of state institutions after a ten-day ultimatum given to the government to meet demands expired. The opposition, headed by the Socialist Party (SP), said on Wednesday (December 2nd) it will insist on the opening of some ballot boxes that it believes were manipulated in the June 28th general elections. "The government risks early elections by not meeting our demands," SP lawmaker Erion Brace said, announcing a meeting of the party's presidency Thursday. The government insists that no ballot boxes will be reopened as the elections have been certified by local institutions and commended by EU leaders.

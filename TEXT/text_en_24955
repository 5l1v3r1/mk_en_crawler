BUCHAREST, Romania -- Justice Minister Catalin Predoiu said on Friday (January 30th) he will reinstate the head of the National Anti-Corruption Directorate (DNA), Daniel Morar. Predoiu told a press conference the move would be "a clear message to the international community that Romania's justice system is determined to fight corruption and defend the EU's financial interests". Last August, the ministry announced Morar would be replaced for alleged close ties to President Traian Basescu. Under Morar's leadership, the DNA launched corruption investigations against eight former or current cabinet ministers, including former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase.

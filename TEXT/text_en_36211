SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown called on the BiH government Saturday (6 March) to urgently approve the law on prevention of money laundering. He said failure to adopt this piece of legislation would affect government efforts against money laundering, international terrorism and illegal migration.
Also on Saturday, BiH Federation President Niko Lozanic confirmed he has asked for the dismissal of Prime Minister Ahmet Hadzipasic. The move followed a boycott by ministers from the Croatian Democratic Union, which did not participate in approving the federation's budget. The Party of Democratic Action, of which Hadzipasic is a member, said it would not accept his dismissal. (FoNet, FENA, HINA, BH Radio - 06/03/04)

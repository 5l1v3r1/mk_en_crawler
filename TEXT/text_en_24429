SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Former Interior Minister and war crimes indictee Ljube Boskovski announced plans Sunday (January 11th) to run for president. He is the first to throw his hat in the ring. Boskovski, 48, announced an hour after officials set the elections for March 22nd. He received a hero's welcome after being acquitted of several war crimes charges by The Hague tribunal last year. Boskovski spent more than three years in custody for a 2001 police raid on an ethnic Albanian village that left seven people dead. Prosecutors are appealing the acquittal.

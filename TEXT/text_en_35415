ANKARA, Turkey -- The IMF's visiting mission has warned against possible increases in the minimum wage, Turkish Labour Minister Murat Basesgioglu said Monday (14 June). The issue arose during his meeting with mission members. Basesgioglu said he assured them that the government was aware of the dangers entailed by excessive increases in the wage. The IMF had criticised a significant increase in the minimum wage prior to the local elections on 4 March; in response, the government took measures to compensate for revenue losses.

TIRANA, Albania -- The main port in Durres is ramping up its capacity as traffic reaches its peak for the year. Port authorities said on Tuesday (August 17th) that a terminal with 12 new checkpoints has been added to the existing 23, reducing the amount of time passengers spend queued up for customs procedures. Figures suggest that about 237,000 passengers passed through the checkpoints in July, while ferries transported around 62,000 vehicles. (VoA, Ora News, Alsat, Klan - 17/08/10)

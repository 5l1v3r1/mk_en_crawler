WASHINGTON, United States -- A government delegation from Croatia on Monday (30 September) launched a round of talks with the IMF aimed at signing a new stand-by agreement. The previous one expired in May. A government crisis during the spring and IMF demands for fiscal tightening led to a postponement of talks on a new financing arrangement. An IMF mission will travel to Croatia on 24 October to continue talks. According to previous statements from the finance ministry, Croatia is seeking some $100m in financing, to be used only in emergencies. (Infoinvest, HRT, HINA - 30/09/02)

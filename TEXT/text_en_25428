ANKARA, Turkey -- Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc says the government is determined to pass its package of constitutional reforms, first in parliament, and if necessary, in a public referendum. Arinc said Thursday (March 25th) that the timeframe for the referendum is sometime in June, if all goes as planned. The main opposition Republican Peoples' Party (CHP) opposes the move, and says it will ask the Constitutional Court to weigh in if President Abdullah Gul approves the amendments. 
The CHP may have an uphill battle. The Venice Commission, a panel that advises the Council of Europe and the European Parliament, announced on Wednesday that it has no problem with any of the proposed amendments. Turkish media has reported that the ruling Justice and Development Party will be able to convince enough lawmakers to support the package, making a referendum unnecessary.

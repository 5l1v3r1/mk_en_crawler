SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev refused to accept on Tuesday (March 11th) the resignation of Transport Minister Petar Mutafchiev, who was ready to step down after a train fire two weeks ago killed nine people. The investigation into the incident continues and the cause of the blaze has not been determined. The opposition says the actions of the transport ministry were inadequate and demanded Mutafchiev's resignation, which he later offered. Stanishev, however, defended Mutafchiev's actions, saying he sees no reason to let him go.
In other news, the finance and agriculture ministries announced on Tuesday that the government is granting farmers additional funding to compensate for suspension of the EU's SAPARD programme funding. The EU has frozen some funds under the programme due to an ongoing investigation into alleged embezzlement. The results are expected in May. (BTA, BGNES, Darik - 11/03/08)

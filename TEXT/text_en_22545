SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Two mine clearers died on Saturday (July 12th) when a mine left over from the 1992-1995 war exploded in the central town of Maglaj, the police announced. Two weeks ago, a similar incident killed two people who were cutting wood in northern BiH. According to officials, old mines lie on some 1,755 square km or 3.4% of BiH's territory.

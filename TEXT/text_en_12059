BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Central Bank announced on Sunday (13 February) that it was cutting its key interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point to 15.75 per cent for domestic currency deposits, following a drop of inflation to 15-year lows. The bank said excess currency in the market favoured continued appreciation of the lei and relieved inflation pressures. Romania's inflation rate fell to 8.9 per cent in January, the lowest recorded figure since 1990. 
Meanwhile, reviving the economic partnership between Romania and Russia is the focus of Romanian President Traian Basescu's two-day visit to Moscow. Basescu will meet with government officials and leading members of the business community.
In other news, Romania's ruling coalition announced that Adrian Videanu of the Democratic Party would be its candidate for mayor of Bucharest in the 3 April local elections. He is the first announced candidate. (Nine o'clock, RIA Novosti, Itar-Tass - 14/02/05; Bloomberg - 13/02/05; Nine o'clock - 11/02/05)

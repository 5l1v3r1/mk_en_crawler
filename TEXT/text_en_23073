BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Romania proposed to EU leaders on Monday (September 1st) a set of measures to improve the situation in the Black Sea region, President Traian Basescu said. The Romanian delegation circulated the document to all heads of state and government of EU states at Monday's extraordinary European Council meeting, held to discuss the Russian-Georgian conflict. The proposal will also be sent to NATO member states, Basescu said. In it, Bucharest appeals for transatlantic solidarity and backs the idea that solving conflicts in the Black Sea area, including the Transdniestrian conflict, is possible only by observing international law, the right of sovereignty and territorial integrity and the inviolability of state borders. The document asks the EU to play a bigger role in all talks regarding such conflicts, suggests deployment of peacekeeping mechanisms and supports a larger role for NATO in the Black Sea region.

ATHENS, Greece -- Dozens of flights across Greece are being cancelled Thursday (July 8th) amid a general strike against the government's pension and social security reform. The strike, the sixth since the beginning of the year, will also paralyse public transportation, some ports and railways. Hospitals will only treat emergency cases. There will be no news content, since journalists are striking as well. The walkout coincides with a vote by parliament on controversial reforms that would cut pensions and raise the retirement age. The bill is expected to pass, as the ruling PASOK party has a seven-seat majority. Late Wednesday, parliament approved the legislation in the first reading. A total of 159 of PASOK's 160 lawmakers voted for it.
Earlier in the day, the European Commission published the findings of the first mission of EU, IMF and European Central Bank (ECB) officials to the country last month. The report concludes that Athens is on a good track, but warned that high inflation remains a risk and progress in the healthcare sector seems slow. The EU, IMF and ECB experts will visit Athens again, likely later this month, to determine whether to release the second tranche of the 110 billion-euro joint EU/IMF support mechanism.

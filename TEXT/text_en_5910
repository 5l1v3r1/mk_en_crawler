Most of the world economies have returned to a positive path to greater economic freedom, the US-based Wall Street Journal and the Heritage Foundation said in an annual report released on Wednesday (January 12th). 
The authors of the 2011 Index of Economic Freedom, which covers 183 countries and territories in the world, ranking 179 of them, rated Hong Kong as the world's freest economy for a 17th year in a row. 
The Wall Street Journal and Heritage Foundation use ten indicators to evaluate the economic openness, the rule of law and competitiveness of the surveyed countries. Those include business freedom, trade freedom, fiscal freedom, government spending, monetary freedom, investment freedom, financial freedom, property rights, freedom from corruption and labour freedom. The surveyed economies are given marks from 0 (the worst) to 100 (the best) on each of those indicators and their overall scores determine their individual rankings in the index. 
 Only six economies, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland and Canada received overall marks of more than 80 points to be designated as "free". 
The 19-nation list of the "biggest gainers," i.e., countries that improved their index scores by at least two points from last year, included only three European countries -- Bulgaria (+2.6), Cyprus (+2.4) and Moldova (+2). 
At the same time, six of the 14 countries that lost more than two points were also European -- Iceland (-5.5), Ireland (-2.6), Greece and Italy with -2.4 each, plus Albania and Britain, both with two-point lower scores this year. 
Cyprus, the 18th freest economy in the world, owed its better score in the 2011 index to "significant improvements in the corruption, labour, investment, and monetary freedom categories". Its mark of 73.3 points made it the only Southeast European (SEE) country among the 27 "mostly free" economies, with scores from 70 to 79.9. 
Eight of the other SEE nations -- Macedonia (66), Bulgaria (64.9), Romania (64.7), Turkey (64.2), Albania (64), Montenegro (62.5), Croatia (61.1) and Greece (60.3) -- were categorised as "moderately free," on the basis of their marks of between 60 and 69.9 points. 
Macedonia improved its score by 0.3 of a point this year to move up five slots to 55th, replacing Albania as the freest Balkan economy. Its better mark this year reflected "improvements in freedom from corruption and monetary freedom". 
Bulgaria's higher overall score this year was attributed to "gains in seven of the ten economic freedom categories", according to the report. Placed 60th in the world, the country "has weathered the impact of the global economic downturn relatively well, with the economy supported by generally prudent fiscal policy and sound public debt management". 
Albania slipped 17 positions to 70th in the 2011 index "due primarily to decreases in trade freedom, investment freedom, freedom from corruption, labour freedom, and its government spending score", the report's authors explained. 
 Croatia, which improved its overall score by 1.9 points, allowing it to jump ten places to 82nd this year, showed improvements in six of the ten indicators, but still needs to deal with some lingering problems, including corruption and political interference, especially in the judiciary. 
 The only countries in the region designated as "mostly unfree" were Bosnia and Herzegovina (57.5), Moldova (55.7) and Serbia (58), whose scores were below the world average of 59.7 points this year. 
Kosovo is not included in the 2011 index. Countries scoring less than 49.9 points are labelled as "repressed economies". The worst performer this year is North Korea, with a score of 1.0.

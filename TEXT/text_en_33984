NEW YORK, United States -- Secretary of State Colin Powell has certified a decision to restore normal trade relations with Serbia-Montenegro, a State Department spokesman said on Monday (3 November). Normal trade status was revoked in 1992 because of the former Yugoslavia's support for separatist Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to the State Department, Belgrade's relations with Sarajevo have changed since the end of the 1995 conflict and particularly since the ousting of Slobodan Milosevic. The US government was also encouraged by reforms in Serbia-Montenegro. The spokesman said that the resumption of normal trade is seen as a means to encourage change, economic growth and stability in the area. (Dow Jones, Tanjug, BBC, B92 - 03/11/03)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- NATO members meeting on Thursday (April 3rd) in Bucharest have invited Croatia and Albania to join the Alliance, but say fellow candidate Macedonia must wait until its longstanding name dispute with Greece is resolved. Athens maintains its neighbour's current name implies a territorial claim on its northern province of Macedonia. "This is a huge disappointment," said Macedonian government negotiator Nikola Dimitrov. "It goes against the values that stand behind NATO. It's very much against stability in the Balkans." The delegation from Skopje then left the summit. 
For their part, Croatian President Stipe Mesic and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader thanked NATO members for the support extended to their country. They stressed that confidence in Croatia and Albania would send encouraging messages to other NATO aspirants in the region. 
Albanian President Bamir Topi described it as "the most important decision in the history of the Albanian people", while Prime Minister Sali Berisha said NATO's decision "opens an era of secure freedom and secure future". (Makfax, MIA, HRT, BBC, CNN, AP, BalkanInsight - 03/04/08)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A mixed panel of EULEX and Kosovo judges at the District Court of Pristina on Monday (February 15th) adjourned the trial of Vetevendosje (Self Determination) movement leader Albin Kurti for a week. Kurti is accused of participating in a crowd committing a criminal offence and taking part in a crowd obstructing officials from performing their duties during a demonstration three years ago. He is the only person being held responsible for a demonstration February 10th 2007 during which two protestors died and more than 80 people were wounded. Kurti boycotted the start of his trial Monday to protest international missions that don't recognise Kosovo's independence.

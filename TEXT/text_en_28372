VIENNA, Austria -- High Representative Valentin Inzko warned on Tuesday (November 16th) that Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) lags behind its neighbours in terms of reforms. Speaking in Vienna at a press conference ahead of the 15th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Agreements that ended the 1992-1995 conflict, he called on BiH officials to form a functioning central-level government as soon as possible, in order to continue with reforms needed for EU and NATO integration. Inzko stressed that BiH can achieve progress only as a unified country, ruling out any secession effort by Republika Srpska. (Radio Free Europe, AP, Xinhua - 16/11/10)

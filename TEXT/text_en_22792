TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi said Monday (July 7th) that political problems should not interfere with the justice system. Topi, who attended a meeting of the High Court, called on the body to pay more attention to reforms. "It is important to specify that the state's political problems should at no time affect the judicial system," the president said. A few weeks ago the parliament turned down the president's decrees on five nominations to the High Court. The president described the rejections as political acts. 
In other news, the European Commission (EC) wants Albania to intensify its fight against organised crime and corruption, EC representative in Albania Dirk Lange said on Monday. "The anti-corruption strategy must be applied in order for improvements to be achieved in this field," Lange said. (Shqip - 08/07/08; VOA, Balkan Web, Top Channel - 07/07/08)

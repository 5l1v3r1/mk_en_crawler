Albanian authorities last month held the country's first-ever national conference on drug usage and trafficking, describing the issue as a government priority. According to Albanian Attorney General Theodhori Sollaku, the country is a transit point for the heroin trade, as well as a site of cannabis production. 
"Up until now, cannabis has been the only drug produced in Albania. However, there are signs of the presence of heroin and synthetic drugs, like ecstasy," Sollaku said. 
Acting US Ambassador to Tirana Steven Zate urged the government to do more to halt these illegal activities. "The Albanian government, supported by the international partners, has to act on this phenomenon, and not only with the words written in the national strategy," Zate said. 
Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano urged the creation of a common front. The drug problem is "a negative sign for Albania's image in the world", Nano said, urging politicians to avoid blaming each other and instead work together to enact necessary legislation. 
Albania has come under frequent criticism from the international community for failing to take sufficient steps against organised crime, including narcotics trafficking. The government, however, insists it is doing what it can. 
Police have identified all the drug traffickers operating in Albania, Public Order Minister Igli Toska said, calling on other countries in the region to take stronger measures. "The Balkans is not a region where hard drugs are produced, but unfortunately it is a transit point," he said. 
According to the European Commission's Ambassador to Tirana, Lutz Salzmann, authorities should punish traffickers as well as drug users. "You need to rehabilitate the drug users through social and economic projects. The state has to catch the real traffickers to stop this phenomenon," Salzmann said.

Because of this, it is not possible to calculate productivity per hour worked. Productivity per employee is calculated as a ratio between the Gross value added and the number of employees„. 
4. Sector-specific standards and technical regulations, including sector-related requirements for environmental protection 
With the Law on standardisation from 1995 ("Official Gazette of RM" No. 23/95), 11.610 standards were accepted as macedonian standards – S, as well as technical provisions (rulebooks on quality, orders on compulsory attesting, rulebooks on technical normatives etc.). Most of these regulations have not been abolished and are still in use, i.e. they are enforced by the authorized ministries and bodies within the ministries. Most of the standards were compulsory. With the new Law on Standardisation ("Official Gazette of RM" No. 54/02), all Macedonian standards are voluntary. In accordance with the Law on prescribing of technical reqiurements for products and evaluation of compliance ("Official Gazette of RM" No.55/02), chnical provisions are under authority of the respective ministries. In the scope of construction and construction products, there are 533 standards in total (12 main groups), of which 5 European standards are harmonized in the scope of thermal insulation, and 20 are in the procedure of undertaking of the European standards, and their adoption is expected. In regard with the technical provisions (rulebooks on quality, orders on obligatory attesting, rulebooks on technical normatives etc.), there are 46 provisions in the scope of construction and construction products, and some of them are valid in other scopes. More important provisions (rulebooks) are: Rulebook on technical normatives for construction of high-construction objects in seismic areas (Official Gazette of SFRY No. 31/81, 49/82, 29/83, 21/88, 52/90), Rulebook on technical normatives for reinforced concrete and concrete products (Official Gazette of SFRY 15/90, 26/88), Rulebook on technical normatives for designing and construction of final works in construction (Official Gazette of SFRY nr. 14/89) etc. In regard with the reply to the question regarding sector-related requirements for environmental protection, see 153H15_I_II_A, point 4. 
5. Incentives a) For investment b) For exports c) Other 
See 154H15_I_II_A, point 5.  
6. Rules on foreign investment a) Characteristics: Restrictions on foreign participation, financial participation in particular; tax benefits rules on profit repatriation b) Guarantees 
See 155H15_I_II_A, point 6. 
7. Trading system a) Non-tariff measures affecting imports and exports, such as licences and quotas 
See 156H15_I_II_A, point 7. 
8. Likely developments, and time-scale a) Investment envisaged (public sector, private sector, foreign) b) Present or envisaged restructuring or modernisation plans 
See 157H15_I_II_A, point 8. 9. Approximation of national legislation to Community legislation a) List of measures, either planned or already adopted 
Aiming to approximate the national legislation to the EU in the scope of construction and construction products, we will start to prepare a Law on Building Materials and by-laws, which will be completely in compliance with the requests of the Directive 89/106/EE. The Law on construction and the by-laws that derive of this law are in the procedure of preparation (this Law is prepared by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning). The quality control of construction objects will be made by the certifying, inspection bodies that will be accredited in accordance with the requests of the EU standards for accreditation. 
b) Timetable 
The preparation of the Law on construction, together with the following by-laws, is in the final phase, and its  adoption and application is expected in the year 2005. The preparation of the Law on Building Materials with the following by-laws will start in the year 2005, and its adoption and application is expected in the year 2006.

The objects are of good quality and are well equipped. However, significant part of the most of the catering objects have to be repaired, modernized and equipped, because of the fact that we are considering the big objects that require larger investments, and for which the privatization process finished in the past few years. In accordance with the Law from the year 1995, and as a result of the delayed privatization and the circumstances in the country, significant number of accomodation facilities have not been put into categories and harmonized with the international standards. However, the new laws on catering and tourism raise this issue on a priority and obligatory level. The increase of the number of beds in the private rooms is notifyable, and they are also obliged to take care for the international standards for certain category of service.

c) Domestic demand, present and forecast (for the next three years) 
As a result of the great part in the total turnover, the domestic demand has significant influence on the results within this business. The situation may be changed in the future years as a result of the increase of the competition, in spite of the fact that we have to take into consideration the demand on the domestic market, as well as its limited purchase power. In accordance with the forecasts and the Studies of the Master Plan for development of the tourism, the demand will be directed more towards the lake sites,i.e. as it was before, with tendency to increase the future transit tourism.

g) Production and market monopolies 
Since the tourism turnover in the Republic of Macedonia is realized and dependent on the elasticity of the domestic tourist demand, the influence of the competition in the business with tourism is great. The legislation in the catering and tourism provides equal treatment of all participants in this business activity, and in that manner it prevents market and marketing monopolies.

5. Incentives 
a) For investment 
The development of the tourism in the Republic of Macedonia is based on the following:   Macro-economy policy passed by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia;   The Company  Law (“Official Gazette of RM” nr. 28/2004)   Legislation within the activity;   Physical Plan  of the Republic of Macedonia;   The National Strategy for Development of Small and Medium Enterprises;   The Program for measures and activities for support of the entrepreneurship and providing competition for the small and medium sized enterprises in the Republic of Macedonia, representing an operational manner of acting towards the policy and strategy of medium and small enterprises, through various forms of financial and non-financial support, which obtains conditions for opening of new working posts and decrease of the number of unemployed persons, increase of the export and providing conditions for growth of the living standard of the citizens through their work.   The low growth and the limited competitiveness within the entrepreneurs and small and medium sized enterprises, are result of the unfavourable access to the financial sources, as well as the high financial expenses. As a result of the high expenses, the basic long-term financial source of the small and medium enterprises in the past period of time were the foreign credit lines, provided by bilateral and multilateral creditors (donors). It is estimated that in the future period also, these financial sources will play a significant role in securing the necessary financial sources of the development of the micro-small and medium businesses.   Annual programs for general advertising and informative activity on tourism in the Republic of Macedonia in which the priority activities for informing of tourists on foreign market and foreign visitors in the country are located. The program activities refer to the printed advertising material, presentations and fair exhibitions on foreign tourist markets, visits of foreign tourist reporters, activities for international cooperation in regard with increasing of the quality of services etc. 
b) For exports 
Any special incentives for investments in tourism are not determined, i.e the investment conditions are not of selective and priority character in regard with the other activities.  c) Other 
The investments in tourism are more remarkable in the past few years, and the reason for this is the fact that the transformation of the social and state capital was performed in a very slow manner in this sector, which was not the case in other industrial branches. The biggest investments are made in the catering services and, basically, they refer to the reconstruction and modernization of the existing facilities. In the same time, the private sector invests in small hotels and other catering facilities, tending to keep the standards for certain category. The privatization in the tourism was completed earlier, and, with the introduction of the licenses for the tourist agencies, the quality of the offered services is increased.

6. Rules on foreign investment 
The foreign investments in the tourism are in the frame of the National strategy for foreign direct investments, i.e. the Republic of Macedonia offers to the foreign investors a guaranteed equal treatment of all investors; Macedonia is a member of the MIGA; contracts for mutual protection of investments have been concluded with 26 countries. There are no restrictions for entrance of a foreign capital in the tourism and catering in the Republic of Macedonia, except in the areas where the activity is connected with the protection of the historical monuments and cultural treasures. 
a) Characteristics: Restrictions on foreign participation, financial participation in particular; tax benefits rules on profit repatriation 
There are no restrictions on foreign investments in this area and there are no rules on tax benefits for profit repatriation in the tourism and catering sector. 
b)  Guarantees 
The general rules and benefits that refer to the foreign investors that invest in the Republic of Macedonia are in effect for investments in tourism too. 
7. Trading system 
The trading system in the activity does not make restrictions in respect with the exchange of services on the domestic and foreign market as well as in respect with the domestic and foreign persons that perform the activity. 
8. Likely developments, and time-scale 
a) Investment envisaged (public sector, private sector, foreign) 
With the completion of the privatization process in the tourism sector, it is expected to have healing of the development of the tourism activities, where the initiative of the private sector will be directed towards the development of the accommodation capacities and the tourism infrastructure, as well as towards the general tourism advertising of the country;  including  the public sector in this action will be made through improvement of the condition of the elected tourism locations, equipping of the main communication routes and access road with an adequate signalization; preparation of the public private partnerships, especially with the local self-government for specific development projects; regional and cross border tourism cooperation, as well as tendency to provide incentives through the taxation policy for certain investments, and to activate adequate investment resources. 
b) Present or envisaged restructuring or modernisation plans 
One of the priority tasks, determined with the Annual program for macro-economy development of the Republic of Macedonia is the quality and rational managing with the state budget, and in the scope of that, with the tourism sector  also. The reconstruction and modernization plans are in the authority of the private sector and are in a great extent dependent on the credit conditions, i.e. the existence of the credit lines for small and medium enterprises. 
9. Approximation of national legislation to Community legislation 
The law on Catering Industry and the Law on Tourism are entirely harmonized with the European legislation ( The Directive of the UE 90/314 is transposed in our legislation) The harmonization refers to the travels and package deals, including  tourism services of good quality in the contracts between the suppliers of services and the users of services, as well as other adequate conditions for stay of tourists, by which it indirectly  refers to the catering activities etc. Upon passing of these laws, the services of EU experts in the scope of the legislation were used, as well as a comparative legislation from several EU countries.

Light trailers (highest permissible weight up to 750kg) The light trailers do not need to be registered pursuant Article 325 of the Law on Road Traffic  Safety. The light trailers that are not subject to registration must have on the rear side  a registration  number plate with the same  registration  number of the tow vehicle. 10. Road taxes for the use of public roads of the vehicles The tables with  the amount of the public road use fee are presented under the appropriate items. The amount of the annual public road use fee is calcualted in MKD by multiplying  the quantities with the retail price of a litre  of fuel MB-98. The  motor and trailer vehicles owners  pay the fee prior to submitting the application for registration, in a one-time advance amount of money  for a period of 12 months. The owners of  motor vehicles who  temporarily register the vehicles for a period shorter than 12 months pay proportional share of the fee. The Article 96 of the mentioned Law on Public Roads prescribes charging of the fee for using     highway and part of a highway. The amount of the fee for using  highway and part of a highway is determined by the Government Decission (”Official Gazette” of the Republic of Macedonia  No. 52/00) on the basis of the retail price of a litre of MB-98 according to  the category of vehicle and the section lenght. . The vehicles that are subject to the fee for using  highway and part of a highway are classified in the following categories:   First category – motor vehicles with the highest overall height of 1.7 m and the highest overall lenght of 5.5 m (passanger vehicles);   Second category - motor vehicles with the highest overall height of 3.3 m and the highest overall lenght of 9.5 m (passanger vehicles with trailer,  jeeps, vans and semi-freight vehicles);   Third category - motor vehicles with the highest overall height of 4.2 m and the highest overall lenght of 10.5 m (jeeps with trailer, semi-freight vehicles with trailer, vans with trailer, freight vehicles and buses);   Fourth category - motor vehicles with overall height higher than 4.2 m and overall lenght higher than 10.5 m (freight vehicles with trailers, buses and rigs). Mandatory insurance against liability  of motor vehicle  owners  Pursuant to the Law on Insurance (”Offcial Gazette” of the Republic of Macedonia No. 35/01, 4/02, 27/02) the owner, i.e. the holder of the righ to use the vehicle is obliged to sign  a contract for automobile liability insurance. The registration of the motor and the trailer vehicle, the renewal of the registration and the issuance of trial number  plates can be done  after proof of signed  contract for insurance is submitted to the body competent for registration of vechicles. 
Homologation 
Article 318 of the Law on Road Traffic Safety (”Offcial Gazette” of the Republic of Macedonia No. 14/98, 38/02, 38/04) stipulates that motor and trailer vehicles which  are serially produced or imported must fulfill the homologation regulations in force in the Republic of Macedonia, i.e. to be in accordance  with international agreements ratified by the Republic of Macedonia. The homologation fee is subject to deregulation of prices and is determined independently by the authorised homologation institutions on the basis of the type of vehicle.

(“Official Gazette of SFRY” No. 74/88). The quality of the cereals is determined by the following:   the botanical classification;   the organoleptyc characteristics;   extraneous matter content and type;   the quantity of water,   the particular physical features;  hectolitre mass;   the presence of pests;   the presence of microorganisms and their noxious metabolites;   the presence of residual pesticides and other noxious substances. 
Organoleptyc Characteristics of the Cereals Cereals used for milling products and cereals for direct human consumption must be mature and healthy. The appearance, form, colour and shine, as well as the smell and taste, of cereals must be typical for the variety, the sort, i.e. the line. The cereals must not have any strange smell or taste; in particular they must not have:   the smell and taste of weed seed in cereals,   the smell and taste of mould and smut of wheat,   the smell of stored-crop pest,   the smell and taste of spoiling  due to poor storage,   the strange smell absorbed in transport or during storage. 
Type and Quantity of Ingredients  in Cereals The ingredients in cereals represent all outer  kinds of matter which are  not basic cereals  and damaged grain. The extraneous matter are classified in three basic groups:   dirt of outer  origin,   grains of other cereals,  damaged grain. Dirt of outer  origin that must not be contained in the basic mass of cereals includes the following:   vegetable dirt (straw residues, chaff husks, tailing, seed coats, pieces of wood,  grain or  weed),   animal dirt (insects, insect fragments, rodent excrements, rodent hair, etc.),   dirt of mineral origin (pieces of metal, grit, sand, dust, earth)    mineral dirt (metal pieces, grit, sand, dust, earth),   other dirt (cord, paper, thread, etc.). Grains of other cereals are grains that are not the basic mass of that kind of cereal. Damaged grains are the following:   crashed grains, i.e. grains with open kernels due to mechanical damage or tiny parts of grain and grain with removed germs,   shrivelled grains, i.e. underdeveloped grains due to poor vegetative conditions,   small, undeveloped grains,   grains of inappropriate colour: green, which is not ripe grain, grains where the process of spoiling started but was interrupted,   grains damaged by artificial drying: sound grains with a darker brown coat, while the grain section is of a brown – non variety - colour,   grains infected with ergot, ergoted grains filled with spores of stinking smutof wheat, and musty grains with mould visible to the naked eye on the surface and in the inner part of the grain,   grains damaged by field bugs,   bitten grains: grains damaged by pests on the outside or from the inside, the pests being either wire worms or other pests (mites, rodents, etc.),   germinated grains: grains with swollen or wrinkled germs, and grains with grown primary roots so that they are either visible or have already been removed. 
Quantity of the Ingredients  in Cereals The total quantity of ingredients   in wheat for immediate human consumption (wheat for cooking) in the original packaging may not exceed 1%, out of which the permitted quantities are the following:   Grains of other cereals – not more than 0.2%,   Crashed grains – not more than 0.2%,   Grains damaged by drying, by stinging and biting – not more than 0.5%.

EGGS 
The quality of eggs is established based on the By-law on the Quality of Eggs and Eggs Products published in the “Official Gazette”  of SFRY  No. 55/89. According to the quality and the manner of storing, eggs are distributed as follows:   superior quality eggs,   first class eggs,   second class eggs,   third class eggs. First and second-class eggs are sent to the market classified according to mass in 7 classes; third class eggs are used for processing. Eggs are distributed  after quality control  no later than 48 hours after production, and before they are placed in transport packages.   Egg products are put into circulation in the original packing and must have a mark designating the type of eggs, i.e. information on the type of the feather poultry they come from if they are not hen’s  eggs. The quality control of the eggs is performed in accord with the By-law on the Methods for Quality Inspection, published in the “Official Gazette of RM” No. 72/87. The examination is conducted through sampling and methods of physical and chemical analysis.  The Law on Safety of Foodstuffs and Products and Materials in Contact with Foodstuffs  (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 54/02) will assure the safety of the consumer and will protect consumers from misleading through appropriate and timely information on food safety and efficient supervision over the production, import and export, simultaneously protecting the health of the consumer. During the drafting of The Law on Safety of Foodstuffs and Products and Materials in Contact with Foodstuffs , Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council was taken into account. The national legislation in the Republic of Macedonia in the area of health safety of the food is not yet fully harmonised with the international standards. The process of harmonisation has been initiated with the adoption of The Law on Safety of Foodstuffs and Products and Materials in Contact with Foodstuffs  based on the following EU regulations:  Directive 2000/13/U for approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs  ( L 109, 06.05.2000),   Council Regulation (EEC) No 2082/92, on certificates of specific character for agricultural products and foodstuffs (OJ L 208, 24.07.1992)  Directive 2001/18/C on deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms ( L 106, 17.04.2001),   Directive 93/99/EEC on the subject of additional measures concerning the official control of foodstuffs (OJ L 290, 24.11.1993)   Regulation (EC) No. 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients (OJ L 043 14.02.1997) As the procedure for preparing by-laws is on its way, the rules on food hygiene will be also taken into consideration, in the part related to the registration and approval of food production facilities and also the rules relating to introduction of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), which are contained in the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the hygiene of foodstuffs (COM/2000/0438). All of the EU directives and regulations that are not incorporated into The Law on Safety of Foodstuffs and Products and Materials in Contact with Foodstuffs   shall be incorporated into the by-laws that are in the phase of adoption. Regarding food, the competence lies within the sphere of the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy and the Ministry of Economy. Within these ministries there are bodies that supervise the application of the regulations concerning the issues of food in a wider aspect:   Ministry of Health - State Sanitary and Health Inspectorate   Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy- Veterinary Directorate and State Agricultural Inspectorate   Ministry of Economy - State Market Inspectorate The State Sanitary and Health Inspectorate controls all the food products; the complete sanitary safety:  contents  contaminants  microbiological safety The Veterinary Directorate controls products of animal origin; the complete sanitary safety:  contents  contaminants  microbiological safety State Agricultural Inspectorate - phyto-sanitary control  The State Market Inspectorate controls all food products; analysis of quality and contents From 01.01.2005, the Food Directorate  started to function within the Ministry of Health, in accord with the The Law on Safety of Foodstuffs and Products and Materials in Contact with Foodstuffs (“Official Gazette of RM” 54/02), With the adoption of this Law and with the start of operation of the Food Directorate will mean realization of the basic objective of the public health care policy in the area of food, which is basis for the four main pillars of the public health: food safety, food adequacy, social justice and health ecology. 
c) The measures of the common agricultural policy are applied on the level of individual products. A full description of the policies that are currently applied or are intended to be applied is required for each of the stated products or groups of products. 
CEREALS Cereals are grown on 41% of the total arable land of the country. Wheat is most widely spread with 21%, barley with 10%, corn with 7%, rye with 0.5% and rice with 0.4%. Cereals have a part  of 35% in the total support to the agricultural sector (Source:  Annual Agricultural Report for 2003). 
Wheat The Name of the Policy Measure: Protective Price For the producers of wheat the Government of the Republic of Macedonia prescribes a protective price for soft and durumwheat. 
Legal Grounds:    Law on Trade (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 23/1995 and No. 16/2004)    Law on Commodity Reserves (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 47/87, 13/93 and 68/04). 
Objectives and Description of the Scheme The protective prices are prices at which certain agricultural products are purchased in the government commodity reserves in the cases when their price falls bellow the prescribed protective price. According to the Law on Trade, the purpose of this measure is protection of the producers of wheat from monopolistic behaviour by the milling and processing enterprises and ensuring the stability of the prices of flour and bread. Pursuant to the Law on Trade (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 16/2004) the protective prices may be applied until 29.03.2005.  In accord with the Law on Commodity Reserves (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 47/87, No. 13/93), as an exception, the agricultural food products are not procured through competitive bidding or through request for proposals. Pursuant to the Law on Commodity Reserves (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 68/04), the provision regarding the procurement of agricultural food products at protective prices is abolished and at present the procurement of agricultural food products is conducted in accord with the provisions of the Law on Public Procurement (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 19/2004). For grains (wheat, corn and barley) the agricultural policy will be aimed at financial support of the producers of cereals, based on hectares. For the wheat and the barley the non-repayable aid based on hectares is applied from 2004, pursuant to the Law on Instigation of Development of the Agriculture (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 24/92, 32/92, 23/92, 78/93 and 14/96). 
Eligibility Criteria for Use of the Measure: Delivered wheat by the  wheat producers  to the milling and processing enterprises.  
Basis for Payments and Regional Differentiation: (also the basis for establishing the regions) During the calculation of the protective price of the wheat the following provision was taken in consideration – the protective price of the wheat for every subsequent year should not surpass 70% of the three-year average world prices increased by three-year average transportation costs and handling charges to Skopje. This mechanism is agreed with the World Bank. The protective price is prescribed for all producers of wheat in the country without regional differentiation. Prescribed protective prices for soft and durum wheat for the period 1999-2003 in MKD/kg 
Year Prescribed protective prices for soft wheat Prescribed protective prices for durum wheat 1999 10.00 12.00 2000 10.00 12.00 2001 10.50 12.50 2002 10.50 12.50 2003 10.50 12.50 
Administration of the Schemes The Government of the Republic of Macedonia prescribes the protective price with a Decision, on proposal from the Ministry of Economy in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy. The protective price of wheat in 2004 was set by taking into consideration, among other things, the costs for production of wheat in the country. 
TOBACCO 
The Name of the Policy Measure: Protective Price of Tobacco 
Legal Grounds: 
  Law on Trade (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 23/1995 and No. 16/2004)   Law on Tobacco (“Official Gazette of RM” No.. 69/1996 and 15/1998) 
Objectives and General Description of the Scheme Pursuant to the Law on Trade, the purpose of this measure is protection of the producers from monopolistic behaviour of the enterprises – purchasers of tobacco - and ensuring the stability of the prices of tobacco. Pursuant to the Law on Trade (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 16/2004) the protective prices may be applied until 29.03.2005.  In accord with the Law on Tobacco, the tobacco as a good of common interest was financed by the state through funds from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. These funds were used in order to place, in the government commodity reserves, the tobacco that was not purchased due to inability of the purchaser to pay as a result of bankruptcy or  liquidation. 
Aim 
Protection of the producers of oriental small-leafed aromatic types of tobaccos in the Republic of Macedonia,  ensuring stability and competitiveness on the domestic and foreign tobacco market.  The protective price represents a base for establishing the purchasing prices differentiated by types and classes of tobaccos during the signing of contracts for production and purchase of tobacco between the producers and the tobacco enterprises. 
Basis for Payments

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- At its congress Saturday (May 12th), the main Croat party, the Croatian Democratic Union BiH (HDZ BiH), re-elected Dragan Covic as party chairman. Covic, a former Croat member of the BiH presidency, said he would work for constitutional changes that would strengthen the rights of the Croat community. He said that the present two-entity model divides the country into Bosniak and Serb parts, excluding the Croat community. The HDZ BiH also decided to double the term of the party chairman, from two years to four.
In other news, the international community's new representative for Srebrenica, Clifford Bond, met on Friday with BiH Presidency Chairman Nebojsa Radmanovic and Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik. Bond said the situation in Srebrenica is directly connected to the fighting and crimes committed there more than a decade ago. He added that little has been done to help residents find work and rebuild their lives. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 13/05/07; Fena - 12/05/07; Fena, RTRS, PBS - 11/05/07)

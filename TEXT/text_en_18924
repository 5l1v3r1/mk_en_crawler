SREBRENICA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney is calling for measures to improve the quality of life in Srebrenica. Meeting with Srebrenica municipal councillors on Tuesday (April 3rd), McElhaney insisted that with the help of the Republika Srpska (RS) government and the international community, all issues could be resolved. The town council recently began seeking separate status for Srebrenica, outside the jurisdiction of RS. 
In Sarajevo, meanwhile, a two-day conference of young politicians from Croatia, Serbia and BiH opened on Tuesday. The event aims to improve regional co-operation and to educate young politicians about multiethnic tolerance and teamwork. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 04/04/07; RTRS, PBS - 03/04/07)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- As expected, the US administration has officially granted the status of functioning market economy to Romania, effective Tuesday (11 March). The move liberalises access of Romanian exporters to the US market and should encourage US investments in Romania. Also Monday, the Romanian government launched a programme to meet EU criteria for a functioning market economy, hoping to receive that status in the fall. (Rompres, Mediafax - 11/03/03)

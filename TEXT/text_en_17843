BELGRADE, Serbia -- Outgoing Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, leader of the ruling Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), is using Kosovo as an excuse to postpone coalition negotiations, says Bozidar Djelic, former finance minister and the Democratic Party's (DS) candidate for prime minister. He told Blic on Friday (February 23rd) that consultations on the new government could proceed simultaneously with the Kosovo status talks under way in Vienna, as parliament has passed a resolution demonstrating unity over the Kosovo issue. Asked whether DS -- the strongest party in the democratic bloc -- might allow Kostunica to keep his job, Djelic indicated such a scenario is unlikely. (Blic, Vecernje Novosti - 23/02/07)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Movement for Rights and Freedom (MRF), part of the ruling coalition, gave an ultimatum to Parliamentary Speaker Georgi Pirinski of the ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) on Tuesday (January 29th), demanding that journalists and guests be given access to parliament. Pirinski has moved to limit the access on the grounds that journalists were interfering with parliamentary discussions. 
The MRF has warned it will begin consultations with other parliamentary groups with the goal of changing National Assembly rules, if Pirinski does not remove the restrictions. It says will also seek a reduction in the parliamentary speaker's authority. A split with the BSP over the issue could raise alarms about the future of the ruling coalition.

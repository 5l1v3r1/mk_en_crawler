PARIS, France -- President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Tuesday (May 5th) the EU should create a common economic and security space with Turkey as an alternative to Turkey's membership in the Union, media reported. "There are countries, such as Turkey, which are bound to be associated to Europe as tightly as possible, but which should not become full members," he said. Instead of full membership, he proposed a reinforced partnership in the economy and security sectors, which the Union could also extend to Russia. The EU "must cease to dilute itself in endless enlargement" and should not make promises to Turkey that it will never be able to keep, Sarkozy warned. Turkey began EU membership talks in October 2005 but has so far opened only ten of the 35 negotiation chapters. (Hurriyet, Anadolu news agency, AP, EUObserver - 06/05/09)

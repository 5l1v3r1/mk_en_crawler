TIRANA, Albania -- A study by Transparency International (TI) Albania suggests that the country's various political parties are hiding the bulk of their financial sources. By law, parties are required to report to the Central Electoral Commission, but it does not have the right to investigate the accuracy of financial declarations. 
TI said that, for example, the two biggest parties -- the ruling Democratic Party and the main opposition Socialist Party -- reported they spent 259,000 euros and 330,000 euros respectively on the latest municipal elections. Each said that around 50% of the funding came from the state budget, while the rest was from private contributors, who were not identified. TI suggests the drafting of a new law that would force parties to specifically name funding sources. (24-ore, Kohajone, Korrieri, VizionPlus, Shqip - 29/04/07)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan dismissed on Sunday (February 18th) running speculation about Turkey's next parliamentary elections being held ahead of schedule, in September, instead of November. While insisting the government has not changed its mind, he suggested the issue could be discussed after the presidential election in May. (Sabah, Milliyet - 19/02/07)

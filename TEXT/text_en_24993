PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A virtual group of young hackers, Kosovo Hackers Group, attacked the EULEX website on Saturday (August 29th) in response to an announced agreement on police co-operation that EULEX intends to sign with Serbia. The group, which has a history of hacker attacks containing political messages, placed a double-headed Albanian eagle on the EU-mission's website and left a message reading "You cannot sell our country back to Serbia. We, Kosovo's youth, are tired of all the lies. EULEX signs agreement to destroy the future of Kosovo." Pristina institutions oppose the proposed agreement between Serbia and EULEX, arguing that it is not within the mission's mandate to take such actions.

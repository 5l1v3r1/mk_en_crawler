PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UN police in Kosovo are investigating the possible involvement of Kosovo police officers in a bomb blast last week that killed two people. Veton Elshani, a spokesperson for the Kosovo Police Service, said on Monday (October 1st) that police are investigating seven cars from a station in the southern town of Urosevac that witnesses say were on the scene shortly before the bomb went off. Elshani conceded the attack may have been related to the August murder of Kosovo policeman Triumf Riza. (Balkanweb, Tanjug, RFE, Reuters, RTK, Kosovapress, Kosovalive, B92 - 01/10/07)

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR troops on Wednesday (16 June) raided the offices of Telekom Srpska in Banja Luka. A spokesman for the NATO-led peacekeepers described the operation as a routine unannounced inspection. The telecom has been checked in the past for illegal wiretapping.
Also Wednesday, BiH's top international officer, Paddy Ashdown, said that the Bosnian Serb government's acknowledgement of the Srebrenica massacre must be followed by arrests of war crimes suspects. He was visiting Sandici, where the first exhumation of a mass grave identified by the Bosnian Serb authorities is being conducted.

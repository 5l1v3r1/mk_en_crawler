LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Authorities on Wednesday (22 October) arrested and then released Agim Ceku, the former chief of staff of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and current commander of the Kosovo Protection Force. A justice ministry spokesman explained that the arrest had been made on an international warrant issued by Serbia. Ceku was released because under the UN resolution on Kosovo, criminal offences committed there cannot be tried in Serbian courts. In 1999, a court in Nis opened an investigation into Ceku and other KLA leaders accused of genocide against Serbs in the province. News of the arrest sparked angry protests in Pristina.

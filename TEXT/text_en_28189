ATHENS, Greece -- Anti-terror police raided an apartment near the main court in Athens late Monday (April 19th), seizing a cache of weapons believed to be linked to the far-left militant group Revolutionary Struggle. The flat had been rented by a man using false identification. No arrests were made in the operation. The raid came after a similar one late last week, in which 195kg of explosives were found in an alleged Revolutionary Struggle hideout. (AP, ANA-MPA - 20/04/10)

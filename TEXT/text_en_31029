BUDAPEST, Hungary -- The trial of a former Hungarian military officer accused of crimes against civilians in the Serbian town of Novi Sad in 1942 will open on Thursday in Budapest, media reported on Monday (May 2nd). Serbia's war crimes prosecutor's office launched an investigation against Sandor Kepiro in 2008, suspecting he took part in the killing of more than 1,200 Serbs, Jews and Roma people during a raid by Hungarian forces on Novi Sad. Serbian authorities have handed the case over to Hungary, where local prosecutors also opened a probe against the 97-year-old Kepiro. (Beta, B92, Radio Free Europe - 02/05/11)

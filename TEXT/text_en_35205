BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) again dismissed the notion of the Democratic Party (DS) joining the Serbian government. Branislav Ristivojevic, a senior DSS official, told the Novi Sad daily <I>Dnevnik</I> on Sunday (25 April) that DS would not enter the ruling coalition. The minority government, led by Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's DSS, includes the Serbian Renewal Party and G17 Plus. The latter says including DS would bolster stability and credibility.
In other news, local media reported Sunday that the Serbian government and the IMF mission have reached a preliminary agreement, allowing Serbia to receive a $140m loan under a stand-by programme in June. Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic said it would "be positive news to all potential investors". (B92, Tanjug, Dnevnik, Beta - 25/04/04)

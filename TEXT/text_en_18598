TRIPOLI, Libya -- The Tripoli regional court postponed on Sunday (February 11th) the hearing involving five Bulgarian nurses, sentenced to death together with a Palestinian doctor in a controversial HIV infection case. The new hearing stemmed from a slander charged filed against them on behalf of Libyan police, whom the nurses say tortured them into confessing. The slander charges were filed after Bulgaria filed charges in absentia against the Libyan police last month. They have already been acquitted of torture charges in Libya.

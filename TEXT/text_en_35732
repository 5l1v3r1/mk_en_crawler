SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Defence Minister Nikolay Svinarov says Bulgaria will likely ask NATO to provide some extra financing to send more troops to Afghanistan. Sofia offered more than 200 additional troops earlier this week, but says budgetary constraints might delay deployment.
Meanwhile, the finance ministry says it expects to close the regional policy chapter with the EU this week. It is one of three chapters Sofia aims to close by the end of the month.
In other news, police have smashed a major counterfeiting ring with the assistance of the US Secret Service and Europol, authorities in Sofia announced Wednesday (2 June). A total of 95,000 euros in fake bills were seized in police searches of 50 locations in five cities. Europol Director Juergen Storbeck says some of the bills were of such high quality that ATMs in Europe could not detect them. Fifteen suspects have been arrested.

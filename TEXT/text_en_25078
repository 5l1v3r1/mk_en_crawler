PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) insisted on Thursday (October 29th) that the government should act soon to address the financial and editorial situation at public broadcaster RTK. The week began with the EBU criticising Prime Minister Hashim Thaci for turning the station into a "media arm of the ruling party". Thaci sent a letter to the EBU, citing the RTK's achievements and its balanced reporting. EBU Director Jean Reveillon welcomed the letter, but said improvements are essential in order for the EBU to continue its contract with the RTK, in light of what the EBU describes as continuing political and economic interference.

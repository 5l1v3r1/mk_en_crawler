BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele voiced concern Tuesday (March 15th) about the political deadlock in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the failure of political leaders to agree on government formation. The two officials called on the key players to overcome their differences and voiced support for mediation efforts by High Representative Valentin Inzko. "Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot afford to lose more time. The political leaders must urgently address EU-related reforms as a matter of priority," the two officials said in a joint statement.

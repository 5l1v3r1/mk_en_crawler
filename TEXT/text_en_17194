ANKARA, Turkey â€“ In a statement, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) announced what it described as a unilateral ceasefire as of Sunday (1 October). However, it said the duration of the ceasefire would depend on future contacts between the PKK and the authorities in Ankara. It also left the door open for using arms in retaliation for activities by the Turkish military. Earlier in the week, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan refused a PKK call for both sides to observe a ceasefire. (AFP, Bloomberg, Focus, Zaman, Cihan, Reuters - 01/10/06; AP - 30/09/06)

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Ramush Haradinaj, former prime minister of Kosovo and former Kosovo Liberation Army commander, was acquitted on Thursday (April 3rd) of all charges he faced, including the torture, rape and murder of Serbs and ethnic Albanian collaborators a decade ago. The verdict was a blow to prosecutors, who had sought 25-year prison sentences for Haradinaj and his two co-defendants. One of them, Idriz Balaj, was also cleared of all charges, while the second, Lahi Brahimaj, was sentenced to six years in prison for his involvement in the torture of war prisoners at the Jablanica detention centre.
In Serbia, parties across the political spectrum condemned the verdict. Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, who heads the Serbian Democratic Party, said Haradinaj's acquittal makes a "mockery of innocent victims". Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic said it proves the time has come to close down the UN tribunal. (Koha Jone - 04/04/08; AFP, Blic, Tanjug, B92, Kosovalive, RTK, BalkanWeb - 03/04/08)

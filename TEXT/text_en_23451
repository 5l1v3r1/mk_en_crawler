PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbs in Mitrovica and KFOR commanders agreed on Tuesday (April 28th) that peacekeeping troops blocking the roads to the Brdjani district will withdraw. KFOR personnel will leave, while Serbs and Albanians, involved in sporadic clashes since Friday, will be able to return to their homes. Tensions rose when several Albanian families tried to start restoring houses in a disputed area near the unofficial border that separates the divided town of Mitrovica into the Serb-dominated north and the Albanian-dominated south.
In other news, the Independent Judicial and Prosecutorial Commission has begun re-appointing judges and prosecutors, according to local media reports Wednesday. The aim is to remove unprofessional, corrupt officials or judicial staff members with dubious pasts. The process is expected to take a month.

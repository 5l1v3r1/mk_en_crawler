PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- The government adopted a declaration Wednesday (11 December) rejecting the text of the new constitutional charter for the future Yugoslav federation. Specifically, it opposes a section of the preamble which states that Kosovo is part of Serbia. Agriculture Minister Goran Bogdanovic, the only Serb in the cabinet, was the sole dissenter. The majority in the cabinet seeks independence for the province. (B92, Tanjug - 11/12/02)

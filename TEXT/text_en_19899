BELGRADE, Serbia -- Three unions representing employees in Serbia's education sector launched a partial strike Monday (November 19th), holding classes for 30 minutes instead of the usual 45. The teachers are demanding an approximately 20% wage hike in 2008. The government is reportedly offering only a 5% increase towards the end of next year. Education Minister Zoran Loncar noted that only 200 schools, or 11% of the total, took part in the strike, saying this shows the education sector understands that the government has only limited room for salary increases. According to the unions, however, 415 schools are on strike. Administrative employees in the judicial sector went on strike last week. (Blic - 20/11/07; B92, RTS - 19/11/07)

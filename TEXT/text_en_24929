ANKARA, Turkey -- The country launched its first 24-hour Kurdish-language TV channel on Thursday (January 1st). State-run news channel TRT-6 went on the air with traditional Kurdish dancing and a concert. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan kicked off the programming, becoming the first-ever Turkish leader to speak in Kurdish when he told a press conference "May TRT-6 be beneficial." The channel will compete for fans of the Kurdish-language Roj TV, a satellite station based in Belgium and popular among Turkey's 14 million Kurds. Turkey has often criticised Roj TV for broadcasting statements by the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). (Hurriyet, CNN Turk, Euronews, VOA, Anadolu news agency, NTV - 01/01/09)

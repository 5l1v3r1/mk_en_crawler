The vice governor of Serbia's central bank, Dejan Simic, has been arrested after reportedly taking a 100,000-euro bribe. According to police, Simic was arrested in his apartment along with a senior official of the Socialist Party of Serbia, Vladimir Zagradjanin. Both were placed in 48-hour custody. 
Media reports said Simic took the money in exchange for intervening on behalf of a Belgrade-based bank that is in bankruptcy proceedings. Zagradjanin -- a close associate of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic -- allegedly was at Simic's apartment in order to deliver the money. 
Commenting on the arrests, Serbian Interior Minister Dragan Jocic said they demonstrated the government's determination to tackle corruption and organised crime. "All those who have violated the law must be brought to justice, with no exceptions," Jocic said. 
But Simic's lawyer, Sava Andjelkovic, has rejected the allegations, charging that "certain men have abused their official position and authority" in arresting his client. 
Meanwhile, Milorad Vucelic of the Socialist Party said Zagradjanin was on "personal business" and that the arrest had no connection with his party, whose parliamentary support is crucial to the minority government of Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica. 
The National Bank of Serbia said it lacks official information about the reasons for Simic's detention. It also said Simic, appointed in September 2004, was doing a very good job of controlling the banking sector. 
Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic has vowed that 2006 would see a decisive fight against corruption and organised crime.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- A new poll by the International Republican Institute finds two-thirds of the public supports co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. A similar number of respondents said local courts should be allowed to rule on indictments issued by the tribunal.
In other news, tribunal spokeswoman Florence Hartmann says prosecutors have no plans to issue new indictments for the time being. Her comment Wednesday (26 March) was in response to Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic, who suggested the tribunal was likely to issue six or seven more indictments.

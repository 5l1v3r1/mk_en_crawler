NEW YORK, United States -- Representatives of Kosovo will most probably not be allowed to attend an October 8th UN General Assembly discussion of Serbia's initiative to question the legality of Kosovo's self-declared independence at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), General Assembly President Miguel d'Escoto Brockman said in New York on Friday (October 3rd). Brockman cited procedural regulations as the reason for barring representatives of Kosovo, which does not belong to the UN. (B92, Makfax, DPA, Blic, Tanjug - 04/10/08)

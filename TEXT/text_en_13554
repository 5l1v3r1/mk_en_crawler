SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Despite signs of early progress, participants in the BiH constitutional reform negotiations remain divided on the issue of reshaping the presidency. After a meeting Wednesday (21 December) in Sarajevo among the eight main political parties, BiH Presidency member Sulejman Tihic told reporters that officials could not agree on whether to introduce the concept of a single president or remain with the current tripartite presidency. He says the parties from Republika Srpska oppose the idea of a single president.
Also Wednesday, Principal Deputy High Representative Lawrence Butler visited Banja Luka and said he was satisfied with what he heard in talks with leaders there. Butler said he expects concrete progress in a number of legislative issues early next year, including amendments to laws on consumer protection and bank supervision.
In other news, High Representative Paddy Ashdown announced on Wednesday that Italian Brigadier-General Vincenzo Coppola, who heads the EU Police Mission in BiH starting on 1 January, will also serve as the international member of the BiH Police Reform Directorate's Steering Board. Ashdown urged BiH authorities to nominate the BiH members of the board as soon as possible. (Nezavisne novine, Dnevni avaz - 22/12/05; RS Government Web site, Fena, PBS BiH - 21/12/05)

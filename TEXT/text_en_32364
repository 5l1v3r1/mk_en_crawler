SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Evidence has been found that the Republika Srpska (RS) Army spied on NATO and the Muslim-Croat entity, in violation of the Dayton accords, a spokesman for High Representative Paddy Ashdown said Saturday (29 March). Julian Braithwaite said the RS military was "caught red-handed engaged in espionage activities against other institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the international community". Material proving the illegal surveillance was apparently found during raids by SFOR troops on three intelligence facilities. Additional reports suggest the RS may have also spied on neighbouring Croatia. The reports prompted a meeting Saturday between BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic and the Croatian Ambassador to BiH, Josip Vrbosic. (AP, AFP, Croatian Radio, HINA, BBC - 29/03/2003)

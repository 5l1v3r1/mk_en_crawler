WASHINGTON, United States -- State Department Spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday (17 November) that democracy in Serbia is not dead, despite the strong showing by a radical nationalist in Sunday's failed presidential election. "You might call it a poison pill for democracy, but the fact is democracy's up and running and functioning in Serbia anyway," he said. Boucher went on to explain that a boycott by two major pro-democracy parties led to low voter turnout. That exaggerated the results of the Serbian Radical Party, whose supporters consistently turn out to vote. Boucher noted that the 28 December parliamentary elections would be a better gauge of the popularity of the various political parties. Also Monday, the OSCE reiterated calls for Serbia to change its 50 per cent turnout threshold, which has now foiled three election attempts. (AFP, Beta, B92, BBC - 17/11/03)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The foreign ministry voiced expectations on Wednesday (17 May) that the restoration of full diplomatic ties between the United States and Libya earlier this week would have a positive impact on the case of five Bulgarian nurses facing trial again next month in Libya. Ministry spokesman Dimitar Tsanchev said at a news conference that Sofia hoped that the decision of the US government would show Libya that solutions to difficult problems could be found through dialogue and goodwill. Washington has recently called on Tripoli to release the five nurses and one Palestinian doctor, all of whom are accused of infecting children with the HIV virus. (BNR, Xinhua - 18/05/06)

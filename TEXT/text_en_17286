PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The public debate period on the country's draft constitution ends on Monday (May 28th). Since it began on April 4th, around 70 individuals and institutions have suggested changes, according to Slobodan Dragovic, the secretary of Parliament's constitutional committee. After the public debate, the committee will adopt the final proposal for a new constitution, which will then be put to another vote in Parliament within 15 days. Framing the constitution has been a key task since the republic declared independence last summer.
In other news, Defence Minister Boro Vucinic announced on Sunday that his ministry would be submitting an important package of draft laws, including a new defence strategy, to the government for approval. He said they are essential to transforming the army, in line with the country's Euro-Atlantic integration bid. (Vijesti - 28/05/07; Pobjeda - 27/05/07; RTCG, Mina - 26/05/07)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Activist Sinisa Vucinic received a six-month suspended jail sentence Wednesday (October 7th) for making veiled death threats against Zarko Korac, president of the opposition Social Democratic Union, and Milos Vasic, a journalist with the weekly Vreme. Vucinic, the self-described president of the Republika Srpska Serb Chetnik Movement initiative committee, told Bosnian Serb media in July that Korac and Vasic could face the same fate as their friend, former Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, who was assassinated in Belgrade in March 2003. Shortly after making the statement, Vucinic said he didn't mean to offend or threaten anyone and apologised to both Korac and Vasic. (Tanjug, B92, Beta, RTS, AP - 07/10/09)

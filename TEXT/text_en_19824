ANKARA, Turkey -- A court has charged an alleged member of a youth chapter of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) with complicity in last week's attempt to blow up a multistory parking lot in downtown Ankara. The young man, reportedly a college student, was arrested in Eskisehir on Tuesday (September 18th). According to local media, he provided one of the SIM cards for three mobile phones that were to be used to detonate the 600kg bomb. He apparently took the card from another suspect who has also been indicted. Police are questioning several other people in Ankara and in the province of Van but prosecutors have not formally charged any other suspects. 
PKK militants, meanwhile, shot a Turkish soldier dead in an attack on a military post near the city of Bitlis late on Tuesday. Another soldier was injured in the gunfight. (AP, AFP, Anatolia - 19/09/07)

Damjanovic was convicted in connection with the killing, torture and inhumane treatment of Bosniak civilians in Vogosec in 1992-1993. The BiH Court found him responsible for the murder of his former teacher, Zahid Barucija, but acquitted him of involvement in the killing of a Bosniak couple, Muharem and Mejra Hodzic.

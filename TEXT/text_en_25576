TIRANA, Albania -- The Constitutional Court issued a detailed report Tuesday (March 23rd) explaining that the controversial lustration law violates the constitution. The legislation is aimed at ensuring former members of the communist-era secret police services do not occupy senior positions. Parliament passed the law in December 2008, despite criticism from the international community. (Gazeta Shqiptare, Shekulli, Shqip - 24/03/10; Lajmifundit, Balkan Web, Alsat - 23/03/10)

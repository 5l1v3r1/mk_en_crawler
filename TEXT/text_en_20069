ANKARA, Turkey -- Seven illegal migrants drowned on Monday (December 17th) after their boat sank in the Aegean Sea near the resort of Bodrum. The Coast Guard said nine of those aboard, eight migrants and one Turkish national, managed to swim to shore. In all, 17 people were on board, coming from Afghanistan, Mauritania and the Palestinian territories. Preliminary findings suggest it sank because it was overloaded. Last week, a similar incident took the lives of 50 illegal migrants.
Meanwhile, 59 illegal migrants were arrested by gendarmerie and border police teams in the Turkish province of Edirne. The migrants were from the Palestinian territories, Burma and Iraq. (Anadolu news agency, CNN Turk, A1, MIA, DHA, Sabah, Reuters, AP - 17/12/07)

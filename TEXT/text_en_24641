ANKARA, Turkey -- A court has charged eight suspects with the killing of 44 people at a wedding party in the southeastern province of Mardin, Governor Hasan Duruer said on Wednesday (May 6th). The suspects were among the ten people detained after Monday's massacre in the village of Bilge, where a group of masked gunmen opened fire. Among the dead were the bride and the groom, six children and three pregnant women. A blood feud between two families from the village apparently sparked the attack. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the massacre as "atrocious". "No kind of tradition can justify this killing," he said.

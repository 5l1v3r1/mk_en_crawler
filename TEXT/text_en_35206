SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Gezim Ostreni, who staged an unsuccessful bid for president earlier this month, urged ethnic Albanian voters to turn out for Wednesday's (28 April) presidential runoff. Last week, Ostreni's Democratic Union for Integration officially threw its support behind Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski of the ruling SDSM. Ostreni said a large turnout by ethnic Albanians would counter accusations that they are trying to obstruct the peace process.
In other news, Macedonia's Prosecution Office announced Sunday that it has established a special department to fight organised crime. The unit would be comprised of eight to ten prosecutors who would report directly to the chief prosecutor. (Vest - 26/04/04; A1 TV - 25/04/04)

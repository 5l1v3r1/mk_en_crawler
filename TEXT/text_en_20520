ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader was quoted as telling the Zagreb-based Jutarnji List newspaper on Saturday (February 9th) that the support Serbian presidential candidate Tomislav Nikolic received in the runoff last weekend is another reason to support Croatia's NATO accession. Sanader was quoted as saying in the interview that the number of votes Nikolic won should be a source of concern not only in Serbia, but in Europe as a whole. The controversial remarks were later rejected by the Croatian government. Sanader "has had absolutely no contacts with the author of the interview, Jutarnji List editor Davor Butkovic, and therefore it is impossible for him to have given the interview", the government said, criticising the fabricated interview as a highly unprofessional and unethical. The government also warns it could have negative consequences on Croatia's democratic progress. (Makfax, HRT, Jutarnji List, Vecernji List, HINA, Beta - 09/02/08)

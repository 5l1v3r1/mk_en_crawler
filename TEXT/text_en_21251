THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A Serb charged with contempt of court pled not guilty on Thursday (May 29th) at The Hague war crimes tribunal. Ljubisa Petkovic, 56, was charged after refusing to testify in April at the trial of Serbian ultranationalist leader Vojislav Seselj. Petkovic was commander of the war staff of Seselj's Serbian Radical Party in 1991. Police arrested him on Wednesday and transferred him to The Hague's detention unit. Seselj is on trial for incitement of nationalism and of ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, along with murder, torture, imprisonment and deportation.

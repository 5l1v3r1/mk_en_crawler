BELGRADE, Serbia -- UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte wrapped up a two-day visit to Belgrade on Tuesday (October 3rd). The focus was on Serbia's level of co-operation with The Hague tribunal and implementation of the government's action plan to apprehend remaining war crimes fugitives, including Ratko Mladic.
Last week, del Ponte said that she was dissatisfied with results on both fronts. She is to submit a detailed report to the EU on Serbia's efforts in mid-October. (Blic, Danas, Glas javnosti - 03/10/06; Beta - 02/10/06)

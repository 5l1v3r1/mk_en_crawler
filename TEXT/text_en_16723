SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government endorsed on Wednesday (6 September) a draft law on police, considered a key requirement for EU integration. Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska noted that due to the importance of the legislation, the ruling VMRO-DPMNE would seek to ensure a broad political consensus. Attempts by the former government to pass the law failed due to a disagreement with its coalition partner, the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union of Integration. 
Also on Wednesday, President Branko Crvenkovski, Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki met to discuss national priorities. They agreed that these include Euro-Atlantic integration, resolving the name dispute with Greece and completing the border demarcation with Kosovo.

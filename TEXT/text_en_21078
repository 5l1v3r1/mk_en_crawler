SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party nominated retired General Brigo Asparuhov as its candidate for mayor of Sofia on Friday (August 31st) after hours of debate. Asparuhov, a former intelligence chief who worked in the communist-era security services, was a key figure in a controversy ahead of Bulgaria's 2004 NATO accession. After then-Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg nominated him to serve as a security adviser, several countries in the West said his appointment would damage Bulgaria's image. 
Asparuhov will now face off against the clear front-runner, incumbent Boyko Borisov, in the October 28th local elections. (Sega, 24 chasa - 03/09/07; Sofia news agency - 01/09/07; Darik, Dnevnik, Netinfo, Mediapool - 31/08/07)

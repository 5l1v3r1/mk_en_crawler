LONDON, United Kingdom -- Romanian President Ion Iliescu said Friday (10 September) his country had made significant progress in implementing EU reforms over the past few years, resulting in a real chance to close accession talks with the Union by the end of this year. During a visit to London, Iliescu said the government is determined to accelerate reforms in all fields to achieve EU standards. Noting that Bucharest has been holding talks on the last accession chapters, he said he expects the accession treaty would be signed in the first half of 2005. Iliescu added that British Prime Minister Tony Blair had pledged his country's support for those accession efforts. (Rompres, CNN - 10/09/04)

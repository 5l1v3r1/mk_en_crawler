BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Leaders from across southeast Europe came to Belgrade earlier this week, for a summit on a wide-range of regional issues. On the sidelines, Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou expressed support Tuesday (8 April) for journalists working in Baghdad, as well as EU concern over casualties among their ranks.
Also at the summit, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy expressed confidence that his country would enter the EU in 2007, adding that he expects accession talks to be completed by the end of this year. Papandreou noted that the technical delay in negotiations stemmed from the busy schedule of EU diplomats, given the war in Iraq, but said they would be overcome. Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov received the same assurances during his visit to Greece, which holds the rotating EU presidency.

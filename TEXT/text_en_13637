ATHENS, Greece -- EU Commissioner for European Regional Policy Danuta Huebner on Friday (21 October) called on Greece to speed up activities and make up for delays in EU-backed public work and construction projects, warning that otherwise the country risked losing EU funds. Greece has so far used only 35 per cent of the 15 billion euros endorsed by the EU under a financial programme set to expire at the end of 2006, Huebner warned. In addition, the commissioner added, Greece risks losing around 200m euros from the EU Cohesion Fund, which backs environmental and transport programmes.

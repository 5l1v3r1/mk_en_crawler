SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko lifted sanctions against four individuals on Friday (August 21st) who were removed from their posts in June 2004 for obstructing the Dayton Peace Accords implementation. The Office of High Representative said the measure does not mean Dragan Kalinic, Savo Krunic, Jovo Kosmajac and Nemanja Vasic will be spared applicable legal proceedings nor will be reinstated to their previous positions. 
Meanwhile, Inzko told the Vienna-based newspaper Standard that BiH will likely not enter the EU before 2014. He declined to mention a specific timeframe. "The EU's conditions are more concrete than they are generally believed to be, and strategies for the wrapping up the talks are clear. There are clear criteria for visa liberalisation for all countries. Of 174 points, BiH has implemented around 150," Inzko said.

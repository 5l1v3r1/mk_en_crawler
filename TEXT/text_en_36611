ZAGREB, Croatia -- Former Bosnian Croat General Tihomir Blaskic was released from the UN tribunal's detention centre and travelled to Zagreb on Monday (2 August). He had served more than eight years of his 45-year sentence before the tribunal's appeals chamber last week threw out all but three of the 19 counts on which he had been convicted. Blaskic was cleared of responsibility for the massacre of Muslims in the village of Ahmici in 1993 after Croatia provided new evidence that had been kept secret by the regime of the late Franjo Tudjman.
In other news, the UN tribunal announced Monday that it would grant provisional release pending trial to six former Bosnian Croat political and military leaders. All six -- Jadranko Prlic, Bruno Stojic, Slobodan Praljak, Milivoj Petkovic, Valentin Coric and Berlisav Pusic -- are accused of engaging in a joint criminal enterprise to clear areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina of Muslims and other non-Croats. They surrendered to the tribunal in April. (Vecenji List, Pincom.info - 03/08/04; BBC, AFP, ICTY press release, FENA, HINA - 02/08/04)

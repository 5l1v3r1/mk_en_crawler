BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer repeated on Friday (10 June) a call for arresting wartime Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic as soon as possible. During a news conference in Brussels, the NATO chief said it was "crystal clear that the sooner he [Mladic] is in The Hague, the better". De Hoop Scheffer added that Radovan Karadzic -- another top war crimes indictee -- should not be able to hide forever.

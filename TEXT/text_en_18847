SOFIA, Bulgaria -- British Minister for Europe Geoff Hoon began a two-day visit to Bulgaria on Tuesday (February 6th), as part of a regional tour that includes the other EU newcomer, Romania. After arriving in Sofia, Hoon met with Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin about bilateral ties, strategic partnerships within the EU, and the case of the five Bulgarian nurses, sentenced to death in Libya in a disputed HIV infection case. At a joint news conference afterwards, Hoon said their case must be resolved solely via diplomatic means. He added that there must be no discussion of exchanging the nurses for a Libyan currently serving a life sentence for the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am plane over Lockerbie, Scotland.

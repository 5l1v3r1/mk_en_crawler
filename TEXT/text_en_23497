SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) --High Representative Valentin Inzko used his Bonn powers on Wednesday (July 29th) to extend stopgap spending for the city of Mostar from April 1st to September 30th because the city council has failed to pass a budget. The decision will allow public workers to receive their salaries and benefits. Excluded, however, are the salaries of city council members. They will be paid only after they pass a budget and agree on a new mayor. The post has been vacant for months, because council members have been unable to come up with a consensus candidate. That deadlock and the budget stalemate have "inflicted Mostar city residents with unnecessary suffering and aggravation, and placed lives at risk", Inzko stressed. Civil servants threatened to go on strike to demand back pay, unless Inzko intervened. (Dnevni Avaz, Fena, BHRT, RTRS, OHR - 29/07/09)

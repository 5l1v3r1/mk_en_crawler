ANKARA, Turkey -- A controversial trial opens on Monday (October 20th), involving 86 defendants suspected of belonging to the shadowy separatist group Ergenekon. It allegedly plotted to topple the country's pro-Islamic government. Among the defendants are retired army officers, leftist politicians, members of secularist associations, journalists, and academics who oppose the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). They allegedly formed an illegal organisation that planned to incite chaos and disorder to trigger a military coup against the AKP government. Prosecutors say the group is responsible for at least two armed attacks in Turkey. They also accuse the defendants of planning to assassinate several prominent figures, including Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Nobel laureate writer Orhan Pamuk.

ATHENS, Greece -- The foreign ministry confirmed late on Monday (April 4th) the suspension of operations at its embassy in Tripoli due to ongoing unrest. For now, Hungary, the current holder of the rotating EU presidency, will represent Athens' interest in Libya. 
Separately, a Turkish humanitarian ship carrying hundreds of Libyans injured in the violence arrived in Turkey on Tuesday. The vessel left Misrata on Sunday with 321 wounded and 108 Libyans accompanying them, leaving behind thousands who had gathered, pleading to be evacuated. The boat also brought dozens of foreigners and Turks. (Zaman, Hurriyet, Anadolu news agency - 05/04/11; ANA-MPA, Eleftherotypia, Kathimerini - 05/03/11)

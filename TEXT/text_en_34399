BUCHAREST, Romania -- The first results of the weekend referendum on the new constitution suggest overwhelming support for the document, according to the Central Electoral Bureau (BEC). According to partial results presented by BEC on Monday (20 October), 91 per cent of voters backed the amended constitution, which is aimed at easing EU integration. Nearly 8 per cent opposed it. The rest of the votes were nullified. Turnout was 55.7 per cent, surpassing the required threshold for validity. The centrist opposition and several civic organisations contested the results, accusing the ruling Social Democrat Party of manipulating the referendum.

TIRANA, Albania -- Albania's 2.8 million voters headed to the polls on Sunday (3 July) to elect 140 deputies for the country's next parliament. A total of 1,253 candidates belonging to 27 parties and coalitions are competing in the election, which is being seen as a crucial test of Albania's democratisation and a signal of the country's prospects for joining the EU and NATO.
Some 400 foreign and 3,500 Albanian observers are monitoring the vote. The latest polls put Sali Berisha's Democrats in a dead heat with Prime Minister Fatos Nano's Socialists, showing the conservatives with 35 per cent of the vote, compared to 34 per cent for the Socialists.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic appeared for the resumption of his trial at the UN war crimes tribunal Monday (March 1st). In his opening statement, he defended the Bosnian Serbs' cause in the war, insisting that he and his people acted in self-defence against a core group of Muslims who sought to dominate Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1992-1995 BiH conflict, Karadzic is conducting his own defence. His boycott of the trial last fall forced a postponement until now. (BBC, Reuters, AP - 01/03/10)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Teodor Atanasiu, whom President Traian Basescu suspended as defence minister earlier this week, announced on Wednesday (13 September) that he would appeal the move in court. Atanasiu says prosecutors should have first conducted a preliminary inquiry and provided Basescu with a report recommending his temporary removal. Atanasiu says Basescu's move was political, stemming from the minister's recent proposal to withdraw Romanian troops from Iraq. According to Basescu, however, it was in response to criminal proceedings launched by prosecutors last week. They are seeking to determine if Atanasiu revealed classified information about the location of Romanian troops abroad. (Azi - 14/09/06; Rompres, Mediafax - 13/09/06)

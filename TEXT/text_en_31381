STRASBOURG, France -- Arresting former Bosnian Serbian Army commander Gen Ratko Mladic would be a clear sign that Yugoslavia is committed to co-operating on war crimes, says Council of Europe (CoE) Secretary General Walter Schwimmer. At a press conference in Strasbourg Wednesday (29 January), he reiterated that Yugoslavia must fulfil this condition before it enters the CoE. He added that the CoE would hold an open discussion next week on Yugoslavia's efforts to co-operate with the UN tribunal. (Blic - 30/01/03; Tanjug, FoNet - 29/01/03)

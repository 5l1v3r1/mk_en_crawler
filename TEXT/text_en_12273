SOFIA, Bulgaria -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has sent warning letters to Bulgaria and Romania, voicing the European Commission's (EC) dissatisfaction with the pace of EU accession-related reforms in the two candidate countries. Announcing the move on Friday (10 June), EC spokeswoman Krisztina Nagy said the letters cite delays in the most critical areas. For Bulgaria, these are the judiciary, agriculture, environment and freedom to provide services. For Romania, they are the free movement of goods, competition, agriculture, taxes, the environment, and justice and home affairs. The Accession Treaties of both countries contain a safeguard clause, under which their entry in the EU -- scheduled for 2007 -- can be postponed by one year unless all reforms are realised.

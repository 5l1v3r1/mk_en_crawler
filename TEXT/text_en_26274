THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Monday (September 14th) ordered former tribunal spokeswoman Florence Hartmann to pay a fine of 7,000 euros for contempt of court. In August 2008, the tribunal accused her of disclosing two confidential court decisions related to the trial of former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic. The documents were discussed in a book and article published by Hartmann in 2007 and 2008. Judge Bakone Moloto, who announced the ruling Monday, said that Hartmann, a journalist, had "knowingly and wilfully interfered with administration of justice". Hartmann, 46, is a French national who served as spokesperson for former chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte from 2000 to 2006. (BBC, DPA, AP, B92, Beta - 14/09/09)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The outgoing cabinet passed a measure Thursday (18 December) extending the visa free regime for Serbia-Montenegro to the end of January, to avoid problems related to New Year's holiday trips. The visa free regime was to expire at the end of December. The government says further arrangements on the bilateral travel regime will follow related EU guidelines. (HINA - 18/12/03)

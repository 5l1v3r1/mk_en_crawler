ATHENS, Greece -- Foreign ministry spokesperson Grigoris Delavekouras said on Monday (October 18th) that security has been tightened at diplomatic missions abroad in light of a recent threat. According to Delavekouras, an unidentified man called the Greek consulate in Los Angeles last week and warned that staff, embassies and consulates will be attacked unless Iranian immigrants in Greece are given asylum. There are currently 46,000 asylum claims in Greece, some of which have been pending for over five years. About 25 Iranian immigrants seeking asylum launched a hunger strike in Greece on Thursday.

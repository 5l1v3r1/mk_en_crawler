SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The EU said on Friday (June 19th) that BiH has violated its commitments under the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) by adopting a controversial law on customs duties, media reported. On Thursday, parliament endorsed the bill, which imposes higher duties on nearly 1,000 items, in a bid to protect domestic production. In a statement, the EU's office in BiH denounced the move and warned it also contradicts the country's commitments under its Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The foreign ministry on Friday (December 31st) denied a media report suggesting Turkey has agreed with the EU to open its ports to Cypriot ships in return for advancing its accession process. "The news of a compromise with the EU â¦ is not true. Our conditions on this issue are known by all," Turkey's chief EU negotiator, Egemen Bagis, was quoted as saying by Anadolu news agency. The statement came after local broadcaster NTV reported that a port in Istanbul or Izmir would be opened to Cypriot vessels if the government in Nicosia agrees to it. The report did not indicate its source. (Reuters, Hurriyet, Anadolu news agency - 31/12/10)

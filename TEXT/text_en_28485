BUCHAREST, Romania -- Civil servants agreed on Thursday (October 14th) to end their mass protest after Finance Minister Gheorghe Ialomitianu offered a compromise solution to their demands. After continuous negotiations that started Wednesday, Ialomitianu promised finance ministry employees that they will receive bonuses for the last two months "on the basis of an analysis conducted by a joint commission". He also promised to propose several amendments to the single wage law, which would provide for the inclusion of bonuses in the base salary of lower paid employees, as well as performance-based bonuses. The protest started on Wednesday when about 200 finance ministry employees walked off their jobs to protest bonus cuts. They were joined by thousands of workers in tax offices and employment agencies across the country. The bonuses were slashed as part of the government's austerity measures.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The House of Representatives on Wednesday (June 4th) rejected a motion filed by Prime Minister Nikola Spiric to dismiss Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj, Deputy Defence Minister Igor Crnadak and Deputy Minister for Civil Affairs Senad Sepic. The vote was 22 to 9 with one abstention. Spiric launched the procedure to dismiss them in early May after the Central Electoral Commission said the three had conflicts of interest, since they or their close relatives had ties to companies that do business with state institutions. Wednesday's vote means all three will keep their jobs. (AFP, RTRS, SRNA, Dnevni Avaz - 04/06/08)

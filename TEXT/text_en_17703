BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prosecutors with the anti-corruption department said on Friday (March 23rd) that they have launched a probe against former Transport Minister Miron Mitrea of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), who is accused of abuse of office. The ministre allegedly allowed valuable land in northern Bucharest to be exchanged for less valuable land, despite a lawsuit that was already in progress. Mitrea is the third member of former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase's cabinet to be investigated for corruption, including Nastase himself. (Mediafax, Rompres - 23/03/07)

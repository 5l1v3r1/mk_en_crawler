SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The cabinet is considering a year-long 2% hike in the Value Added Tax (VAT), to 22%, as part of the new anti-crisis measures, according to local media reports on Monday (March 22nd). This represents a turn-around in fiscal policy, as Finance Minister Simeon Dyankov had previously promised a 2% cut in the standard VAT rate as of 2011, with more cuts expected later. Raising the VAT would boost revenues. To cut spending, the cabinet is considering a 10% across-the-board wage reduction among public workers. (Sega, 24 Chasa - 23/03/10; Darik, Dnevnik - 22/03/10)

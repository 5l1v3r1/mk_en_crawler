Fugitive Croatian General Ante Gotovina's arrest on 7 December is considered likely to help smooth the way for the country's integration into NATO and the EU. Following the arrest, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said that the door to entry into the bloc is now open. 
Meanwhile, an invitation to join NATO is expected during the Alliance's summit in the spring of 2008. In Washington, congressional supporters of NATO membership for Croatia say that with Gotovina's arrest, the main obstacle has disappeared. 
"Of course, the membership will not start automatically, but apprehension of Gotovina was a main barrier," said Representative Elton Gallegly, who co-chairs the Croatian congressional caucus along with Reps. George Radanovich and Peter Viclosky. In November, the caucus proposed Resolution HR 529, which backs Croatia's entry into the Alliance. The sponsors introduced the resolution to the House International Relations Subcommittee on Europe. 
Recently, Croatia presented a national action plan for achieving NATO membership. The plan calls for greater efforts to complete the process of refugee returns and restitution of assets, judicial reform, the fight against corruption and protection of minorities. One key element of the plan -- resolving the Gotovina case -- has now been fulfilled. 
Membership in the Alliance would be an enormous boon to Croatia, analysts say, not only for security reasons but also because of economic benefits. Foreign investment could increase by 20 per cent or more. The membership costs will be about $5.5m, or 1 per cent less than Croatia's military budget. 
According to NATO chief Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, NATO and EU membership constitute the only safe recipe for stability in the Balkans. In pursuit of this goal, Zagreb has teamed up with two other Western Balkan countries -- Albania and Macedonia -- to co-ordinate efforts in meeting the criteria.

TIRANA, Albania -- The secretary-general of the main opposition Socialist Party (SP), parliamentary caucus head Pandeli Majko, has resigned from both posts amid continuing strife within the party. According to media reports Tuesday (April 10th), Majko has not officially announced the reasons for his decision, though it followed a party congress marked by rising tensions between two factions. One backs SP leader Edi Rama, while the other supports former SP chairman Fatos Nano. (Albanian News, Shekulli - 11/04/07; QIK, Top-Channel, Balkanweb, A1 TV - 10/04/07)

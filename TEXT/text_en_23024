SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The opposition plans a new vote of no confidence against the cabinet based on problems with the absorption of EU funds and corruption, the co-chairman of the Bulgarian People's Union, Stefan Sofiyanski, said on Thursday (July 3rd). Opposition parties plan to spend about a week discussing the motion and streamlining their case. Media reports suggest they will launch the move before the regular report by the European Commission (EC) -- due at the end of July -- to avoid parliament taking its summer recess before the vote is held. The EC report is expected to criticise Bulgaria for corruption and misappropriation stemming from the utilisation of EU funds in recent months, as well as for recent scandals that rocked the interior ministry.

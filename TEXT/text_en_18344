BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic, leader of the Democratic Party (DS), denied on Sunday (January 14th) that the DS and the senior ruling Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) of Vojislav Kostunica have cut a deal on distributing cabinet seats after the January 21st parliamentary elections. But Tadic did not rule out the possibility of a DS-led cabinet that would include the DSS and the Liberal Democratic Party, a former DS faction. Tadic again stressed that the party with the most votes must be the one to name the next prime minister. He also stressed the importance of forming a new government as soon as possible after the elections. (B92, Beta - 14/01/07)

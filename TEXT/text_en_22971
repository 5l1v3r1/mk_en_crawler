BUCHAREST, Romania -- The main opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) will hold an extraordinary congress on September 27th to endorse its nominee for prime minister, newspapers reported on Tuesday (September 2nd). Party spokesman Cristian Diaconescu said the PSD will also announce a joint governance platform with its political ally, the Conservative Party. Last week, PSD leader Mircea Geoana said he "wants and can" be prime minister, though the doors seem open to other candidates. (Evenimentul Zilei, Avedarul, Nine O'Clock - 02/09/08)

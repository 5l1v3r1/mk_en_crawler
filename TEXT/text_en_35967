LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Italian Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs Roberto Antonione told the Slovenian newspaper <I>Vecer</I> on Saturday (10 January) that the EU should expand co-operation with Croatia. He argued the EU first enlargement wave should go hand-in-hand with intensified trade and political ties with other countries in Southeast Europe. "We must develop special forms of co-operation with those countries . particularly Croatia, which will be given the role of a neighbouring country of the Union," Antonione said.

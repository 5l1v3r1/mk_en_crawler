ATHENS, Greece -- Prosecutors on Friday (August 22nd) pressed charges against eight people suspected in the kidnapping of Greek businessman George Milonas. Vassilis Paleokostas, one of Greece's most wanted criminals, is among those charged. The suspects, arrested last week, are charged with direct or indirect involvement in the kidnapping, as well as with blackmail, illegal possession of explosives and bombs, and weapons and drugs charges. Milonas, 49, was kidnapped in early June in Thessaloniki. His abductors demanded a huge ransom -- 30m euros, according to some reports. He was held for two weeks. Vassilis Paleokostas, who was on the run for two years after managing to escape Greece's most heavily-guarded prison by helicopter two years ago, was arrested last Wednesday.

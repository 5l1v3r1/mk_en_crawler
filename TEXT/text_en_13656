SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EUFOR Commander Gian Marco Chiarini will reportedly visit Belgrade on Monday (23 January) to discuss bilateral co-operation with Serbia-Montenegro authorities. Saturday's (21 January) edition of the Sarajevo daily Dnevni avaz said the visit is expected to result in the sealing of a deal that would allow transit of EUFOR troops via the federal union's territory in case of regional emergencies. Accords to that effect were concluded between Belgrade and NATO last year. (Dnevni avaz, Tanjug - 21/01/06)

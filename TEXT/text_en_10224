SOFIA, Bulgaria -- EU Affairs Minister Meglena Kuneva said Monday (29 November) that Bulgaria's pairing with Romania in the EU accession process would likely continue through the signing of the accession treaty, expected next spring. Amid increased rumours that the two countries might be separated due to Romania's delay in finalising accession negotiations, Kuneva called for restraint from speculation until the EU leaders' decision next month is known. 
In other news, Defence Minister Nikolay Svinarov said Sunday that the withdrawal of Bulgarian troops from Iraq could be discussed only after January. He said two determining factors are the outcome of the 30 January Iraqi elections and the results of Bulgaria's parliamentary elections next year.

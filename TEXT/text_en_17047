SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling announced on Friday (30 June) that he removed the ban on holding public office for seven more BiH officials -- Edhem Bicakcic, Kemal Brodlija, Enes Cengic, Ramiz Dzaferovic, Elvedin Hrelja, Milos Krstic and Kemal Terzic. They had been sanctioned by Schwarz-Schilling's predecessors for obstructing the Dayton Peace Accords. Lifting the ban gives them the right to participate in BiH's public and political life again.
In other news Friday, BiH officially established a commission to investigate the truth about Sarajevo Serbs still missing from the 1992-1995 conflict, after months of delays. Serb members boycotted parliament to protest the foot-dragging. The panel holds its first session Thursday. (PBS BiH, Nezavisne novine - 01/07/06; PBS BiH - 30/06/06)

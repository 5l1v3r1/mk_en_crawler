TIRANA, Albania -- The finance ministry's office on prevention of money laundering has requested the freezing of a bank account suspected of being linked to al-Qaeda, according to the daily Gazeta Shqiptare. The account is worth 2.4m euros. The newspaper quoted a source Sunday (6 June) as saying that prosecutors are working to determine the origin of the money, the source of the bank account, and the money's final destination. Officials suspect it belongs to a citizen of Jordanian origin, Abdul Latif Saleh. Suspicions arose when a second Jordanian, identified as Hamza Abu Rajan, presented to the bank a special power of attorney for the transfer of 2.4m euros.

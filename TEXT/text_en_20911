LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- EU presidency holder Slovenia on Wednesday (March 5th) became the first Balkan country to recognise Kosovo's independence. Parliament approved the decision by a vote of 57 to four. Slovenia thus became the 15th EU member state to recognise the independence of the former Serbian province. "This is not a decision against Serbia. Slovenia is not doing this for its own sake; we are doing this based on European and international policy," Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel said before the vote. Iceland also recognised Kosovo's independence Wednesday. (Reuters, RIA Novosti, Makfax, B92, RTK, KTV, Reuters - 05/03/08)

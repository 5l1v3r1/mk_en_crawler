SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO Deputy Assistant Secretary General Robert Serry said at a news conference in Sarajevo Tuesday (30 November) that Thursday's transfer of military command in BiH to the EU is a turning point for the Union, NATO and BiH. He described it as a testimony of the great progress achieved in the nine years since the war ended. Serry repeated that NATO is not leaving BiH, as it is establishing a headquarters in Sarajevo.

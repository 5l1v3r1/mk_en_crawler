SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) welcomed Republika Srpska (RS) President Dragan Cavic's decision to dismantle the 410th intelligence unit of the RS Army over a recent illegal spying scandal. OHR spokesman Mario Brkic told reporters Tuesday (15 April) that this decision represented "a first step towards placing intelligence centres in BIH under efficient and strong civil command".
Cavic meanwhile met with SFOR commander Lt Gen William Ward on Tuesday. Afterwards, Cavic said relevant RS institutions and SFOR would work together to fulfil the conditions for BiH's accession to the Partnership for Peace programme. (OHR Sources - 16/04/03; RTRS - 15/04/03)

ANKARA, Turkey -- The constitutional court decided on Friday (December 11th) to ban the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) and to remove two of its members from politics for a period of five years based on their alleged links with militants from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The request to ban DTP was filed in 2007 by chief prosecutor of the country's Supreme Court of Appeals, Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya. The DTP has 21 lawmakers in parliament who said they would withdraw from parliamentary business in protest of the court's decision. The party has denied any links with the PKK. 
The court decision sparked a protest in Diyarbakir on Saturday. Thousands of DTP supporters gathered in front of the party's headquarters throwing firebombs and stones at police, and chanting "Blood for Blood! Revenge!" The police used tear gas to disperse the crowd. A similar rally was held in Istanbul, however, it only attracted about a dozen protestors.
A spokesperson for EU presidency holder Sweden said in a statement that it is concerned about the court's decision. Slamming violence and terrorism, the statement said that banning political parties should be taken only as a last resort. (BBC, NTV, AFP, AP - 11/12/09)

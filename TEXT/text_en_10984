ZAGREB, Croatia -- The 13 candidates in Croatia's presidential election ended their campaigns Thursday (30 December) with a final televised debate. The latest polls suggest that incumbent Stipe Mesic is well ahead of his main rival, Jadranka Kosor of the ruling HDZ party. The winner of Sunday's vote will most likely lead the country into the EU.

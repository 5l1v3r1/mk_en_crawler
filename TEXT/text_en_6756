The 30th edition of the Skopje Jazz Festival welcomed 18 artists over five evenings, divided in several special programmes. The bands came from all over the world, including the US, Turkey, Italy, the Netherlands, Brazil, Sweden, Norway, the Czech Republic and Macedonia. 
On October 19th, the day before the four-day event kicked off, jazz lovers were treated to a pre-festival concert by the Skopje band Sethstat, promoting their fifth album "Korab" together with the Vasil Hadzimanov Trio. 
The official programme started with the sounds of Alessandro Penezzi and Alexandre Ribeiro from Brazil, followed by two-time Grammy winner Wayne Shorter and his quartet. 
The great jazz masters Charles Lloyd New Quartet and Miroslav Vitous performed on the festival's second evening. 
The performance of American guitar player and composer Pat Metheny, composer and producer Nils Petter Molvaer, Turkish instrumental formation Istanbul Sessions, Italian instrumental trio ZU, pianist Vijay Iyer and his trio, Muhal Richard Abrams Trio and many other well-known jazz players marked this year's event. 
The EX, a band from the Netherlands -- which has 25 albums and 1,500 concerts under its belt -- closed the event on October 24th. 
The Skopje Jazz Festival is listed among the biggest cultural events in Macedonia, thanks to the rich musical programme selected by festival director Oliver Belopeta. 
For residents of Skopje, the festival has become a legendary meeting ground for the real jazz music lovers, while for musicians, it is a new experience in a country that has a lot to offer in the music field.

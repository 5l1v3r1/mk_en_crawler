BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament decided late on Monday (July 27th) to strip former Youth and Sports Minister Monica Iacob Ridzi of her immunity from prosecution. The vote by the Chamber of Deputies clears the way for the launch of a criminal investigation against Ridzi, who is suspected of embezzling public funds. She resigned as minister earlier this month but remains a member of parliament and denies any impropriety. She is suspected of illegally spending 600,000 euros earmarked for a music festival. According to local media reports, the money actually went to Elena Basescu's successful campaign for a seat in the European Parliament. (Reuters, DPA - 27/07/09)

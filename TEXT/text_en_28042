TIRANA, Albania -- The OSCE office in Tirana announced on Monday (May 17th) that it has a compromise that would end the longstanding political crisis. Last week, OSCE Ambassador Robert Bosch said that a proposal had been presented to both the government and opposition Socialist Party (SP). While Prime Minister Sali Berisha has said he is unaware of any proposal, SP leader Edi Rama says it calls for opening ballot boxes used during the disputed June 2009 general elections to investigators from a third party, the Venice Commission. SP lawmaker Arta Dade insisted on Monday that Berisha acknowledge the proposal exists. (Shekulli, Balkan Web, Telegrafi, Klan - 17/05/10)

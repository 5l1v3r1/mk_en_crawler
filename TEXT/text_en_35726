BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Turkish Energy and Natural Resources Minister Hilmi Guler said on Wednesday (2 June) that he expects Kazakhstan to join the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline project that will carry Caspian oil to the world via Turkey. Under present agreements, only Azerbaijan has agreed to export its oil via the BTC pipeline. Including Kazakhstan would ensure the project's financial feasibility, analysts say.
In other news, Turkish customs officials have discovered containers of weapons -- including a rocket-launching pad -- on a ship travelling from the Ukraine to Egypt, according to CNNTurk.com. The vessel was stopped Wednesday at the Turkish port of Ambarli, about 29km west of Istanbul. The crew was arrested. Security has been stepped up ahead of the NATO summit in Istanbul later this month. (CNNTurk.com - 03/06/04; Anadolu Agency, NTV - 02/06/04)

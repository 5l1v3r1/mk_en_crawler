ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan cancelled a trip to Argentina on Sunday (May 30th) after Buenos Aires halted the unveiling of a monument to the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. The foreign ministry blamed "hostile" interference by Armenian lobbyists and said it hoped Argentinean authorities would work to lift the shadow cast on bilateral relations. Argentinean President Cristina Kirchner reportedly phoned Erdogan to explain that the central government cannot reverse a decision by the city government. Dropping Argentina from his Latin America agenda, he had planned to travel directly on to Chile on Monday from Brazil, but flew home instead to handle the crisis with Israel.

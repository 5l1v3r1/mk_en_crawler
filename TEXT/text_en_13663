BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro's Council of Ministers decided on Monday (19 September) to block a controversial 300m-euro military procurement deal. The same contract prompted federal Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic's resignation earlier this month. The cabinet now says further modernisation of the Serbia-Montenegro Army would be put on hold until authorities complete their investigations. 
Also Monday, Belgrade media reported that the owner of the plant awarded the contract to produce the controversial equipment, as well three top army officers, face criminal charges. (Politika - 20/09/05; Beta, B92 - 19/09/05)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- Several thousand people staged a rally in Pristina on Thursday (9 January) to protest the murders of a former military commander and two family members. Tahir Zemaj, his son Enis and a cousin were gunned down in Pec last week. Zemaj recently testified for the prosecution in a trial against several former KLA members.

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- European Parliament President Hans-Gert Poettering has called on Croatia and Slovenia to settle their border dispute themselves, rather than resorting to international arbitration. In an interview with the Slovene state-run radio on Tuesday (March 13th), Poettering said an arbitration procedure could take years. The two countries have argued over maritime areas and fishing rights since the breakup of the former Yugoslavia. 
In other news, the Croatian Foreign Ministry announced that a joint EU-Croatian panel for civil society had held its first session in Brussels on Monday. The 12-member panel reviewed Croatia's progress in accession negotiations and discussed measures to boost institutional co-operation. (Poslovni dnevnik - 14/03/07; HINA - 13/03/07)

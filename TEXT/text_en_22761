BELGRADE, Serbia/PRISTINA, Kosovo -- European Commission (EC) Director for the Western Balkans Pierre Mirel said the EU has agreed to meet Serbia's key conditions for the deployment of the EU's EULEX mission in Kosovo. According to Mirel, who was in Belgrade on Friday (November 7th), the EU will agree to Belgrade's demands that EULEX gain the approval of the UN Security Council, remain neutral regarding Kosovo's status and make no reference to former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan. Special EU Representative in Kosovo Pieter Feith, however, repudiated Mirel's announcement. "Comments that are attributed to an EC official do not represent the EU's official position," Feith said on Saturday. 
In related news, the head of the EU Council's Directorate for the Western Balkans, Stefan Lehne, has said the start of EULEX's work in Kosovo could suffer another postponement, the daily Dnevnik reported on Saturday. According to Lehne, the EULEX's deployment will incur a delay unless the UN Security Council hammers out an agreement on Tuesday in New York.
Meanwhile Friday, Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) leader Vojislav Kostunica called for a no-confidence vote against the government over EULEX's deployment in Kosovo. (B92, Dnevnik, Tanjug, Beta - 08/11/08, AP, B92, Vecernje novosti - 07/11/08)

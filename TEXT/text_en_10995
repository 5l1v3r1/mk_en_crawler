BUJANOVAC, Serbia-Montenegro -- Western officials welcomed Wednesday's (29 June) inaugural session of the new Co-ordinating Body for Southern Serbia in Bujanovac, voicing hope that the remodeled structure would accelerate political stabilisation in the area. Envoys attending the event -- including OSCE Ambassador to Serbia-Montenegro Maurizio Massari and US Ambassador Michael C. Polt -- also pledged economic and other assistance to promote interethnic relations and economic development. The co-ordinating body was relaunched after local ethnic Albanian leaders in Presevo, Bujanovac and Medvedja decided to join it. 
In other news Wednesday, the Serbia-Montenegro Parliament adopted amendments to the federal union's Constitutional Charter. The changes, recently approved by the two republics, prolong the mandate of the federal legislature until new elections are held. That mandate expired in March. 
Also Wednesday, the IMF announced that it has released $182.9m in loans to Serbia following Belgrade's efforts to curb inflation and reduce its current account deficit. (Danas - 30/06/05; Tanjug, Beta, AP - 29/06/05)

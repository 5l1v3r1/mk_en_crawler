TIRANA, Albania -- Albania's parliamentary parties again clashed over electoral reform after the opposition Socialist Party (SP) walked out of discussions on Thursday (22 June). SP accused the ruling majority of obstructing the process, and said it would only sit in on negotiations if two conditions are met -- elimination of the temporary voters lists and establishment of a new date for local elections. The next local elections were to be held in December or January 2007, but SP said winter weather might be an obstacle for voting in the mountainous regions. The party insists the date be shifted to this fall or next spring. SP also proposed that the mandate of the new local officials to be extended from three to four years. 
Electoral reform preparation has been deadlocked since last December due to bickering between the opposition and ruling majority. (Albanian News - 23/06/06)

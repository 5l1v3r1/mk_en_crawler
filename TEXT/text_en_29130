BUCHAREST, Romania -- Two more lawmakers from the opposition National Liberal Party (PNL) left the party on Tuesday (April 6th) and announced they would support the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (PDL). The two deputies are Senator Gabriel Berca and deputy Mihai Banu. They expressed disagreement with the policies led by the current PNL leadership, mostly with regard to local party branches. 
Dozens of MPs from the PDL, Social Democratic Party and Conservative Party have defected since the current parliament was formed in 2008, while PNL has gained ten seats. Even so, the ruling coalition still lacks a clear majority with only 206 of the needed 236 seats. (Cotidianul, Ziare, Evenimentul Zilei - 06/04/10)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said on Wednesday (October 4th) that his country deserves to join the EU in the next two to three years, adding it would be unacceptable for accession to occur after 2010. Speaking at a Zagreb conference on politics and democratisation, Sanader reiterated that he expects the Union to settle its internal disputes and institutional issues by the time Croatia is ready for membership. 
Meanwhile, wrapping up a two-day meeting in Brussels, the joint EU-Croatia inter-parliamentary committee adopted a declaration Wednesday, backing Croatia's efforts to enter the EU by 2009. Committee co-chairman Pal Schmitt praised the country's determination to proceed with reforms. (Vjesnik - 05/10/06; HINA, Index.hr, HRT - 04/10/06)

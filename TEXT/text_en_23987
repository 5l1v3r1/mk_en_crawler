PARIS, France -- A judge charged seven people on Saturday (January 17th) with financing terrorism, specifically the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Police arrested the seven in the southern city of Marseille earlier in the week, suspecting all seven to be PKK members or supporters. They face charges of participating in a criminal conspiracy with a terrorist enterprise, assault and attempted extortion. Authorities remanded five into custody. The suspects allegedly threatened and, in some cases, assaulted members of the city's Kurdish community. 
Last week, a court in Paris sentenced 11 people to terms of three months to five years for involvement in petrol bomb attacks on two Turkish bars and a cultural centre in Bordeaux in March and April 2007. (Hurriyet, NTV - 18/01/09; AFP - 17/01/09)

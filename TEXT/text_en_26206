PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Managing relations with Serbia tops the list of international challenges for the government this year, International Civilian Office chief Pieter Feith said Thursday (January 14th) during a meeting with Hashim Thaci, the country's prime minister. Feith added that while the government made solid achievements in 2009, challenges remain.
In other news Thursday, EULEX head Yves de Kermabon visited the newly established Serb-dominated municipality of Ranilug, where he dismissed Belgrade-orchestrated parallel structures across Kosovo. "Strong, fair and multiethnic rule-of-law institutions for all communities are the only option. This will be a guarantee for fair justice and will make the so-called parallel structures irrelevant," de Kermabon said.

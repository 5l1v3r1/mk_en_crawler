SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country's special court on Friday (26 May) sentenced a Bosnian Serb to 20 years in prison for crimes against humanity. Dragoje Paunovic, a former military officer, was found guilty of ordering his troops to capture 27 Bosniak civilians in Rogatica and use them as human shields during a battle on 15 August 1992. Later that day, he ordered his troops to execute the prisoners, firing at some himself. Only three survived. (Nezavisne novine, NTV Hayat - 27/05/06; Reuters - 26/05/06)

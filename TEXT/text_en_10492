SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The EBRD says Bulgaria is a leader in Southeast Europe in terms of economic reform. "From a country in crisis seven years ago, Bulgaria has now turned into a star performer compared to its neighbours in terms of transition," Peter Sanfey, EBRD's lead economist for the region, said Wednesday (17 November). He warned, however, that there should be no letup in privatisation and restructuring, and that Sofia should do more to revamp its judiciary. 
In other news, three key players in the Bulgarian government -- EU Affairs Minister Meglena Kouneva, Foreign Minister Solomon Passy and Finance Minister Milen Velchev -- suggested separately on Wednesday that Bulgaria's signing of the EU accession treaty could be delayed because it has been paired with Romania. Bucharest has not yet closed all accession chapters, as Sofia has. (Dnevnik - 18/11/04; AFP, bTV - 17/11/04)

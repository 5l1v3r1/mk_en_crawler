ZAGREB, Croatia -- The opposition on Monday (December 1st) accused Prime Minister Ivo Sanader of supporting human rights violations after police questioned a young man for creating a group of Sanader opponents in the online social network Facebook. Niksa Klecak, 22, dubbed his group "I bet I can find 5,000 people who dislike Sanader". Police say they investigated it because a photo montage depicted Sanader in a Nazi uniform. Croatian law bans Nazi symbols. Klecak obtained his release only after proving he had not uploaded the photo. Opposition Social Democratic Party leader Zoran Milanovic described the case as a "dangerous precedent" that threatens freedom of expression. (Vecernji List, AP, Javno - 01/12/08)

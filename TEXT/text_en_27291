SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentine Inzko on Friday (October 30th) instructed the Mostar City Council to organise mayoral elections within 30 days. Inzko announced his decision after a meeting of the Peace Implementation Council Steering Board ambassadors. Mostar's City Council members have been unable to agree on a consensus candidate, leaving the mayoral post vacant for a year. Inzko said he expects the City Council to adopt a budget as soon as possible after the election. (Fena, BHRT, OHR - 30/10/09)

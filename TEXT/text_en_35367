TIRANA, Albania -- The leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, Sali Berisha, said Sunday (15 February) the talks among right-wing opposition parties would result in the adoption of a common platform. The roundtable is to start on Monday. Berisha said the common platform would present a solution to the problems faced by the opposition, but he denied rumours that the parties would come up with a shadow cabinet. (ATA - 15/02/04)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Sources told Skopje's A1 TV at the weekend that parliamentary elections would likely be held on 28 May. The date is viewed as a compromise between the ruling coalition -- which had pressed for a July vote -- and the opposition, which maintains a summer vote would be affected by low turnout. Senior EU officials visited Skopje late last week to discuss the elections and other issues. 
In other news, the Democratic Union for Integration, a junior partner in the coalition government, presented a bill Friday on the status of former members of the now disbanded National Liberation Army (NLA). The draft does not use the reference "NLA", but instead refers to "participants in the 2001 armed conflict". It reportedly envisions treatment and benefits for former ethnic Albanian militants and their families equal to those provided to former members of the Macedonian security forces.

WASHINGTON, United States -- Turkish Economy Minister Ali Babacan begins a three-day visit to the United States on Monday (8 September), aimed at discussing the latest developments in Turkey's economy with potential US investors. He is also expected to discuss details of an $8.5 billion US financial aid package for Turkey. Treasury spokesman Rob Nichols reiterated on Sunday that the decision to disburse the loan was independent of Turkey's still pending decision to deploy peacekeepers in Iraq.

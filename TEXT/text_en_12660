SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A special war crimes court is due to open in Sarajevo on Wednesday (9 March). It will employ five teams of prosecutors to take over cases from the UN war crimes tribunal as well as local courts. 
In other news, EUFOR reported on Friday that its weapons collection campaign has been a success. EU troops visited private homes in Sarajevo over the past two weeks asking residents to surrender illegal weapons. That netted thousands of grenades, small arms, grenade launchers, anti-tank rockets and pieces of ammunition. (Reuters - 05/03/05; AP - 04/03/05)

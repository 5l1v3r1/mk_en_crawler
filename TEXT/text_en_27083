BELGRADE, Serbia -- Political representatives of Albanians in southern Serbia have launched an initiative to establish Albanian regional institutions and a Presevo valley region, local media reported on Sunday (August 2nd). Councillors of the Presevo, Bujanovas and Medvedja municipalities have adopted a political declaration calling on Serbian authorities to halt special police actions in southern Serbia and to prevent any escalation of the political and security situation. They have also insisted on demilitarising this zone. Serbia has deployed gendarmerie in the region arguing, it is there to fight crime and corruption.

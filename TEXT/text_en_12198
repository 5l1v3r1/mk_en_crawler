SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative to BiH Paddy Ashdown announced at a news conference Friday (11 February) that he has asked BiH Constitutional Court President Mate Tadic and Justice Minister Slobodan Kovac to form a working group to propose a new model for how the country's top judicial body should function. The report by the expert team would be expected within 3 months. Ashdown said his initiative could potentially lead to reducing the duties of the high representative and increasing those of the BiH Constitutional Court. He also suggested the court might be authorised to assess decisions made by the high representative. (OHR Sources, Pincom.info, PBS BiH - 11/02/05)

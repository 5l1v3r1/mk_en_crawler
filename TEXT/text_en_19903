BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Supreme Defence Council endorsed on Tuesday (December 18th) the defence ministry's 2008 plan for deployments. Romanian troops will continue to participate in peace-keeping missions in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Iraq; in the collective defence Active Endeavour operations in the Mediterranean Sea, and in the UN, OSCE, and in EU-led individual observation and monitoring missions. 
In other news Wednesday, President Traian Basescu said Romania does not plan any measures against Moldova, which last week expelled two Romanian diplomats from the country. Moldova accused them of engaging in activities incompatible with their diplomatic status. The two countries have been exchanging sharp rhetoric over the past few months.

TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi met on Wednesday (May 25th) with Kosovo Local Government Minister Slobodan Petrovic, praising efforts for an independent, multiethnic and democratic new country. Kosovo's efforts to meet the needs of all citizens, including consolidating a multiethnic state by respecting the rights of minorities, is a step forward, Topi told Petrovic, a Kosovo Serb. "These are the main pillars for the integration of Kosovo in Euro-Atlantic structures," Topi said during the meeting in Tirana. Petrovic thanked him for his role as a pro-European politician who is helping Kosovo secure new international recognitions, as well as for supporting the dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters on Friday (29 August) that he favours sending troops to Iraq to help stabilise the country. "We must not be afraid to go there," he said. The decision depends on which part of Iraq the Turkish troops would be assigned to, Erdogan added. NATO's Supreme Commander in Europe, US General James Jones, reportedly is to visit Turkey on Tuesday for talks on Iraq and other issues.
In other news, no progress on wages was reported Saturday following a fifth round of collective bargaining talks among government representatives, the unions and civil servants. A commission will now be established to study the issue; the final decision rests with the cabinet. (AFP - 31/08/03; Anatolia, BBC - 30/08/03; AFP - 29/08/03)

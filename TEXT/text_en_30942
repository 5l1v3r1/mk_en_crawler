ZAGREB, Croatia -- Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, said on Tuesday (February 8th) that Croatia may receive a date for wrapping up its EU negotiations in April. After talks with Croatian counterpart Jadranka Kosor in Zagreb, Orban pointed out that the date could be given in April provided that the country makes significant progress in March. At the same time, he warned that if the date is not clear by April, then the process will likely be prolonged. (HRT, Hina, tportal.ht - 08/02/11)

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- After two postponements in a week, the trial against former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic will now start on October 26th, The Hague war crimes tribunal announced on Thursday (October 15th). Karadzic is charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. His trial is expected to last three years. It will start with a two-day opening statement by prosecutors, followed by two days for Karadzic to present his defence. He has sought delays, insisting he needs more time to prepare.

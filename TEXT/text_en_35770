SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between Macedonia and the EU finally took effect on Thursday (1 April), three years after it was signed. EU security chief Javier Solana said that with this step "the distance between Brussels and Skopje is reduced". It is first such agreement to be implemented. Talks on an SAA with Croatia have been completed, while negotiations with Albania are under way.
Also Thursday, Macedonian and Albanian border police kicked off a co-operation project at the Blato border crossing. The focus is on curbing the illegal trafficking of drugs and people. (Utrinski Vesnik - 02/04/04; MIA, Makfax, A1 TV - 01/04/04)

NEW YORK, United States -- The UN, the US and the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) on Wednesday (September 3rd) welcomed the launch this week of reunification talks by the two Cypriot leaders, Demetris Christofias and Mehmet Ali Talat. In a written statement, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon vowed his organisation's support for talks aimed at reunifying the island after 34 years of division. US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said Washington backs a bi-zonal, bi-communal solution for the two communities on the island. PACE Rapporteur for Cyprus Joachim Horster called the direct talks "the best opportunity in many years to end the division of Cyprus" and said the Council of Europe is ready to help reach a solution. Greece also welcomed the new round of talks. (CNA, Famagusta Gazette, ANA-MPA, Hurriyet, AFP, RIA Novosti, Naftemporiki, Kathimerini, SKAI - 03/09/08)

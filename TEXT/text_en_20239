SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of High Representative (OHR) expects Republika Srpska (RS) to consult with state-level institutions before sealing any new annexes related to RS's Agreement on Special and Parallel Relations with Serbia. The OHR says this would help the RS "reduce tensions, eliminate the possibility for misunderstanding and re-focus on BiH's EU future". The OHR also reminded RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik that the high representative is the final authority on civilian aspects of the Dayton Peace Accord, and has the right to review agreements and annexes. Serbia and RS leaders agreed to implement a number of joint projects at a meeting in Banja Luka last week. 
In other news Thursday, RS's parliament announced plans for a public competition to write a new anthem. The winner will receive 5,000 euros. Several months ago, BiH and later the RS Constitutional Court, declared using "Bozhe pravde", Serbia's national anthem, was unconstitutional.

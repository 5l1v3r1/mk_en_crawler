BELGRADE, Serbia -- At a seminar in Belgrade on Monday (August 27th), judges and prosecutors handling cases involving organised crime met with justice ministry representatives to discuss measures aimed at making the fight against organised crime more efficient. Justice Ministry State Secretary Snezana Malovic said one way would be to allow the confiscation of property acquired through criminal activity. "International co-operation in this field is necessary because organised crime groups from the former territory of Yugoslavia have established close co-operation and their activities jeopardise all the countries in the region," Malovic was quoted as saying by B92. Sandro Calvani, director of the UN Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI), also participated in the seminar. He offered to help Serbia meet EU standards in the field.

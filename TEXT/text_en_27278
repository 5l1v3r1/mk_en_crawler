BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC), poised to announce a response to planned budget cuts by Greece Wednesday (February 3rd), says the measures require more clarification. The EC warned it may ask for "additional measures" from Athens. Amelia Torres, spokesperson for EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, described the goals of the Greek stabilisation programme as "ambitious" Monday, adding they contain "risks". The EU anticipates monitoring implementation of the plan. Each year, EU member states are obliged to send the EC a stability programme describing public finance measures planned by their governments. Greece's case is a bit different since the EC launched a procedure against it last spring over its excessive budget deficit. Brussels says Athens has failed to implement effective initiatives to correct the issue. (AFP, Reuters, Wall Street Journal - 01/02/10)

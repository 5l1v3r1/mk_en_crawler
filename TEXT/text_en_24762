STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- French President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Friday (July 3rd) his country still opposes full EU membership for Turkey. France, he said, backs a proposal by the Swedish EU presidency to open new negotiation chapters in Turkey's accession talks "as long as this doesn't lead to full-fledged membership", Sarkozy said after meeting with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt in Stockholm. Sweden assumed the rotating EU presidency on Wednesday. (Anadolu news agency, Haber Turk, AP, DPA, Euronews - 03/07/09)

NEW YORK, United States -- The UN denied on Friday (18 March) that Greek Cypriots have made a formal proposal to resume suspended peace and reunification talks. On Thursday, Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos said he submitted such a proposal to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. But a UN spokesman said officials were unaware of it. Later on Friday, the Cyprus government issued a correction, saying Nicosia was engaged in "exploratory" contacts. (Kathimerini - 19/03/05; NTV - 18/03/05)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor reassured her government's coalition partners Tuesday (January 5th) that the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) is stable and stronger than ever. This follows the expulsion of former prime minister and honorary party president Ivo Sanader, which sparked fears of a split in the ruling party. Sanader was expelled from the HDZ after he announced his return to politics, six months after leaving it. Kosor also said she trusts Parliament Speaker Luka Bebic, even though he voted against Sanader's expulsion. Coalition partners expressed satisfaction with the way the HDZ dealt with Sanader's attempted political comeback, describing it as quick and decisive. (HINA, HRT, Poslovni, Vecernji List - 05/01/10)

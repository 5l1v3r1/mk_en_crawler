The European Commission has recommended that Bulgaria and Romania join the EU next year as planned, but only if they fulfil ten more conditions. Bulgaria in particular will have to show tangible results in the fight against corruption and organised crime. The report presented to the European Parliament on Tuesday (16 May) also warns both states could face serious membership restrictions and cuts to EU funds after they join. The final assessment on whether they can join will be delayed until October. For Bulgaria and Romania, the answer from the European Commission is a conditional yes. (BBC-16/05/06)

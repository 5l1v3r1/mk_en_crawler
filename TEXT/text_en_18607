THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Bosnian Muslim wartime commander Rasim Delic's trial before The Hague tribunal began Monday (July 9th) with an argument from the prosecution that more witnesses be allowed to testify, and the questioning time limit for each witness be extended. The Hague set the number of witnesses to be heard in the case at 55 -- half of the prosecutors' request. "If we are required to start the trial under these conditions, the likely outcome would be acquittal, we are not in a position to be able to prove our case with 55 witnesses.'' prosecutor Daryl Mundis said. Delic is charged with the rape, torture and murder of Bosnian Croats and Serbs committed by troops under his control. He pleaded not guilty on all charges.

WASHINGTON, United States -- Press freedom declined in almost every region of the world last year, according to a study by the US-based watchdog Freedom House. The study, released on Thursday (April 29th), revealed a decline in press freedom for the eighth year in a row. In the Balkans, there are only two countries in the group of "free" states in terms of media -- Cyprus and Greece -- ranked 19th and 23rd respectively. All other states are in the partly free category -- Bulgaria at 76th, Serbia -- at 78th, Montenegro -- at 80th, Croatia -- at 85th, Romania -- at 88th, Macedonia -- at 94th, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- at 97th, Albania -- at 102nd, Turkey -- at 106th, and Kosovo -- at 108th. The report studied 196 countries worldwide, based on 23 questions. The survey was conducted between January 1st 2009 and December 31st 2009. (Freedom House website - 29/04/10)

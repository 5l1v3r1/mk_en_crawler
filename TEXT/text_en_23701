BELGRADE, Serbia -- The European Commission (EC) has managed to talk the Netherlands into allowing implementation of the interim trade agreement between Serbia and the EU, Serb media reported on Friday (May 22nd), citing EU sources. The Netherlands has long insisted that Serbia must first arrest Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic. According to the EU sources, a formal decision is expected in June, along with a decision on scrapping visa requirements for some Western Balkan countries, including Serbia. However, the Netherlands reportedly still insists that other parts of Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement should remain blocked. (Blic, Vecernji Novosti, B92 - 22/05/09)

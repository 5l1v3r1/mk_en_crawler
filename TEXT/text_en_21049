MOSCOW, Russia -- Russia has granted refugee status to the wife and son of the late Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic international agencies reported on Friday (February 1st) referring to sources within the country's immigration service. The Milosevic's were given the status in March 2005. Marko Milosevic has been living in Russia since 2000 where he moved immediately after his father stepped down, while his mother joined him three years later after she came under investigation for embezzlement in Serbia. Last year, Serbian authorities issued an international arrest warrant for both of them, charging they organised an international cigarette smuggling ring. Neither could return to Serbia to attend Milosevic's funeral in March 2006. (Reuters, BBC, B92, RTS - 01/02/08)

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The main parties in Republika Srpska (RS) -- the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats and the Serb Democratic Party -- agreed on Thursday (October 28th) to draft a joint platform regarding all open issues and take a common stand regarding possible participation in the BiH state-level government and on all other state-level political issues. This will happen within a week, according to party leaders Milorad Dodik and Mladen Bosic. They added that the views of the two parties are converging, especially as far as constitutional reforms are concerned. 
Dodik and Bosic said they would back only a constitutional amendment on electoral legislation that follows the recommendations of the Strasbourg Court of Human Rights and which guarantees the equal right of all ethnic communities to run for the tripartite presidency. Currently the three seats are reserved for Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs. (Nezavisne Novine, Vecernje Novosti - 28/10/10)

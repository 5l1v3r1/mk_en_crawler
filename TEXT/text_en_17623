SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The main ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic Union for Integration, confirmed on Saturday (January 27th) that it would boycott the Macedonian Parliament, despite strong international pressure stressing the need for political dialogue. DUI accuses the ruling coalition of violating the so-called Badinter principle, under which minority-related laws must receive decisive support from minority parties in order to be adopted. Last week, DUI's ally, the Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDP), also announced a boycott.
On Friday, US Ambassador to Macedonia Gillian A. Milovanovic urged the parties to reconsider their decisions. She said ethnic Albanians had voted for DUI and PDP candidates to represent them in parliament. (Telma TV, Makfax - 27/01/07)

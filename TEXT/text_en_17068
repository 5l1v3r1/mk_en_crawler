BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian Interior Ministry announced on Thursday (1 June) that it issued an arrest warrant for Marija Milosevic, daughter of the late Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, at the request of the Second Municipal Court in Belgrade. The court ordered her detention for repeatedly ignoring summonses to hearings. Milosevic is charged with "endangering public safety" and illegal possession and use of firearms during the dramatic police action that accompanied the arrest of her father in Belgrade in April 2001.

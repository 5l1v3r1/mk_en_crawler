BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said on Monday (April 23rd) that he would soon table a draft resolution to withdraw the country's 600 troops from Iraq. The subject is a source of bitter disagreement with embattled President Traian Basescu, who is now facing a referendum on impeachment. Analysts say that given recent changes in the ruling coalition, including the removal of Basescu's Democratic Party, Tariceanu will likely succeed. Defence Minister Teodor Melescanu says current deployments abroad are straining available resources. (Rompres, Reuters - 23/04/07)

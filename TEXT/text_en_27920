TIRANA, Albania -- Electricity producers, transmitters and distributors in the country have asked the energy regulator to raise prices by an average of 12% or 8 euro cents per kW/h, local media report on Friday (November 19th). The companies have also insisted on differentiating prices depending on the consumer -- household, businesses, and public users. Each company is seeking an increase based on their expectations of revenues, investments, losses in the system and maintenance. CEZ, which manages distribution, sought a price hike but was turned down. A decision by the energy regulator is expected on December 7th. Industrial companies want the regulator to ignore the request, saying CEZ must first improve its supply and services. (Shekulli, Panorama, Ora News, News 24 - 19/11/10)

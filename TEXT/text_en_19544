SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The teachers' strike moved into its sixth week after the rank and file rejected an offer from the government. In a vote Monday (October 29th), 55% of teachers turned down the deal that offered them a 19.1% wage increase as of November, and a total increase of 46.4% by the end of 2008. The wages of non-teaching staff would have increased by the same rate. The teachers are demanding nearly a 73% raise, down from the nearly 100% initially sought.

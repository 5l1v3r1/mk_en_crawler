PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- The UN mission in Pristina announced Thursday (3 October) that forensic experts have discovered 28 unmarked graves in the village of Djakovica. The exhumed remains were taken to a morgue in a nearby town for identification. A UN spokesman said there was no indication of the ethnic origin of the victims, who were apparently killed during or after the 1999 conflict in the Serbian province. Slavisa Dobricanin, a Yugoslav expert in the forensic team, said the remains most likely were those of Roma and Serbs, but promised more information next week. He said experts learned of the graves from testimony by an ethnic Albanian. (AP, AFP - 03/10/02)

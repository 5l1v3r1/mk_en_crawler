BUCHAREST, Romania -- NATO Secretary General George Robertson spoke at a joint session of parliament on Monday (3 March), congratulating the country for implementing difficult economic, political and military reforms and showing strong international engagement. Robertson noted that Romania was the first country to join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme in January 1994 and had moved very close to achieving full membership in the alliance.
On a related note, Romania's Ministry of Industry released a study showing the military sector must attract private and state investment to meet NATO standards. The report concludes that military enterprises lack sufficient foreign and domestic trade orders and might not sustain competition among NATO members.

ATHENS, Greece -- A strike planned by the media Thursday (July 2nd) had to be cancelled after a court in Athens declared it illegal. The decision came shortly after the strike action began at noon, forcing a halt to it. Journalists were protesting the closing of two media outlets -- Eleftheros Typos newspaper and radio station City -- whose owners blamed the ongoing economic crisis. Protest organisers say they aren't giving up.
In other news, two powerful explosions shook central Athens early Friday. The first damaged cars and buildings at an intersection in the Ambelokipi district. Two newspapers received calls warning of the bomb, but no specific location was mentioned. The second blast caused heavy damage to the Hellenic Migration Policy Institute. No group has claimed responsibility for either attack yet. (Nafhtemporiki, Ethnos, Vima, Sky, AFP - 03/07/09; Focus - 02/07/09)

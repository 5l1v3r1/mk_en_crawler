BERLIN, Germany -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder met with Bosnian Prime Minister Adnan Terzic on Thursday (18 November), assuring him that Germany backs Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) bid for membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace programme and would assist the country on its way to EU integration. Reportedly, Schroeder praised the general progress achieved by BiH in co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal but urged concrete and determined action to detain those still at large. 
In other news, High Representative Paddy Ashdown is in London for talks with senior British officials. A spokesman for his office says BiH's co-operation with The Hague tribunal will top the agenda. 
Meanwhile, a two-day session of the BiH Police Restructuring Commission in Mostar ended Thursday without a concrete agreement on a single police force in BiH. According to press reports Friday, Republika Srpska's representatives again thwarted a deal. (Dnevni avaz - 19/11/04; PBS BiH, Pincom.info - 18/11/04)

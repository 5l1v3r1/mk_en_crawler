SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government approved amendments Thursday (March 26th) to the law on education, introducing a ban on wearing religious symbols, such as Muslim headscarves or large Christian crosses, in schools. Authorities had never tolerated wearing such symbols, where 80% of the population is Christian and 12% is Muslim, even before enacting the ban. The spokesman of the chief mufti office in Bulgaria, Hussein Hafazov, described it as a "complete violation of the rights of Muslim women". Parliament must approve the ban for it to take effect.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- On Thursday (3 October), NATO Secretary General George Robertson urged Croatia to comply with the requests of the UN war crimes tribunal concerning Gen Janko Bobetko. A statement posted on NATO's web site noted that all former Yugoslav states are obliged to observe the rulings of the tribunal regardless of their domestic laws. Robertson warned that "failure to co-operate could have a counterproductive impact on movement towards NATO and further integration within the Euro-Atlantic Community." Prime Minister Ivica Racan opposes the indictment of Bobetko, viewed by many Croatians as a war hero.
In other news, the cabinet Thursday adopted a programme offering alternative employment to military personnel downsized as part of ongoing army reforms. The defence ministry plans to slash staff levels from 40,000 to 19,520 in 2005, in a bid to meet NATO standards. (HINA, HRT, NATO web site - 03/10/02)

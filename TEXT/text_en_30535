TIRANA, Albania -- Miroslav Lajcak, EU envoy for the political crisis in Albania, is recommending that politicians in Tirana invite EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele to help resolve longstanding differences. Lajcak is urging both Prime Minister Sali Berisha and opposition leader Edi Rama to involve Fuele in ending the stalemate, according to reports by local media Wednesday (February 16th). During Tuesday's session on Albania at the European Parliament, Fuele said the stalemate is undermining national institutions. (Panorama, Telegrafi - 16/02/11)

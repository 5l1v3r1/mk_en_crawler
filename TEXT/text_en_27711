ZAGREB, Croatia -- European Parliament (EP) rapporteur on visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans, Tanja Fajon, expects Croatia to complete its EU accession talks next year, probably in the first half of 2011. In an interview with the daily Slobodna Dalmacija on Sunday (October 24th), Fajon said that the country should put all its energy towards closing the most difficult negotiation chapters, such as the one on the judiciary. 
As for the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) after the October 3rd general elections, Fajon said that constitutional changes should be among the first tasks of the new government. She rejected any notion of partition, stressing that BiH can advance towards the EU only as a unified country. (Slobodna Dalmacija, RTRS, Srna - 24/10/10)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The director of the State Agency for National Security (DANS), Tsvetlin Yovchev, resigned on Wednesday (February 16th) in the wake of recent wire-tapping scandals. Yovchev said his decision was prompted by the lack of confidence in him and his failure to meet Prime Minister Boyko Borisov's expectations. Yovchev was appointed to the post in August 2009 shortly after Borisov's GERB party won the general elections. Earlier in the day, Borisov criticised the agency's performance in dealing with the recent scandals involving the controversial use of special investigative means in several cases involving high-ranking officials, including Borisov himself.

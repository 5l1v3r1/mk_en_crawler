ZAGREB, Croatia -- Thousands of Croats took to the streets of Zagreb on Tuesday (March 8th) demanding the government's resignation. This latest demonstration was, like other recent ones, organised via Facebook and ended without incidents. Marking International Women's Day, the protestors also voiced their solidarity with female workers at the bankrupt Kamensko textile factory. (Vecernji List, Nova TV, RTS - 08/03/11)

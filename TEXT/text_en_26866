ANKARA, Turkey -- The government invited on Saturday (December 5th) a European organisation fighting inmate torture to visit Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan in prison to see his cell. Ocalan, 61, is the founder of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has been leading a bloody fight for the independence of the Kurdish-dominated regions in southeast Turkey. He has been serving a life sentence in a prison on Imrali Island since 1999. Ocalan was the only inmate on the island before new prisoners arrived last month. That was prompted by criticism from the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture, which accused Ankara of violating Ocalan's human rights. (AFP, NTV, World Bulletin - 04/12/09)

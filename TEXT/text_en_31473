PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- KFOR Commander Gen Fabio Mini announced Thursday (23 January) that until further notice, KFOR would suspend efforts to remove checkpoints near Orthodox churches in Kosovo. According to the Italian agency ANSA, UNMIK had planned to restrict KFOR protection to historical monuments. However, growing concerns over the future of religious buildings fostered the decision to delay the withdrawal of KFOR personnel. Church officials with the Raska-Prizren eparchy praised the move.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU and Turkey appeared to have moved closer Friday (17 December) to a historic agreement on the start of accession talks, as EU leaders softened an earlier demand that Ankara recognise Cyprus. On Thursday, the leaders decided to offer to launch talks on 3 October 2005, but only if Turkey immediately initialled an accord giving de facto recognition of the Greek Cypriot-led government. That demand, however, was dropped after Dutch, British, French, German and Greek leaders reached a compromise, under which Ankara would instead make a "voluntary" commitment to recognising Cyprus in the near future. The EU has indicated it may also put in place safeguards meant to ensure Turkey meets the criteria for membership, and to limit the flow of labor migration. The final summit decisions are to be adopted by EU leaders late Friday.
In other news, the leaders agreed to sign accession treaties with Bulgaria and Romania in early 2005. This would enable the two countries to join the Union in 2007 if they implement the required reforms. The EU leaders have also agreed to launch accession talks with Croatia in April 2005 if Zagreb proves it is co-operating unconditionally with the UN war crimes tribunal.

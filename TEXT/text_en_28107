TIRANA, Albania -- The Socialist Party (SP) has suggested that electoral reform should only focus on local elections, rather than the whole system. SP lawmaker Damian Gjiknuri said on Wednesday (August 18th) that he believes reforms should be drafted by a commission over the course of a few months. Gjiknuri recommended that any potential reforms associated with the general elections should follow next year's local elections. According to the SP, a commission is the best way to work on reforms that were suggested by the OSCE immediately after the disputed June 2009 general elections. The OSCE recommended de-politicising members of electoral commissions, giving voters an opportunity to better know candidates, eliminating the involvement of political parties in selecting judges who handle election-related complaints, and giving each voter the right to complain individually when their right to vote has been violated. The ruling Democratic Party has pledged support to any initiative to improve the Electoral Code. (Koha Jone, News 24 - 19/08/10; Klan - 18/08/10)

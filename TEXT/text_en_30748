SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said on Friday (March 11th) that Bulgaria is ready to send 20 fire-fighters to Japan to help local rescuers after the devastating earthquake and a tsunami. Turkey too offered its assistance to deal with the consequences of the disaster. Officials fear the earthquake, measuring 8.9 on the Richter Scale, and the tsunami that followed likely killed 10,000 people in northeastern Miyagi prefecture alone.
The situation was further aggravated after a nuclear power complex lost its cooling system as sea water flooded it Saturday. More than 200,000 residents of the Fukushima area north of Tokyo have been evacuated amid fears of a meltdown. Prime Minister Naoto Kan described the situation Sunday as Japan's worst crisis since World War II. (BBC 13/03/11; Standart, Darik, Mediapool, Xinhua, Kyodo - 11/03/11)

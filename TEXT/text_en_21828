ANKARA, Turkey -- Families of victims of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) are furious over the Turkish government's decision to end PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan's solitary confinement, according to media reports Monday (November 24th). He has been serving a life sentence in a prison on the island of Imrali since 1999. The Martyr Families Solidarity Association said on Sunday it will take the issue to the European Court of Human Rights if the Imrali prison loses its special status. On Friday, Justice Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin announced authorities have started building a new detention facility on the island to house five or six other detainees. Suat Kiniklioglu, of the ruling Justice and Development Party, confirmed on Sunday plans to change Ocalan's status to that of an ordinary inmate, amid concerns over his mental health.

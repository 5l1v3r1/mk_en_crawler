ANKARA, Turkey -- The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is reportedly close to finalising work on a democratic reform package that will make shutting down political parties more difficult. The effort began last month, after Chief Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya filed a suit with Turkey's Constitutional Court, claiming the AKP should be banned for activities he says threaten secularism.

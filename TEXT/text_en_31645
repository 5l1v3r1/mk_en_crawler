BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou says Serbia and Montenegro should step up efforts to finalise their new constitutional charter. Meeting Yugoslav officials in Belgrade Tuesday (14 January), Papandreou asserted that the EU, whose presidency is chaired by Greece until June, views Serbia and Montenegro as a stable union with "a single voice in European and Euro-Atlantic environment". He made it clear that progress in approving the charter is a condition for EU entry down the road. The constitutional commission on the federal charter is to meet Wednesday to discuss the law on implementing the constitution. The Serbian and Montenegrin Parliaments are delaying approval of the charter, awaiting endorsement of the law. Papandreou also called on the Yugoslav government to better co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal.
In other news, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic insisted Tuesday that the government is not going to collapse. According to Belgrade-based FoNet, Djindjic is convinced those that oppose the government lack the clout needed to attack it. (B92, Tanjug, FoNet, BBC - 14/01/02)

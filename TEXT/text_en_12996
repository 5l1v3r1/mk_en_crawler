TIRANA, Albania -- The government announced on Tuesday (31 May) that it has seized the assets of four Islamic organisations suspected of ties to terrorists. "Coming to Albania in the 1990s, these foundations have hidden behind charity work to finance suspect activities or to make investments to launder their funds," said Alban Beqja, a spokesman for the finance ministry. Also seized were the assets of a Belgian woman and a Lebanese man who are believed to have helped finance terrorist groups. (AFP - 01/06/05; AFP - 31/05/05)

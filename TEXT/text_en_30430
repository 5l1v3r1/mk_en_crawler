TIRANA, Albania -- It's come down to the wire in the Tirana mayoral race. Vote-counting since the weekend local elections had left Democratic Party candidate Lulzim Basha holding a a razor thin lead over incumbent mayor and Socialist Party leader Edi Rama by Thursday evening (May 12th). But officials say the last 16 boxes to be counted come from a SP bastion and could overturn Basha's 638 vote lead. Counting slowed during the day but intensified in the evening when foreign ambassadors and OSCE and EU representatives visited the centres. (VoA, Top Channel, Balkan Web, Klan - 12/05/11)

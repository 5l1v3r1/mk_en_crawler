ATHENS, Greece -- Public transport workers in Athens are staging a six-hour work stoppage Monday (December 13th) to protest cuts that are part of the government's austerity measures. On Sunday, the workers managed to stop public transport in the capital for five hours. Work stoppages are also planned for Tuesday and Thursday. Bank workers' unions plan a 48-hour strike of their own, starting Tuesday. A nationwide strike organised by the two leading labour unions is planned for Wednesday. (ANA-MPA, DPA - 13/12/10)

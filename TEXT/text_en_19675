SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government banned the export of burned wood from all tree types Thursday (August 23rd), reportedly in a bid to stop the recent rash of deliberately-set forest fires. A government report suggests 34,000 hectares of forests and land have been destroyed by fires so far this year. In July alone, the damage from fires was estimated at 1.7m euros. The government blames property investors and logging companies, as burned wood fetches higher prices in neighbouring countries. It is used in construction.

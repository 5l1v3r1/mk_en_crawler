PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The International Civilian Office reacted on Thursday (March 17th) to statements from the government that a planned salary increase will happen even though no agreement was reached with the IMF. ICO spokesperson Andy McGuffie said that the government should explain how the hike for civil servants and education sector will happen. Finance Minister Bedri Hamza said on Thursday that he hopes the budget be approved by parliament next week, as salaries are due to rise as of April. The ruling Democratic Party promised a salary hike of 30% to 50% ahead of the December 2010 general elections. (Koha Ditore, Zeri, Express, Lajm - 18/03/11)

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republic Srpska (RS) President Dragan Cavic on Saturday (8 January) picked Pero Bukejlovic of the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) to be the next prime minister. Bukejlovic, a 58-year old mechanical engineer, served as industry and technology minister from 2001 to 2003. He told reporters that his main focus would be social policy, privatisation and co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. He also pledged to work for political stability in RS. The prime minister-designate now has 40 days to form a government and present it to parliament for approval. Bukejlovic succeeds Dragan Mikerevic, who's cabinet resigned last month following sanctions by international community High Representative Paddy Ashdown.

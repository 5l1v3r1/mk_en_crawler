SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The June 1st snap elections were the worst in Macedonia's history, the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights said in a report published on Monday (June 9th). It concludes the vote was neither fair nor democratic for at least a quarter of the population, and accused authority figures of putting party interests ahead of their constitutional obligations. EU and NATO ambassadors predicted on Monday that the repeat vote -- scheduled for the worst-hit polling stations -- should go without incident. (Utrinski Vesnik - 10/06/08; Makfax, A1 - 09/06/08)

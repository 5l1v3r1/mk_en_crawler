THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court, is expected to issue a ruling in Bosnia and Herzegovina's genocide case against Serbia on February 26th. If it wins the case, BiH could seek billions of euros in damages. The BiH Presidency's Bosniak member, Haris Silajdzic, said on Monday that the verdict would be observed by all. This was in response to a statement by Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, who vowed to ignore the verdict. 
In other news, Dodik said Monday that he would not meet a March 2nd deadline for reform of the Bosnian Serb police force. The EU has said that it would sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with BiH if the country merges the police forces of its two entities. (Reuters, Washington Times - 12/02/07)

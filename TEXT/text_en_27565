PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, leader of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), voiced satisfaction Monday (May 24th) with his party's performance in Sunday's elections. He pointed out that in Podgorica, where no party secured a clear majority, the DPS will hold discussions with its state-level partner, the Social Democratic Party (SDP). SDP leader Ranko Krivokapic seemed to sew it up, implying his party could not accept any group that questions Montenegro's independence as partners, which opposition parties do.

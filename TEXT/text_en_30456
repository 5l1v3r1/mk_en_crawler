PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX arrested 12 former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) on Wednesday (March 16th), for allegedly ordering and conducting torture in a Kosovo camp in 1999. Among those arrested is Fatmir Limaj, former transport and telecommunication minister. Limaj is accused of giving orders for the murder and torture of Serb and Albanian civilian prisoners in the village Klecke of Lipjan/Lipljane. This is not the first time he is facing a war crimes indictment; he was acquitted by The Hague war crimes tribunal in 2005. The KLA War Veterans Organisation rejected Wednesday's arrests as groundless. (Koha Ditore, Zeri, Kosova Sot, Express - 17/03/11; Kohavision, RTK - 16/03/11)

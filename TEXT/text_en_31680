SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Defence Minister Nikolai Svinarov says he expects the United States to submit an official request this week to use Bulgarian military bases and air space. Both he and Foreign Minister Solomon Passy promised that it would be approved by the Council of Ministers and would be passed on for approval by parliament if necessary.
On Friday (10 January) meanwhile, the left-wing opposition party Bulgarian Socialist Party officially demanded the resignations of Passy, EU Integration Minister Meglena Kuneva and Energy Minister Milko Kovachev. At issue are their roles in the decision to close Units 3 and 4 of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant, despite a decision to the contrary by parliament.

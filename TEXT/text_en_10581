ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday (12 November) that promises made by the West to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) have not been kept. Charging that the economic, cultural and educational isolation of the Turkish-run part of Cyprus has continued, he called on the international community to take steps to change the situation. The TRNC marks the 21st anniversary of its establishment Monday. (TurkishPress.com, Anadolu Agency - 13/11/04)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The central parliament of BiH rejected a key package of constitutional reforms Wednesday (26 April), despite an agreement between the country's seven main political parties to back the changes. The legislation, which would have shifted some power from the two entities to the central government, was supported by 26 deputies in the 42-seat house -- two short of the required two-thirds majority. Later on Wednesday, US Ambassador Douglas McElhaney, whose country has been mediating the constitutional reform process, and European Commission Ambassador Michael Humphreys expressed strong disappointment over the outcome. The international community had been urging adoption of the reforms in time for the October general elections. (Nezavisne novine, Dnevni avaz - 27/04/06; Reuters, Fena - 26/04/06)

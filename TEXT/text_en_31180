TIRANA, Albania -- EU mediator Miroslav Lajcak said on Thursday (February 3rd) that the Union is concerned that the situation in Albania may escalate further. After meeting with political leaders and President Bamir Topi in Tirana, Lajcak said the EU stands ready to help and has two main requests. The first is to start investigations into the violent January 21st demonstrations by independent institutions in order to hold accountable those responsible for the violence at the anti-government rally. The second is to immediately start political dialogue ahead of the May 8th local elections. These, he said, are steps that will bring the country back to the European integration agenda. The opposition plans to hold protests in Tirana, Vlora, Korca and Lezha on Friday. (Shekulli, Balkan Web, Top Channel, VoA - 03/02/11)

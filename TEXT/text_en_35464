BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian Constitutional Court on Thursday (15 April) blocked a law that would have made war crimes defendants in The Hague eligible for government assistance. The controversial legislation was proposed by the nationalist Radical Party and adopted with backing from Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's government. It would have allowed taxpayer money to be used to pay for the legal expenses of defendants in The Hague. Slobodan Milosevic and others facing war crimes trials would also have been made eligible to receive compensation for lost income.
In other news, Serbian Interior Minister Dragan Jocic said Thursday that former Bosnian Serb Army leader Ratko Mladic has not been in Serbia since 2002. Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte has repeatedly said otherwise. US aid to Serbia and prospects for EU integration are in jeopardy because of the continued failure to arrest Mladic and other indictees. (BBC, AFP - 16/04/04; B92, Tanjug - 15/04/04)

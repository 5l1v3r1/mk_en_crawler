SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Thousands Bosnian Muslims gathered in Srebrenica on Saturday (July 11th) for the burial of 534 newly identified victims of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. The remains were recently recovered from mass graves and were buried in the Potocari Memorial Park outside Srebrenica. They victims were among 8,000 Muslims killed in Europe's worst atrocity since World War II. Speaking at the ceremony, High Representative to BiH Valentin Inzko said the victims must not be forgotten and called for those responsible to be punished. 
The massacre was commemorated for the first time across Europe, but not in BiH itself. Last week, Bosnian Serb members of parliament blocked a resolution to proclaim July 11th a day of remembrance. In Belgrade on Friday, around 100 Serbian human rights groups staged a protest in front of the president's headquarters to demand July 11th be declared a day of commemoration.

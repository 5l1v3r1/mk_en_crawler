SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Already strained relations between Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and President Branko Crvenkovski worsened on Thursday (June 14th) when they met to discuss US President George W. Bush's recent meeting with Adriatic Charter country prime ministers in Tirana and the delayed formation of Macedonia's judicial council. After the meeting, Gruevski told reporters that, given his limited power, Crvenkovski's opinion is of no importance to the government. For his part, the president said Gruevski's suggestions are not the best way to achieve the common goals of EU and NATO membership. (Makfax, A1 TV, MRT, ANA-MPA, Focus 14/06/07)

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The government announced on Tuesday (August 10th) that Montenegro will offer citizenship to any member of the business community who invests over 500,000 euros in the country. According to a statement on the cabinet's website, the "economic citizenship programme" aims to persuade leading businessmen to move their companies to Montenegro. Podgorica recently granted citizenship to former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who fled his country to avoid corruption charges. Shinawatra has promised to invest in Montenegrin tourism. Tuesday's statement underscored that only those with "undisputable and credible biography and financial means" can apply for the citizenship programme.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO's new Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Tuesday (August 25th) that he is visiting Greece and Turkey this week because their bilateral problems are affecting the Alliance's efforts in Afghanistan and Africa. Rasmussen told reporters at NATO's headquarters in Brussels, "We have reached a point where this problem causes problems in our missions. In Afghanistan, NATO cannot conclude an agreement to support EU police," he added without mentioning Cyprus, which is the focus of strained relations between the two members of the organisation. As for Africa, Rasmussen pointed out that "off the Horn of Africa, both NATO and the EU have missions in the same area against piracy but we have no agreement on who will do what or how to support each other ... That is just two examples of how these problems have spread far beyond Turkey and Greece. Rasmussen, who took over at the helm of the Alliance on August 1st, visits Athens on Wednesday and Ankara on Thursday. (Kathimerini - 26/08/09; AFP, Worldbulletin - 25/08/09)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish authorities have started excavations at a new site in the southeastern province of Diyarbakir as part of a probe into alleged killings of Kurds by Turkish security forces in the 1990s, media reported on Thursday (April 2nd). Investigators started digging at a site near the village of Karacali after local villagers testified the area contained the graves of Kurds killed between 1994 and 1996. Similar excavations are already ongoing near two other southeastern towns, Silopi and Cizre.
In other news, Turkey's state-run Television and Radio Corporation (TRT) on Thursday launched Armenian- and Kurdish-language channels as part of Ankara's efforts to normalise relations with Armenia and boost the rights of its large Kurdish minority. The move is "a goodwill gesture" by Ankara ahead of US President Barack Obama's visit to Turkey on next week, according to media reports. Turkey has insisted that Obama, so as not to impede efforts to reconcile Turkey and Armenia, block a US lawmakers' resolution to recognise the killing of 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915-1917 as genocide.

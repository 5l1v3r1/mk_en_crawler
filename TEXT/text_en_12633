PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Kosovo police on Monday (6 June) assumed control of the bridge dividing the ethnic Albanian and Serb quarters of Mitrovica. French KFOR troops pulled out of the bridge to let an ethnically mixed 30-member squad move in. The authorities plan to reopen the bridge to traffic for two hours a day at first, and then permanently after July. According to UN officials quoted by international media, the move reflects the greatly improved situation in the area.
In other news, UN Deputy Secretary General Louise Frechette said during a visit to Pristina on Monday that the process for determining Kosovo's future would be decided only after an international review is completed of the province's progress in meeting international standards of democracy. The review would take place this summer. Frechette met with Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova and Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi. (Politika - 07/06/05; Reuters, KosovaLive, AP, Tanjug - 06/06/05)

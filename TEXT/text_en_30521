STRASBOURG, France -- The Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment on Tuesday (March 15th) criticised Greece for what it described as "unacceptable" treatment of illegal immigrants, warning of aggravated conditions at police stations and detention facilities. The committee said that Athens authorities have ignored recommendations they were given to improve the situation, while at the same time have "continuously asserted that action was being taken to improve the situation". 
Separately Wednesday, authorities in Athens said they have found the bodies of two more young Bangladeshis who tried to flee a ship that was evacuating them from Libya. The incident, near the island of Crete, happened earlier this month. Four bodies were recovered Tuesday, and three others were found shortly after the group of 49 left the ship using a rope to get into the water, prompting speculation that they did not want to return to Bangladesh. Two people remain missing. The rest of the group managed to swim to the shore. (Kathimerini - 16/03/11; Ta Nea, Nafthemporiki, To Vima, ANA-MPA, Council of Europe website - 15/03/11)

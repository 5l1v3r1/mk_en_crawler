THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Public hearings at The Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ) over an alleged Greek violation of a bilateral agreement between Skopje and Athens will start on Monday (March 21st). Over the next two days, Macedonia will present its oral arguments. It filed its complaint in November 2008, accusing Greece of breaching a 1995 interim agreement by blocking Skopje's NATO entry bid. Under the agreement, Athens "agreed "not to object" to Macedonia's application for membership in international organisations and institutions that refer to it as the Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EUFOR on Monday (November 19th) searched the home of prominent businessman Dragan Sojic in the town of Pale, east of Sarajevo, in a bid to locate former Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic. EUFOR says the operation was conducted at the request of the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, which suspects Sojic is part of Karadzic's support network. Karadzic has been on the run for 12 years. (Nezavisne Novine, Dnevni Avaz - 20/11/07; RTRS, Fena, NTV Hayat, AP, AFP - 19/11/07)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The world is losing patience with Serbia over its failure to arrest former Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus said Friday (13 January). He warned that there is a real threat that the EU could suspend Stabilisation and Association talks with Belgrade if the fugitive is not brought to justice. 
Serbia-Montenegro Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic is also calling for Mladic's arrest. In an interview published by the daily Politika, Ljajic said the issue could strengthen Belgrade's position in the Kosovo status talks, as well as boost Serbia-Montenegro's Euro-Atlantic bid.

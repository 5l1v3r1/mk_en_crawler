TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu called on the West not to look sceptically at the EU integration bids of Albania and other Western Balkan states, as well as Kosovo, during a speech Tuesday (9 May) marking Europe Day. Moisiu said that the prospect of EU membership is the sole way to guarantee peace, stability and progress in the region, and in turn, the whole continent. 
Also Tuesday, Prime Minister Sali Berisha urged the international community to assist in Albania's decentralisation reforms, during a donor conference in Tirana. Berisha warned that the country was lagging in this area and that the delay would have serious economic consequences. (Albanian News - 10/05/06; Albanian President Web site - 09/05/06)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Top Turkish and US generals continued a series of meetings on Saturday (November 24th) aimed at boosting co-operation against the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). General Bantz Craddock, commander of US forces in Europe, was the third US general to visit Turkey in a week. General David Petraeus, head of US forces in Iraq, and General James Cartwright, vice-chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, traveled to Ankara last Tuesday. Washington has vowed to help NATO ally Turkey combat the PKK. Ankara has deployed 100,000 troops at the border and says it is ready to strike PKK bases in northern Iraq. 
In other news, police used tear gas and rubber batons Sunday to disperse a demonstration by 40,000 Kurds in Diyarbakir, protesting attempts to ban the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP). Protesters chanted slogans in support of the DTP and jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan. Last week, Turkey's chief prosecutors asked the Constitutional Court to outlaw the DTP, claiming it has become a threat to Turkey's integrity due to its PKK links.

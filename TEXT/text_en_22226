SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak lacks the authority to intervene in the frozen foreign currency savings debt issue, Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said on Wednesday (May 14th). Nor, he said, does the BiH Constitutional Court have the authority to decide anything. Instead, he suggests, local institutions must solve the problem. Earlier this week, Lajcak urged the Constitutional Court to address issues arising from the existence of two laws -- at different levels of power -- that deal with the frozen foreign currency debt. Regulation of the old savings debt was originally under uniform, state-level purview. However, this past January, RS adopted its own legislation and introduced a separate system that violates BiH law, according to Lajcak's office. (RTRS, SRNA - 14/05/08)

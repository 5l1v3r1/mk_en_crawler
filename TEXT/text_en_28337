ATHENS, Greece -- Hundreds of tourists were left stranded outside the Acropolis museum in Athens on Tuesday (July 13th) as workers staged a four-hour protest against overdue pay and austerity reforms. Similar work stoppages were staged by state employees working in the Culture and Tourism Ministry and at archaeological sites across the country. Judges and prosecutors also held a two-hour protest over a planned pension system reform that would boost the retirement age. On Thursday, flights to and from Greece will be halted for four hours due to a strike by air traffic controllers, which is part of public sector walkout organised by the ADEDY labour union. It has urged all 500,000 members to march to parliament, where lawmakers will be voting on the pension reform bill. (Xinhua, AFP - 13/07/10; Reuters - 12/07/10)

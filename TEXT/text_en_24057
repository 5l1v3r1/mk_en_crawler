ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police arrested a senior Bosnian security official Friday (January 16th), suspected of involvement in the plotting of two murders in Croatia. Vjekoslav Vukovic, head of the department for combating organised crime at Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH's) security ministry, was detained in the northern city of Rijeka. Vukovic is suspected of having provided the weapon that was supposed to be used in the murders in Rijeka. Police managed to prevent the murders in October.
Meanwhile, border police at Gradiska in BiH arrested Bosnian Croat Tomo Jurinovic on Saturday. He is suspected of committing war crimes during the 1992-1995 conflict. Prosecutors link him to the illegal imprisonment, torture and abuse of a Serb family, which led to one death.
In other news, Bosnian Serb wartime commanders Momir Pelemis and Slavko Peric went before a court in Sarajevo on Friday and pleaded not guilty to charges of war crimes against Bosnian Muslims committed in July 1995 during the Srebrenica massacre. Pelemis, 59, and Peric, 41, are charged with involvement in the murder of about 1,700 Bosnian Muslims in the village of Pilica. They were arrested two months ago.

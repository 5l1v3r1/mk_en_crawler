BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu announced on Monday (20 February) that several days worth of consultations among parties in parliament, held at his request, have resulted in an agreement ensuring approval of a crucial anti-corruption bill. He urged lawmakers to pass and enforce the bill in the Official Gazette by 6 March, when an EU mission visits Romania to assess judicial reforms. Two weeks ago, the Senate rejected the draft after many supporters failed show up for the vote. (Nine o'clock - 21/02/06)

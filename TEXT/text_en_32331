ATHENS, Greece -- On Thursday (31 October), Finance Minister Nikos Christodoulakis cut Greece's growth estimates for 2003 and announced that the slowdown would result in budget deficits in coming years. The GDP forecast "is now 3.8 percent versus the previous target of 4.1 percent," Christodoulakis said. The 2002 budget will show a deficit of 1.2 per cent of GDP vs. the previous target of a 0.4 per cent surplus. For 2003, the budget target has been revised to a 0.9 percent deficit, from a 0.4 percent surplus, he said. The government expects this trend to persist into 2004 as well. (AP - 31/10/02)

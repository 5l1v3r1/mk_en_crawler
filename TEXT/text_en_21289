TIRANA, Albania -- Political parties agreed on Monday (September 29th) to earmark 30% of their candidate lists for women. That would mean 42 women in the 130-seat parliament starting next year, compared to just ten now. Most of them hold senior posts in their parties. (Koha Jone, Gazeta Shqiptare, Shqip - 29/09/08)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- During a visit to Belgrade on Monday (25 October), British Minister for Europe Denis MacShane said full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal would boost Serbia-Montenegro's European integration prospects. In separate talks with Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic and Serbian President Boris Tadic, MacShane stressed that indictees still at large are damaging national interests. He also called for an effective dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina in the process of seeking a solution to Kosovo's status. MacShane continued his trip to the region Tuesday, arriving in neighbouring Macedonia. (A1 TV, Makfax - 26/10/04; Beta, Tanjug, Makfax - 25/10/04)

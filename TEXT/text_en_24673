ANKARA, Turkey -- A problem with the left altimeter may have contributed to last week's crash of a Turkish Airlines 737 in Amsterdam, the Dutch safety board announced on Wednesday (March 4th). Nine people aboard died and 86 suffered injuries in the February 25th crash. In response Wednesday, Turkish Transport Minister Binal Yildirim said such a conclusion is premature. "The picture should be viewed in its completeness," Yildirim told journalists in Ankara. The Turkish Airline Pilots' Association echoed that sentiment. "The information that was announced is not a final report but preliminary investigations," Association head Ali Yilmaz told a press conference.

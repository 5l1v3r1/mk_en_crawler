LONDON, United Kingdom -- Germany and France are expected to adopt a tougher stand on the Turkish bid to join the EU when their leaders meet in SaarbrÃ¼cken on Tuesday (December 5th). The Financial Times reported on Monday that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Jacques Chirac would ask the EU to set an 18-month deadline for Turkey to end restrictions on Cypriot shipping and air traffic. The European Commission had not suggested the adoption of such a clause in its recommendation for a partial freeze of accession talks with Turkey. 
In other news, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Iran on Sunday. While the focus was the Middle East, particularly Iraq, Erdogan reportedly urged diplomatic means as the best way to resolve issues concerning Iran's nuclear programme.

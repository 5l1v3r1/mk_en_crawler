TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Fatos Nano on Wednesday (23 July) named replacements for Foreign Minister Ilir Meta and Integration Minister Sokol Nako, who resigned in protest over the government's policies. Marko Bello, former integration minister, will take over the foreign ministry, while Ermelinda Meksi, former economy minister, will serve as integration minister and deputy prime minister. The two candidates have been formally nominated by President Alfred Moisiu but must be approved by a simple majority in parliament. (AFP, BBC, ATA, Albanian Daily News - 23/07/03)

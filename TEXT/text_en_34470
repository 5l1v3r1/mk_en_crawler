NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Tassos Papadopoulos said Sunday (12 October) that Greek Cypriots are determined to find a solution to the island's division. He reiterated that it should be sought within the framework proposed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. Also on Sunday, however, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas said that Turkish Cypriots would not give up what he described as Turkey's legitimate rights to the island, adding that such an outcome would distort the balance of power in the region.

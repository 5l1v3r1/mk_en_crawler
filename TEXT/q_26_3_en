What is the standard procedure for the assessment of a visa application? To obtain a visa, aliens submit an application to the Diplomatic and Consular Mission of the Republic of Macedonia, using the appropriate form. The text of the form is written both in English and in Macedonian language, and may also be written in the language of the country where the application is submitted. Upon receiving the application, the authorised officer of the Diplomatic and Consular Mission of the Republic of Macedonia, assesses the eligibility of the visa application based on the enclosed documents and evidence and on the information received from the applicant. According to the Law on Movement and Residence of Aliens (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/92; 66/92; 26/93 and 45/02) and the Guideline on the Mode of Issuing Travel Documents and Visas to Aliens by the Diplomatic and Consular Missions of the Republic of Macedonia abroad and the Mode of Keeping Records of Issued Travel Documents and Visas to Aliens (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 10/98), the authorised officer asks for approval to issue the visa from the Ministry of the Interior in cases when:   The application is submitted by an alien from a country previously listed for visa requirement;    The person is appliying for a multiple or unlimited exit and entry visa for a period longer than six months;    There are entries regarding the alien in certain records;     The alien is a holder of a foreign travel document issued to refugees or stateless persons, emergency passport for aliens or another travel document which the foreign countries issue to aliens. In cases when an approval is not required, the authorised officer assesses the eligibility of the application and if he/she has any suspicions regarding the grounds for the application, the authenticity of the documents or the information received from the applicant, he/she may ask for verification of the authenticity of the documents from the institutions which have issued them or may request relevant operative verification by the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Macedonia. The authorised officer provides explanation on the grounds for suspicion. The final decision to issue or not to issue a visa is brought by the authorised officer after the verification procedure and based on obtained information.  Visas are issued by placing the prescribed visa form in the travel document, which has to be proper and valid. A proper travel document is a document which is not damaged, which contains all numbered pages, where data are written legibly, there are no traces of erased data, the photograph reliably shows the holder of the travel document, and there is space to affix the visa. A valid travel document is a document which is issued by a competent state body, and which grants the right to return to the issuing country or the right to entry into a third country, the validity of which has not expired and which the Republic of Macedonia recognises as a valid travel document for crossing the state border.  7. Does your country have online connections between visa-issuing authorities and the Foreign Ministry? Currently, there are no on-line connections between the visa issuing authorities and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The establishment of on-line connections between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the diplomatic and consular missions of the Republic of Macedonia is planned under the project for establishment of a Visa Centre at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is to be operational by the end of 2006  The Visa Centre will be a part of the integrated information system on integrated border management foreseen in the National Strategy on Integrated Border Management. 8. Does a national visa register/database exist (including granted visas and rejected visa applications)? The Law on Movement and Residence of Aliens (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/92; 66/92; 26/93  45/02), prescribes keeping records on issued visas.  The Diplomatic and Consular missions of the Republic of Macedonia abroad enter data on the issued and renewed travel documents and issued visas to aliens in Registers, in accordance with the Guideline on the Mode of Issuing Travel Documents and Visas to Aliens by Diplomatic and Consular Missions of the Republic of Macedonia and on the Mode of Keeping Records on the Issued Travel Documents and Visas to Aliens (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 10/98). The Register on issued visas to aliens contains:  Ordinal number,   Date of issuance,   First name and surname,  Nationality,   Type and number of the travel document and the issuing state,   Type of visa,   Serial number,   Expiry date,   Amount of the fees charged,   A note. Pursuant to the above-mentioned guidelines, the Diplomatic and Consular Missions of the Republic of Macedonia abroad, must inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Macedonia about the practices and problems related to issuing travel documents and visas to aliens, every six months. At the end of the calendar year, the Diplomatic and Consular missions of the Republic of Macedonia submit to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs a report on issuing travel documents and visas to aliens. In accordance with the Rulebook on the Mode of Issuance of Travel and Other Documents and Visas to Aliens and the form of the Documents and Visas (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 75/93), the Ministry of the Interior keeps records of visas issued at border crossing points. With the establishment of the Visa Centre, an establishment of a National Register as an electronic database on issued visas and rejected visa applications is foreseen.
9. What is your capacity to detect falsified documents? In the Republic of Macedonia the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are responsible for the control of documents. The consular offices of the Republic of Macedonia are equipped with basic devices for initial examination of the personal documents. The civil servants during the preparation period, prior to their assignment in the diplomatic or consular missions are introduced with the features and the ways of operating of these devices. Special emphasis is placed on careful visual examination. In the procedure of recognition and detection of falsified documents, the Border Police officers visually examine personal documents and compare it with specimen of the travel documents and visas. Concerning the technical devices, the border crossings are equipped with hand UV lamps, magnifying lamps and docu-tests.  Special training has been organised by foreign experts in which all Border Police officers from the border crossings in the Republic of Macedonia have participated. Border Police officers are also trained on their posts during their regular work.  The travel documents, visas, as well as other documents which are suspected to be falsified are being confiscated from the person, who possesses them. They are forwarded to the Forensic Department within the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Macedonia where a forensic investigation is conducted and the document is compared with an original specimen by qualified police officers.  In case there is no original specimen upon which the comparison could be made, further checks of the authenticity of the documents are pursued by the International Police Cooperation Sector, which also includes the National Central Bureau – Interpol Skopje. Original specimen and check-up in the database are provided through Interpol. The Republic of Macedonia, through Interpol, participates in the database for stolen travel documents which enables the border crossings to check within this database if a certain foreign travel document is being stolen in an Interpol member country.

10. Do the existing visas allow applicants to work in your country without a residence permit or working licence?  Pursuant to the Law on Movement and Residence of Aliens (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/92, 66/92, 26/93 and 45/02), the visa represents a permission to enter and reside in the Republic of Macedonia for a certain period of time. The visa does not authorise the applicant to work without a residence permit and a working permit, except for business visas.  If the applicant comes to the Republic of Macedonia with the intention of employment, he/she must previously obtain an entry/exit visa from the Diplomatic and Consular Mission. The visa is in the form of a sticker with a designation of the purpose of the stay “for employment”. After the entry, the alien first obtains a working permit from the Employment Agency, and subsequently, based on that permit, a permit for temporary residence is issued by the Ministry of the Interior, for purposes of employment within the period of validity of the working permit. For more details see answer 02_A_01The business visa issued to an alien is valid as a temporary residence permit. For more details see answer 02_A_01
11. Does your legislation foresee any provision for the punishment of persons entering your territory without a passport? If not, do your authorities have the intention to introduce any amendment in this sense and when will this be done?  Article 4 of the Law on Movement and Residence of Aliens (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/92, 66/92, 26/93 and 45/02), provides that a foreigner may be allowed to enter and reside on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia if he/she holds a valid travel document or other document issued in accordance with international agreements, or a travel document issued by the Ministry of the Interior, or by the Diplomatic or Consular missions of the Republic of Macedonia abroad. The travel document shall contain a visa, unless otherwise determined by an international agreement or by the provisions of the said Law.  A foreigner who is not in possession of a valid travel document and who comes to the country for a tourist or a business visit, in the course of carrying out the border crossing control by the Ministry of the Interior, a tourist pass, as an exception, may be issued, on the basis of an identity card or other document determining the identity, valid in the country of origin of the alien.  The legislation of the Republic of Macedonia contains provisions, which prescribe sanctions for persons entering the country without a travel document:  Article 84 - penal provisions of the Law on Movement and Residence of Aliens (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/92, 66/92, 26/93 and 45/02) - prescribes that for committed misdemeanour a fine shall be imposed to an alien who crosses or attempts to cross the state border at places outside the designated border crossing points or without a valid travel document.

Pursuant to Article 29 of the Rulebook on the Mode of Issuing Travel and Other Documents and Visas to Aliens and the Form of the Documents and Visas (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 75/93) the Ministry of the Interior issues visas to aliens (at border crossings) in the following cases:    Transit visas to aliens transiting the territory of the Republic of Macedonia;    Single entry-exit visas to aliens coming to the Republic of Macedonia for tourist visits, with a three month validity; and    Entry/exit visas to aliens working on international transportation facilities and to aliens which entering in the country is based on other eligible grounds with a validity period necessary to perform the duties.

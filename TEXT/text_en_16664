BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) released monitoring reports Wednesday (November 8th) on Turkey and seven other EU hopefuls. As expected, Ankara was criticised for slowing the pace of reforms. The EC also gave Turkey until mid-December to open its ports to Cypriot ships, or face unspecified consequences. The Commission pressed Croatia, the other candidate already in negotiations, to fight corruption harder, reform its judiciary and administration, and speed economic reforms. Rising trade imbalances remain problematic, it said. Despite hopes in Skopje, a concrete date for opening accession talks with Macedonia was not given, and the country was urged to step up reforms in a number of areas. 
Reports were also issued on progress in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo. (BBC, CNN, European Commission press releases -- 08/11/06)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- At a special plea hearing Thursday (March 24th), Montenegrin Veselin Vlahovic, known as the "Monster of Grbavica" denied all charges brought against him at BiH's war crimes court. Last month, prosecutors pressed 56 charges against Vlahovic for war crimes committed against Bosniaks and Croats in Sarajevo in 1992 and 1993. As a member of a paramilitary group, Vlahovic allegedly took part in murders, rapes, illegal detention and torture of non-Serb civilians. Vlahovic was arrested a year ago in Spain and was handed over to Bosnian authorities in August. (Vecernje Novosti, Nezavisne Novine, Mondo, Glas Javnosti, B92 - 24/03/11)

MOSCOW, Russia -- Greek Defence Minister Spilios Spiliotopoulos visited Moscow on Thursday (4 November) to meet with Russian counterpart Sergei Ivanov. Boosting military and technical co-operation was the main item on the agenda. The ministers also discussed the Greek Parliament's investigation into the purchase of Russian TOR-M1 weaponry systems and ZUBR hovercraft by the former Socialist-led government. Spiliotopoulos said the investigation is a domestic issue regarding possible violations in the public procurement process, and does not concern the quality of Russian armaments. (ANA - 04/11/04)

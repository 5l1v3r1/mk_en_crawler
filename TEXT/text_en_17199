ATHENS, Greece -- Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis reacted strongly on Thursday (December 28th) to a move by the Macedonian government to change Skopje's "Petrovec" airport to "Alexander the Great" and Ohrid's airport to "Apostle Paul". She accused the Macedonian leadership of trying to twist history. "Alexander the Great was a leading personality of worldwide range, spreading Greek civilisation all over the world at the time," Bakoyannis said, warning that the move could hamper Macedonia's EU bid.

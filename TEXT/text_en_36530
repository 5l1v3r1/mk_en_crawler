TIRANA, Albania -- The EU warned Albania on Friday (6 August) that it could suspend talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement if next year's elections are not free and fair. Lutz Salzmann, chief of the EU office in Tirana, urged politicians from all parties to put aside their differences and develop a legal and institutional framework that would guarantee fair elections in June 2005. He also called on them to "distance themselves from the black market economy". Salzmann cited the findings of European law enforcement experts, who have determined that many criminals go unpunished in Albania because they enjoy political protection. (AFP - 06/08/04)

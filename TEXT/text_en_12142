PARIS, France -- A donor conference aimed at raising money for the restoration and preservation of Kosovo's cultural heritage ended Friday (13 May) with concrete commitments for $10m to $15m in financial assistance, and a pledge for more funding in the future. UNESCO, in co-operation with the European Commission, the Council of Europe and UNMIK, organised the event in Paris. Donors were asked to help with the rebuilding and protection of nearly 75 cultural and religious monuments that were destroyed or damaged during the 1998-1999 conflict and subsequent violence.

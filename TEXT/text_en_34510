BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska President Dragan Cavic vowed Tuesday (7 October) that authorities would increase efforts to arrest war crimes suspects. Cavic and US Ambassador-at-large for War Crimes Issues Pierre-Richard Prosper signed a joint statement in Banja Luka calling on all suspects to surrender. They also urged the population to help local authorities locate key indictees, including former Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. Prosper said the country's road to EU and NATO accession depends on Karadzic's extradition to The Hague.
In other news Tuesday, the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Republika Srpska welcomed an agreement between BiH and Serbia-Montenegro on the return of refugees. The organisation said it hopes the deal would speed up efforts to resolve property and tenancy issues and other refugee problems.

VIENNA, Austria -- German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier urged all sides Thursday (January 18th) to accept the proposal that UN envoy for Kosovo status Martti Ahtisaari will be submitting soon. In a speech to the Permanent Council of the OSCE, Steinmeier noted that lasting peace and stability in the Western Balkans is one of the priorities of Germany's EU presidency. It is important to build a multiethnic Kosovo where the rights of ethnic Albanians and non-Albanians are respected, he said.Steinmeier also stressed that the solution to the Kosovo status issue will not set a precedent for others in the region.
UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker, meanwhile, says Ahtisaari will visit Pristina in February to present his proposal. On Thursday, Ruecker met with the province's Political-Strategic Group for Transition, which is preparing for the transfer of responsibilities from UNMIK to local institutions.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic said on Thursday (December 24th) that Serbia should not hurry to file a genocide lawsuit against Croatia at the International Court of Justice. His comment followed media reports suggesting an expert team in Belgrade had wrapped up its work on the case, to counter a lawsuit Croatia filed about ten years ago. 
Zagreb wants compensation from Serbia and Montenegro for the human toll and material damage suffered during the 1991-1995 conflicts among the former Yugoslav republics. Croatia says the Serbian army killed more than 20,000 Croats in ethnic cleansing campaigns. Tadic said on Friday "In my opinion it would have been better if ... issues regarding the civil rights of both Croat and Serb citizens could be solved in processes which did not have such deep implications."
Separately Thursday, the leader of the Croatian Independent Democratic Serb Party, Milorad Pupovac, said in Belgrade that he has already asked Croatian President Stipe Mesic to withdraw the lawsuit against Serbia before his term ends in February."The last thing Serbs living in Croatia need is reviving the debate about genocide," Pupovac said, adding that instead of suing each other, the two countries should negotiate.

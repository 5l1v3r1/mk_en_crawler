TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha, leader of the ruling Democratic Party (DP), explicitly denied at the weekend that there are conflicts within the ruling coalition serious enough to threaten the cabinet. Berisha acknowledged that there is an "acceptable diversity of thoughts" within the coalition but stressed that the government is stable and working successfully on set reforms. Local media have been speculating recently that some of the coalition allies were critical of legislative proposals by DP and of Berisha's recent personnel change in the cabinet. Last week's surprise resignation of Foreign Minister Besnik Mustafaj forced the shuffle. (Top-Channel, Shekulli, Balkanweb - 29/04/07)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling and European Commission Ambassador Michael Humphreys jointly called for parliament to adopt key constitutional changes Sunday (16 April). On Tuesday, the draft, based on an agreement reached among BiH's main parties, is to be debated by a committee of parliament's lower house. According to the statement, the importance of the constitutional reforms -- aimed at strengthening state institutions -- and the brief time before the next general elections allow for no further delays.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic warned on Tuesday (28 December) that any member of the BiH Armed Forces found to be helping war crimes indictees or withholding information about fugitives' whereabouts would face disciplinary action and legal measures. At a news conference, Radovanovic confirmed that High Representative Paddy Ashdown recently demanded the ministry investigate whether wartime Republika Srpska military commander Ratko Mladic resided in underground army facilities over the summer. The probe is to be completed by 10 January. 
In other news, an extraordinary meeting Tuesday of the BiH presidency, the BiH cabinet and leaders of the main parties ended without an agreement on how to resolve the current political crisis. Two Serb ministers resigned from the cabinet and may be followed by two more, in the wake of sanctions imposed by Ashdown.

WASHINGTON, United States -- US prosecutors have charged Almir Rrapo, a former Albanian government official, with a series of crimes committed in New York. The office of the general prosecutor said on Tuesday (August 24th) that Rrapo and an associate, Florian Veshi, are accused of murder, extortion, arson, kidnapping and racketeering. Albanian police arrested Rrapo in early July at the US embassy. Reports suggest he was a senior administrative assistant to Foreign Minister Ilir Meta. Veshi, on the other hand, was arrested on Monday by the FBI and New York police. The two are part of a larger group of 16 who are charged with murdering two people, kidnapping and trafficking 680kg of marijuana. (VoA, Top Channel, Ora News - 25/08/10; AP - 24/08/10)

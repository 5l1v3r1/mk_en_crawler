SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The US Embassy in Sarajevo warned on Friday (December 19th) that a campaign is being led against US diplomat Raffi Gregorian, the second highest ranking international community official in the country. "Unfortunately, over the last several months an appalling campaign has been conducted against US diplomats falsely portraying them as "out to get" specific individuals or institutions. The environment created by this campaign has the potential to transform threats, however empty in themselves, into dangerous actions," the embassy said in a statement. Gregorian is the principal deputy of High Representative Miroslav Lajcak, responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Dayton Accord. Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik has publicly accused Gregorian and other international officials of working against Republika Srpska's interest. (AFP, Dnevni Avaz, US Embassy website - 19/12/08)

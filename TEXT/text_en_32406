BUCHAREST, Romania -- The two chambers of parliament have scheduled joint debates on a no confidence vote against the government for Monday (31 March). The opposition filed the motion late last week following the adoption of the amended anti-corruption legislative package. Opposition lawmakers describe the new regulations as inefficient and designed to meet "economic" interests of the ruling majority. However, the party of the Hungarian minorities supports the package, likely giving the ruling Social Democrats the votes they will need to survive the motion. (Nine O'Clock - 25/03/03)

ATHENS, Greece -- Farmers staged protests across the country Tuesday (January 20th), demanding higher subsidies for agriculture, better pensions and lower fuel taxes. Protesters closed the Iraklio Airport on the island of Crete. Authorities cancelled flights after farmers blocked the airplane parking area with tractors and heavy machinery. Protesters also shut down two major highways and several secondary roads in central and northern Greece. The protests also forced the Promahonas border crossing at the northern border with Bulgaria to close. Road blockades are continuing Wednesday, media reported. Farmers' representatives will meet with Agriculture Minister Sotirios Hatzigakis to discuss their demands.

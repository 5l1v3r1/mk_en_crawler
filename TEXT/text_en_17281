SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Council of Ministers' (CoM) first 100 days in office were marred by the failure to reach political agreement on key police and constitutional reforms, CoM Chairman Nikola Spiric said on Sunday (May 27th) in an interview with Nezavisne Novine. He stressed that these issues would be the focus in the months ahead, as they are the main obstacles to Euro-Atlantic integration. He added he would insist that work on all EU-related reforms be accelerated. (Nezavisne Novine, RTRS - 27/05/07)

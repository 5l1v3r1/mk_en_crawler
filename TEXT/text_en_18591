BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU security chief Javier Solana said Monday (May 7th) that a new UN Security Council resolution regarding Kosovo is required for settling the status issue, and for the planned deployment of an EU mission there to replace the current UN one. In a speech to the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee in Brussels, Solana called on the 27 EU countries to support UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for supervised independence of the province. He said a unified Europe could influence sceptics Russia and China -- both of which are permanent UN Security Council members -- as well as South Africa, a non-permanent member. EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn also addressed the panel, echoing the importance of bloc unity.

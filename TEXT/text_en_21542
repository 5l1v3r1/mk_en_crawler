ANKARA, Turkey -- Warplanes launched fresh air strikes against terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) camps in northern Iraq on Wednesday (April 23rd). The general staff confirmed on its website that the attack targeted a major PKK camp in Khakurk, where the borders of Iraq, Turkey and Iran meet. It added the warplanes had "neutralised" the armed group but provided no information on casualties. Turkish bombers last hit targets in northern Iraq a week ago.
The Anadolu news agency meanwhile is reporting that police arrested a suspected suicide bomber in the town of Tarsus. Police say she was carrying explosives and a detonator. Her alleged target was a local police station. (Hurriyet - 24/04/08; NTV, AP, RIA Novosti - 23/04/08)

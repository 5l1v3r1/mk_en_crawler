BUCHAREST, Romania -- The new cabinet led by Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu was formally sworn in at a ceremony at the Cotroceni Palace on Wednesday (29 December), a day after being approved by parliament. In the end, 265 deputies supported the nominees and 200 voted against them, giving Tariceanu a clear majority. He listed fighting corruption, guaranteeing freedom of expression and boosting judicial independence as his top priorities, and said tax reform will be the focus during the last few days of the year. He had to make one quick personnel change, dropping 29-year old Cristina Parvulescu as the nominee for European Integration Minister and replacing her with the more experienced Emil Dinga.

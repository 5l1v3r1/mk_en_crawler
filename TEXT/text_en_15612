SKOPJE, Macedonia -- VMRO-DPMNE, which won the 5 July parliamentary elections in Macedonia, has said it might not continue talks with the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) unless the latter refrains from negative rhetoric. At issue are comments from DUI warning of "consequences" if it is not invited to join the new cabinet. VMRO-DPMNE has condemned the comments and says it will not pursue a coalition accord at any price. 
According to media reports, meanwhile, the talks between VMRO-DPMNE and its potential allies on distribution of seats in the cabinet are expected to be finalised Tuesday. The Democratic Party of Albanians and the New Social Democratic Party are expected to be partners in the future ruling coalition. (Vecer, MRT - 24/07/06; A1 TV - 23/07/06; Dnevnik, Vest - 22/07/06)

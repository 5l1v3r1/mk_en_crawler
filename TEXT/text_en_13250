SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The trade union representing Bulgarian teachers announced on Sunday (27 November) that it is ready to stage a general strike over what is perceives as insufficient funding for the educational sector in the 2006 state budget. Union leader Yanka Takeva said that since silent protests staged across the country last week brought no results, teachers are prepared to step up their efforts. 
Neighbouring Romania has similar problems in its education sector, where a teachers' strike has continued for several weeks. Weekend talks between the government and the teachers' unions reportedly failed. (bTV, Nine o'clock - 28/11/05)

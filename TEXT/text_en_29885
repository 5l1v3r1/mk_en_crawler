ZAGREB, Croatia -- Justice Minister Drazen Bosnjakovic confirmed on Monday (January 24th) that his ministry has received a list from Serbia containing the names of 33 veterans suspected of war crimes: Croatian citizens who were charged or were investigated by former Yugoslavia military courts. Bosnjakovic stressed that the list is not final, as Serbian authorities continue to update it. The list was delivered as part of an agreement reached recently between Bosnjakovic and Serbian counterpart Snezana Malovic regarding war crimes suspects. The meeting followed the arrest of Croatian war veteran Tihomir Purda in Bosnia and Herzegovina, based on a warrant issued by Serbia, for alleged war crimes committed in Vukovar.

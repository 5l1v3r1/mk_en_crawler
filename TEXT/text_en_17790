BELGRADE, Serbia -- The country's largest party, the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, called on Thursday (March 22nd) for early elections at all levels -- parliamentary, presidential and local. Party vice president Dragan Todorovic said the pro-Western democratic bloc parties have proven unable to form new coalition two months after the general elections. The Radicals won 81 seats in the 250-member Parliament, short of a ruling majority. 
Meanwhile, coalition negotiations among the democratic bloc are continuing. Local media reports Friday suggested that incumbent Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica would likely keep his job. (Politika, Danas, Blic, Vecernje Novosti - 23/03/07; Tanjug, AP - 22/03/07)

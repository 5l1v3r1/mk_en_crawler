TIRANA, Albania -- Serbia is close to removing its visa regime with Albania, Deputy Foreign Minister Zdravko Ponos said on Wednesday (June 23rd) during a visit to Shkodra. Ponos met with representatives of the Serbian and Montenegrin minority in northern Albania. "One of the issues discussed with my colleagues was visas. Albania has already lifted the visa regime, while Serbia will soon decide and enable free movement as part of the European integration of the region," Ponos said. Albania abolished its visa regime for Serbian citizens last month. (Shekulli, News 24, Top News - 23/06/10)

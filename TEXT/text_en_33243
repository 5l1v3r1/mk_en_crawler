ZAGREB, Croatia -- Representatives of the US State Department are expected in Zagreb Wednesday (11 June) for talks on signing a reciprocal immunity agreement, exempting citizens from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Given strong objections from the EU, Croatia has been hesitant to conclude the deal. Washington has set a 1 July deadline, indicating that US military assistance might otherwise be suspended.

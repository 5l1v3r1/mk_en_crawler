SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The three ruling coalition parties pledged Monday (28 June) to wrap up power decentralisation talks by the end of the week. The Social Democratic Alliance for Macedonia, the Liberal Democratic Party, and the Democratic Union for Integration said they would do everything possible to reach a compromise, allowing local elections to be held before 17 October. They stressed it would be unacceptable to select local administration heads under the old system of territorial division. Meanwhile, the main opposition party, VMRO-DPMNE, said Monday that it would insist that a new chairman of the State Electoral Commission be voted into office prior to the local elections.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prosecutors in Dubrovnik have pressed charges against former Trebinje Mayor Bozidar Vucurevic, local media reported on Sunday (October 12th). Vucurevic is suspected of committing war crimes against civilians and destroying cultural and historical monuments between 1991 and 1995. An investigating judge has issued an arrest warrant. Prosecutors say Vucurevic, individually and in co-operation with former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, planned, instigated, ordered and supported the idea of creating a Great Serbia by occupying and integrating parts of Croatian territory, and by banishing the Croatian population there. Media in Bosnia and Herzegovina reported a month ago that Vucurevic suffered a stroke and is recovering at a Trebinje hospital. (HRT, RTRS, SRNA, Monitor, Jutarnji List - 12/10/08)

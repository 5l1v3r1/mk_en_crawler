THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said in a statement Wednesday (August 11th) he wants his trial postponed by three weeks to allow him time to review recordings found in the apartment of fugitive Ratko Mladic's wife. Karadzic's trial is due to resume on August 17th. The so-called Mladic tapes -- 93 audio and ten video tapes, two CDs and eight DVDs -- were found in a March raid on the Belgrade apartment of Mladic's wife and given to Karadzic's defence team on August 4th.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Council of Ministers adopted a draft law on the High Judicial and Appeals Council Thursday (11 March). Establishment of this body is expected to foster reorganisation of the country's judicial and appeals system and result in a stronger, more efficient judiciary. At the same session, the BiH government endorsed the draft law on preventing money laundering. The bill is aimed at regulating mechanisms and competencies in the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism, as well as bolstering international co-operation in this field. Both drafts were forwarded to the BiH Parliament for urgent approval. (PBS BiH, NTV Hayat - 11/03/04)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Boyko Borisov announced on Sunday (May 2nd) that Interior Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov will be the ruling Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) party's candidate in the 2011 presidential election. "I got angry with analysts suggesting I would try to escape from responsibility [by running] in the presidential elections. I am not escaping ... I will remain prime minister until the end," Borisov said in an interview with local daily 24 Chasa. His government's mandate expires in 2013. He also denied rumours that he plans a government reshuffle this month that would remove Finance Minister Simeon Dyankov. (Darik, 24 Chasa, Dnevnik - 02/05/10)

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus and Croatian Economy Minister Ljubo Jurcic signed a free trade agreement Monday (23 December) that was nearly a year in the making. Under the agreement, customs fees and duties would be reduced gradually over a five-year period, while actual free trade would begin in 2007. By then, 70 per cent of consumer goods and 30 per cent of agricultural products should be imported by both countries free of customs duties. The deal must be approved by the parliaments of each country. That is likely to happen during the first quarter of 2003. (AP, AFP - 24/12/02; Tanjug, B92, BBC, AFP - 23/12/02)

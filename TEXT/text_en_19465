BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu asked the Constitutional Court on Thursday (January 24th) to rule in a dispute between the government and President Traian Basescu. At issue is Basescu's refusal to appoint Norica Nicolai as new justice minister, citing concerns about her past behaviour and public image. The government is asking the court to determine if that refusal is unconstitutional. The cabinet cites a precedent involving Foreign Minister Adrian Cioroianu, whose nomination Basescu rejected, citing lack of experience. The court, however, ruled in favour of the appointment.

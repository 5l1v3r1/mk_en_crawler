BELGRADE, Serbia -- Four of the eleven people accused of helping war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic evade justice pleaded not guilty before the Belgrade Second Municipal Court on Monday (November 20th). Former Republika Srpska (RS) security officer Marko Lugonja, former Serb army pilot Stanko Ristic and two other Serbs, Ratko Vucetic and Ljiljana Vaskovic, entered pleas. A fifth defendant, former RS army officer Sasa Badnjar, refused to do so. The remaining defendants face hearings shortly. If convicted, each faces up to eight years in prison.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The human rights group Amnesty International is asking the EU to exert pressure on Croatia to deal with shortcomings in its judicial system and step up prosecution of war crimes. Amnesty's programme director Nicola Duckworth said on Wednesday (February 2nd) after talks with EU officials in Brussels that the bloc should take into consideration the group's concerns when deciding whether the country meets the benchmarks for EU membership. The human rights watchdog issued a report in December, highlighting "the failings of Croatia's justice system". European Parliament members Hannes Swoboda and Doris Pack say the report should not impact the completion of Croatia's accession talks. (Hina, Nova TV, AKI, MIA - 02/02/11)

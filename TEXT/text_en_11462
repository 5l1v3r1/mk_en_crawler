SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The interior ministry announced on Wednesday (20 April) that the National Service for Fighting Against Organised Crime has broken a human trafficking channel, with the assistance of the FBI office in Sofia, as well as German and French services. The channel, which trafficked illegal immigrants to EU member states using forged documents, was under watch for six months in Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey.
In other news, official statistics suggest employment in Bulgaria's informal or grey economy was cut almost twofold in the past two years. It is estimated that around 14 per cent of all workers are currently engaged in the grey economy. (Sega, 24 Chasa - 21/04/05; Mediapool - 20/04/05)

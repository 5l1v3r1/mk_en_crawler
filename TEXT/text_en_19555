SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Deputy Foreign Minister Feim Chaushev, a member of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, resigned on Monday (March 24th) because of an ongoing controversy over his use of two different names, Petar and Feim. Petar was given to him during a time when the former communist regime sought to assimilate Bulgaria's Turkish minority. He has used this name in business dealings. The second name, Feim, was actually his birth name, but he did not begin going by it until he joined the cabinet. While his identification documents were all issued under the name Petar, he signed official documents using the name Feim, which is technically a violation of the law. 
Chaushev has been an important figure in Bulgarian foreign policy. He played a role in convincing Tripoli to release six Bulgarian medics who had faced the death penalty in Libya. (24 Chasa - 25/03/08; AFP, BGNES, BTA, Actualno, Darik - 24/03/08)

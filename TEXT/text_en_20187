ATHENS, Greece -- The nationwide 24-hour strike against the government's planned pension system reform ended early Thursday (February 14th) in success, according to organisers. In Athens alone, 8,000 people gathered in front of parliament headquarters, demanding that the government drop its pension reform plans and efforts to privatise the main port facilities. Unionists fear that combining various pension funds into a few big structures will result in lower incomes and pensions. 
In other news, an earthquake measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale shook southern Greece on Thursday, from the Peloponnese region to Athens. No injuries or damage was reported. (Focus, ITAR-TASS, ERT, BBC - 14/02/08; ANA-MPA, UPI - 13/02/08)

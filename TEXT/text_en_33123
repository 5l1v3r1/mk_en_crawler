BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The time is not right to call early general elections, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic said Sunday (18 May). Given the support the government enjoys from parliament, he said, it will continue to work until its regular term expires at the end of next year. He added that several conditions have to be met before early elections are even considered, including adoption of a new Serbian constitution, changes to the election law and agreement on a single voter registration list.
In other news Sunday, Gen Blagoje Grahovac, an adviser to Serbian-Montenegrin President Svetozar Marovic, proposed that a joint Balkan battalion be created. He suggested that NATO officers assume a central role in the command of the "common defence system".
Meanwhile, Republika Srpska Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic is to visit Belgrade on Monday. He will meet with government officials and representatives of the business community. (Tanjug, Beta, B92, BBC, FoNet, FENA - 18/05/03)

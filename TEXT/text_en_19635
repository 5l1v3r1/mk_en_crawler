SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Serbian President Boris Tadic on Saturday (October 27th) urged High Representative Miroslav Lajcak to reconsider a set of reform measures that have angered Serbian leaders and the Serb population. The measures, announced by Lajcak last week, were aimed at preventing any of the country's two autonomous entities from blocking the work of the joint Bosnian parliament and other bodies. 
Serbian leaders and the Serb population in BiH are accusing Lajcak of attempting to abolish their entity. RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik has threatened to walk out of the joint institutions. (BHRT, Makfax, RTRS, SRNA, Beta, Tanjug, B92, AP, HRT, NTV Hayat - 27/10/07)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Vasile Puscas, Romania's chief negotiator with the EU, said Thursday (12 June) that the European Commission is urging faster reforms so the country could meet a 2007 accession deadline. In a speech to the Romania-EU joint consultative committee, which is holding a two-day meeting in Bucharest, Puscas said Romania has three main priorities in the preparation process: obtaining market economy status, consolidating the public administration and modernising domestic institutions in line with EU requirements.

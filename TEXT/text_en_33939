SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Macedonian Parliament approved on Friday (7 November) the appointment of four ministers, in the first reshuffle of Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski's cabinet. Parliament Speaker Nikola Popovski will head the finance ministry; Stevce Jekimovski will become economic minister; and Ixhet Memeti and Agron Buxhaku will take over as ministers of justice and transport. The opposition VMRO-DPMNE and the Democratic Party of Albanians voted against the changes.
In other news, Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski said on Saturday that all citizens who surrender their illegally possessed weapons would be welcomed even after the official deadline of the weapons collection campaign, which expires 15 December. Trajkovski declined to speculate on the success of the campaign, but said the results reported so far are higher in comparison to similar initiatives in neighbouring countries.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A convoy of Macedonian goods left Wednesday (28 January) for Montenegro, marking the reopening of the Macedonian-Montenegrin transit route via Kosovo. Transit of goods was suspended in 1999 due to the Kosovo crisis. The issue was resolved in December when representatives of the customs administrations of Macedonia, Kosovo and Montenegro agreed to resume deliveries via the route.
In other news Wednesday, Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister Musa Xhaferi kicked off a three-day working visit to London to discuss bilateral issues and implementation of the Ohrid Peace Accord. (Dnevnik - 29/01/04; Makfax, MIA - 28/01/04)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Greece and Turkey have agreed on further confidence-building measures under NATO auspices, Secretary General George Robertson said Wednesday (23 July). Robertson said the two countries "have agreed on co-operation between their national defence colleges, for example in the field of science and on subjects of mutual interest, such as NATO issues, military doctrines, crisis management, peacekeeping, natural disasters, environmental issues and others." Athens and Ankara, often at odds, earlier agreed to inform each other about upcoming military exercises.
In other developments, the Alliance released details Wednesday of the new NATO structure approved by defence ministers earlier this month. Headquartered in Izmir, Turkey, the new streamlined military command structure is described as being more flexible, efficient and better suited to conduct the full range of NATO missions.

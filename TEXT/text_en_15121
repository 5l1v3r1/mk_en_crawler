LONDON, United Kingdom -- The EU foreign ministers will respond to a declaration by Turkey that said extending the customs union with the EU to Cyprus does not amount to formal recognition, the Union's British presidency announced Wednesday (31 August). The "counter-declaration" has been placed on the agenda of the ministers' meeting in Wales on Thursday. According to the Brussels-based publication EU Observer, Ankara's pronouncement could be termed an "additional, unilateral document with limited influence", not affecting the provisions of the protocol itself. Cyprus, an EU member, is threatening to block the launch of accession talks with Ankara on 3 October because of the issue. (Reuters, AFP - 01/09/05; EU Observer, NTV - 31/08/05)

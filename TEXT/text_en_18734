KLINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Forensic experts began work Thursday (July 5th) on a newly discovered mass grave in Klina, 60km west of Pristina. A shepherd stumbled onto human remains earlier this week. It is not immediately clear whether the victims were Serbs or ethnic Albanians, as the area had a mixed population during the 1999 conflict. At one time, Klina was a battlefield between KLA guerrillas and Serbian forces. An estimated 100 ethnic Albanian residents of the area remain missing.

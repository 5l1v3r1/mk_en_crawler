ANKARA, Turkey -- No parliamentary committee will be established to draft a new constitution after all, Parliament Speaker Mehmet Ali Sahin announced on Wednesday (October 6th). He says the various parties in parliament have not agreed on the need for such a panel. This is despite the fact that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- who leads the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) -- last month agreed with Kemal Kilicdaroglu, chairman of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), on establishing the parliamentary committee. That was after September 12th referendum on a series of constitutional reforms. Sahin singled out the AKP parliamentary group, which, he says, doesn't want the issue of the new constitution addressed before the parliamentary elections, scheduled for June/July 2011. The CHP, on the other hand, wants work to begin immediately. (Hurriyet, Milliyet - 06/10/10)

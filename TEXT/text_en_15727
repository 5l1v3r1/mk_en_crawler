ZAGREB, Croatia -- FIFA announced on Friday (18 August) that it launched disciplinary proceedings against the Croatian Football Federation (HNS) following the actions of some Croatian fans during a friendly against Italy, played in Livorno on Wednesday (16 August). Around 200 fans formed a human swastika at the stadium and many gave Nazi salutes. HNS chief Vlatko Markovic has described the behaviour as "shocking" and "disappointing". Officials are concerned the incident could harm Croatia's bid to host the 2012 European Championship. (HINA, AP - 18/08/06)

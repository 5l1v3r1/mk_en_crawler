LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Agriculture Minister Franci But told reporters Monday (6 October) that his country refuses to accept Croatia's decision to set up an Adriatic environmental zone. "It is a unilateral and unacceptable move since it threatens Slovenian interests concerning fishing in international waters and the protection of the environment in the Adriatic," he said. Zagreb dropped earlier plans to establish an exclusive economic zone in the area after a bitter diplomatic row with Slovenia. (AFP - 06/10/03)

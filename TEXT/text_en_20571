ANKARA, Turkey -- An unnamed foreign ministry official, quoted by the newspaper Zaman, confirmed on Sunday (September 9th) that Turkey has demanded an official explanation from Israel regarding fuel tanks found near Turkey's border with Syria. The request follows Syria's claim last week that Israeli aircraft entered its airspace and dropped "munitions" onto deserted areas after being shot at by Syrian air defences. The planes reportedly also entered Turkish airspace.
Israel has not commented on the incident. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem is in Turkey to discuss bilateral ties as well as the alleged incursion. 
In other news, security officials confirmed on Sunday that several members of the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party were arrested because they publicly described rebels from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party as "martyrs". If convicted under the penal code's article on terrorism, they might face several years in prison. (Zaman - 10/09/07; NTV, AP, Xinhua, Reuters - 09/09/07)

TIRANA, Albania -- Tirana Mayor and main opposition Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama on Sunday (January 18th) criticised a decision by representatives of the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and the opposition Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI) to reject the adoption of Tirana's municipal budget for 2009. Last week, DP and SMI members of the Municipal Council refused to back the budget, which they described as "problematic". Rama said their decision was purely political.

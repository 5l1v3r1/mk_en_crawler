SOFIA, Bulgaria -- No progress was reported in efforts to end the ongoing teachers' strike, despite a new round of negotiations between the government and the unions at the weekend. Negotiations are set to continue Monday (October 22nd). Unions made clear on Sunday that they would not back down from demands for significant pay raises and no personnel cuts.
Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev says if no progress is made shortly, the cabinet might revise its offer downwards. This is the fifth week of the strike, and parents are voicing concern that students might not be able to receive grades for the first term. One parents' association has threatened to press charges against the teachers' unions for disrupting the school process.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament's lower house on Tuesday (June 23rd) rejected a motion to launch a criminal investigation against former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase on corruption charges, media reported. The vote was 116-100, which means Nastase will retain legislative immunity. He is accused of abuse while leader of the Social Democratic Party. He allegedly took more than 230,000 euros from commercial activities to fund his 2004 campaign.
In other news Tuesday, President Traian Basescu vowed to suspend any cabinet minister under investigation. Parliament's lower house agreed on Tuesday to establish an inquiry committee to look into alleged embezzlement and misappropriation of state funds by Youth and Sports Minister Monica Iacob Ridzi. She allegedly embezzled about 630,000 euros earmarked for a Youth Day celebration last month. Environment Minister Nicolae Nemirschi is being investigated separately, for allegedly submitting a false asset declaration.
Also Tuesday, the justice ministry said US authorities have agreed to extradite Mihai Necolaiciuc, former manager of Romania's National Railroad Company, who is being sought for embezzlement and fraud. He was arrested in Florida last week for breaking immigration laws. (Mediafax, Agerpres, Ziare, AP - 23/06/09)

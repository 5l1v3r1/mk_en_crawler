PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- On Wednesday (16 July), a Kosovo court jailed a well-known former rebel chief and three co-defendants accused of war crimes committed during the 1998-1999 conflict. In Kosovo's first war crimes trial against former members of the disbanded KLA, a panel of three international judges sentenced Rrustem Mustafa, also known as "Remi", to 17 years imprisonment. A prosecutor in the province had charged the four with torturing fellow ethnic Albanians suspected of collaborating with Serb officials during the conflict. Remi and two of the others were also accused of murdering civilians. (Reuters - 16/07/03)

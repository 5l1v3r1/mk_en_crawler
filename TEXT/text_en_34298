ANKARA, Turkey -- The EU progress report on Turkey will reportedly suggest that despite legislation introducing reforms, there have been shortcomings in implementation. The EU progress report on Turkey is due on 5 November and local press reports suggest it will criticise the role of the military in domestic politics. The report is also expected to request that authorities remove obstacles to education and broadcasting in ethnic languages.
European Parliament President Pat Cox, however, put a positive spin on the situation Wednesday (29 October). In an interview for local TV channel NTV, Cox said Turkey has made significant progress in improving its chances to begin EU accession negotiations and this will be noted in the report.
Turkish Minister of Economy Ali Babacan meanwhile is in New York, participating in the UN General Assembly meeting on high-level dialogue on financing for development. (Hurriyet, Milliyet - 30/10/03; NTV, TRT 2, Anadolu Agency - 29/10/03)

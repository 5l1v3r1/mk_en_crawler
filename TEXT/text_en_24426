ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic insisted on Sunday (January 11th) that Croatia will not succumb to efforts by Slovenia to block the country's EU accession bid. In an interview with the newspaper Slobodna Dalmacija, Mesic said it is obvious that some people in Slovenia believe that Croatia is vulnerable because of its strategic goal of EU membership. Last month, Slovenia used the long-standing border dispute between the two countries to veto opening more of Croatia's accession negotiations chapters. That jeopardised plans to wrap up talks by the end of this year. Mesic said some believe his country can now be pressed to make concessions deemed impossible in other circumstances. "But, dear neighbour Slovenians, this will not be so," Mesic said. Croatia wants to take the border dispute before the International Court of Justice in The Hague. (MIA, Javno - 11/01/09)

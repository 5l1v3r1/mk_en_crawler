SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Macedonian Orthodox Church issued a statement Monday (May 26th) rejecting speculation by the Greek media that the country's Orthodox Church head, Archbishop Stefan, made territorial claims against Greece during a recent visit to the Vatican. According to the Church, Greece took the cleric's words out of context. "Neither in the past nor now could one deny that Thessaloniki is a birthplace of ours and the alphabet of all Slavic peoples rooted in the language of its citizens back then. It is exactly why Thessaloniki always has belonged -- in a spiritual and cultural sense -- to us and to all Slavic peoples," Archbishop Stefan said. (MIA, Makfax, MRT, A1 TV - 26/05/08)

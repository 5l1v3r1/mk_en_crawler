ATHENS, Greece -- Cyprus' newly elected President Dimitris Christofias said on Thursday (March 6th) that he expects to meet Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat some time between March 17th and 24th. At a news conference during a visit to Athens, Christofias said the meeting would be an "exploratory" one, so he and Talat can determine the agenda of future talks. He says reunifying the divided island is his top goal during his five-year mandate. Talat has said he expects a breakthrough by year's end.
The online edition of the Phileleftheros newspaper reports that UN peacekeepers in Cyprus are already preparing to host the meeting. (Zaman, Hurriyet - 07/03/08; NTV, Phileleftheros, Financial Mirror, AFP, Reuters - 06/03/08)

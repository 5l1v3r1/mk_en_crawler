SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The members of the BiH presidency -- Serb Borislav Paravac and Bosniak Sulejman Tihic -- believe that BiH still needs the institution of the international community's high representative (HR), according to their comments to Radio Free Europe, reported by local media. Both shared the opinion that ten years after the Dayton Accords, Bosnian institutions remain too young to function independently and ensure full implementation of the peace deal. But Paravac and Tihic agreed that BiH should adopt a timetable for the gradual reduction of HR powers, as well as an exit strategy for the international community. 
In other news, the local media reported late last week that the West expects the Croatian Democratic Union to remain committed to reforms and to quickly help appoint a new Croat member of the BiH presidency. High Representative Paddy Ashdown dismissed former member Dragan Covic last month, in light of embezzlement charges. (Nezavisne novine - 11/04/05; Fena - 08/04/05)

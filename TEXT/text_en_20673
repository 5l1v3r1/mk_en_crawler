ANKARA, Turkey -- Thousands of judges, prosecutors, lawyers and ordinary citizens joined a demonstration in Ankara on Sunday (December 9th) against a recently adopted law which they view as a possible threat to judicial independence. The legislation, which was approved on December 1st and published three days later, expands the conditions for access to the country's court system by allowing lawyers to become judges and prosecutors after passing written and oral exams. Secularists fear that the Islamist-rooted government of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) is using the legislation to integrate its political supporters in courts. The AKP denies this, insisting it has evolved into a conservative democratic party. (AFP, Press TV, Aljazeera - 09/12/07)

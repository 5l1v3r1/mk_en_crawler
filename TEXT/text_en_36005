BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Foreign Investor Council, consisting of 75 foreign banks and companies, has called on Serbia to continue moving ahead with key reforms. On Monday (29 March), the group met with representatives of the new government in Belgrade. The investors said they want to see continued efforts to advance current reforms, rather than the invention of new ones. Together, members of the Foreign Investor Council have pumped more than 1 billion euros into Serbia. (B92, Beta - 30/03/04)

LONDON, the United Kingdom -- The international human rights watchdog Amnesty International accused Greek police of using excessive force and violating the rights of demonstrators in a report released on Monday (March 30th). The report alleges police committed widespread abuses during the wave of street protests that hit the country last December, after a police officer shot a teenager dead. Since those demonstrations ended, Amnesty says it has continued to receive complaints against the police, including allegations of arbitrary arrests, physically abuse of detainees, denial of prompt access to lawyers and targeting of immigrants.

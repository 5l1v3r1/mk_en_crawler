SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Three incidents were reported during protests Wednesday (9 August) in Skopje. The demonstrations were organised by the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) and the Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDP), whose supporters rallied for a third day against the parties' exclusion from the new government. Police say demonstrators attacked three cars -- two of them with drivers inside. They sustained no injuries but the vehicles were damaged. DUI-PDP supporters also blocked traffic for 30 minutes Wednesday on highways in northwest Macedonia. DUI's deputy leader, outgoing Deputy Prime Minister Musa Xhaferri, says the party will continue with protests though Friday, when further steps would be announced.

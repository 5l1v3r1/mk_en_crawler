SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The participants in a public debate Wednesday (April 4th) on Macedonia's NATO integration bid cited political dialogue and judicial reforms as the main challenges on the path to Alliance membership. The meeting in Skopje included Defence Minister Lazar Elenovski and several of his predecessors. During the discussions, Elenovski voiced his belief that crucial dialogue between the ruling and opposition parties, including ethnic Albanian ones, would proceed.

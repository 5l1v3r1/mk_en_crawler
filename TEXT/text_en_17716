SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- As expected, international community High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling annulled on Friday (March 23rd) Parliament's approval of the new Federation of BiH (FBiH) government. The envoy said the vote by the entity's House of Representatives was inappropriate since his office had not yet completed the vetting of all the ministerial nominees, as required by law. The process was finalised on Friday, clearing the way for re-approval. The proposed ruling coalition includes the Bosniak Party for Democratic Action and Party for BiH, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) of BiH, and HDZ 1990.

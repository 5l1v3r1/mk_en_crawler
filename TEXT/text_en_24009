TIRANA, Albania -- Demo-Christian Party official Aleksander Keka died in a car explosion Thursday (June 18th) near the northern city of Shkodra. He was alone in the car when a bomb, believed to be planted under the driver's seat, went off. Keka, 34, was a businessman and had a family of four. This is the most serious incident since campaigning for the June 28th general elections began three weeks ago. The Demo-Christians ended their partnership with the ruling Democratic Party recently and are campaigning separately. 
In other news, the EU's Czech presidency is again urging Albania to hold free and fair elections and ensure that all eligible voters will be able to cast their ballots, local media reported on Thursday.
Separately Thursday, the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) published its third and final monitoring report on the campaign. Tensions have been rising in some regions, it warned. (VoA, Top Channel, Ora News, Balkan Web, Shekulli, Top News, Klan, Alsat - 18/06/09)

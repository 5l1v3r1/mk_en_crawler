SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak rejected the possibility of including the option of secession for the Republika Srpska (RS) in the new BiH constitution, according to a statement Wednesday (January 30th). RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik had said that his party will seek the right to self-determination for the RS, especially in light of developments in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians are expected to declare independence within weeks. "BiH is an internationally recognised state, its territorial integrity is guaranteed by the Dayton Peace Agreement and its existence cannot be questioned. Republika Srpska does not have the right to secede from the BiH; at the same time no one can unilaterally abolish Republika Srpska," Lajcak stressed. He added that constitutional reform negotiations -- due to begin later this year -- are aimed at making BiH more efficient and more effective for all citizens, rather than to divide the country.

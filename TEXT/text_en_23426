PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Parliament's foreign policy committee unanimously backed the nomination of Igor Jovovic as ambassador to Serbia on Thursday (July 30th). Montenegro has had no ambassador to Belgrade since last fall, when Podgorica recognised Kosovo's independence. Belgrade immediately declared the ambassador at that time, Anka Vojvodic, persona non grata. (Pobjeda - 31/07/09; RTCG, B92, Tanjug - 30/07/09)

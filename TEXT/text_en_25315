BELGRADE, Serbia/SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Former BiH presidency member Ejup Ganic was arrested at an airport in London on Friday (February 26th) and soon released because of "logistical reasons", Serbian Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said. The officials added that Serbia has requested an explanation from UK authorities for allowing Ganic to go free. Ganic has denied he was arrested on an Interpol warrant and said he was simply waiting for his luggage. Serbian War Crimes Chief Prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic said that Ganic -- along with 19 others -- is wanted in Serbia for an attack in Sarajevo against a column of the Yugoslav National Army in May 1992.
In Sarajevo, BiH presidency member Haris Silajdzic urged Belgrade to stop "politically motivated persecution" of Bosniaks. "These statements are absolutely false and pose a serious threat to our good neighbourly relations," said Silajdzic of the allegation that Ganic was arrested on a Serbian warrant.

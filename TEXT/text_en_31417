BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska's (RS) special police forces raided the Bosna hotel in Banja Luka and conducted a two-hour search Thursday (24 April). RS police head Radomir Njegos says it happened after police received information that two criminals linked with Serbia's Zemun clan might be staying there. Earlier this week, the Office of the High Representative and the top BiH security bodies approved an anti-crime plan aimed at preventing criminals from Serbia to cross into BiH, now that Belgrade has lifted its state of emergency.

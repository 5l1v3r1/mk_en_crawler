PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK is barring candidates running for president in Serbia from campaigning in Kosovo, according to Belgrade-based B92 radio. In a report Thursday (13 May), UNMIK representative Mechthild Henneke was quoted as saying the issue is security at campaign rallies. Following a burst of violence in mid-March, authorities want to avoid events that might provoke a recurrence.
Meanwhile, UNMIK chief Harri Holkeri has been admitted to hospital for exhaustion. He is expected to remain there for a couple of days. (B92, Tanjug - 13/05/04)

PALE, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The news agency SRNA reports Tuesday (13 January) that SFOR personnel have extended their search for wartime political leader Radovan Karadzic. What was supposed to be a three-day operation focusing on the Bosnian Serb town of Pale entered a fourth day Tuesday when SFOR personnel, in co-operation with the Republika Srpska Interior Ministry, raided houses near Breznik, east of Pale, and seized documents. All along, the targets have been Kardazic and his network of supporters. The fugitive war crimes indictee has been on the run for eight years now. SFOR praised the Bosnian Serb police for their contributions, calling this "the first truly joint operation to capture war crime suspects".

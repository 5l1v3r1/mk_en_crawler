PRISTINA, Kosovo -- US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Countryman says Kosovo's future is in the EU, adding that Washington will continue its strong support for Kosovo as a modern European state of the 21st century. "It's a fact that the EU has provided more assistance to Kosovo than the US and this will continue to be so in the future. I am concerned that these facts are ignored by Kosovo politicians and by the public," Countryman told Radio Free Europe on Tuesday (April 26th). He added that Kosovo has more friends in Brussels and in the EU than people think. (Zeri, Express, Lajm, Koha Ditore - 27/04/11)

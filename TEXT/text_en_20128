PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The government announced an energy crisis Thursday (February 14th) and created a special group chaired by Prime Minister Hashim Thaci to resolve the issue. Speaking to the media, Thaci blamed "sabotage in the management of the Kosovo Power Company (KEK)". He said the government would punish all those that try "to leave Kosovo in the dark at the very time of its independence". Also on Thursday, the KEK conceded that it would be unable to guarantee 24-hour a day power supplies to Kosovo, as demand has outpaced supplies. (Kosovalive, Tanjug, B92, Focus - 14/02/08)

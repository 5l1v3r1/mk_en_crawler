TORONTO, Canada -- A court in Toronto decided on Thursday (22 September) to extradite Dejan Demirovic, former member of Scorpions paramilitary unit, to Serbia-Montenegro, according to AP. Demirovic is charged in Serbia with participating in the 1999 executions of at least 14 Albanians in the Kosovo village of Podujevo. Demirovic fled Serbia in 2001 and sought refugee status in Canada. He managed to hide his past until a witness told her story to Canadian authorities. (Beta, Tanjug, B92 - 22/09/05)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski says he plans to summon the National Security Council this week to discuss the situation in Kosovo, Skopje-based daily Utrinski vesnik reported on Monday (August 20th). Crvenkovski told journalists that while the situation in Macedonia is stable, the government must discuss reports of possible partition of the Serbian province as a possible solution to its final status. As a neighbouring country, Macedonia must work to prevent that, Crvenkovski said. (Utrinski vesnik - 20/08/07)

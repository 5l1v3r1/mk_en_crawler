SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Britain's Ambassador to Macedonia, Robert Chatterton Dickson, called on Friday (October 20th) for a stepped-up fight against corruption and crime. Speaking at a news conference, Dickson suggested that the government of Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski concentrate on implementing reforms required for integration, rather than on obtaining concrete dates. Britain supports the process of EU enlargement, Dickson said, adding that Macedonia will become an EU member when it meets membership criteria. (Dnevnik- 21/10/06)

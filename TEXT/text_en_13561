SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The ruling coalition announced on Wednesday (21 December) that a decision on a possible new Bulgarian mission to assist Iraq's reconstruction would be made in late February at the earliest. The chairman of the parliamentary commission for defence, Angel Naydenov, says several scenarios are being considered.
In other news, the ruling coalition submitted a draft law to parliament on Thursday that envisions amendments to the country's constitution. Primarily, it would restructure the judiciary and regulate the local governments' responsibilities for tax collection. Debate is expected as early as January.

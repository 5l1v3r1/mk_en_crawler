SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Two professional mine-clearers or sappers were killed and one was badly injured Tuesday (March 18th) during mine removal operations at the foot of the Ozren Mountain in northern BiH, police said. The first engineer died immediately in the blast while the second died on the way to the hospital. On Monday, another sapper was killed in a similar incident in the village of Stanari, near Doboj. 
Both incidents happened just as EUFOR and the BiH government launched simultaneous public awareness campaigns about landmines, to mark next month's International Mine Action Day. Prime Minister Nikola Spiric says BiH has more landmines than any other country in Europe. (RTRS, Fena, NTV Hayat, DPA, Reuters - 18/03/08)

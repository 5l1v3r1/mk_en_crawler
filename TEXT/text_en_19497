LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Current EU presidency holder Slovenia said on Wednesday (March 26th) that Serbia may soon be offered a more liberal EU visa regime to provide its citizens with a new incentive to support the country's EU bid. "What we can offer is an agreement on a visa regime that would be significantly more favourable than the present one," Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel said, ahead of a weekend meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brdo pri Kranju. "This agreement could be available shortly and I hope signed before the (Serbian) election," he added. 
Serbs will go to the polls on May 11th to choose a new government. The current ruling coalition collapsed following Kosovo's declaration of independence. (Tanjug, Reuters, Blic, Fonet, Beta - 26/03/08)

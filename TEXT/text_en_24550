SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Three ministers are leaving the government, local media reported Wednesday (July 8th). Education Minister Pero Stojanovski is reportedly quitting over pressure related to reforms in the sector. Agriculture Minister Aco Spasenovski's resignation reportedly stems from farmers' dissatisfaction with the situation in their sector, while Finance Minister Trajko Slavevski was replaced at the initiative of Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski. Slavevski has vowed to defend his performance before parliament. According to media reports, Deputy Prime Minister Zoran Stavrevski will add the finance ministry to his portfolio; Nikola Todorov will be appointed education minister and Ljupco Dimovski will become agriculture minister. A week ago, Deputy Prime Minister for European Integration Ivica Bocevski left the cabinet. He will be replaced by Vasko Naumovski.

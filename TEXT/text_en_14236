ANKARA, Turkey -- The EU should start accession talks with Turkey on 3 October as scheduled, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday (11 August), adding that Ankara has fulfilled its part of the deal by supporting the UN plan for the reunification of Cyprus, and by extending its customs treaty with the EU to the Union's 10 new members. Imposing new conditions on Turkey would not be fair, the prime minister said. 
Turkey's chief negotiator with the EU, Economy Minister Ali Babacan, said Thursday that there were no technical or legal obstacles to launching the accession talks in October. He attributed opposition in some EU member countries to domestic politics, and said Turkey's delegation is planning a diplomacy shuttle to correct misunderstandings and misperceptions.

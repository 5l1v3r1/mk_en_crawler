SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Rising ethnic tensions and recent troubles in the Lipkovo area overshadowed celebrations marking the 12th anniversary of Macedonia's independence Monday (8 September). Representatives of the ethnic Albanian parties in parliament and ethnic Albanian cabinet ministers did not attend a reception hosted by Parliament Speaker Nikola Popovski. Local media reported that the largest ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic Union of Integration, has threatened to withdraw from the coalition agreement with the ruling Social Democratic Alliance for Macedonia if the rumours of civilian casualties during weekend clashes between government troops and armed extremist groups in the Brest area prove to be true. Two members of the rebel group calling itself the Albanian National Army were killed in the operation. The US State Department voiced support Monday for government efforts to tackle militants who threaten the country's security, but warned that the lives of civilians must not be threatened.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The European Parliament (EP) will ratify Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU in January, EP Rapporteur for Serbia Jelko Kacin said on Monday (December 20th) in Belgrade. He announced that the EP will also adopt a resolution on Serbia's progress in the EU integration process, and he urged all EU member states to ratify the agreement to do so as soon as possible, saying it is important for the region and the EU. Interior Minister Ivica Dacic assured Kacin that Serbian authorities are doing their best to prevent visa-free regime abuses, completing the European Commission questionnaire and are willing to prove full co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal.

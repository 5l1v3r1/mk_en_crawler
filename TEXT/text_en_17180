KABUL, Afghanistan -- Bulgaria's Air Force detachment in Afghanistan officially assumed command of the Kabul International Airport from Romania on Monday (31 July). The 70-strong Bulgarian unit, part of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, will be in charge of the airport's management for the next four months. With them, Bulgaria currently maintains around 100 troops in the mission. During a meeting Monday with Bulgarian military representatives in Kabul, the British commander of the NATO-led forces in Afghanistan, Lieutenant General David Richards, said he anticipates Sofia boosting that number.

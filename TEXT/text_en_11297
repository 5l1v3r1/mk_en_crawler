ATHENS, Greece -- The leader of Greece's main opposition party PASOK, George Papandreou, said Wednesday (23 February) that the main objective of his ongoing tour of the country was to reconcile factions within the party ahead of the party congress scheduled for early March. According to Papandreou, the congress should focus on reforms rather than on quarrels between different groups. (ANA - 23/02/05)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government unanimously supported Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul on Wednesday (17 November), rejecting a motion against him filed by the opposition. The ministers based their decision on reports by the chief public prosecutor and the state auditor's office, which cleared Zuzul of any wrongdoing associated with a bankruptcy procedure involving the Imostroj company. The opposition is claiming a conflict of interest. (Vjesnik - 18/11/04; HINA, HRT - 17/11/04)

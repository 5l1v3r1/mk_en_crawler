SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) on Wednesday (13 October) criticised the BiH Parliament for failing to adopt a crucial law on the public broadcasting system that meets EU criteria. The OHR described the failure as a setback in the EU integration process, noting that the establishment of a single, self-sustainable public broadcasting system is a major requirement of the European Commission's feasibility study for BiH.

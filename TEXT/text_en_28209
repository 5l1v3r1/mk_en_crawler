SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prosecutors filed charges Wednesday (July 14th) against former Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev for allegedly mishandling classified documents. They say that Stanishev, who led the previous Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) government, failed to return seven documents containing classified information regarding security and organised crime. The BSP lost last year's general elections to GERB. Stanishev, who remains BSP leader, denies the charges and says they are politically motivated. (BBC, Reuters, BNT, bTV - 14/07/10)

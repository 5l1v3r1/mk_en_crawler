SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The second round of negotiations on the new police reform proposal drafted by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak ended without progress Tuesday (September 18th). Officials say that Serb and Bosniak politicians remain diametrically opposed on all key issues. So far, only the Croat parties have indicated they support Lajcak's proposal. Reportedly, the one compromise reached so far is related to border police and the State Investigation and Protection Agency. Talks will continue on Monday.

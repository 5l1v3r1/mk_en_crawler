ATHENS, Greece -- Economy and Finance Minister Nikos Christodoulakis told the World Bank-IMF annual meeting in Dubai on Tuesday (23 September) that his government has upped its projections for the 2003 budget deficit, from 0.9 per cent to slightly more than 1 per cent of GDP. Greece's deficit stood at 1.2 per cent of GDP in 2002. The minister added that the government is confident that it would be able to maintain the downward trend in coming years despite the high cost of the 2004 Olympics.

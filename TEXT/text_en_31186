ANKARA, Turkey -- Police in Ankara used tear gas and water cannons Thursday (February 3rd) to prevent demonstrators from reaching the parliament building. About 10,000 people gathered in the central part of the capital before marching towards parliament where lawmakers are debating a draft labour law that protestors claim would limit their rights. The bill would allow employers to relocate employees against their will and give them the right to hire interns and apprentices for four months without pay. Protesters attacked police with rocks and several people were reported injured. (AP, AFP, Hurriyet, Anadolu news agency, Reuters - 03/02/11)

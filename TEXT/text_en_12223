BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu-Tariceanu, chairman of the National Liberal Party (PNL), praised the decision of the main partner in the ruling coalition, the Democratic Party, to support PNL's initiative for early elections. On Thursday (7 July), Tariceanu announced the resignation of his coalition government after the Constitutional Court rejected crucial judicial reform laws. He said the ruling jeopardises the country's scheduled EU accession in January 2007.
In other news, the government announced on Friday that it has adopted emergency laws that would allow the state to return to owners property seized by the former communist regime. Compensation would be provided to those whose assets no longer exist or cannot be restituted. The Constitutional Court struck down that measure as well last week. (Rompres - 09/07/05; AP - 08/07/05)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serbs should not consider Kosovo as an example when they decide their future, BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric said in an interview published on Wednesday (April 11th). "Under Dayton, the Serb Republic is an integral part of Bosnia and they [Bosnian Serbs] don't question its sovereignty," he added. Spiric, an ethnic Serb, went on to add that Republika Srpska (RS) has no plans to secede from BiH or to join Serbia.
The same day, Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Milorad Dodik announced that RS plans to replace its national emblem. The double-headed white eagle is often associated with atrocities committed during the 1992-1995 conflict. (The Financial Times, Nezavisne novine, Dnevni avaz - 12/04/07; Reuters, RTRS - 11/04/07)

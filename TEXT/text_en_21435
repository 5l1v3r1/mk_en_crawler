ATHENS, Greece -- Authorities suspect a new terrorist organisation is behind a bomb threat in downtown Athens, local media reported on Wednesday (July 30th). Police detonated a bomb found outside a government building in the district of Neos Kosmos Tuesday after someone placed three warning phone calls to police and the news media. According to police, a new terrorist group is trying to improve its technique by staging experimental attacks. Tuesday's attempted bombing is being linked to a similar incident in June, when police detonated a bomb found outside the Bayer Corporation's offices in Athens.
In other news, an earthquake measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale hit western Greece early Wednesday but caused no injuries or damage. Its epicentre was located under the sea southeast of the Ionian island of Kefalonia. (In-news, ANA-MPA, Naftemporiki, SKAI, Kathimerini, Ta nea, AP - 30/07/08)

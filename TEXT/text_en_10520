ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A Turkish court on Saturday (16 October) ordered the arrest of three members of the outlawed Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front on charges they planned major bomb attacks. In June, two women were killed when the group carried out an attack on an Istanbul bus. 
Meanwhile, a court in Istanbul freed a prominent Kurdish politician a day after he returned from a nine-year exile. Judges found that the charges against Mehdi Zana, husband of Kurdish activist Leyla Zana, are no longer valid as a result of new legislation.

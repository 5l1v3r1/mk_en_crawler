BUCHAREST, Romania -- Corneliu Vadim Tudor resigned on Saturday (12 March) as leader of the Greater Romania Party (PRM), after 14 years in the post. The decision followed a session of the party's national council, which agreed to change the party's name to People's Greater Romania Party. Party officials say both moves are an effort to improve the reputation of the PRM, which is widely seen as ultranationalist and anti-Semitic. Tudor, who is being replaced by Corneliu Ciontu, will stay on as honorary party president. (Rompres, Nine o'clock - 14/03/05)

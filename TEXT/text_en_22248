TIRANA, Albania -- Lawmakers on Monday (November 17th) postponed until Tuesday discussion of the country's new election code, saying the sides have to reach a consensus before putting the bill to a vote. Small parties in parliament are protesting their exclusion from election committees under the new code. About a dozen lawmakers staging a hunger strike over the issue are growing weaker, according to media reports.
Also Monday, the OSCE representative in Albania, Robert Bosch, urged political parties to improve the new electoral code. "Every discriminatory element should be excluded," Bosch said. (BBC, Top Channel, Shekulli, Telegrafi - 17/11/08)

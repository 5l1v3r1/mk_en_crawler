THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- UN war crimes tribunal president Theodor Meron has formed a three-member council which is to decide whether to transfer the trials of Zeljko Meakic, Momcilo Gruban, Dusko Knezevic and Dusan Fustar to a court in Bosnia and Herzegovina, FENA reported on Thursday (7 October), citing tribunal sources. The four Bosnian Serbs are charged with crimes committed at the Omarska and Keraterm detention camps near Prijedor. The indictees turned themselves in to the tribunal in 2002 and 2003.

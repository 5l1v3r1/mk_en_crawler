TIRANA, Albania -- Bloated rivers in Gramsh, about 60km from Tirana, have killed two people, while heavy rains have caused floods in the northwest regions of Lezha, Kurbin and Shkodra. The first victims of the heavy rains in the area were pulled out of Sojnik River on Sunday (November 8th). The national road to Kukes, which also connects the north with Kosovo, was paralysed for several hours Saturday. A special unit has been established to handle the situation.

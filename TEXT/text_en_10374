ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic reconfirmed on Saturday (18 September) his support for UN peacekeeping operations worldwide. He also said the US-led military operation in Iraq had helped to "topple the dictatorial regime and establish peace in that part of the world which must be democratised". Asked to comment on US President George W. Bush's calls for more active Croatian involvement in Iraq, Mesic said he would like first to discuss the issue with relevant institutions.

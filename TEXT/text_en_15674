THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The trial of seven former senior Bosnian Serb military and police officials charged with directing the murder of more than 7,000 Muslims in Srebrenica resumed on Monday (21 August). It is the largest single trial to be held at The Hague to date. The proceedings formally opened on 14 July with a session on procedural issues. In an opening statement Monday, chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte said it was "inexcusable" that Serbia had not arrested fugitive Ratko Mladic, accused of masterminding the massacre. Five of the defendants have been charged with genocide and two with war crimes. They could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted. All seven have pleaded not guilty.

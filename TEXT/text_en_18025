ANKARA, Turkey -- Over 200,000 people gathered in Ankara on Saturday (April 14th) to protest the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the possible presidential nomination of its Islamic-rooted leader, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The protest was organised by the former commander of Turkey's paramilitary forces, Sener Eruygur. Demonstrators demanded the AKP government's resignation and shouted slogans against Erdogan running in next month's presidential elections. On Friday, outgoing President Ahmet Necdet Sezer harshly criticised the government's policies, warning against what he called a renewed Islamic threat to the secular state.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The US government is increasingly concerned by corruption within Bulgaria's law enforcement agencies, according to a report by the US Justice Department. Bulgarian media cited passages Thursday (April 24th) suggesting the FBI and the US Secret Service are reluctant to share information with their Bulgarian colleagues, fearing they might relay it to organised crime, which would indicate deep-rooted corruption in government.
US Ambassador to Bulgaria John Beyrle, in Friday's edition of the Trud newspaper, acknowledges a "reluctance" to exchange information with police authorities. He stressed however that co-operation with the newly established National Security Agency is quite good. (Trud, BGNES, bTV - 25/04/08)

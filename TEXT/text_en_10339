TIRANA, Albania -- Deputy Prime Minister Namik Dokle urged authorities on Tuesday (23 November) to speed up the arms collection process. Noting the large quantity of weapons and ammunitions still in circulation, he reiterated that the deadline for their voluntary surrender is 31 May 2005. Dokle said the arms collection commissions are not sufficiently committed to the process and urged improved co-operation among police, prosecutors and local governments. Since the operation began in March 1999, 217,000 weapons have been collected, along with more than 117,314,000 pieces of ammunition. (Albanian Daily News - 24/11/04)

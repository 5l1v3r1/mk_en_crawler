TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha reiterated on Tuesday (August 10th) that the ruling majority is ready to implement a European Parliament resolution on investigating the contested June 2009 elections. The resolution, published in June, called for a solution to the ongoing political stalemate between the government and the opposition. It has dragged on for more than a year, affecting Albania's reform efforts. The opposition Socialists insist the vote was manipulated and want the ballots recounted.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu appointed the country's first ten charges d'affaires on Tuesday (September 2nd), following nominations by the government last week. "It is a decision we made after thorough consultations. I think we have made extraordinary selections," Sejdiu told a press conference. Kosovo will be represented in Albania, Austria, Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States by charges d'affaires who will later become ambassadors.
Separately Tuesday, Sejdiu expressed a readiness to meet with his Serbian counterpart, Boris Tadic, but only in the presence of international representatives. Though Kosovo status process cannot be subject to further talks, he said, "Issues that have to do with relations between sovereign states need to be addressed."

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The European Commission is asking both Croatia and Slovenia to avoid any moves that could lead to an escalation of tensions along their disputed border area, said Krisztina Nagy, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokesperson. The comment on Thursday (14 September) was in response to a letter Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel sent to Rehn and to EU security chief Javier Solana, claiming that Croatia is taking unilateral action to draw a borderline that suits its desires. The two countries have still not delineated part of their common border, and there have been frequent incidents as a result. The latest conflict occurred earlier this week, when Croatian police arrested some Slovenian journalists who allegedly crossed the border illegally. (Vecernji List - 15/09/06; HINA, HRT - 14/09/06)

ANKARA, Turkey -- The government moved Wednesday (29 January) to reform the country's cumbersome judiciary system. A bill has been drafted to set up regional appeals courts that should alleviate some of the load handled by the central appeals court in Ankara, according to Deputy Prime Minister Abdullatif Sener. The appeals court handles some 500,000 cases every year, taking an average of two and a half years to complete each one. That has been a source of criticism by the European Commission.

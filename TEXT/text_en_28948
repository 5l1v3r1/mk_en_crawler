TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament adopted a law Tuesday (June 8th) that regulates procedures related to the pardon of prisoners. Under the legislation, the interior minister will be in charge of selecting potential inmates to be pardoned by the president. Prisoners serving life sentences will not be eligible, while those who committed serious crimes will have to have served a third of their sentence before they can apply. Pardons can be sought for convicts who are seriously ill, pregnant or are minors. (News24, Shekulli, BalkanWeb - 08/06/10)

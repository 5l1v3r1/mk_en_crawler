PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Following last month's independence referendum, President Filip Vujanovic predicted on Tuesday (6 June) that Montenegro would have its own constitution by the end of the year. He also said that Montenegro and Serbia might need help from the EU during negotiations on separation. That contradicts the view of Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, who says there is no need for external assistance. Vujanovic says he interprets that to mean all issues can be tackled quickly and easily. (Mina - 06/06/06)

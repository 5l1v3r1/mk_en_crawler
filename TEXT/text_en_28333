PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Local NGOs are urging EULEX to show concrete results in fighting organised crime and corruption. Thursday's (May 13th) call from 15 organisations followed a EULEX raid two weeks ago on the ministry of transport and telecommunication and on properties of Transport Minister Fatmir Limaj, based on suspected corruption. Ramadan Ilazi, executive director of the FOL movement, said that EULEX must keep working to boost the rule of law and overall security. "Organised crime and corruption," he added, "are hindering Kosovo's European future. We fully support" efforts by EULEX and the Kosovo special prosecutor.

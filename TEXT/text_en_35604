WASHINGTON, United States -- The IMF announced Monday (7 June) that it has released a $147m loan to Serbia-Montenegro, part of an existing line of credit. The IMF agreed in 2002 to provide $953m over three years to boost the country's economic programme. Belgrade has used $440m from the credit line to date.
Also Monday, High Representative Paddy Ashdown met with Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic in Belgrade. They agreed that war crimes co-operation is the only obstacle to both countries' Euro-Atlantic integration. (Albanian Daily News - 08/06/04; AFP, B92, Tanjug - 07/06/04)

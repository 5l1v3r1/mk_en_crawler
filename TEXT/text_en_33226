SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Foreign Minister Solomon Passy and his Turkish counterpart, Abdullah Gul, met on Monday (12 May) to discuss suspended electricity exports to Turkey. Afterwards, Passy expressed confidence the issue would be resolved during Energy Minister Milko Kovachev's visit to Turkey on 29 May. Turkey suspended power imports from Bulgaria in April, claiming Sofia had failed to comply with contract terms.
In other news, the government opened talks Monday with a Turkish consortium for the sale of the Bulgarian Telecommunications Company. The talks follow unsuccessful negotiations with the US investment fund Advent International. (Trud, Dnevnik, 24 Chassa, Standart - 13/05/03; BTA, BNT, BTV, AFP, BNR - 12/05/03)

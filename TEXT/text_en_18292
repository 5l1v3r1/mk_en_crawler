SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH still has a chance to seal a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU in June, should the new government assume office quickly and the police reform accord is implemented, according to the head of the BiH department at the European Commission's (EC) Enlargement Directorate, Dirk Lange. In an interview in Tuesday's (January 16th) Dnevni avaz, he noted that following the finalisation of technical talks on the SAA late last year, the EC decided to postpone the formal conclusion of the negotiations procedure until BiH meets all reform requirements. "We are now waiting for a signal from BiH about an agreement on police reform," he said. 
Outgoing Principal Deputy High Representative Lawrence Butler echoed Lange's remarks. In a statement Tuesday, he added that failure to reform the police would extend the mandate of the Office of the High Representative in BiH. As for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, Butler said the Republika Srpska police had not impressed him with their efforts. (Dnevni avaz, Nezavisne novine - 16/01/07)

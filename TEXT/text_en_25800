PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The NATO accession of all Western Balkan countries is crucial since it is the only secure option for long-term stability, Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic and Albanian President Bamir Topi agreed at a meeting in Budva on Friday (September 18th). Topi arrived in Podgorica on Wednesday, the first visit by an Albanian head of state since Montenegro declared its independence in May 2006. According to Djukanovic, Topi's visit will be a catalyst to better bilateral relations. Djukanovic stressed that the two countries have very good co-operation in the fields of defence and interior affairs, as well as joint projects in infrastructure, energy, and environmental protection.

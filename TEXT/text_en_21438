PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier announced on Tuesday (July 29th) that the reconfiguration process of the international civilian presence will be delayed for a couple of months. "Now we are looking at the end of November or the beginning of December as a deadline for completing the operational aspect of handing over all responsibilities. I think that some of the things need to be done by EULEX because I cannot do them," Zannier told the Koha ditore newspaper. 
In other news, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci promised parliamentarians Tuesday that he would appoint a defence minister this week and then name intelligence agency chiefs. He stressed that the institutions will be professional and multiethnic and will protect all Kosovo citizens. (Koha ditore, Kohavision, Express - 30/07/08; RTK, Kohavision, TV21 - 29/07/08)

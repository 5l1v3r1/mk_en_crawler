ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A Syrian national went on trial in Istanbul Monday (20 March), on suspicion of being the main link between suicide bombings in the city and the al-Qaeda network. Turkish prosecutors believe Luai Sakra was involved in the November 2003 bombings, which killed 58 people. More than 70 men are on trial in connection with the bombings. Prosecutors say Sakra, arrested in southern Turkey last year, also planned to blow up an Israeli cruise liner. They allege that he channeled funds that the other defendants used to attack the British consulate, the HSBC bank and two synagogues in Istanbul. (BBC - 20/03/06)

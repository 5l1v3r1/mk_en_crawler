ANKARA, Turkey -- Military aircraft staged new bombing raids against Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) targets in northern Iraq early Wednesday (December 26th). The General Staff in Ankara said eight guerrilla hideouts were hit, including caves used by the Kurdish militants. Iraqi Kurdish officials said the raids had targeted remote areas in the Dahuk province. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The Turkish Air Force has hit targets in northern Iraq three times in ten days. 
Separately, the army said clashes in Turkey's Sirnak province killed six PKK rebels Wednesday. Five others were killed Tuesday. Turkish President Abdullah Gul said Ankara is pleased with the intelligence sharing under way with the United States. However, White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said Washington wants Ankara to avoid any large-scale action that could destabilise northern Iraq.

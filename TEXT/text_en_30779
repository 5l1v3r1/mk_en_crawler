BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton announced on Friday (May 6th) that Italian diplomat Fernando Gentilini will be the bloc's special envoy to Kosovo for the next three months. The EU plans to boost its positions in Kosovo by having a single representative to the country instead of the current two -- one for EU governments and one for the European Commission. A permanent envoy is expected to be named later this year. The mandate of the outgoing representative, Pieter Feith, expired on April 31st. (EU website, Kosova Live, Alsat - 06/05/11)

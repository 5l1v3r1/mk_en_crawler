ATHENS, Greece -- A radical group claimed responsibility Wednesday (January 5th) for a powerful explosion outside a court house in Athens last week and threatened to attack judges in the upcoming trial involving suspected members of their organisation. The blast on December 30th caused serious property damage but no injuries as people had been evacuated due to a phoned in warning. "From now on, their [the judges'] personal safety is in direct jeopardy," Conspiracy Nuclei of Fire said in an online posting. "We publicly pledge that, for every year in prison that our brothers receive, we will plant a kilo of explosives in [judges'] front yards, cars and offices," it added. The trial is scheduled to begin on January 17th. Nine members of the group will be tried at a maximum security prison in Athens; four others will be tried in absentia. They are charged with belonging to a terror group and involvement in a series of bomb attacks. (AP, ANA-NPA, Reuters - 05/01/11)

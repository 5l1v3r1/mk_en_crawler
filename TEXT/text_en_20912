PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Police in Kosovo urged Serbian colleagues to return to jobs they left last week in a protest against Kosovo's independence. Around 300 Serbian police officers, most of them from Serb enclaves in eastern and central Kosovo, were then suspended from work for about 48 hours. "Our suspended colleagues are members of the Kosovo police and we need them," Kosovo police spokesman Veton Elshani said on Wednesday (March 5th). "The people of Kosovo also need them," he added. 
Meanwhile, a group of 73 Serb civil servants working in the municipal administration and courts in the eastern town of Gjilan left their jobs Tuesday to protest independence, as did 15 Serbs in the nearby town of Vitia. Some say they are afraid because there are no Serb police officers working, others say they are afraid of a backlash from fellow Serbs. (AFP, Koha Ditore, Xinhua - 05/03/08)

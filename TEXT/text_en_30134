THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb General Dragomir Milosevic was transferred on Tuesday (March 22nd) to Estonia to serve his 29-year sentence for crimes against civilians during the 44-month siege of Sarajevo in 1994-1995. The decision to transfer him was made by tribunal President Patrick Robinson. The Appeals Chamber had trimmed Milosevic's sentence from 33 years to 29 years in November 2009, concluding that although he was responsible for the crimes in his role as a military commander, there was no evidence proving that he ordered civilians shot during the shelling of the Bosnian capital.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn suggested on Monday (January 15th) that the EU's future position towards Serbia will depend on the outcome of the January 21st parliamentary elections. Rehn told reporters in Brussels that he was optimistic democratic forces would win the upcoming vote, enabling the resumption and fast completion of Stabilisation and Association Agreement negotiations with Belgrade. According to Rehn, Serbia could quickly obtain a status of EU candidate, given the country's economic, institutional and intellectual capacities. 
During a visit to Belgrade on Monday, Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt also said the EU would adapt its stance on Serbia in accordance with the election results. He said the bloc respects the choice of Serbian voters, but hopes they will elect a government with which the EU could enter concrete talks on integration. (Danas - 16/01/07; RTS - 15/01/07)

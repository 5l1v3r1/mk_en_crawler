LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Montenegrin Foreign Minister Milan Rocen visited Ljubljana on Friday (May 14th) and said that ousted Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who has a Montenegrin passport, must not use the country as a base for sending political messages to his homeland. In April, Shinawatra said in Montenegro that he was in touch with supporters in Thailand. Rocen explained that Shinawatra got Montenegrin citizenship before he was indicted in Thailand, and that he is not wanted by Interpol. Shinawatra was ousted in a 2006 military coup and then sentenced in absentia to two years in prison for corruption and abuse of office. His followers have been protesting for the past two months, in violent demonstrations that have killed more than 300 people and left about 1,400 injured. (Reuters, SEEbiz, Index - 14/05/10)

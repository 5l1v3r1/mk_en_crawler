TIRANA, Albania -- A group of rapporteurs from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) is in Albania to assess the country's progress towards EU accession and visa liberalisation with the bloc. On Wednesday (November 4th), authorities briefed the delegation on the distribution of ID cards and biometric passports. About 245,000 citizens have applied for the new passports so far, interior ministry officials said. Other issues included border security and modern technologies used at border crossings, as well as fighting organised crime and illegal trafficking. Rapporteurs David Wilshire and Jaako Laakso praised Albania's progress, saying that effective and successful work has been done.

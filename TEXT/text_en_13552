BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU on Tuesday (20 September) appeared closer to agreeing on the launch of accession talks with Turkey, despite a last-minute objection by Cyprus. The ambassadors of the EU member-states agreed Monday on the text of a statement on Ankara's refusal to recognise Cyprus. The draft declaration said that Turkey would have to recognise the Greek Cypriot government before its accession to the EU. Cyprus, however, withdrew its support from the text on Tuesday. Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos sad his country was satisfied with the declaration but wanted some "procedural" aspects to be addressed. He noted that all EU countries want the accession talks to begin on 3 October as planned. The EU ambassadors are to meet Wednesday to discuss the issue. Once they adopt the statement, they will launch a debate on the ground rules for negotiations with Turkey. (International Herald Tribune, AP - 21/09/05; AFP, EUobserver - 20/09/05)

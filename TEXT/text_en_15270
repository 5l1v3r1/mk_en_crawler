SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Court's appeals chamber on Friday (28 July) acquitted former Federation of BiH (FBiH) Defence Minister Miroslav Prce of charges related to a bid for Croat self-rule in 2001. The judges ruled that Prce must be acquitted not only of charges that he undermined BiH's military and defence capacity, but also of abuse of office. The charges stemmed from the disbanding of the FBiH Army's Croat component in March 2001, when Croat self-government was proclaimed in the entity. 
The court upheld a five-year sentence for embezzlement, in connection with a scandal involving a Bosnian Croat bank. Prce has been serving time for that since September 2004. (Dnevni avaz - 29/07/06; Pincom.info - 28/07/06)

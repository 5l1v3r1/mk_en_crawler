ISTANBUL, Turkey -- The EU wants to see relations between Turkey's government and military redefined, according to Joost Lagendijk, the co-president of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Commission. Speaking Tuesday (17 June), Lagendijk commended the government for submitting the EU legal harmonisation package to parliament despite reservations by the military. Two cabinet members, Justice Minister Cemil Cicek and Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, indicated Tuesday that the government was working on measures to curb the army's influence on politics, but did not elaborate.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Alliance of Independent Unions of Serbia President Ljubisav Orbovic warned on Sunday (June 13th) that the workforce situation has become critical. He said that at least 1 million citizens are subsisting below the poverty line. According to him, about 160,000 workers do not regularly receive wages and 110,000 people receive only minimum wage. He added that nearly 500 jobs have been slashed each day since the beginning of the crisis. Orbovic also expressed concern about the situation in the south, where no large enterprises are opening and job opportunities are scarce. No big strikes are being planned however, as workers are worried they may lose their jobs. (B92, Tanjug - 13/06/10)

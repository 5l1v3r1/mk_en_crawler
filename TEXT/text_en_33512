TIRANA, Albania -- The state media watchdog group, the Media Monitoring Board, presented a report Tuesday (23 September) on media coverage during the ongoing election campaign. The report, adopted by the Central Electoral Commission, assesses coverage as generally balanced, but cites several procedural violations, especially involving TV channels. The group gives the media until Thursday to resolve the problems. (ATA, BBC - 23/09/03)

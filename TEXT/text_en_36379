PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- An international prosecutor cleared four Jordanian police officers of involvement in a shootout that left three US prison guards and a Jordanian dead. A UN spokesman said investigators have found no evidence that the four had committed a criminal act. A Jordanian sergeant opened fire on vehicles carrying US corrections officers on 11 April in Mitrovica. He was killed when the Americans returned fire. The four other Jordanians were manning a post together with him and were arrested after the incident.
In other news, the UN administration has reinstated 12 ethnic Albanian members of the Kosovo Protection Force who were suspended in December. At the time, it was unclear why they were under investigation, but local media reported they could be charged with offences ranging from trafficking to black market trade.

Commenting on Belgrade's decision, Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said that Serbia is truly committed to respecting human rights, but also pays attention to its relations with China, which are of national interest. European Parliament Rapporteur for Serbia Jelko Kacin said he was shocked by Serbia's decision. (Beta, Tanjug, Politika, B92, Blic - 06/12/10)

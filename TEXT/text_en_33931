SOFIA, Bulgaria -- IMF Mission chief for Bulgaria Jerald Schiff said Sunday (9 November) that the government should accelerate structural reforms in certain sectors. He said reforms in railway and energy sectors would help reduce government subsidies provided to state-held companies in these industries. He added that no government could afford to support all activities of the companies. Schiff also urged that the privatisation of the Bulgarian Telecom Company and cigarette producer Bulgartabac be completed. (Dnevnik, Trud - 10/11/03; BTA - 09/11/03)

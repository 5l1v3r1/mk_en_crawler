ANKARA, Turkey -- The Ankara High Criminal Court on Monday (March 2nd) annulled an earlier decision by the public prosecutor's office, thus clearing the way for the criminal prosecution of those responsible for a controversial internet petition. It called on Turkey to apologise for the killing of 1.5 million Armenian civilians by Ottoman Turks between 1915 and 1917. In January, the Ankara prosecutor's office rejected a petition by six Turkish prosecutors calling for indictment of the petition organisers for "insulting the Turkish nation" under Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code. Monday's ruling opens the way for prosecuting the organisers.
In other news Monday, a retired Turkish policeman threatened to commit suicide in front of the office of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara. The man held a gun to his head to protest the current economic situation. Security guards talked him into giving up the weapon. Erdogan was not in the building at the time.

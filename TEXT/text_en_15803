ZAGREB, Croatia -- Under the new law on secret agencies that took effect on Thursday (17 August), the country's secret service agencies were reduced from three to two. The law stipulates the closure of the Counter-Intelligence Agency (POA) and regulates the operation of the Security Intelligence Agency and of the Military Security Intelligence Office (VSOA). Outgoing POA chief Tomislav Karamarko and VSOA head Gordan Cacic were asked to serve as interim heads of the new civil and military intelligence agencies. (Vecernji List, HINA - 17/08/06)

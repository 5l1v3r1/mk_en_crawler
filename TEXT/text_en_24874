ATHENS, Greece -- Police arrested late on Monday (June 1st) the wife and two daughters of Siemens' former financial manager in Greece, Christos Karavellas, who is sought by authorities on corruption charges. The three were detained based on warrants from an investigating prosecutor on charges of complicity in money laundering. Last Friday, Karavellas was to face charges of bribery and money laundering in connection with contracts signed between Siemens' Greek branch and Greece's largest telecom company OTE between 1994 and 1997. Karavellas, however, failed to appear in court. His lawyer said his client was abroad, prompting the prosecutor's office to issue an international arrest warrant for Karavellas. The foreign ministry says evidence suggests he attempted to illegally transfer 4m euros to Uruguay to buy property there.
In other news Tuesday, a group of hooded youths hurled stones and petrol bombs at a government building in Athens, causing minor damage but no injuries. The target was the Secretariat General of Communication and Information, where press briefings are held. Police said the youths demand the release of a person arrested during last December's massive street riots, after a police officer shot a teenager dead.

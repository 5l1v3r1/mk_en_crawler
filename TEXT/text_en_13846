TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu met on Thursday (18 August) with the head of the ODIHR election observation mission, Jurgen Grunnet. They discussed Sunday's upcoming rerun elections in three municipalities where irregularities surfaced in the 3 July elections. Grunnet said he hoped the re-votes would be held in line with international standards and would reflect the best components of the July vote. The Democratic Party (DP) won the election.
Also Thursday, DP chairman Sali Berisha and New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Genc Pollo signed an agreement to establish a new government coalition.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak met on Monday (October 22nd) with Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik to discuss the set of measures Lajcak imposed recently in a bid to strengthen state institutions. On Sunday, Dodik had threatened that his ruling Union of Independent Social Democrats members would boycott state-level institutions, effectively halting government work, due to concerns the measures are unconstitutional.
At a press conference after their meeting, Dodik and Lajcak said they had found common ground regarding the measures. Lajcak said he would provide a legal interpretation for each of them to dispel RS's concerns that they violate the Dayton Peace Accord.

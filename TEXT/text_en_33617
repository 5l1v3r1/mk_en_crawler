NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council's continued support for Kosovo is crucial to maintaining the rule of law there, said UN Assistant Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations Hedi Annabi. During a speech to the council on Friday (12 September), he expressed concern over increased tensions in the province, including recent attacks targeting Kosovo Serbs and law enforcement authorities attached to UNMIK. From Belgrade, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister and co-ordinator for Kosovo Nebojsa Covic described the statement as encouraging. He reiterated that Belgrade is ready for dialogue with Pristina.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik warned against attempts to further centralise BiH and transfer responsibilities from the RS to state level, media reported on Tuesday (September 2nd). Dodik said he does not question BiH in its Dayton Accord framework, but added the RS won't allow attempts to deprive it of its current powers. His comments were in response to media reports that two Bosniak organisations -- the Congress of North American Bosniaks and the Bosnian Advisory Council -- have launched a campaign to bring about amendments to the Dayton Accords aimed at greater centralisation.

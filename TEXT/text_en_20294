THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- "The fact that Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic are still at large is a stain on our work, a stain on all these great achievements," outgoing chief prosecutor of the UN war crimes tribunal Carla del Ponte said at a farewell press conference Thursday (December 13th). She used the opportunity to again urge the EU to refrain from signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia until Bosnian Serb wartime leader Mladic is arrested. Del Ponte reiterated her stance that Mladic is within the direct reach of Belgrade and warned that if the EU does not use its influence now, Mladic will never be brought to justice. Del Ponte steps down on December 31st after eight years on the job. She will be succeeded by Belgian prosecutor Serge Brammertz. (Reuters, BBC, Tanjug Beta, RTRS, PBS, AP, AFP, DW - 13/12/07)

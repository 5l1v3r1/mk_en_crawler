SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko and US Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues Stephen Rapp agreed on Wednesday (October 14th) that BiH's war crimes strategy is only being implemented on a limited basis. Inzko noted that amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code have not been adopted, nor is there precise information on the exact number of war crimes cases that are being investigated in BiH. He and Rapp agreed that the arrest and transfer of former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic to The Hague war crimes tribunal remains a priority for BiH. 
Separately Wednesday, European Commission (EC) delegation to BiH head Dimitris Kourkoulas urged government officials to speed up key reforms in order to meet conditions required to close the Office of the High Representative and transition it into an Office of the EU Special Representative, and to implement constitutional reforms. Short of all this, Kourkoulas warned, BiH will not be granted EU candidate country status. (RTRS, Srna, Fena, OHR - 14/10/09)

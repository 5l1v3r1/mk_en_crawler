SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Several EU member states are still sceptical about accepting Bulgaria and Romania in the Union by 2007, says Dimitar Conev, the spokesman for Bulgaria's Cabinet of Ministers. Internal political quarrels and the blocking of major privatisation deals are among the top reasons for the scepticism, he said. Conev noted that Bulgaria's roadmap clearly states that without a reformed and functioning judicial system the country may not achieve either NATO or EU accession. He declined to specify which member states oppose setting a definite timeline for Bulgaria's accession to the EU. (BTA, mediapool, bTV - 09/12/02)

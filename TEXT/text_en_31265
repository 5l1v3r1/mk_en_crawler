ATHENS, Greece -- Greece would like to build a "wall" on its land border with Turkey, a main point of entry for illegal migrants trying to reach Europe. "Society has exceeded its ability to absorb any more illegal immigrants," Citizens Protection Minister Christos Papoutsis said in an interview with the ANA-MPA agency Friday (December 31st). "Only those migrants who have an internationally recognised right to protection or a right to asylum will remain in the country, no one else." 
Also Friday, police found 65 illegal migrants hidden in a truck near Athens. The migrants, from Middle East countries, were on their way to the western port city of Patras, where they were hoped to hop a ferry to Italy. The driver of the truck and a suspected smuggler were arrested. (Hurriyet - 02/01/11; Deutsche Welle - 01/01/11; DPA, AFP, ANA-MPA - 31/12/10)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor announced on Saturday (December 18th) that there will be some changes in the government to strengthen the economic team. Kosor, who leads the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), was speaking at a convention of the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), the junior partner in the governing coalition. "The election year is ahead of us; it is important to create a team which will enable the implementation of all three programme pillars of this government -- economic recovery, European Union membership, and the fight against corruption," Kosor said, without indicating who might be replaced.

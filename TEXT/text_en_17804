PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- A special UN prosecutor told reporters on Tuesday (April 17th) that Romanian police officers fired the rubber bullets that killed two ethnic Albanian protesters at a Pristina demonstration on February 10th. Robert Dean called the deaths "unnecessary and avoidable". The victims posed no threat to anybody, he explained. A report by investigators concluded that one or two officers had fired the fatal shots, but their identities could not be determined. 
Romania pulled its 75 police officers out of Kosovo shortly after the incident, despite objections by UNMIK. (Reuters, UN website, Tanjug - 17/04/07)

NEW YORK, United States -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown told the UN Security Council on Wednesday (23 March) that Republika Srpska's (RS) attitude towards the UN war crimes tribunal is finally changing, ten years after the Dayton Peace Accords. According to Ashdown, who attended the Council's session in New York, the recent handover of five indictees by RS to The Hague tribunal suggests Bosnian Serb authorities have finally accepted that "the road to Euro-Atlantic integration passes through The Hague".
In Banja Luka, meanwhile, RS Prime Minister Pero Bukejlovic met with a monitoring team from the Council of Europe to discuss issues related to BiH's fulfilment of post-accession requirements. Bukejlovic reiterated that his government is committed to meeting its obligations to the tribunal. 
Also Wednesday, the OSCE Mission to BiH issued the first report on war crimes trials held by domestic courts. The OSCE looked at trials since 1996, and concluded that the domestic courts largely proved able to handle the cases. (UN Web site, RTRS, OSCE Web site, Fena - 23/03/05)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of the European Commission (EC) delegation to Serbia, Vincent Degert, said on Sunday (July 11th) that any partition of Kosovo is not an option. He stressed that none of the EU members supports such an idea, fearing a domino effect in the region. In an interview with Fonet news agency, Degert said the EU believes that all involved sides should gather at a table and talk, to find a solution. He added that EULEX plays a very positive role in Kosovo and that all provocations in the north should stop. (FoNet, RTS - 11/07/10)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Tuesday (March 3rd) that the European Commission (EC) expected both Slovenia and Croatia to respond to its proposal to mediate the border dispute between the two countries. During a roundtable in Brussels on Croatia's EU accession, Rehn said the EC expected both countries to support the move without imposing some "impossible conditions that practically mean rejection of the initiative". Until now, the Commission had refrained from intervening in the dispute, saying it was a purely bilateral issue. However, the Slovenian government continued to block the opening of new chapters of the acquis in Croatia's EU accession talks, which has apparently changed the EC's position. Both the Slovenian and Croatian governments welcomed the EU proposal in principle but failed to demonstrate more serious interest.

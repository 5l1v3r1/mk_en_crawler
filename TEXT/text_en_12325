THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Dutch military chiefs appeared in court Thursday (12 May) in The Netherlands in a case brought by families of some victims of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. More than 7,000 men and boys were killed by Bosnian Serb troops who overran the Muslim enclave during the Bosnian conflict. Victims' relatives are seeking compensation, charging that Dutch UN peacekeepers responsible for protecting the area failed in their duty. Testimony at Thursday's preliminary hearing will help The Hague District Court decide whether there are sufficient grounds for the civil suit to move to trial.
In other news, former Republika Srpska Army officer Milorad Trbic pleaded not guilty to genocide charges stemming from the Srebrenica massacre, during his appearance before the UN tribunal Wednesday. He surrendered last month. (BBC, Nezavisne novine - 12/05/05; NTV Hayat, PBS BiH - 11/05/05)

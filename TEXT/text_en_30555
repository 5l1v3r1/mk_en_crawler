SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The appeals chamber of the Court of BiH upheld on Tuesday (December 14th) the war crimes sentence handed down to Branimir Glavas. In July, Croatia sentenced the former parliament member to eight years in prison for war crimes against Serbian civilians during the 1991-1995 conflict. Glavas, who fled to neighbouring BiH to avoid prison, was arrested by Bosnian authorities in September after a local court upheld the verdict. He appealed the first instance ruling of a Bosnian court. The appeals chamber said that time spent in custody in Croatia and BiH will be credited towards his sentence.

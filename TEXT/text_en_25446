NEW YORK, United States -- Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said at the UN's 64th General Assembly session in New York on Friday (September 25th) that Montenegro has entered a new phase of European and Euro-Atlantic integration since the UN's last session. "We expect soon to receive the European Commission's stance on Montenegro's readiness to join the EU, as well as an invitation to join NATO," said Djukanovic. He also said that Montenegro remains committed to the basic UN engagements for peaceful settlement of disputes and non-interference in internal problems of other countries.

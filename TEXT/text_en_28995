PRISTINA, Kosovo -- In a new report to be discussed at the UN Security Council next month, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urges transparency in carrying out a strategy for northern Kosovo drafted by the International Civilian Office and the government. He did not, however, take a position on the strategy itself.
"Sensitive issues in the north should be addressed in peace and with co-ordination and continuous consultation between all relevant actors, bearing in mind the specific circumstances and concerns of communities," local media quoted the report as saying Thursday (April 8th). Security Council members will also receive a report from EULEX Chief Yves De Kermabon as an annex to Ban's document. (Koha Ditore, Express, Zeri, Lajm - 08/04/10)

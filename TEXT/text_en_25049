PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government will undergo a "reshuffle" in January after both coalition parties have agreed to the move, Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said on Saturday (December 26th), adding the changes will not "shake" the coalition, but rather will strengthen it. The reconfiguration will follow an overall evaluation of work done by ministers so far. The final decision, Kuci said, is up to Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, who will make it after consulting with governing partners. 
Thaci's Democratic Party is currently the largest party in Kosovo, governing with President Fatmir Sejdiu's Democratic League of Kosovo. (Koha Ditore, Telegrafi, Lajmifundit, RTK, Kohavision - 27/12/09)

STRASBOURG, France -- The European Commission (EC) criticised on Thursday (April 22nd) the ongoing stalemate among political parties in Albania. "Political dialogue is not functioning. The parliament is not functioning and this is a concern for democracy, and is worrying for Albania," the EC head of Unit for Albania and Montenegro, Marta Garcia Fidalgo, said during a session of the European Parliament focusing on Albania. The stalemate stems from the June 2009 general elections, which the opposition Socialist Party wants investigated for alleged manipulations. (Shqip - 23/04/10; Top Channel, Top News - 22/04/10)

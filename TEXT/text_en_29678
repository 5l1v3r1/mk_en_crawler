BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu will not attend the Warsaw summit of Central European leaders and US President Barack Obama that opens on Friday (May 27th) because Kosovo President Atifete Jahjaga is invited. Romania does not recognise Kosovo's independence. Serbian President Boris Tadic has refused to participate in the event for the same reason. (Adevarul, Realitatea, Gandul - 26/05/11)

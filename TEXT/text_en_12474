SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH national team came close to an upset win against Spain in a World Cup qualifier in Valencia on Wednesday (8 June). After Zvjezdan Misimovic put the Balkan team ahead with a 39th minute goal, it took Spain until the seventh minute of injury time to equalise -- and only after two Bosnian players had been sent off, leaving their team with just nine men on the field. Serbia-Montenegro remains on top of Group Seven, one point ahead of Spain. In Group One, Macedonia lost to the Czech Republic 6-1 in Prague. In Group Two, Ukraine dealt a near fatal blow to Greece's World Cup prospects, defeating the Euro 2004 champions in Athens 1-0. Turkey, which beat Kazakhstan 6-0, pushed the Greek team off the second spot in the group. (AP, Reuters, AFP - 08/06/05)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Local Serbs in northern Kosovo blocked the main Mitrovica-Leposavic road on Tuesday (March 8th) to protest the presence of Albanian police officers in joint police patrols. The blockade lasted 30 minutes. Kosovo Police and EULEX officers were on hand and no incidents were reported. Police told the media that a similar demonstration took place near the Jarinje border crossing with Serbia, where local Serbs protested what they called a recent unannounced visit by Kosovo President Behgjet Pacolli.

PRIZREN, Kosovo, Serbia -- KFOR Commander Lieutenant General Roland Kather said on Tuesday (April 10th) that no reduction of troops is expected this year or next. During a visit of the Multinational Task Force South in Prizren, Kather said he expects the UN Security Council mission to Pristina on April 19th to be productive because it would acquaint members with the situation on the ground. He urged the public to help peacekeepers maintain security and stability during the visit. 
Ulpiana Lama, a spokeswoman for Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku, said on Tuesday that the government is taking all necessary security measures to prevent any possible incident during the visit. (RFE, RTK, QIK, KosovaPress, KosovaLive - 10/04/07)

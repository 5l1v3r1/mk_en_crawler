ATHENS, Greece -- Washington has allowed a convicted spy of Greek origin to return to Athens, the Greek Justice Ministry announced on Friday (November 23rd). US authorities agreed to allow Steven Lalas, 54, to serve the rest of his sentence under supervision with his family in Kavala. In 1993, when he worked in the US Embassy in Athens, Lalas was arrested on allegations he had given sensitive information to Greek intelligence. He was sentenced to 14 years in jail, of which he served 12. (Eleftheros Typos, Kathimerini - 24/11/07; AP - 23/11/07)

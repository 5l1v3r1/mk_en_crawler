SOFIA, Bulgaria -- US Ambassador to Sofia John Beyrle reiterated on Wednesday (March 28th) that his country is doing all it can on behalf of five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor who were sentenced to death in a controversial HIV infection trial in Libya. Beyrle said he believes they will return home this year, especially given EU support.
On Wednesday, the Bulgarian Parliament rejected a proposal to change the law on electing European Parliament members, so that the nurses could be nominated as candidates. Both the ruling parties and the opposition decided the move would not help the nurses leave Libya sooner. (Sega - 29/03/07; Mediapool - 28/03/07)

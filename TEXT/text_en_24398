BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said on Thursday (December 11th) that if his country must choose between EU membership and the "question of its territorial integrity" (the Kosovo issue), Serbia will have to say "no" to the EU. He told parliament's foreign affairs committee that EU integration and the fight to maintain Serbia's sovereignty over Kosovo are two separate issues, but that Serbia will have no choice if the two questions overlap.
In other news Thursday, a delegation of French lawmakers visited Belgrade headed by Phillipe Meunier. Meunier said he and others will try to convince their Dutch counterparts to stop making ratification of Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement contingent on the arrest of war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic. 
On Wednesday meanwhile, High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH) Miroslav Lajcak visited Belgrade. President Boris Tadic assured him that Serbia, as a guarantor of the Dayton Peace Accords, unequivocally supports the territorial integrity of BiH and its EU integration process. Lajcak said Belgrade must do more to promote stability in BiH, given fierce rhetoric recently among Serbs, Muslims and Croats.

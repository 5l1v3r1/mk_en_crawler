II. FISHERIES AND FLEET STRUCTURE 
A. Fishing fleet 

1. What are the principal fisheries in your country and what is their geographical distribution? 
In the Republic of Macedonia, the fishing as economy branch is performed on the three natural lakes (Lake Ohrid, Lake Prespa and Lake Dojran), as well as on the water accumulations designated as fishing areas by a decision of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. Sport and recreational fishing is performed on all fishing waters.  Fishing is allowed upon previously obtained permit for concession, in accordance with the Law on Fisheries (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 62/93) and the Law on Concessions (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 25/02, 24/03). 2. Where are fishing vessels located and what are their areas of operation? What type of gear do they use? 
The fishing vessels (boats) are located at sites, designated by the concession grantees. Because the lakes are sailable and because of their configuration, fishing is feasible on the entire surface of the lakes on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia.                                   The fish catch is performed in freshwater in the Republic of Macedonia, because of which there is no significant fishing fleet. Boats of type “Pasara” are being used as fishing vessels, with length of up to 5.0 meters, width of up to 1.7 meters and outboard engine of 2.94 KW etc.             The fishing equipment is described in the provisions of the Order on Types of Fishing Tools that are allowed for commercial and sport/recreational fishing, as well as certain limitations as to usage of certain fishing tools for commercial and sport/recreational fishing (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 33/99).                 
B. Fleet register 

1. Does your country have a fleet register? If yes, describe the administrative structure for the fleet register and specify its status. 
The Port Authorities, as entities within the Ministry of Transport and Communications, maintain the boat registry. Entries/record keeping in the boat registry is performed in accordance with the Law on Inland Waterways Navigation  (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 27/00) and the Rulebook on Boats (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 34/01).                                                                                                        In accordance with the Law on Inland Waterways Navigation (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 27/00), the Boat registry is a public register, maintained by the Port Authority.                                                                          
C. Fishing licenses 

1. How is the issuing of fishing licenses organised? 
In accordance with the Law on Fisheries (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 62/93) and in accordance with the Law on Concessions (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 25/02, 24/03), the fish stock of a particular fishing area for commercial fishing is granted for exploitation – concession, to a legal entity that previously submits a five-year revised plan for improvement, protection and exploitation of the fish stock. In order to organize commercial fishing, the fish stock beneficiary is required to issue identification forms for commercial fishing to each fisherman, and the identification form is stipulated in the Guideline on the Commercial Fishing Identification Form (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 3/94). According to this Guideline, this identification form determines the capacities of the worker-fisherman. The identification form contains the following data: issuance number/unique number, an ID photo and signature of the fisherman, name of the fish stock beneficiary, personal data of the fisherman, date of issuance and signature of authorized official. The identification form is valid for the entire period during which the fisherman works for the fish stock beneficiary/legal entity.                                                            The permits for sport fishing on the fishing waters are issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy, through the fish stock beneficiary, in accordance with the Guideline for Issuance and Form of Sport Fishing Permit (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 3/94). The permit contains the following data: data on the fish stock beneficiary, personal data of the sport fisherman, amount charged in local currency, date of issuance and signature of authorized official. The permits can be issued and valid for one day, seven days, fifteen days and for one year.                                                                 
2. What is the mechanism to withdraw licenses when the conditions for these are not met? 
According to the Law on Fisheries, (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 62/93) and the Law on Agricultural Inspection (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 38/04), the responsible inspector is authorized for temporary confiscation of the fish catch, the commercial fishing permit, as well as the fishing tools during the inspection, should the inspector detect irregularities in the work of the fish stock beneficiaries. The responsible inspector is also authorized for temporary confiscation of the sport fishing permit and the fishing tools if the legal provisions regarding sport fishing are not being complied with.

In the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of Macedonia, based on the Law on Chambers of Commerce (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 54/02), the fish producers are organized in their own organizational form “Group of Fish Producers ”, which functions within the Association for agriculture and food industry within the Chamber of Commerce of  the Republic of Macedonia.                                               
2. Are there any specific provisions on consumer information? 
The provisions on consumers information are regulated by the Consumer Protection Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 38/04).                                               This Law establishes the requirement for producers, traders and distributors to inform the consumers on hazardous properties of certain products. This Law also stipulates that the producer and/or distributor are required to undertake measures for withdrawal of hazardous products from the markets should they find out that hazardous products have been released to the markets.                                    The responsible inspection authorites should, within the scope of their activities, determine which products are hazardous, and undertake initiative for determination of their quality and the hazard they can cause to consumers, and thus to assume measures and collaborate with the producers and consumers  for elimination of hazards that certain products might cause.                                                                According to the Article 128 of the Consumer Protection Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 38/04), the associations of consumers have the right to inform the responsible inspection authority if they learn about products or services with anomalies or hazardous products or services. Also, these associations have the right to release information to consumers about their rights and market events/developments.                                              The responsible governmental institutions and inspection entities are authorized to inform the consumers about hazards and risks that certain products feature, through the media, by holding press conferences and through other means of information dissemination.                      The Organization of Consumers of the Republic of Macedonia cooperates and maintains contact with all printed and electronic media in the Republic of Macedonia, and in doing so, it advocates for greater transparency in its functioning.    
3. Are there any marketing standards? 
The marketing standards are regulated by the Rulebook on Quality  of  fish, crabs, shellfish, sea urchins, frogs, turtles, snails and associated products (“Official Gazette of SFRY” No. 65/79 and 48/84).                                                                                                                                   This Rulebook regulates the minimum quality-related conditions that the above mentioned products have to fulfill, as well as the conditions to secure and maintain the quality.                                                              The conditions regulated by this Rulebook have to be fulfilled not only during the production process, but during the products marketing as well.

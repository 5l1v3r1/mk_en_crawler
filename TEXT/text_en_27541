PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu swore in 75 judges and prosecutors at a ceremony Tuesday (June 29th) that was attended by International Civilian Office head Pieter Feith and other international officials. Sejdiu called on the judiciary officials to be professional, impartial and honest in fulfilling their tasks. Kosovo Judicial Council head Enver Peci said that the appointment process was fair and transparent but pointed out that not all vacancies were filled. In Gjilan, for example, a district court chairman was not appointed due to the lack of a qualified candidate. (Alsat, Kohavision, RTK - 29/06/10)

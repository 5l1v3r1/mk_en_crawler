SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A joint session of BiH's two chambers of parliament ended on Tuesday (November 27th) without an agreement on new parliamentary procedures. Sulejman Tihic, leader of the Party of Democratic Action, said none of the four or five proposals different from those proposed by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak was approved. Debate continues Wednesday. Earlier this month, Lajcak decided to simplify quorum rules and, in particular, remove the ethnic voting requirement in a bid to facilitate decision-making in parliament and in the council of ministers. Republika Srpska politicians maintain Serbs will always be outvoted by majority Muslims. (Nezavisne Novine, Dnevni Avaz - 28/11/07; OHR website, RTRS, Fena, PBS, AP - 27/11/07)

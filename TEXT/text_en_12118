ATHENS, Greece -- The next round of UN-sponsored talks aimed at resolving the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece will be held within weeks, according to Greek press reports Sunday (13 March). UN mediator Matthew Nimitz made the announcement after meeting with Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Yannis Valynakis in New York earlier the same day.
In other news, former European Commission President Jacques Santer said Friday that Macedonia has made progress in implementing EU-related reforms. He added, however, that it is too early to talk about concrete dates for accession. Santer spoke during a visit to Skopje, where he attended a summit on development and co-operation among countries in the region. (ANA - 13/03/05; Vest - 12/03/05)

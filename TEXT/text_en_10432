ANKARA, Turkey -- A senior UN official said Wednesday (20 October) she was impressed with the Turkish government's commitment to ensuring respect for human rights. Speaking at the end of a ten-day visit, UN Special Representative on Human Rights Defenders Hina Jilani cautioned, however, that the new democratic laws are yet to be implemented fully at the local level. "There are still pockets of resistance to the change," she said. 
Also on Wednesday, European Commissioner for Industry Olli Rehn addressed a forum in Istanbul and said the EU intends to keep its accession promise to Turkey. Meanwhile, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, visiting Paris, said in an interview published Thursday that holding referenda on Turkey's EU membership would run counter to the Union's practices to date. Some in France have suggested holding such a referendum. (AFP, NTV - 21/10/04; AP, AFP - 20/10/04)

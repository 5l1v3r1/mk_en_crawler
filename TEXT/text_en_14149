ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Zagreb regional court on Friday (12 August) allegedly ordered extension of the custody term for Slobodan Davidovic -- a former member of the Serb paramilitary unit Scorpions -- according to regional press reports. The 52-year old Croatian Serb was arrested in June, after he was identified as a participant in the murder of six young Bosniaks in Srebrenica in 1995, that was recorded on video. The court ruled that Davidovic will remain in custody for another month, to prevent him from fleeing or influencing witnesses. (Dnevni avaz - 13/08/05)

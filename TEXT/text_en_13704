BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Members of the federal parliament are debating the nomination Friday (21 October) of Zoran Stankovic as new Serbia-Montenegrin defence minister. His predecessor in the post, Prvoslav Davinic, resigned more than a month ago amid a military procurement scandal. The position of federal defence minister is considered crucial to co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, especially regarding indictee Ratko Mladic. Local media reports suggest the vote on Stankovic will be close.
In other news, the head of Serbia's constitutional court, Slobodan Vucetic, is urging officials to appoint new judges to the court. The nine-member panel has three vacancies, crippling its decision-making ability, says Vucetic. (Danas, Glas Javnosti - 21/10/05; B92, RTS, Tanjug, Beta - 20/10/05)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu and Ukrainian counterpart Viktor Yuschenko have agreed that their countries will settle issues at a bilateral level and not seek international arbitration, it was announced Friday (22 April) after Yuschenko's visit to Bucharest. According to a statement from Basescu's office, the two presidents particularly discussed the Ukrainian project to build the Bystroe Canal in the Danube Delta, which has raised strong objections in Romania. Basescu and Yuschenko decided that a bilateral inter-state commission would be established to tackle this and other issues. (Rompres - 22/04/05; Nine o'clock - 21/04/05)

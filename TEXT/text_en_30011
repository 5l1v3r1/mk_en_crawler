PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX has announced that an international member of the mission has been suspended for alleged abuse, and that other staff members have been temporarily transferred to other duties within the mission due to security concerns. "All the individuals worked as part of the Close Protection Team to the Head of Mission, with responsibility for his physical security," EULEX said Sunday (April 17th). Media reported that the suspended official had been making offensive statements against Kosovo as a country, Albanians as a nation, and their religion, and was threatening local staff not to speak out. The outcome of the investigation is expected before the end of this month.
Meanwhile, the head of the Council for the Defence of Human Rights and Freedoms Behxhet Shala insisted that the immunity of those accused should be lifted should the claims be proved. He added that there are also cases of sexual abuse in EULEX, which, he says local staff members are afraid to report in writing amid fears they might lose their jobs.

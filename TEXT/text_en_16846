ANKARA, Turkey -- The foreign ministry voiced concern Wednesday (5 July) over a series of missile launches by North Korea, accusing Pyongyang of ignoring the security of its neighbours. "We call on the North Korean government to put an end to its missile programme immediately, to abide by the moratorium it declared in the past, and to adopt The Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation," Turkey said. 
Also on Wednesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul met with US counterpart Condoleezza Rice in Washington, where they signed a so-called "strategic vision document" aimed at launching intense bilateral dialogue on different levels. Gul said the document reflects the countries' shared values, such as democracy, human rights and a free market economy. (AFP, EU Observer, NTV - 05/07/06)

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Montenegrin Parliament rejected a no-confidence motion Wednesday (28 September) against President Filip Vujanovic. Opposition parties filed the motion, claiming that Vujanovic violated the constitution by signing a war compensation agreement during his July visit to Croatia. Vujanovic dismissed the accusations, arguing that Montenegro's symbolic payment of 400,000 euros was a way of building better relations with its neighbours. (Tanjug - 28/09/05)

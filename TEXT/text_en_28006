TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama warned the government Tuesday (September 21st) that if materials related to the disputed June 2009 general elections are destroyed, then negotiations between the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and the opposition to resolve the crisis will fail. The Central Elections Commission has announced that those elections materials, including ballot papers, must be destroyed in order to continue preparing for next year's local elections. The SP insists on a thorough investigation into last year's election, alleging numerous violations in the voting process. Rama was speaking in Rreshen, where he launched a series of meetings with SP supporters about protests aimed at bringing down the government due to economic issues and unemployment.

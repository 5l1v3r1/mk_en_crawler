ANKARA, Turkey -- Police have arrested 46 people in connection with a football match-fixing scandal across Europe that started from Germany several months ago. Police fanned out on Wednesday (March 24th) across a total of 26 towns and cities, detaining some prominent coaches and players including the retired star, Arif Erdem. German investigators estimate that 200 matches in 11 countries were fixed by referees and players, netting at least 10m euros in betting profits.

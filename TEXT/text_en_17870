OSIJEK, Croatia -- The Osijek County Court on Monday (April 16th) formally indicted Parliament member Branimir Glavas and six other individuals with war crimes committed in the eastern Croatian Osijek region in 1991. The seven are charged in connection with the torture and murder of ten ethnic Serb civilians. Glavas, 50, staged a debilitating month long hunger strike late last year while in custody on related charges, prompting officials to release him. He has now been ordered back behind bars.

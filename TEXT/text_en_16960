STRASBOURG, France -- Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha told the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe that Kosovo should be given independence from Serbia. He added that since it was unlikely Kosovo's ethnic Albanians and Serbia could ever reach an agreement, a solution should be imposed.
Meanwhile, both the United States and the EU commented on the inclusion, in the new draft Serbian constitution, of language describing Kosovo as an integral part of Serbia. Neither Kosovo nor Serbia has the authority to decide the issue unilaterally, said US State Department spokesman Tom Casey. "This is an issue which has to be clarified with the UN Security Council," a spokeswoman for EU security chief Javier Solana said. (Reuters, EUobserver - 03/10/06)

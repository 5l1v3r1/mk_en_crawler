BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliament should approve a new law on political parties by the middle of May, State Administration and Local Self-Government Minister Milan Markovic told Politika daily on Tuesday (April 21st). He said all parties in parliament -- except for one -- support the bill, so the approval process should be smooth. The aim is to remove very small parties from the political arena by more than doubling the number of signatures necessary to register a party to 10,000; the number for parties representing minorities is 1,000. Markovic also said he expects parliament to approve the new law on local elections -- introducing a direct vote for mayors -- before the summer recess. 
In other news Tuesday, Labour Minister Rasim Ljajic suggested cutting the number of government ministries to save money. Ljajic also said it is important that the government stop speculation about restructuring and openly admit if it has abandoned the idea because of the lack of political consensus.

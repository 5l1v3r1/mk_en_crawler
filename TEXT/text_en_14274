BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer and EU security chief Javier Solana jointly called on Monday (12 September) for the arrest of top war crimes suspects Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic by the time the 10th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords is commemorated this autumn. Speaking at a news conference following a meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels, they emphasised that full co-operation with The Hague tribunal is a crucial condition Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia-Montenegro must meet to move towards EU and NATO integration. The EU will not hesitate to block the accession process if the obligations are not met, Solana said, citing the case of Croatia. Zagreb has seen its negotiations with the EU put on hold because of its failure to hand over General Ante Gotovina to the tribunal.
In other news, NATO's defence ministers are holding an informal meeting in Berlin this week. Issues related to the Alliance's missions in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as fighting terrorism will dominate the agenda. (Nezavisne novine, Dnevni avaz - 13/09/05; NATO Web site, Beta - 12/09/05)

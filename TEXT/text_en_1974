Dejan "Bugsy" Milenkovic, charged with being an accomplice in the March 2003 murder of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, was recently extradited to Serbia after six months in a Greek prison. Nicknamed for the notorious criminal Bugsy Siegel, he is thought to have been a key member of the Zemun Clan criminal gang, whose members allegedly carried out the attack on Djindjic. 
Authorities hope he will identify those who ordered the assassination as well as clear up other unresolved questions about the case. They say he was behind the wheel of a truck that attempted to hit Djindjic's car on a Belgrade highway on 21 February 2003. Other members of the Zemun gang were then allegedly supposed to fire a rocket into the car, but the plan failed because Milenkovic did not manage to stop Djindjic's vehicle. 
Milenkovic was arrested, but freed after just three days. The circumstances of his release remain murky. Serbian police and the judiciary have leveled accusations at each other concerning the mishap, but an official investigation on the matter was never organised. 
Following his release, Milenkovic disappeared. He was on the run for 16 months, until his arrest in Thessaloniki on 16 July 2004. 
At his first appearance before the Belgrade Special Court for Organised Crime, Milenkovic requested additional time to prepare his defence. The trial is set to resume on 9 March. "I know that many are unhappy with my presence here, as some did not want to see me here alive," Milenkovic told the court. 
 Under Serbian law, he could be granted witness-associate status and the charges against him could be dropped. In that case, however, he must co-operate with the prosecution and testify against the rest of the Zemun Clan. If that does not happen, Milenkovic will be tried for the assassination of Djindjic. He also faces charges of involvement in six murders and several kidnappings.

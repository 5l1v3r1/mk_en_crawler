BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian Socialist Party (SPS) leader Ivica Dacic said on Saturday (May 3rd) that his party will not enter a coalition with the Democratic Party (DS) and the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) after next week's elections. "The speculations of an agreement between the SPS, the DS and the LDP are science fiction, because the SPS can never be in a coalition with parties that lead an anti-government and anti-national policy," Dacic told an election meeting in Pozarevac. 
Meanwhile, New Serbia (NS) leader Velimir Ilic said on Sunday that since Serbia signed the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU, there are no chances for a government coalition with the DS. President Boris Tadic, the DS leader, said on Sunday that the May 11th elections will allow citizens to decide whether to annul the SAA agreement. (Danas - 05/05/08; FoNet, B92, Blic - 04/05/08)

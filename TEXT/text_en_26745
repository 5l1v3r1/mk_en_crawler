STRASBOURG, France -- Members of the Party of European Socialists (PES) voiced their support Wednesday (March 10th) for efforts by Albania's opposition Socialist Party (SP) to investigate the 2009 general elections. SP leader Edi Rama was in Strasbourg to meet with PES officials and senior European Parliament (EP) members, explaining "I want to stress the importance of free elections and their transparency." He added that Albania must stop manipulating elections once and for all. He also called for the free movement of Albanians in Europe. 
The PES welcomed the SP's decision to end a six-month boycott and return to parliament last month. It also urged the Albanian government to do its part and allow a commission to look into the contested elections. Since its return, the SP has focused only on issues that concern it.

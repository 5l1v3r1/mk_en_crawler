SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The trial against former Bosnian Serb paramilitary unit commander Gojko Jankovic, who is charged with committing war crimes in Foca, began before the BiH Court on Friday (21 April). Jankovic is indicted in connection with the imprisonment, killing and sexual abuse of non-Serbs in the eastern Foca municipality between April 1992 and February 1993. He surrendered to the UN tribunal in March 2005. In November, Hague officials decided to transfer his case to the BiH judiciary. 
In other news, the remains of some 55 Bosniak war victims were buried in Vlasenica and Zvornik on Saturday. Most of the bodies were exhumed from a mass grave in Ogradica earlier this year. (Nezavisne novine - 23/04/06; Fena, PBS BiH - 21/04/06)

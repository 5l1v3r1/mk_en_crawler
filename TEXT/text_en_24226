BELGRADE, Serbia -- The district court in Belgrade sentenced 13 Serbs to a total of 193 years in prison Thursday (March 12th) for participating in the November 1991 mass murder of Croat military prisoners of war in Vukovar. Five other defendants won acquittal. The longest sentences -- 20 years in prison -- went to the commander of Serb forces in Vukovar, Miroljub Vujovic, and his deputy, Stanko Vujanovic. Prosecutors say the Serbs shot dead an estimated 200 Croats at the Ovcara pig farm in Vukovar. (AP, Reuters, MIA, BTA, Beta - 12/03/09)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey has accused Greece of secretly transferring US-made weapons to the Cypriot National Guard, domestic media reported Monday (August 20th). It made the claim in a diplomatic note sent to the United States. According to NTV, Ankara's move was in response to a draft congressional resolution that claims Turkish forces are using US-made weapons in the occupied northern part of the island. Turkey denies this. The bill, H. Res. 627, was introduced on August 4th.
The Cypriot government, meanwhile, has rejected Turkey's allegations that it is receiving US weapons from Greece. "Instead of dealing with the immediate withdrawal of its occupational troops from Cyprus, as stipulated by the UN resolutions, Turkey is dealing with ghosts," Cypriot Foreign Minister Erato Kozakou Marcoullis said on Tuesday.

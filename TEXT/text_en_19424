ATHENS, Greece -- The government decided on Tuesday (September 25th) to remove from schools a controversial history textbook that outraged the Orthodox Church and extreme nationalists. Education Minister Evripidis Stylianidis cited "grave reservations about the contents". 
The textbook has been the focus of heated debate for over a year because, according to critics, it presents Greece's 400 years under Ottoman rule in a softer light and underestimates the role of the Church in the fight for independence. (AFP, ERT, ANA-MPA - 25/09/07)

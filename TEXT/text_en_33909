SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A US delegation met on Monday (10 November) with the BiH Standing Committee for Military Affairs to discuss the recently launched plan to destroy Man-Portable Air Defence Systems (MANPADS). Local authorities are implementing the programme in co-operation with SFOR personnel and Washington. During the meeting, US Assistant Secretary of State Lincoln Bloomfield stressed that the sale of this equipment could result in shipments to terrorist groups, so the full destruction of MANPADS and other surplus light weapons is preferable.
In other news, the Bulldozer Commission that is crafting reforms in BiH presented a new set of 50 draft amendments Monday. They incorporate analyses and ideas of local structures in a bid to improve the business climate and boost investment. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine. Oslobodjenje - 11/11/03; FENA, BBC - 10/11/03)

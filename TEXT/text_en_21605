BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu criticised President Traian Basescu on Saturday (October 25th) for his decision to sign a controversial law granting teachers a 50% salary hike. "I can draw only one conclusion: he considers the results of the elections more important than Romania's future," Tariceanu said in a TV interview. Tariceanu said he witnessed a "cheap drama" in which Basescu asked him for additional data on the economic impact of the wage hikes. Tariceanu said the data he provided showed the measure would be catastrophic to the budget. On Friday, Basescu's approval of the wage hike triggered a stock-market crash. The Bucharest Stock Exchange suspended all transactions because of across-the-board plunges. 
Despite this, Basescu got support on Saturday from Democratic Liberal Party leader Emil Boc. He said his party would call for a no-confidence vote in parliament if the government tries to block the salary hike. "The government can either apply the law or go home," Boc said.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak says it is 99.9% certain that BiH will sign its Stabilisation and Association (SAA) agreement with the EU on June 16th. He added on Tuesday (May 13th) that implementing the agreement and pursuing the EU integration process in general will demonstrate the extent to which BiH institutions are able to effectively manage the process and meet their obligations. Observers originally expected the signing at the end of April. The EU blames the delay on slow document translations. (RTRS, SRNA, Dnevni Avaz, Onasa - 13/05/08)

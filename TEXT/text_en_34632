ATHENS, Greece -- The ruling PASOK party is ready to withdraw certain proposals it has presented to amend the election law, according to government spokesman Christos Protopappas. In an interview with the Athens newspaper <I>Ethnos</I> on Monday (25 August), he said that PASOK is also ready to accept some of the opposition's proposals as long as they would modernise the political system.

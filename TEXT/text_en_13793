SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Nineteen people were injured in a fight between soccer fans and the police in the town of Zenica late Saturday (20 August). The rioting started when officers tried to take fans of Zeljeznicar out of a stadium after their team met Celik in a local championship game. One Zeljeznicar fan died but the cause of death was not immediately clear. There were 11 police officers among the injured. Authorities are ruling out an ethnic motive for the violence. Significant property damage was also reported. (Reuters, Dnevni avaz - 22/08/05; Fena, Reuters - 21/08/05)

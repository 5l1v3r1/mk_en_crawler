TIRANA, Albania -- The OSCE Permanent Council approved the new mandate of the OSCE presence in Albania Thursday (18 December). The mandate was drafted at Tirana's request and is designed to update the terms of reference to reflect the country's development since the establishment of the presence in 1997, as well as the positive changes taking place in the region. The approved mandate reaffirms the primary goal of the OSCE presence -- to promote democratisation, the rule of law and human rights and to consolidate democratic institutions in conformity with OSCE principles, standards and commitments.

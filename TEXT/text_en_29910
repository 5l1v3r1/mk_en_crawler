PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The census process in Kosovo ended on Tuesday (April 19th), four days later than initially planned. The Bureau of Statistics decided last week to extend the headcount in seven municipalities and according to reports, there was more participation later in the process. However, no figures have been provided on how many citizens registered since the census began on April 1st. Preliminary results will be published in late June. The opposition Vetevendosje Movement slammed the census process as a failure, both technically and politically. (Zeri, Express - 20/04/11; Kohavision, Arta TV, TV 21 - 19/04/11)

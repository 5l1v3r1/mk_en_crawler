BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic said Saturday (16 October) that a bid to impeach him could result in early elections. The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party and the Socialist Party launched the procedure after Tadic publicly called on Kosovo Serbs to vote in the province's upcoming elections. So far the motion has been signed by 106 MPs; it needs 167 votes to pass. If it succeeds, a referendum will be held. If voters then rejected the motion to dismiss Tadic, parliament would be dissolved. (Tanjug, B92 - 16/10/04; SRNA, HINA Tanjug, B92 - 15/10/04)

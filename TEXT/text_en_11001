BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The chief of Belgrade's military intelligence service, General Svetko Kovac, told the newspaper Blic on Wednesday (29 June) that the army protected Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic until 2002. During that period, Mladic lived at his home and at military installations, Kovac said. He also said his service continues to receive reports that the fugitive is hiding at army barracks, but has not been able to corroborate them. He denied that military intelligence is participating in any negotiations with Mladic.
Meanwhile, the weekly Nedeljni Telegraf reported Wednesday that one of Serbia's security services has discovered Mladic's hiding place but has made no attempt to arrest him. (Danas - 30/06/05; BBC, Reuters, Blic, B92 - 29/06/05)

TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament voted late on Friday (July 20th) to elect Bamir Topi as the country's new president. The deputy chief of the ruling Democratic Party squeaked by with 85 votes , one more than the required constitutional minimum, after a handful of members of the Socialist-led coalition broke ranks and ignored a boycott that had scuttled several earlier rounds. 
Topi, a former agriculture minister, replaces President Alfred Moisiu, whose term ends on Tuesday. (AP, AFP, A1, B92, BNR, Focus, Makfax, MIA - 21/07/07; AFP, AP, BTA, Reuters - 20/07/07)

NEW YORK, United States -- The foreign ministers of Kosovo and Serbia say they are committed to discussing unresolved issues. During talks regarding Kosovo at the UN Security Council on Monday (May 17th), Serbian top diplomat Vuk Jeremic said Belgrade is ready to start talks on important issues such as Kosovo's status. But his Kosovo counterpart Skender Hyseni said that issue is closed, adding that Pristina and Belgrade can talk only as neighbouring countries. Security Council members encouraged both sides to start negotiations on a solution that will boost stability and end conflicts between the ethnic Albanian and Serb communities. In his report, UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier said the situation in Kosovo remains stable but fragile in the absence of reconciliation between the communities. (Zeri, Kohavision, RTK - 17/05/10)

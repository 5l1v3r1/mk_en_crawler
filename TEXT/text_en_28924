NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Authorities warned Great Britain on Tuesday (November 9th) that they would abolish its military bases on the island if London supports the permanent partition of its former colony. "Division is not a choice for us or for the UN and various international organisations, as well as for the EU," government spokesperson Stefanos Stefanou said, commenting on an article Monday by former British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw in the London Times. In it, Straw argued it is time for London to consider the option of "formal partition of Cyprus", should ongoing reunification talks fail. "If Straw opts for division, then he must know that this means that under the Treaty of Establishment ... Britain will not be able to retain these bases in Cyprus," Stefanou said. Britain has two military bases on the island, including one providing support for the Allied forces in Afghanistan. (Famagusta Gazette - 10/11/10; Xinhua, ISRIA - 09/11/10)

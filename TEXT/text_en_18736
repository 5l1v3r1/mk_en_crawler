SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A task force representing the governments of Bulgaria, Greece and Russia hammered out an agreement Wednesday (February 7th) to build an oil pipeline linking the Bulgarian Black Sea port of Burgas with the Greek city of Alexandroupolis. The project, dogged by delays for more than a decade, was fast-tracked recently following the rise in oil prices. The pipeline will bypass the Bosporus Straits and bring Russian and Central Asian oil to the European market. Russia will get a 51% share in the deal and Bulgaria and Greece will each receive 24.5%. The pipeline will be built by private investors, including Russia's Gazprom-Neft and Rosneft, the Russian-British venture TNK-BP, Bulgargaz and Terminal Universal Burgas from Bulgaria, and Greece's Hellenic Petroleum and Thraki. The formal signing is expected early next month. (AP, Bulgarian government website, BNR, Mediapool, ANA-MPA - 07/02/07)

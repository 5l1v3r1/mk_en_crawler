SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- If the political elite fail to reach agreement on police reform and the political situation in BiH continues to deteriorate, the international community will have to react decisively, Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian said on Sunday (September 23rd) after returning from the United States. Gregorian said the US administration told him it would support any sanctions suggested by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak, including moves to fire political leaders and penalise parties. He also said responsibility for the current impasse over police reform lies with both Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik and Bosniak leader Haris Silajdzic.
In other news Sunday, Dodik backed away from quoted comments suggesting the Kosovo status process would set a precedent for the RS to pursue independence from BiH. Speaking on Sunday, he said there is no relation between the Kosovo status solution and the future of RS. (Dnevni Avaz, Politika - 24/09/07; RTRS, NTV Hayat, FoNet, B92 - 23/09/07)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- A new poll by the CSOP agency suggests that the Democratic Party (PD) of suspended President Traian Basescu is more popular than any other in Romania. According to findings released on Tuesday (May 1st), if parliamentary elections were held now, PD would grab 34% of votes, followed by the main opposition Social Democratic Party with 20%. A new formation, the New Generation Party, would be third with 14%. The pollsters noted that support for the ruling National Liberal Party of Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu has dropped sharply, to 9%, half the level of support it enjoyed in the 2004 parliamentary elections. Asked whether they plan to participate in the May 19th referendum on impeaching Basescu, 58% of the voters said no. (Nine o'clock, Rompres - 02/05/07; Cotidianul - 01/05/07)

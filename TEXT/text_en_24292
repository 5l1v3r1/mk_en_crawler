NEW YORK, United States -- The chief prosecutor of The Hague war crimes tribunal (ICTY), Serge Brammertz, called again for the quick arrest of the two remaining war crimes fugitives, Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic. He spoke Friday (December 12th) at a UN Security Council session, presenting his regular report on Serbia's co-operation with the ICTY. Brammertz said that the arrest of the two fugitives remains a top priority in the tribunal's work. He added that the arrest of Mladic and Hadzic will continue to be the most critical part of Serbia's co-operation with the ICTY. 
The prosecutor also had praise for Belgrade's efforts, saying the arrest and extradition of Radovan Karadzic and Stojan Zupljanin marked an important turning point. Overall co-operation between the different services has improved, as has the planning and co-ordination of actions, Brammertz said.

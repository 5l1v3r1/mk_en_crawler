BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Constitutional Court confirmed on Friday (3 December) the results of the first round of presidential elections on 28 November. That means Prime Minister Adrian Nastase will face Bucharest Mayor Traian Basescu in a run-off next Sunday. The Constitutional Court also rejected as groundless all requests by the opposition to cancel last weekend's parliamentary election results, amid allegations of fraud and other irregularities.

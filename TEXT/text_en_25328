ANKARA, Turkey -- About 500 people gathered in Istanbul on Monday (October 26th) to protest actions by Israeli police at the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. The protestors marched towards the Israeli Consulate and burned an Israeli flag. The demonstration followed an outbreak of violence at the holy site, with Palestinians pelting Israeli police with stones and police responding with stun guns. Al-Aqsa has been a flashpoint for religious tensions over the past several weeks.
The protest in Istanbul came amid recently-strained relations between Israel and Turkey. Ankara cancelled a military exercise on its territory earlier this month over Israel's participation in it. Turkey has been criticising Israel over violence in the Gaza Strip. (Xinhua, AP - 26/10/09)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Civil Affairs Minister Sredoje Novic said Wednesday (July 15th) that BiH could start issuing biometric passports on October 15th, though it may be July 2010 before visa-free travel to EU countries is allowed. Novic unveiled the new passport, which will be forgery-proof and will contain all important biometric information about its owner, at a press conference. Introducing the passports is a precondition set by the EU for abolishing its visa regime with BiH. (SRNA, Dnevni Avaz, RTRS, Sarajevo-x.com - 15/07/09)

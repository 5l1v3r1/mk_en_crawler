BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn repeated on Tuesday (5 July) that the European Commission's draft framework for accession talks with Turkey is the most rigorous ever. During his presentation of the document to the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, Rehn stressed that lessons were drawn from the previous enlargement wave and the focus is "less on words and more on deeds". Membership negotiations with Ankara are due to begin on 3 October. (EU Parliament Web site, EU Activ - 05/07/05)

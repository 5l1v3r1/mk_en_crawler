VIENNA, Austria -- A new, two-day round of technical talks between delegations from Belgrade and Pristina began in Vienna on Thursday (7 September), under the chairmanship of the UN deputy envoy for the Kosovo status talks, Albert Rohan. The focus is again on decentralisation, protection of cultural and religious heritage and ethnic communities' rights in the province. Before the talks, the head of the Pristina negotiation team, Lufti Haziri, said he was optimistic about the discussions. His Serbian counterpart, Slobodan Samardzic, downplayed expectations. The two sides remain divided over the number of Serb municipalities in Kosovo. (Beta, Politika, RTS - 07/09/06)

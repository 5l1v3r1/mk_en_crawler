ATHENS, Greece -- Public Order Minister Giorgos Floridis said Thursday (5 February) that microphones would be installed at various locations in Athens during the run-up to the Olympics. He explained that this would enable special police teams to react quickly to possible terrorist explosions. Organisers also plan to install hundreds of cameras to monitor various sites around the city. Floridis promised that the surveillance equipment would not be used to collect information about private citizens.
Meanwhile, the artistic director of the Olympic ceremonies announced that the opening and closing ceremonies would focus on Greek history and art. "We will see a fairy tale about the essence of the history of the country" through sculpture, mosaic and painting, Dimitris Papaioannou said.
In other news, construction teams working on the Olympic marathon route staged protests for the third day in a row Thursday, blocking traffic with their heavy equipment. They say the project's contractor, European Technical SA, is not paying them. Government officials said replacing the firm could delay the project by a month. (AP - 05/02/04)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The country appeared headed for a cabinet shakeup on Wednesday (March 28th), as the crisis within the ruling coalition deepened. Justice Minister Monica Macovei said in an interview Tuesday that she expects to be fired. The main opposition Social Democratic Party says it is no longer interested in participating in any cabinet reshuffle, and will instead leave it all up to Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu. He reportedly has asked the Conservative Party (PC) to join the restructured government, but PC has declined the offer. Analysts say that leaves a cabinet consisting of Tariceanu's National Liberal Party and the ethnic Hungarian UDMR.
In other news, EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said on Tuesday that Romania must rein in public spending. Strict fiscal policies are necessary in an overheating economy, he warned in Brussels. (Nine O'clock - 28/03/07; AP, Mediafax - 27/03/07)

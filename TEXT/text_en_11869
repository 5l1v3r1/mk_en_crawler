BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The launching of accession talks with Turkey could create a window of opportunity for resuming talks on the reunification of Cyprus, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told the European Parliament Tuesday (18 January). Rehn said the EU would try to assist the pro-European forces in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) to ensure they do well in the upcoming elections.
Earlier this week, France's Minister Delegate for European Affairs, Claudie Haignere, became the first French government official to visit the TRNC. While in Cyprus, Haignere met with TRNC Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat as well as with Greek Cypriot representatives. (AFP, Hurriyet - 18/01/05; AFP - 17/01/05)

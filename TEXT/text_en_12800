TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament spokesperson Skender Duka said Tuesday (4 January) that deputies would convene in an extraordinary session next Monday to discuss the revised election law. Deputies of the opposition Democratic Party (DP) requested the session, saying the issue required urgent attention. DP and the ruling Socialists signed an agreement on election reform in late 2004 but parliament failed to adopt the legislative package in its last session of the year. (ATA - 04/01/05)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- US Ambassador to Macedonia Lawrence Butler has warned of possible risks that could emerge from the November referendum on the country's decentralisation laws. In an interview that appeared in the Albanian language publication Lobi, Butler said a successful referendum would block implementation of the Ohrid Peace Accords and might lead to stagnation, instability and setbacks. As for the decentralisation laws' package adopted by parliament, Butler said Washington's position coincides with those of the World Bank and IMF: that the new legislation meets the technical criteria for the successful functioning of municipalities.

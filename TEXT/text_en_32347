SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Preparations for Macedonia's first bilingual legislature are under way, Parliamentary Secretary Karolina Ognenovic-Cukalieva confirmed. In advance of Thursday's (3 October) constituent session of the new assembly, she announced that most technical requirements to enact new provisions for bilingualism in parliament have been met. According to regulations adopted in July, ethnic Albanian members of parliament can address the sessions in their mother tongue. The exception is speeches by the parliamentary chairman, which will be made solely in Macedonian.
On another note, the Macedonian Army announced Monday that over the next 45 days, it will begin withdrawing some troops deployed in the crisis areas of Tetovo and Kumanovo last year. The defence ministry says it based its decision on the current security situation. (Dnevnik, Nova Makedonija - 01/10/02; A1 TV, MIA - 30/09/02)

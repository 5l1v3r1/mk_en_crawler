ATHENS, Greece -- New Prime Minister George Papandreou, whose party PASOK won a convincing victory in the October 4th snap general elections, promised on Wednesday (October 7th) to stabilise and modernise the public sector by making "transparency" and "the interests of the citizens" his government's top priorities. "Our main goal is to reaffirm the image of the institutionsâ¦ to fight against corruption and improve the efficiency of the public sector," Papandreou said after the first cabinet meeting. "Our task is to deal with the lack of transparency and with the significant levels of corruption, which have taken the size of pandemics," he added. PASOK's programme for the first 100 days in office focuses on supporting "people with low incomes" and stimulating the economy "based on development and green energy".

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Saturday (May 1st) marked the 15th anniversary of Operation Bljesak (Flash), in which Croatian forces removed Serb forces from the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina. President Ivo Josipovic described it as a "milestone in the Homeland War", while Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor described it as a "brilliant" action in a "just, defensive and liberating" response to the aggression of Slobodan Milosevic. The 36-hour long operation started on May 1st 1995, prompting Serbian forces to bomb the centre of Zagreb on May 2nd and 3rd. 
In Serbia, liturgies were held in various locations to commemorate the victims of Flash. Belgrade says 283 Serbs were killed, including 57 women and nine children. Thousands of Serbs were forced to leave their homes. (Beta, Tanjug, B92 - 01/05/10)

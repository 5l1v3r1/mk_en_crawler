BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament on Thursday (19 June) endorsed Prime Minister Adrian Nastase's new cabinet. Of 483 lawmakers, 267 voted for and seven against the new line-up of ministers. Opposition members walked out before the vote, contending that Nastase was violating the constitution. They argued that replacing ministers was the job of the president, not the prime minister. According to the opposition, the reshuffle and downsizing is only cosmetic, as the most important ministers retained their posts. Nastase announced the restructuring on Monday, in a bid to make some ministries more efficient. (Rompres, AFP - 19/06/03)

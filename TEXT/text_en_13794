ATHENS, Greece -- All 118 passengers aboard a Helios Air Boeing 737 that crashed near Athens last week died when the plane hit the ground, Greece's chief coroner reported Saturday (20 August). Fillippos Koutsaftis denied earlier reports that many of the people had frozen to death when the airliner lost cabin pressure at high altitude. Blood samples recovered from the cockpit also indicated that one of the flight attendants may have tried to save the plane when the pilots became incapacitated. Meanwhile, a Boeing 737 owned by Helios Air made an emergency landing in Britain on Saturday, deepening concerns over the company's safety standards. (ANA, AP - 22/08/05; AP, AFP - 21/08/05)

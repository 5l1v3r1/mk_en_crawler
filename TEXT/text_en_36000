THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal on Tuesday (30 March) sentenced a former Bosnian Serb official to ten years in prison for war crimes. Miroslav Deronjic, 49, had admitted to ordering an attack on the Muslim village of Glogova on 9 May 1992 that killed more than 60 people. Hundreds of others were expelled from their homes. Deronjic was the senior Serbian Democratic Party official in the region. In a plea bargain with prosecutors, he agreed to testify against Slobodan Milosevic in exchange for the dropping of several other charges against him.

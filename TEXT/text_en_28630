PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Acting President Jakup Krasniqi said on Tuesday (October 12th), ahead of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's visit to Pristina, that Kosovo will insist the United States be among the mediators in upcoming talks with Serbia. After a meeting of the parliament presidency, Krasniqi, who is also parliament speaker, added that he will announce soon a date for early elections, in the wake of former President Fatmir Sejdiu's resignation last month. He pointed out that the optimal time for holding snap elections is the first half of February. Thus, direct talks between Belgrade and Pristina could begin in March, after a new Kosovo government assumes office, he said. (Tanjug, B92, FoNet, Blic, Koha Ditore - 12/10/10)

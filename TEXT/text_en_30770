ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou told lawmakers on Friday (December 10th) that procedures for the construction of a mosque in Athens have been accelerated. "It is a disgrace that for 25 years, maybe more, since [late Prime Minister] Andreas Papandreou promised the creation of a mosque in the greater Athens area, we have been unable to create such a building," he said. Muslims who reside in Athens have a right to a mosque, he stressed. (ANA-MPA, AFP - 10/12/10)

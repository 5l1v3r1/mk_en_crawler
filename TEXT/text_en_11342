SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prosecutors from BiH and Montenegro signed a protocol of co-operation in Sarajevo on Thursday (26 May). It allows prosecutors to collaborate during investigative and court proceedings involving the most serious types of crime, especially in securing evidence and witnesses in such cases. Officials say co-operation of this kind would be of great help in tackling organised crime, especially drug smuggling networks, because one of the most frequently used routes passes through Montenegro and BiH.

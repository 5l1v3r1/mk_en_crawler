ANKARA, Turkey -- A series of protests were held Tuesday (April 13th) after an attack against banned pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) Chairman Ahmet Turk. He was reportedly punched in the face by an assailant Monday in the northern province of Samsun as he was leaving a courthouse, suffering a broken nose and facial cuts. Police have made two arrests in the incident. 
Demonstrators in Istanbul gathered at Taksim Square amid strong security measures. Protests in Samsun turned violent after demonstrators and members of the public clashed, forcing police to intervene. More than 2,000 people protested in Diyarbakir, including leaders of the Democracy and Peace Party, which many DTP lawmakers joined after their organisation's closure in December for having links to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). In Hakkari, 5,000 people took part in a protest before police dispersed them with tear gas. There were clashes in Didim, in Aydin province, where 13 people were arrested.

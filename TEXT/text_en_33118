ATHENS, Greece -- Civil servants are staging a 24-hour strike Monday (19 May), demanding higher wages. The strike is being organised by the Greek Civil Servants' Union (ADEDY). The finance ministry commented that meeting workers' demands would place a huge burden on the state budget. ADEDY representatives are to meet on Thursday with Finance Minister Nikos Christodoulakis.

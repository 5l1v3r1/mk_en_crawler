ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament approved controversial amendments to the country's labour law Monday (14 July) despite strong objections from the employers' association and trade unions. The changes reduce benefits to laid-off workers and shorten severance periods to a maximum of three months. Responding to criticism from the business community and unions, the government said the reforms are needed to harmonise Croatia's labour legislation with those in neighbouring and EU member countries.

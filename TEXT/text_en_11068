TIRANA, Albania -- The IMF's resident representative to Albania, Jan-Peter Olters, has cited modernisation of the country's tax, customs and telecommunications sectors as the main prerequisites for continued growth and increased foreign investments. In a weekend interview with Reuters published Monday (27 December), Olters noted that Albania's average GDP has a faster rate of growth compared to its neighbours, thanks to its lower base, market liberalisation and higher productivity. "But these factors that motivated and drove growth in the previous years become less important every year," he said. Albania's GDP rose by 6 per cent this year.

STRASBOURG, France -- Integration Minister Besim Beqaj said on Tuesday (September 21st) that Pristina's various institutions have fulfilled the criteria set by the European Commission (EC) for visa liberalisation. He told EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele in Strasbourg that efforts were ramped up after EC Director for Western Balkans Pierre Mirel suggested in July that institutions strengthen the rule of law and complete the legal framework to fight organised crime and corruption.

VIENNA, Austria -- Authorities announced on Thursday (12 May) that Austria broke up a major human trafficking ring led by Romanian, Moldovan and Ukrainian criminals who smuggled more than 5,000 Eastern Europeans to the West. Many allegedly endured horrific conditions in tiny hiding spaces in cars, trucks and trailers. The Federal Criminal Investigations Office said it arrested 64 people in a large-scale operation that began last June and focused on the country's border checkpoints. (AP - 13/05/05)

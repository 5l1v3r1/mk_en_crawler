VIANA DO CASTELA, Portugal -- After meeting with her EU counterparts in Portugal, Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik criticised the positions held by Russia and the United States regarding Kosovo's future status. In an interview Sunday (September 9th) with Austrian radio, Plassnik seemed to criticise a recent statement by a US State Department official, who suggested Washington would recognise Kosovo's independence if no agreement between Belgrade and Pristina is reached. She also criticised Moscow's unfaltering pro-Serbian position. "Neither of the two -- Serbia or Kosovo -- will join either the United States or Russia, but the direction is the EU," Plassnik said. 
Separately Sunday, Russia's envoy to the Contact Group's troika on Kosovo, Aleksandr Botsan-Kharchenko, insisted that Kosovo's future is not a European matter but a UN one. He urged that the final status be resolved according to UN Resolution 1244.
As for Washington's stand, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said on Sunday it was harmful to ongoing negotiations. He asked the US Embassy in Belgrade for a clarification. (Politika, Danas - 10/09/07; B92, RTS, AP, DPA, RFE, Tanjug, Telegrafi, AFP, Reuters, DW - 09/09/07)

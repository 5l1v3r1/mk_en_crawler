 Albanian Economy Minister Genc Ruli and Greek Development Minister Dimitris Sioufas met in Athens to discuss the possibility of increasing Greek electricity exports to Albania, which is working to stabilise its energy situation. The power crisis has led to blackouts lasting 12 to 13 hours. According to the Albanian power utility KESH, the country's hydropower plants are near a shutdown, due to continued drought. The utility is able to generate only 8-10m kWh of electricity per day --- two times lower than the level of domestic consumption.

BELGRADE, Serbia and Montenegro -- A senior aide to Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic surrendered to authorities in Belgrade on Monday (21 February). Former General Milan Gvero, 67, turned himself in after being told that the UN tribunal had issued a secret unsealed indictment against him. He is due to travel to The Hague on Thursday. 
In other news Monday, four opposition parties in the Serbia-Montenegro Parliament announced a joint initiative to launch an impeachment procedure against the federal union's president, Svetozar Marovic. They say he failed to organise timely direct elections for a new federal parliament. The current assembly's mandate is to expire on 5 March, but no new voting has been scheduled.

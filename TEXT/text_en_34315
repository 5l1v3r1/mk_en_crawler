PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The UN police force in Kosovo and KFOR announced Tuesday (28 October) the arrest of five ethnic Albanians on war crimes charges. They are accused of the illegal detention and murder of four fellow ethnic Albanians and the torture of a fifth victim who survived. All five suspects were junior members of the now-disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) from the town of Kacanik. They allegedly carried out the killings to avenge suspected collaboration with Serbian authorities during the 1998-1999 conflict.

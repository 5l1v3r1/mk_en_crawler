NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat said on Saturday (July 19th) that a solution to the Cypriot issue should be based on the principle of "two equal states and two equal communities". The two leaders met in Nicosia, where Erdogan attended a ceremony marking the arrival of Turkish troops on the northern part of the divided island on July 20th 1974. Both leaders said they hope the meeting between Talat and Greek Cypriot President Demetris Christofias Friday will mark the beginning of comprehensive reunification talks.

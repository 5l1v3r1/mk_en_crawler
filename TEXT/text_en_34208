ZAGREB, Croatia -- On Monday (7 July), Defence Minister Zeljka Antunovic met with the new US Ambassador to Zagreb Ralph Frank. Antunovic said afterwards that bilateral military co-operation was developing well, despite the suspension of US military assistance to her country. Croatia was one of the states that refused to sign bilateral immunity agreements with the United States, thus losing US military aid as of 1 July.
In other news, Parliament Speaker Zlatko Tomcic met with senior officials in London on Monday, seeking support for Croatia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. The British Parliament refused to ratify it in October, when Zagreb failed to proceed with the UN war crimes tribunal's indictment against retired Gen Janko Bobetko, who has since died.

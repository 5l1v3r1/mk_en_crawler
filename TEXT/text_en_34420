ZAGREB, Croatia -- The US Embassy in Zagreb has opened a direct phone line for people to use to provide any information they may have on fugitive war crimes indictees, as part of the US government's Rewards for Justice programme. <b>The phone number is: (385)-1-661-2150.</b> According to a statement from the embassy, the phone line is not related solely to General Ante Gotovina but to all suspects indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. During a meeting Thursday with ambassadors from EU member states, President Stipe Mesic insisted Croatia is willing to co-operate with the tribunal.
In other news, the government Thursday adopted a report on refugee returns and decided on a series of measures to speed up the process. According to the data, 81,000 refugees have returned to the country since 2000. At the same session, the cabinet passed a national programme for the integration and support of the Roma minority, which numbers about 9,500. (HINA, BBC - 16/10/03)

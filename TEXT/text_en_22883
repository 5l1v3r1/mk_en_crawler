BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn on Wednesday (November 5th) urged Turkey to implement the Ankara Protocol, which expands the Turkey-EU customs union to include Cyprus, including free access for Greek Cypriot planes and ships to Turkish airports and ports. Ankara refuses to implement it, as it has not recognised the Republic of Cyprus. Rehn's statement came in response to a question by the Cypriot parliament's foreign affairs committee chairman, Averof Neofytou. This was during a joint meeting of the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee with the chairs of EU member states' relevant parliamentary committees.

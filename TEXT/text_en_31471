TIRANA, Albania -- Co-operation between Albania and Kosovo is intensifying at a rapid rate, especially in the economic, banking and financial sectors, says Albanian Foreign Minister Ilir Meta. At a press conference Thursday (23 January) after his meeting with Ajri Begu, Chairman of the Board of Banking and Payments Authority of Kosovo, Meta said he was determined to further intensify such co-operation. He also urged Kosovo's elected officials to assume more responsibilities, echoing a sentiment expressed several days ago by UNMIK chief Michael Steiner. (ATA -23/01/03)

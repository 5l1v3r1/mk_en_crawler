BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The federal foreign ministry on Thursday (1 July) submitted the UN tribunal's indictments against four retired generals to a local court, launching a procedure that could lead to their extradition to The Hague. In October, international prosecutors indicted former police chiefs Sreten Lukic and Vlastimir Djordjevic, former Chief of General Staff Nebojsa Pavkovic and retired army General Vladimir Lazarevic for war crimes against ethnic Albanians during the 1999 Kosovo conflict. While Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic and Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic publicly backed Thursday's decision, a representative of the Socialists said his party would withdraw support from Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's cabinet if the four generals were sent to The Hague.

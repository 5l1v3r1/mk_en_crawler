SREBRENICA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Preparations are under way to mark the 11th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, considered Europe's worst atrocity since World War II. On Tuesday (11 July), the anniversary will be commemorated with the burial of 500 more victims at a cemetery near Srebrenica. Forensic experts also say they have recovered the bodies of 268 victims from a mass grave in Jaz, an area near the village of Kamenica and the city of Zvornik. This was the eighth -- and most likely the biggest -- mass grave in the area. The multinational forensic team believes the victims were initially buried elsewhere and brought to Kamenica to hide evidence of the atrocity. Most of the dead were males between the ages of 16 and 60. (Reuters - 06/07/06)

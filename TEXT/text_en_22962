PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Mitrovica Mayor Bajram Rexhepi said on Wednesday (June 4th) that he expects decisions regarding the divided town to be based on the proposal of former UN envoy to Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari, when Kosovo's constitution enters into force on June 15th. After meeting with KFOR Commander Xavier Bout de Marnhac, Rexhepi said there is a request to re-establish customs service at two northern Kosovo border crossings, which Serbs destroyed after Kosovo declared independence in February. "If this fails, these two border points should be closed for a month ... to prevent smuggling and losses to the Kosovo budget," Rexhepi said.

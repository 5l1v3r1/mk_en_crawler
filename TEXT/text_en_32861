PODGORICA, Montenegro, Yugoslavia -- Four candidates have registered to run in the 22 December presidential election, according to the election commission. Dragan Hajdukovic, Mihajlo Markovic and Milivoje Bakic will run as independents while Obred Markovic was nominated by the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists. Leaders of the major opposition party, the Socialist People's Party, announced Saturday that it will join other opposition parties in boycotting the election.
Meanwhile, a scandal erupted at the weekend. Montenegro's Deputy State Prosecutor Zoran Piperovic was arrested Saturday in connection with human trafficking and prostitution. The charges were based on a Moldovan girl who was allegedly forced into prostitution. Piperovic denied the charges before a magistrate Sunday. (Tanjug, B92, FoNet, BBC, AP, AFP - 01/12/02)

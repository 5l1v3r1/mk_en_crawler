PODGORICA, Montenegro -- A court acquitted nine former police officers Tuesday (March 29th) charged with the 1992 illegal deportation of Bosniak civilians from Montenegro. Over 79 Bosniaks were handed over to Bosnian Serbs, who killed most of them. The court ruled there was insufficient evidence to prove war crimes charges. It added that the forcible transfer was illegal but did not amount to a war crime, as Montenegro was not a side in the Bosnian conflict. (RTCG, Tanjug, Mina - 29/03/11)

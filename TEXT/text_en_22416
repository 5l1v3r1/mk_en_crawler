BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic is lobbying UN members to back Serbia's bid to seek the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) opinion on Kosovo's declaration of independence in February, media reported on Thursday (September 11th). "I would like to ask your country's support to include [the initiative] in the agenda of the 63rd session of the UN General Assembly. I am also calling for your support during the vote on the draft resolution itself in the General Assembly," Tadic said in a letter to UN members, adding the court's opinion will "significantly contribute to easing tensions created as a consequence" of Kosovo's unilateral declaration. Serbia maintains that Kosovo's move constitutes a violation of the UN Charter and other key international documents and violates UN Security Council Resolution 1244, which obliges member states to respect Serbia's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Also Thursday, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic presented Belgrade's initiative on Kosovo during a meeting with Greek counterpart Dora Bakoyannis in Athens. Bakoyannis noted that, while the presence of the EU's EULEX police and judicial mission in Kosovo will contribute to peace and security in the region, Greece's participation in EULEX does not imply recognition of Kosovo.

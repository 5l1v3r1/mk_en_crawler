NEW DELHI, India -- The Serbian pilot of the Air India plane which crashed on Saturday (May 22nd) apparently landed too far down the runway, leaving the plane insufficient room to come to a stop, investigators said. Zlatko Glusica, formerly with the Serbian national carrier JAT Airways, had been working for Air India for the past three years. Colleagues said he was a seasoned pilot with more than 10,000 hours of flying experienced. The flight from Dubai lost control while attempting to land at Mangalore Airport, then careened over a cliff and broke up after hitting an antenna. Eight people survived and 158 were killed.
Serbian President Boris Tadic expressed his condolences to Indian leaders and people over the tragedy. "Accept our deepest condolences in the name of the Serbian people and myself personally," the president wrote in a telegram sent to Indian President Pratibha Patil.

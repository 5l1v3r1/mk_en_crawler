ZAGREB, Croatia -- The UN tribunal at The Hague has decided to merge the trials of three Croatian generals -- Ante Gotovina, Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac -- lawyers confirmed on Sunday (16 July). The move came at the request of prosecutors. The three generals are charged with crimes committed against ethnic Serb civilians during the 1995 Croatian military operation Storm. 
In other news, the BiH war crimes court confirmed on Friday an indictment against four Bosnian Serbs -- Zeljko Mejakic, Momcilo Gruban, Dusan Fustar and Dusko Knezevic -- for crimes against humanity. They are charged in connection with crimes committed against non-Serb prisoners of war in the eastern BiH region of Prijedor in May-August 1992. The case was transferred from The Hague tribunal to the BiH judiciary in May. (HINA, HRT - 16/07/06; PBS BiH - 14/07/06)

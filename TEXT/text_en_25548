SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko said on Friday (November 20th) that BiH will get full EU visa liberalisation in July next year and will join the bloc in 2014. "Let's hope that the visa liberalisation will come from July 1st next year. A difference of six months between the scrapping of visas for Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro, and BiH would still be tolerable, but a difference of one year would be a catastrophe for the mentality of people," Inzko said in an interview for the Vienna-based newspaper Der Standard.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- During talks with Bulgarian EU Affairs Minister Meglena Kuneva in Brussels Wednesday (1 September), EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen urged Sofia to step up efforts in the field of judicial reform as well as in combating organised crime. Noting that reforms are not easy, Verheugen stressed that Bulgaria would be carefully monitored for implementation of commitments it has made. 
In other news, following shootings in Sofia that left two dead, Bulgarian Chief Prosecutor Nikola Filchev set a 24-hour deadline for the interior ministry to conduct a mass operation against organised crime. The action is expected to result in arrests of suspected mafia bosses nationwide. (Sega, Dnevnik - 02/09/04; bTV, Mediapool - 01/09/04)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- More than 500,000 employees of the Romanian Railways Company held a two-hour warning strike Monday (1 March). The protesters voiced their disagreement with the government's proposal for a 3 per cent rise of wages, insisting instead on a 12 per cent salary increase, as well as improved conditions of work and cessation of layoffs.

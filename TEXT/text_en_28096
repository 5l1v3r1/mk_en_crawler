PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Representatives of Kosovo institutions have refused to hold technical talks with Belgrade until after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) rules on the legitimacy of Kosovo's declaration of independence. Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said on Sunday (May 16th) everything is still in the idea stage. "There is nothing concrete about time, subjects, but it is an idea that is prepared at the international and regional level," Kuci said. He added that it is meaningless to talk about anything else before the issue of missing persons is resolved and Serbia returns stolen documentation. The ICJ's final ruling will be delayed now, due to the unexpected departure this month of a judge handling the case. (Koha Ditore, Express, Telegrafi, RTK - 17/05/10)

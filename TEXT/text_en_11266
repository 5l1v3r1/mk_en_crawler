BRUSSELS, Belgium -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair told the European Parliament Thursday (23 June) that the enlargement process provides a "historic opportunity to build a greater and more powerful Union". He warned against a resurgence of nationalism and xenophobia in the EU and said shutting the door to new members would not save jobs or businesses in the West. Blair pledged that when Britain assumes the rotating EU chairmanship next month, it will work to fulfill Union commitments to candidate countries. 
Also Thursday, the chief of the EBRD urged the EU to avoid confusion over its plans for future enlargement. Jean Lemierre warned that it would be very difficult to make the process of reforms in Eastern Europe sustainable without EU accession. Eliminating the promise of membership, he explained, would remove a driving force for change in these countries. (Vjesnik, FT - 24/06/05; Reuters, Turkish Daily News, Reuters - 23/06/05)

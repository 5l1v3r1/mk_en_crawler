THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The largest trial yet of senior Serbian officials began on Monday (10 July) at The Hague's International War Crimes Tribunal. Six men, including former President Milan Milutinovic, face war crimes charges over the actions of Serb troops during the conflict in Kosovo in 1999. The six deny murdering, persecuting and deporting ethnic Albanians. Analysts say the trial could last two years. (BBC -- 10/07/06)

NEW YORK, United States -- Theodor Meron, the president of the UN tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, told the UN Security Council on Tuesday (29 June) that war crimes suspects and their backers are "waiting out" the UN tribunal, which is scheduled to close in 2010. The international war crimes court has been asked to wrap up its investigations in 2004, complete all trials by 2008 and hear appeals by 2010. His remarks were echoed by UN war crimes chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte, who urged Council members to keep the tribunal open until key suspects -- including Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and retired Croatian General Ante Gotovina -- are brought to justice. She praised Croatia's efforts, saying Zagreb is fully co-operating with the tribunal and that she expects Gotovina will be arrested soon. She says Karadzic's arrest may be imminent.
In other news Tuesday, the UN tribunal sentenced Milan Babic, the leader of Serb separatists in Croatia's Krajina region, to 13 years in prison. Babic had pleaded guilty, in a plea bargain with prosecutors. They recommended an 11-year sentence for his role in the ethnic cleansing campaign, in exchange for testimony against former Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic.

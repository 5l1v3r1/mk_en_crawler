NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The body of former President Tassos Papadopoulos was reburied on Thursday (March 11th), three months after it was stolen from its grave in Nicosia. The short ceremony brought together hundreds of family friends and supporters of the late president, whose remains were recovered last week. Police spokesperson Michalis Katsounotos announced on Thursday that a fourth suspect has been arrested in connection with the theft. Police say the motive was ransom, which the family refused to pay.

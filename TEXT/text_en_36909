THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Judges were expected to rule Tuesday (6 July) on how to proceed with Slobodan Milosevic's two-year-old war crimes trial in The Hague. The start of his defence phase was postponed Monday due to concerns about his health, particularly damage to his heart resulting from chronic high blood pressure. Prosecutors have requested that a lawyer be appointed to represent Milosevic, despite his repeated refusals. "The trial chamber is clearly of the view that the time has come for a radical review of the trial process," said Presiding Judge Patrick Robinson. Their ruling is expected later Tuesday.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu spoke bluntly on Tuesday (February 22nd) during an event at the interior ministry. "Stick out your finger and you hit elements of corruption," he said. Basescu called for a thorough reform of the ministry based on a man-by-man evaluation so that only the competent and the "clean" remain.
In other news Tuesday, Victor Ponda, leader of the opposition Social-Liberal Union (USL), said the party may submit a no-confidence motion in case the cabinet initiates the accountability procedure over the labour code. The procedure accelerates the process, but allows the opposition the opportunity to initiate that no-confidence motion. Ponta says trade unions and employers' associations alike are unhappy with the new labour code. (Hotnews.ro, Adevarul, Antena 3, Ziare, Realitatea - 22/02/11)

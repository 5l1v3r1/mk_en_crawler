BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha delivered responses to the European Commission's (EC) lengthy questionnaire on EU integration Wednesday (April 14th). Berisha said the moment is "historic for Albania" and is the most important in the past 18 years. "About 1,200 experts have worked on the questionnaire to bring answers and hope for a positive evaluation," Berisha said at a Brussels press conference with EC Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele, after he presented the 2,284 answers. Based on those responses, the EC will decide whether Albania meets criteria for EU candidate status. (Shekulli, Lajmifundit, Alsat, Top News - 14/04/10)

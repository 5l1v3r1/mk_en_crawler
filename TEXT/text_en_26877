ZAGREB, Croatia -- The justice ministry announced on Saturday (September 5th) it has demanded that Australian prosecutors explain why no appeal was lodged against a local court's decision to release former Serb paramilitary leader Dragan Vasiljkovic. He is charged in Croatia with suspected involvement in the 1991 torture and killing of Croatian civilians and prisoners of war in the rebel Serb stronghold of Knin, and in the southern village of Bruska in 1993. An Australian court, however, concluded that Vasiljkovic could not be extradited to Croatia for trial on war crimes charges, because he would face "a substantial or real chance of prejudice". The deadline for appealing the court's decision expired on Friday. Vasiljkovic was released from custody that same day. Zagreb insists it sent all documents that Australian state prosecutors needed for an appeal. (HRT, HINA, Index, Jutarnji, Vecernji - 05/09/09; DPA - 04/09/09)

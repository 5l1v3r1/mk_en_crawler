TIRANA, Albania -- Political parties began campaigning for the May 8th local elections with weekend rallies. The ruling Democratic Party (DP) leaders presented former Minister for Tourism Ferdinand Xhaferri as their candidate for the port city of Durres on Sunday (April 3rd), promising to make Durres a regional tourism centre. The opposition Socialist Party focused in Tirana where leader and current mayor Edi Rama emphasised infrastructure projects implemented during his tenure. The DP candidate in that race is Lulzim Basha. Campaigning officially begins on Friday. 
Meanwhile, the first incident of election-related violence occurred in the region of Lezha. Candidate Zef Doci, representing the Socialist Movement for Integration in the Balldre municipality, was shot Saturday after returning from a rally. Police have arrested the suspected shooter. Doci is at the military hospital in Tirana. 
Visiting Tirana, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Countryman said the election process will be closely watched by the international community, adding its assessment will be vital to Albania's EU future.

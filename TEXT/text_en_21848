TIRANA, Albania -- The country needs to bridge the gap in its human rights record and offer more protection to women and children, ethnic minorities and the disabled, according to a new report by the Council of Europe's (CoE) commissioner for human rights, Thomas Hammarberg. In the report, released on Wednesday (June 18th), Hammarberg criticised the legal system, saying it remains under political influence. He also said there are no state structures to protect the rights of minorities, particularly the Romas. The report additionally cites a high level of domestic violence and substandard prison conditions. (Shekulli -19/06/08; VOA, Top Channel, Alsat - 18/06/08)

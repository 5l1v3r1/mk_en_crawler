SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Nedelcho Beronov, president of the Constitutional Court, officially entered the presidential race on Thursday (17 August). He was nominated after talks lasting several months among eight main right-wing parties. He won the support of the four largest ones -- Democrats for Strong Bulgaria, United Democratic Forces, the Democratic Party and the People's Agricultural Union. Beronov said he wants to be the president of people who want change and prosperity for the country. He accuses incumbent Georgi Parvanov of putting party interests ahead of the public's. The election will be held on 22 October. (Mediapool, bTV, Dnevnik - 17/08/06)

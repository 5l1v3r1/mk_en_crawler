ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader confirmed on Tuesday (January 29th) that General Josip Lucic will remain at the helm of the army's General Staff for another five-year term. Lucic's mandate expired officially on January 16th, and his post was taken up temporarily by Slavko Baric. 
Lucic's nomination for another term has aroused opposition because he did not receive a formal military education and did not graduate from a military academy. Critics also say keeping the same army chief for such an extended period is against NATO practice. (HRT - 30/01/08; Vecernji List, HRT - 29/01/08)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Torrential rains and floods in the west and snow and blizzards in the east paralysed parts of Turkey on Saturday (October 31st). In Istanbul, rains flooded houses and offices in both the Asian and European parts of the city, disrupting transportation. A building under construction in the Caglayan district collapsed, but no one was injured. 
On Friday, Istanbul authorities began knocking down unlicensed buildings after substandard construction was blamed for a number of deaths in September's flash floods. In all, 29 people were killed. Most of the buildings set for demolition are in Istanbul's industrial area. (BTA - 31/10/09; AFP, Anadolu news agency - 30/10/09)

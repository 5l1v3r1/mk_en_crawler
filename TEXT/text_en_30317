BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Greece managed to return to economic expansion in the first quarter of the year, posting a 0.8% economic growth after nearly three years of economic decline, Eurostat data revealed on Friday (May 13th). In its spring forecasts on the EU economies, the European Commission's (EC) statistics body projected the Greek economy would contract by 3.5% in 2011 and the budget deficit would shrink to 9.5% of gross domestic product from 10.5% last year, well above the government's target of 7.4%. At the same time, the EC urged Greece to take further measures to overcome its financial crisis and meet its 2011 deficit targets. (ANA-MPA, Sigma Live - 13/05/11)

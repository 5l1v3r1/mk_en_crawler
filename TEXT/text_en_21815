CETINJE, Montenegro -- Re-elected last month, President Filip Vujanovic was sworn in on Tuesday (May 20th) to a second term. He pledged continued support for Montenegro's Euro-Atlantic integration efforts.
Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany sounded that same theme Tuesday in Budapest, following a meeting with Montenegrin counterpart Milo Djukanovic. Gyurcsany announced that large Hungarian companies could soon enter the Montenegrin market, a move that may encourage Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises to invest there. For his part, Djukanovic described political and economic ties with Hungary as excellent. Concerning the political situation in Serbia, the two prime ministers agreed that Serbia should remain on a democratic and pro-European path. (Vijesti, Pobjeda - 21/05/08; RTCG, B92, MTI - 20/05/08)

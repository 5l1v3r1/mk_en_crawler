ATHENS, Greece -- Merchant Marine Minister George Voulgarakis resigned on Friday (September 12th) over a real estate scandal. He has been accused of setting up an offshore real estate company to avoid property tax, and of being involved in a real estate transaction between the state and the Monastery of Vatopedi on Mount Athos. Greece's Supreme Court has ordered an investigation of the property trade. Former Justice Minister Anastasios Papaligouras will replace Voulgarakis.

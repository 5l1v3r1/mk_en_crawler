SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The prosecutor's office charged former Agriculture Minister Nihat Kabil with abuse of power on Thursday (May 20th), stemming from two land deals while he was in office -- from 2007 to 2009 -- that cost the county a total of 57m euros. He is the second agriculture minister from the previous administration to face charges related to land swaps. Both he and Valeri Tsvetanov were members of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms. A similar indictment has been issued against Stefan Yurukov, the former head of the State Forestry Agency. (BNR, Darik, Dnevnik - 20/05/10)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- As promised, trade unions launched a nationwide strike in the public sector on Monday (May 31st) to protest government plans to cut wages in the sector by 25%. The measure is part of the new austerity package negotiated with the IMF, an argument the unions aren't buying. Despite massive participation in the strike, it hasn't spread quite as widely as billed. Graduation exams, for example, proceeded in high schools. But there was plenty not happening due to walkouts in the customs sector, hospitals, city halls, the foreign ministry and elsewhere. Strikers themselves are feeling the pinch, as time off is unpaid, a growing financial burden on them. Retirees also joined the protest, as the government intends to cut their pensions by 15%, effective Tuesday. Early retirement is being banned entirely, which may turn out to be a problem in high-stress and high-risk professions. The unions insist on more balanced spending cuts, with less emphasis on wage cuts. (Cotidianul, Evenimentul Zilei - 01/06/10; Mediafax - 31/05/10)

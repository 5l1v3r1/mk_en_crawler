BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Vojislav Kostunica, the leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), says a minority government is the only option for Serbia. In a TV appearance Monday (19 January), he said inclusion of the Democratic Party (DS) in the government was never an option. He said that originally the idea was to have a broad-based government or a reduced-term cabinet. Once these options were exhausted, a minority government became the sole option.
In other news Monday, Federal Army Chief of Staff General Branko Krga said the defence strategy of Serbia-Montenegro has been completed. Now that a group of experts has drafted the policy, it moves next to public discussion and parliament. (B92, BBC, State TV, Tanjug - 19/01/04)

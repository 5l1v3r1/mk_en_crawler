BELGRADE, Serbia -- Federalisation is the only solution for Serbia, the president of the Union of Socialists of Vojvodina, Zivan Berisavljevic, said on Monday (August 13th). "We want Vojvodina to be the second equally-righted entity, or maybe the third, if Kosovo remains within Serbian borders," Berisavljevic said. He added that while Serbia's historic right of souvereignty must be acknowledged, Vojvodina's situation cannot be ignored.
"The Belgrade political elite will try to compensate the possible loss of Kosovo through negation of Vojvodina's autonomy. The option of internationalisation of the Vojvodina issue should not be excluded, if Belgrade's political elite continues to neglect Vojvodina's demands," Berisavljevic said. (A1 - 13/08/07)

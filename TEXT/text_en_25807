TIRANA, Albania -- Doris Pack, head of the European Parliament's (EP) Committee for Southeast Europe, said in a statement Friday (September 18th) that countries in the Balkans are so similar that it is meaningless to differentiate among them. In her statement, published shortly after a heated debate Wednesday in the EP on visa liberalisation for the Balkans, Pack criticised the idea of excluding Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) from the process. For example, she predicted the Muslim community in BiH will become a "ghetto" if the country is excluded from the visa liberalisation process. She pointed out that while the people of these countries deserve a better future and fast integration, their politicians are not committed enough to meet the standards.

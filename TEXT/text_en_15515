PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The sole Serb member of Kosovo's interim government, Slavisa Petkovic, has resigned from the post of minister for return. Prime Minister Agim Ceku issued a statement Friday (November 24th) saying he had accepted the resignation, purportedly over performance issues at the ministry. But Petkovic told the local Koha ditore newspaper that he decided to quit over a lack of collaboration with UNMIK and the UNDP. 
In other news Friday, Sanda Raskovic-Ivic, head of the Serbian government's co-ordination centre for Kosovo and Metohija, said that Belgrade and UNMIK officials agreed in Pristina to quickly resolve the energy crisis in the province. Most pressing are short-term and long-term solutions to problems with electricity supplies to Serb settlements in Kosovo. (B92, Koha ditore - 25/11/06; Tanjug - 24/11/06)

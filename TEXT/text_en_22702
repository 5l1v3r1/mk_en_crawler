BELGRADE, Serbia -- The district court in Belgrade will hear from seven men Monday (November 10th) suspected of helping war crimes suspect Stojan Zupljanin evade justice, court spokesperson Ivana Ramic told Tanjug. War crimes prosecutors requested an investigation of the seven suspects on October 30th, based on suspicions they helped Zupljanin hide for nine years until his arrest in June. Police finally captured him near Belgrade and handed him over to The Hague war crimes tribunal in connection with crimes committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko announced on Wednesday (November 3rd) that he has discontinued the vetting of candidates for ministerial posts, effective immediately. The decision was adopted following consultations with the Peace Implementation Council Steering Board and is aimed at encouraging Bosnian leaders to assume greater responsibility. The international community introduced its vetting process in 2000. Five years later, the BiH parliament introduced its own mechanism for scrutinising ministerial candidates at the state level. Inzko said he expects authorities at entity and canton levels to introduce similar mechanisms. He retains his authority to remove officials who threaten implementation of the Dayton Peace Accord.

STRASBOURG, France -- Two senior EU officials warned Romania on Wednesday (10 March) that it must do more to fight corruption if it wants to meet its target date for accession. EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen said authorities must not limit their fight against corruption to junior civil servants, but should catch the "big fish". Emma Nicholson, the European Parliament's rapporteur on Romania's progress towards membership, said Wednesday that "we want Romania to join, but not at a price that is too high for Europe's citizens to pay." She cautioned that the 2007 target date is not a "done deal".
In other news Wednesday, parliament voted to approve changes in the cabinet. Prime Minister Adrian Nastase explained that new appointments were needed to accelerate the reform process so the country could complete EU accession talks by the end of the year. The opposition parties refused to take part in the vote. (AFP, Rompres, Sega - 10/03/04)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonian police denied allegations by Amnesty International that its officers were using torture, particularly against members of the ethnic Albanian minority. On Saturday (25 January), a spokeswoman admitted that there have been abuses, but denied any of them involved torturing suspects. Mirjana Najceska from the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Macedonia also denounced the report, calling it "unprofessional".
In a separate development, three women were killed in a bar in Dobri Dol near Tetovo. They are thought to have died in a shootout between rival gangs specializing in human trafficking. A man was later found murdered in the nearby village of Senokos. Police believe the two incidents are linked. (bTV, BNT, Nova TV, AP, AFP - 25/01/03)

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The Movement for Social Democracy (KS-EDEK) announced on Monday (February 8th) it has decided to leave the ruling coalition, accusing President Demetris Christofias of making concessions to Turkish Cypriots during talks to reunify the divided island. The withdrawal will not result in early elections. Analysts say EDEK's move will hardly affect reunification negotiations.

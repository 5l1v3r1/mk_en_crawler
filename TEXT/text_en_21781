ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Armenian Foreign Minister Edward Nalbandian said on Monday (November 24th) his country is ready to launch diplomatic relations and open its border with Turkey without preconditions. Nalbandian held a press conference in Istanbul after a meeting of the Organisation of the Black Sea Economic Co-operation and talks with his Turkish counterpart, Ali Babacan. "Such developments would be for the benefit of both countries," said Nalbandian, adding he sees no major obstacles to normalising relations between Turkey and Armenia.
Turkey announced it plans to restore diplomatic relations with Armenia as well as appoint an "accredited ambassador". The two countries have not established diplomatic relations since Armenia became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991. The main reasons are Turkey's opposition to Armenia's occupation of the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan and Yerevan's effort to classify the killing of 1.5 million Armenian civilians by Ottoman Turks in 1915-1917 as genocide. Georgia has long acted as a mediator between Turkey and Armenia. (Hurriyet, Anadolu news agency, Zaman, NTV, DPA, AP, AFP, CNN Turk, Xinhua, RIA Novosti, ANA-MPA, Kathimerini, In.news - 24/11/08)

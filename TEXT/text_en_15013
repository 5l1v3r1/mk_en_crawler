ZAGREB, Croatia -- British Ambassador to Zagreb Sir John Ramsden says his country will abolish its current visa requirements for Croatian citizens, effective on 22 March. In his announcement Wednesday (1 March), Ramsden said Croatians would no longer need visas to visit Britain if their stay does not exceed six months. Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader says Britain's decision proves Croatia's progress in EU accession-oriented reforms. (HRT, HINA - 01/03/06)

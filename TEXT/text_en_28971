PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Foreign Policy Club (FPC) on Wednesday (September 8th) urged the European Commission (EC) to issue a visa liberalisation questionnaire to Kosovo. The organisation believes that by doing so, Brussels will motivate institutions to become more engaged in meeting the criteria and boost their involvement in the process. According to the independent organisation, established by Kosovo publicist Veton Surroi, the government is failing to meet criteria within the deadlines it set itself in its Action Plan for visa liberalisation. The FCP says the government should co-ordinate its actions with EULEX to deliver results in the fight against corruption, organised crime, terrorism and drug trafficking.

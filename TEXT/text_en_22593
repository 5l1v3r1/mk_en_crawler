BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government notified the Constitutional Court on Tuesday (November 11th) that it repealed a measure that would have postponed a 50% raise for teachers until April 2009. The decision, made during Monday's cabinet meeting, will appear in the Official Gazette. The Constitutional Court was supposed to decide on Tuesday whether the ordinance is constitutional or not, but it postponed debate after being informed of the government's decision. On Monday, the cabinet approved a 28% pay hike for teachers to be applied gradually in two stages, in March and in September 2009. Union representing the teachers turned down the offer, describing it as "a mockery". They vowed to continue their protests as scheduled.
In other news, Romanian General Staff chief Admiral Gheorghe Marin was in Belgrade on Tuesday, meeting with his Serbian counterpart, General Zdravko Ponos. They discussed ways to boost bilateral military co-operation and exchanged experiences regarding armed-forces reform, as well as opinions on the current military and political situation in the region. Ponos and Marin agreed that future co-operation between their armed forces will focus on training and joint exercises.

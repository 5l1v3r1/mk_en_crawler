ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic and Slovene counterpart Janez Drnovsek held an informal meeting on Thursday (10 November) at the village of Miljana village near the Croatian-Slovenian border. The talks focused on the situation in the region and bilateral ties, but pointedly sidestepped the border dispute between the two countries.
Also Thursday, Croatia's main opposition party, the Social Democrats (SDP), initiated an interpellation procedure -- in effect, demanding that the government explain the trading of municipal council seats. The SDP accuses the ruling HDZ of buying votes of municipal councilors to secure majorities in local government after the May local elections. SDP says the will of voters was distorted.

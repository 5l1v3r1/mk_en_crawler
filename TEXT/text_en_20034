LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Prime Minister Janez Jansa met on Friday (August 17th) with leaders of the parliamentary parties to discuss the remaining bilateral disputes with Croatia. He said all agreed that a third party should join efforts to reach an agreement. However, all the parties rejected Croatia's proposal to refer disputes to the Hamburg-based International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. Slovenia and Croatia have argued over maritime areas and fishing rights since the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.
In other news, 160 Slovenian troops that joined KFOR in February began withdrawing from Kosovo on Saturday. The drawdown is expected to take three weeks. (Index.hr, RIA-Novosti, STA, Danas - 18/08/07)

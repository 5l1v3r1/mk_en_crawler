BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The privatisation of the state-owned oil industry giant NIS has spurred disagreement within the ruling coalition. In parliament earlier this week, representatives of the junior partner Social Democratic Party (SDP) refused to support the government's plan to sell NIS. The plan -- crucial to continued IMF support of Serbia -- was endorsed anyway. 
On Wednesday (24 August), Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica urged all SDP officials to leave their positions in state institutions, saying it is impossible for a party to simultaneously support the cabinet and the opposition. Later in the day, top SDP executive Slobodan Orlic said officeholders from his party would not resign, though Kostunica was free to fire them. Without the SDP, the Serbian minority cabinet could rely on a total of 129 votes in the 250-seat parliament, including support from Slobodan Milosevic's Socialists.
In other news, Serbia on Thursday is marking the fifth anniversary of former President Ivan Stambolic's assassination. His remains were discovered in March 2003, during the investigation following the murder of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. (RTS - 25/08/05; Beta, Tanjug - 24/08/05)

LONDON, United Kingdom -- A British court has sentenced five Albanians to a total of 63 years in prison for smuggling women into the country and forcing them into prostitution. Ringleaders Agron Demarku, 22, and his brother Flamur, 34, were given 18 years and Izzet Fejzullahu, 32, got 14 years. Two others were sentenced to eight and five years respectively. The gang was caught in a major Scotland Yard operation that began a year ago.
In other news Thursday, Bulgarian officials announced that a two week-long joint operation by law enforcement authorities in Yambol and Haskovo resulted in the smashing of an international channel for synthetic drugs trafficking. The drugs were destined for the Arab world and Eastern Europe. (Monitor - 02/12/05; BBC - 01/12/05)

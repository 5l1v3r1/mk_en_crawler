SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Kevin Sullivan, the spokesman for High Representative Paddy Ashdown, told the media Tuesday (7 January) that BiH authorities are expected to begin reforming the country's customs system "within weeks". The international community wants the government to form a single customs service out of three separate ones in the Muslim-Croat and Serb entities and in the Brcko area. The EU warned that it would withhold loans and assistance if authorities failed to implement the reforms. A report by the European Commission concludes the system is riddled with theft tied to organised crime. (OHR Sources, PBS BiH - 08/01/03; AP, PBS BiH, Onasa - 07/01/03)

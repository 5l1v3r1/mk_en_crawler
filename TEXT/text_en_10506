SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Dutch Ambassador to Bulgaria, Baroness Henrietta van Lynden, called on Tuesday (14 September) for accelerated judicial reforms in Bulgaria, urging the opposition and the judiciary to back the government's proposals for changes in the penal code. Van Lynden, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, was one of the EU ambassadors to Sofia who participated in a meeting with Bulgarian parliamentary and government officials earlier this week. She says she was assured that delays in meeting obligations towards the EU under the Justice and Home Affairs negotiations chapter would be overcome. (Sega - 15/09/04; Mediapool - 14/09/04)

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The trial of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic resumed Tuesday (8 February) after a one-week break. The judges adjourned the proceedings because the defendant had the flu. Also Tuesday, President of The Hague tribunal Judge Theodor Meron rejected a new request by Milosevic's court-appointed lawyers to withdraw from the case. Steven Kay and Gillian Higgins insist they cannot represent the defendant because he refuses to co-operate with them. Meron said they need to stay on the job and take over for Milosevic, should he fall seriously ill. (Reuters - 08/02/05)

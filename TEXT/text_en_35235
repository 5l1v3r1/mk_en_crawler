ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader was re-elected leader of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) at a party conference Saturday (24 April). The only candidate for the post, he received the backing of 99 per cent of the more than 2,200 delegates in attendance. Deputy party chairman Jadranka Kosor also retained her post. Sanader assured the HDZ of his commitment to Croatia's bid for EU membership, saying the European Commission's recent recommendation on starting accession talks with Zagreb radically changed the country's position in the international community.

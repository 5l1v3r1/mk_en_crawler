NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot Foreign Minister Huseyin Ozgurgun said on Friday (June 19th) his government may consider other options if the ongoing reunification talks with Greek Cypriots fail. His statement followed a meeting with UN special envoy for Cyprus Alexander Downer in Nicosia. "I told Mr. Downer that we will have other alternatives if the negotiation process does not yield any results," Ozgurgun was quoted as saying. "The Greek Cypriot side also knows that in this case, we will have to use our right to self-determination," he added. (Anadolu news agency, Haber Turk, TRT - 20/06/09)

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Elections Sunday (25 June) in Turkish-run northern Cyprus brought President Mehmet Ali Talat's Republican Turkish Party two additional parliamentary seats. The vote was held to fill posts left vacant after Talat's election as president of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the death of deputy Salih Miroglu. In addition to the partial parliamentary vote, mayors and municipal councillors for 28 municipalities were also being elected. Talat's party lost the mayoral race for the Turkish-occupied part of the capital, Lefkosia, to the Democratic Party nominee. (Phileleftheros, Hurriyet - 26/06/06)

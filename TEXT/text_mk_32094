BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Southeastern Europe deputy defence ministers will meet in Bucharest on Friday (18 October) to approve NATO's offer to assume command of the SEE Multinational Peace Brigade (SEEBRIG). While up until now NATO has been the one to request partner states' troop contributions for peacekeeping operations, the ''SEEBRIG offer'' should prove that SEE states have assumed the responsibility for the security of their own region, says George Cristian Maior, head of the Department for Euro-Atlantic Integration and Defence Policy in Romania's defence ministry.
During the meeting, the deputy defence ministers will attend drills aimed at testing response, should a series of earthquakes rock Southeastern Europe. (Rompres - 15/10/02)

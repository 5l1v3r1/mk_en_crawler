ATHENS, Greece -- The new electoral draft code will be submitted to parliament in November, said government spokesman Christos Protopappas. He added Friday (18 July) that adoption of the code would depend on progress in talks between the opposition and the majority. The aim of the new code is to boost transparency, beef up stability and enhance representation. Foreign Minister George Papandreou stressed that any such changes would not be enforced before 2005.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Representatives of the five major political parties in BiH reportedly failed to achieve any breakthrough in negotiations on police reforms, according to local media reports. Although no official statements were made after the latest round of negotiations Thursday (March 1st), the press insisted the Serbian and Bosniak political leaders again failed to find common ground. Repeated delays could mean that a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU would likely have to be delayed until next year.

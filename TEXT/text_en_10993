SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov on Wednesday (29 June) urged the parties entering the new parliament to speed up negotiations aimed at forming a new government, so the country's EU membership in 2007 is not delayed. Parvanov plans to convoke the inaugural session of the new legislature next week, though the two frontrunners in last weekend's elections -- the Bulgarian Socialist Party and NMS-II -- have failed to form a coalition thus far. Neither is willing to give up the prime minister's seat.
In other news, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw confirmed his country's support Wednesday for Bulgaria and Romania's EU entry in 2007. During a news conference ahead of the Friday start of Britain's EU presidency, he added that London backs the scheduled launch of EU membership negotiations with Turkey in October.

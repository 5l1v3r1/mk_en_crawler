ATHENS, Greece -- More than 10,000 people gathered in downtown Athens on Saturday (May 15th) to protest the government's austerity measures. The action, organised by the labour union of the Communist Party, PAME, was a continuation of similar protests in the capital for the past week. A 24-hour general strike will be held on May 20th. It is expected to freeze flights to and from Greece, disrupt railway and water transport and close down public services. (Reuters, DPA - 15/05/10)

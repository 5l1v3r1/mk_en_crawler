PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- KFOR Commander General Roland Kather warned on Monday (January 8th) that NATO-led peacekeepers are ready to "respond strongly against individuals or groups of individuals tempted to undermine peace and security" in Kosovo. He added that KFOR would maintain its mandate and troop strength of 17,000 in 2007. 
In other news, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whose country currently holds the EU's rotating presidency, said the Union is determined to help build a democratic society in Kosovo where ethnic Albanians and Serbs would live side by side in peace. The EU plans to replace the UN mission in Kosovo when the province's future is decided.
Also Monday, the Serb National Council of Kosovo and Metohija denounced the alleged mistreatment of a Serb Orthodox priest by members of the Kosovo Police Service (KPS) on the Vucitrn-Mitrovica road earlier in the day. The Council said the KPS used a "brutal approach" towards the priest. The KPS says it is conducting an internal investigation amid complaints of violence against Serbs.

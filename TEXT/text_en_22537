BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Parliament (EP) on Wednesday (April 9th) delayed the adoption of a report on Macedonia's EU progress. Socialists sought the delay, saying they needed more time to persuade Greek members of the EP to support the document. During the debate, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn called on political parties in Macedonia to concentrate on reforms and take advantage of opportunities offered this year. "The name issue has been taking a lot of political energy lately," Rehn said, reiterating that leaders should focus on reforms. The National Council for Macedonia's European Integration insisted on Wednesday that the country should become a member of both the EU and NATO. (Utrinski Vesnik - 10/04/08; Makfax, A1 - 09/04/08)

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The EU is not ready to support independence for Serbia or Montenegro, said Dusko Lopandic, director of the Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Ministry Directorate for Relations with the EU. In an interview with the Podgorica-based daily <I>Pobjeda </I>on Sunday (15 February), he said that the EU had put a lot of effort into bringing the republics into their loose union, and thus it makes no sense to support disintegration.
In other news Sunday, Serbia marked the 200th anniversary of the uprising that liberated the country from the Ottoman Empire. Also on this date in 1804, the first constitution of the Kingdom of Serbia was adopted. In commemoration, Serbian Parliament Speaker and Interim President Dragan Marsicanin opened a monument to Djordje Petrovic Karadjordje, the leader of the uprising, in the town of Orasac.

CRAIOVA, Romania -- Over 30,000 people participated in a rally on Saturday (May 12th) in Craiova, in support of suspended President Traian Basescu, ahead of a planned impeachment referendum on May 19th. The nationwide poll should confirm or reject a decision of the Parliament to dismiss Basescu, who the deputies blame for constitutional violations. Addressing the demonstrators, Basescu repeated that he wanted to modernise Romania. He accused the ruling parties of putting the country into the hands of oligarchs. (Mediafax, Rompres - 12/05/07)

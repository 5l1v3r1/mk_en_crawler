SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Charles English reiterated on Tuesday (February 16th) that the referendum issue in the entity of Republika Srpska is very sensitive, adding the United States would consider provocative any issue that endangers the country's stability, sovereignty or territorial integrity.

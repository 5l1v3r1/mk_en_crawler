BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told visiting BiH Foreign Minister Sven Akalaj on Tuesday (May 8th) he is deeply concerned over the lack of agreement on police reform. He said the reform is the only obstacle to signing a Stabilisation and Associations Agreement with the Union. Separately Tuesday, the BiH Council of Ministers acknowledged the current impasse and ordered that the pace be accelerated.
In other news, the Office of the High Representative warned on Tuesday against a possible unilateral decision by Republika Srpska (RS) to withdraw from the Transfer of Competency Agreement. Last week, RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said the entity would boycott the accord and consider returning certain competencies to entity institutions over the distribution of tax revenues between RS and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

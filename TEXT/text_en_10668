SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown said Wednesday (8 September) that obstacles to BiH's bid for membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace programme stem from Republika Srpska (RS) and the BiH presidency. Following a trip to London and Brussels, Ashdown noted that NATOâ€™s ministerial summit is in December, giving RS 12 weeks to demonstrate it will meet international obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal. He added that another major obstacle to Euro-Atlantic integration is the BiH presidency's failure to complete the BiH police registration process. 
Meanwhile, the RS Defence Ministry announced Wednesday that it has begun searching its archives for information sought by Hague prosecutors. Also Wednesday, SFOR personnel and RS police discovered a cache of illegal heavy weapons in a bunker near Omarska. One official says it was enough to arm a brigade.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The senate approved a bill Tuesday (August 24th) on the National Integrity Agency (ANI), the state anti-corruption organisation. The bill was adopted in the 137-seat senate by a vote of 78-0, with one abstention. Members of the Social Democratic Party and the Conservative Party coalition announced earlier that they would not vote. The legislation had to be reworked after the Constitutional Court ruled in July that some parts of it were unconstitutional. Lawmakers amended the bill, reducing the investigation period from three years to one and removed a stipulation that required members of politicians' families to declare state contracts. The legislation moves next to the head of state for promulgation. (AP, Mediafax - 24/08/10)

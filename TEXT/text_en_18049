NEW YORK, United Nations -- Following negotiations Monday (July 16th) among UN Security Council members, Russia rejected the latest draft of the West's resolution on Kosovo. Russia's Ambassador to the UN Vitaly Churkin indicated that despite that the call for negotiations between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians, the draft still implies that Kosovo would become independent. He concluded that the chances of adopting such a resolution are close to zero. France's UN Ambassador, Jean-Marc de La Sabliere, said this would likely be the last attempt for compromise at the Security Council.
In Lisbon meanwhile, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica told Portuguese counterpart Jose Socrates that Serbia will never trade the Kosovo issue for EU membership. Kostunica also reiterated that Serbia would never accept the independence of the province. Portugal recently assumed the rotating EU chairmanship. 
Also Monday Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku reiterated the province's readiness to declare independence from Serbia. The European Commission and UN chiefs cautioned against unilateral moves.

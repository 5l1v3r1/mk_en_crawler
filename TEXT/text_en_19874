TIRANA, Albania -- Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis reiterated her country's full support for Albania's NATO membership bid during a visit to Tirana on Thursday (March 20th). "Albania has all the reasons to deserve the invitation to join NATO," Bakoyannis said at a joint press conference with Albanian counterpart, Lulzim Basha. She added Albania and Croatia would certainly receive invitations at the upcoming Bucharest summit. However, she reiterated that Greece is prepared to veto Macedonia's bid, since the name dispute between the two countries remains unresolved. She said 17 years of unsuccessful negotiations on the name issue have undermined regional stability. 
On Friday, Bakoyannis is expected to meet with Macedonian counterpart, Antonio Milososki, in Brussels for one last attempt to settle the issue. (Shqip, Panorama, Korrieri, Shekulli - 21/03/08; BalkanWeb, Top-Channel, Tanjug, ANA-MPA, Makfax - 20/03/08)

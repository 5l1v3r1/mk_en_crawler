BUCHAREST, Romania -- Veteran communist politician Gheorghe Apostol, 97, died on Saturday at his home in Bucharest, local media reported on Wednesday (August 25th). He was buried in a private ceremony Tuesday. Apostol drew international attention in March 1989 by publicly criticising dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Back then, he signed the so-called "letter of the six", in which he and five other senior Communist Party officials levelled public criticism against Ceausescu for the first time, opposing his plans to destroy thousands of villages and accusing him of harming Romania's economy and image abroad. Soon afterward, Apostol was accusing of being a Russian spy and was put under house arrest. He was released during the anti-communist revolt in December 1989 that toppled Ceausescu's dictatorship.

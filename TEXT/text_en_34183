ATHENS, Greece -- Agriculture Minister Giorgios Dris vowed on Friday (11 July) to set up a special squad to monitor the quality of Greek feta cheese. Dris's anger was stirred by the discovery of listeria in three tonnes of Greek feta in Norway. The incident was particularly embarrassing for Athens because it came shortly after the EU awarded Greece the exclusive right to use the name "feta" for white cheese, a decision hotly contested by Denmark.

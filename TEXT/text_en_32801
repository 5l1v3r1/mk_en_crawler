TIRANA, Albania -- EU external affairs commissioner Chris Patten said Thursday (5 December) that talks on signing a EU Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Albania would start in February. During a meeting in Tirana, Prime Minister Fatos Nano assured Patten that the government remains committed to meeting all requirements for signing the agreement, which would lead to eventual EU entry.
In other news, the Albanian government Wednesday approved a draft law liberalising the troubled local energy market. The new measure would encourage much needed private investment in the sector and would lead to privatisation of the state energy behemoth KESH.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- US envoy Frank Wisner said on Thursday (August 16th) that his government is preparing for the possibility of unilaterally recognising an independent Kosovo. Speaking to Voice of America, he said Washington will be ready for the option if no compromise on the future status of the Serbian province is achieved by December 10th, when this new round of negotiations is scheduled to end. What happens after that, Wisner added, depends on the government of each country. He is a member of the international trio of mediators overseeing the current phase of negotiations between Pristina and Belgrade.
Meanwhile, Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku said in an interview with the German daily Die Welt on Thursday that further negotiations with Belgrade are meaningless, as Serbian politicians will never publicly accept Kosovo's independence. He also stressed, however, that Kosovo leaders favour an international solution.
"Our goal is independence in accordance with the international community and we are not interested in a unilateral action," he said. He added, however, that the current 120-day negotiations will be "the last delay we allow". (A1, Telegrafi, RTK, RFE, Balkanweb, Makfax, RTRS, AFP - 16/08/07)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Chief of Staff General Zdravko Ponos says Serbia has asked NATO to lift movement restrictions in a 5km buffer zone along Kosovo, including a 25km no-fly zone extending into Serbia established at the end of the 1999 conflict. Speaking on Tuesday (December 2nd), he added that the army has wanted to use the buffer zone for years but has waited for the right political moment to make the request. That moment has arrived, given pending deployment of the EU's police and judicial mission, EULEX, and Kosovo's plan to set up its own security forces, Ponos said. Kosovo leaders oppose Belgrade's request, saying it signals Serbia's desire to regain control over Kosovo. (Studio B, B92, Blic, Tanjug, FoNet - 02/12/08)

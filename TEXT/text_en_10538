STRASBOURG, France -- European Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten strongly criticised Republika Srpska (RS) on Tuesday (16 November) for failing to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal, reiterating that this jeopardises Bosnia and Herzegovina's bid for Euro-Atlantic integration. Patten was particularly critical of the RS leadership for failing to hand over war crimes indictee Radovan Karadzic and others. He warned there is no reason to expect that UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte's upcoming report to the UN Security Council would be a positive one. RS Interior Minister Darko Matijasevic repeated his earlier claim that he has no information about fugitives hiding on RS territory.

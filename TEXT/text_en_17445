BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Serbia war crimes prosecutor's office indicted former Yugoslav People's Army officer Vladimir Kovacevic on Monday (July 31st) for crimes in connection with the shelling of Dubrovnik in December 1991. Two civilians died and three were injured in the attack. The case was transferred to Serbia in May after The Hague deemed Kovacevic mentally unfit to stand trial. Kovacevic's commanders, Admiral Miodrag Jokic and General Pavle Strugar, were sentenced by the UN war crimes tribunal to eight and seven years in prison, respectively, for the same crime. Kovacevic is being treated in the Belgrade Military Medical Academy for "paranoid psychosis", and his attorney said he would insist on a psychiatric evaluation of his client before the start of the trial.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government reiterated on Saturday (August 23rd) that it will only co-operate with UNMIK, not the new EU mission, EULEX, in Kosovo. "We think that the UN is the only authority competent to resolve the problems of Serbs and other non-Albanians in Kosovo," Serbian Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic said on Saturday.
On Friday, the Vice President of the Assembly of Communities of Municipalities of Kosovo and Metohija, Marko Jaksic, and the leader of the Serbian National Council for Northern Kosovo, Milan Ivanovic, urged Serbs working in Kosovo institutions to quit their jobs. During a press conference in Mitrovica, Jaksic said he expects members of the Serbian government to support their effort.
In other news Friday, Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu said the country will appoint its first ambassadors abroad by the end of August. "The naming of the ambassadors in the countries that have recognised Kosovo's independence is an important prerequisite for the establishment of sustainable economic development," Sejdiu said in an interview with Kosovalive.

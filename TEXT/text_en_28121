PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The European Parliament Rapporteur on visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans, Tanja Fajon, arrives in Kosovo on Wednesday (October 20th) for meetings with officials in charge of EU integration and visa liberalisation. Several days ago, Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi criticised the European Commission (EC) for failing to issue a strategy for visa liberalisation as promised, in September. Rexhepi insists that Kosovo has met all requirements needed to start the process. But the EC Liaison Office in Pristina says Kosovo was not ready in September.

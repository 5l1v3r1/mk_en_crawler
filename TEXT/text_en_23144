BUCHAREST, Romania -- As the NATO summit opened in Bucharest on Wednesday (April 2nd), US President George W. Bush said the Alliance will make a historic decision regarding the admission of three Western Balkan countries -- Albania, Croatia and Macedonia. Together, the three form part of a group known as the Adriatic Charter. "The United States strongly supports inviting these nations to join NATO," Bush said in his keynote speech. "These countries have launched the difficult path of reform and built thriving free societies. They are ready to contribute to NATO and their citizens deserve the security that NATO brings."
Macedonia's hopes may be dashed, however, unless it resolves its longstanding name dispute with Greece. Athens has said it will use its veto power to block its neighbour's bid unless an agreement is reached. On Tuesday, Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said the government has already come to a decision over the matter.
The summit in Bucharest is the biggest in NATO's history. In addition to leaders of the 26 member states, all 23 members of the Partnership for Peace programme will be represented. (Mediafax, Rompres, Hotnews.ro - 02/04/08; AFP, Realitatia, Dnevnik, BalkanWeb, Telegrafi - 01/04/08)

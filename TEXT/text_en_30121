BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic said on Tuesday (December 21st) that talks between Belgrade and Pristina on technical issues should start regardless of the bombshell report to the Council of Europe by rapporteur Dick Marty. Tadic says the first topics to be discussed should be the fate of those still missing since the conflict and other issues related to Serbs and Albanians' daily life. Tadic said the two sides should not wait for an investigation into Marty's allegations of human organ trafficking in Kosovo. (B92, Tanjug - 21/12/10)

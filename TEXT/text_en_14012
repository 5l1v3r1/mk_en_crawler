BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The deputy governor of the Serbian Central Bank was fired on Monday (16 January), following his arrest on corruption charges last week. The bank's board said in a statement that its decision should not prejudice the ongoing investigation against Dejan Simic. He is accused of accepting a bribe of 100,000 euros in exchange for returning a license to a bankrupt bank. An official of Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist Party has been arrested for arranging the deal. 
In other news, Serbian authorities have indicted Mobtel owner Sreten Karic and the company's chief executive officer, Olga Zilovic, charging them with illegal business transactions. The two bought 79 luxury apartments in Belgrade on behalf of Mobtel and then resold them to Karic's relatives at a fraction of the price. Prosecutors contend that the transaction defrauded Mobtel's other shareholders and cost the state nearly 3m euros in unpaid taxes.

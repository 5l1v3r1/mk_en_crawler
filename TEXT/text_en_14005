TIRANA, Albania -- The president of the Council of Europe's (CoE) Congress of Local and Regional Authorities, Giovanni Di Stassi, wraps up a two-day visit to Tirana on Tuesday (17 January), aimed at helping resolve the deadlock between the central Albanian government and Tirana local authorities. The CoE has repeatedly urged the politicians to settle a lengthy dispute over a Tirana road construction project that has led to a stalemate between the central and local government institutions. 
In other news, lawmakers decided on Monday to establish a special parliamentary commission to deal with crucial electoral reform. The issue has been strongly affected by the stalemate. (Albanian News - 17/01/06)

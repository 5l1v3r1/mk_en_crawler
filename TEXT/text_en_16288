BUCHAREST, Romania -- A future EU combat tactical group composed of personnel from Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece and Romania is expected to become operational as of July 2007, Romanian Defence Ministry State Secretary Corneliu Dobritoiu said on Thursday (13 July). Last year, the four countries sealed an agreement on the battle group, which will operate within a radius of 6,000km from Brussels and will be part of the EU rapid reaction capacity. Dobritoiu says Romania will contribute 45 military personnel, specialised in nuclear, chemical and biological defence. (Nine o'clock - 14/07/06; Rompres - 13/07/06)

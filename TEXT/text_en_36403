ZAGREB, Croatia -- The development ministry announced Friday (13 August) that Croatia would start implementing a housing programme for returning refugees in September. Under the programme, the government will provide dwellings to ethnic Serbs who fled during the conflicts of the 1990s and whose property has been damaged or destroyed. Development Minister Bozidar Kalmeta says he has discussed the matter with the OSCE mission and EC delegation heads, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and US Ambassador to Croatia Ralph Frank.

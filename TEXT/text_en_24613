BUCHAREST, Romania -- Representatives of the main political parties held a series of talks on forming a new cabinet a week after close elections, media reported on Monday (December 8th). Nominating the future prime minister remains the chief bone of contention. The main candidates are Vasile Blaga, of the election-winning Liberal Democratic Party (PDL), PDL leader Emil Boc and Social Democratic Party (PSD) leader Mircea Geoana, newspapers reported. PDL and PSD representatives met on Sunday to discuss the institutional and constitutional steps needed if the two parties are to co-operate in the next government, but they are deadlocked over the post of prime minister. Boc reportedly insists the PDL has the right to fill the post, as it narrowly won the most seats in parliament. 
Separately, the PDL and the PSD held talks with the incumbent ruling National Liberal Party (PNL), which came in third on November 30th. The fourth-place finisher, the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania, says it backs a possible coalition with the PDL and the PNL.

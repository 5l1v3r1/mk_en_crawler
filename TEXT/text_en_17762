SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Court opened the main hearings Wednesday (December 20th) against four Bosnian Serbs, accused of crimes against humanity at the Omarska and Keraterm detention camps in BiH in 1992. Zeljko Mejakic and Momcilo Gruban are charged with command responsibility for murders, abuse and other mistreatments at Omarska, where some 3,000 non-Serbs were detained, while Dusan Knezevic and Dragan Fustar Knezevic are charged with crimes against non-Serb detainees at Keraterm. The case of the four was handed over from the UN tribunal to the BiH judiciary. The defendants were transferred from The Hague to Sarajevo in May. (RTRS, Srna, PBS BiH, Newsday - 20/12/06)

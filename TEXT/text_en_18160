THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Opening statements will be made on Monday (April 16th) in the trial against former Macedonian Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski and former security official Johan Tarculovski. The proceedings will then be postponed until May 7th because most of the evidence has not been prepared yet, according to prosecutors. A total of 96 witnesses will be testifying, a process that could take 11 weeks. Boskovski and Tarculovski are charged with committing war crimes in the village of Ljuboten in 2001. 
In other news Thursday, Bruno Vekaric, spokesman for Serbia's war crimes prosecutor's office, dismissed a comment this week by BiH Bosniak Presidency member Haris Silajdzic as politically motivated this week, to the effect that everyone responsible for war crimes in BiH should be prosecuted. Vekaric stressed, however, that Serbia would be ready to fully co-operate with BiH war crimes prosecutors so that truth and justice can be established. (MIA, Makfax, RTRS - 12/04/07)

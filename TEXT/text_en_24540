TIRANA, Albania -- The Socialist Party (SP) wants a full count of ballot boxes from the region of Fieri before it recognises the official results from Sunday's general elections, local media reported on Thursday (July 9th). Despite the SP's claims that they won nine mandates in Fieri, preliminary results suggest they won eight. The SP's claims are based on the Central Election Commission's (CEC) decision not to count the votes in some small election centres, which, the SP says, would secure them that ninth seat. The CEC is also working to complete work in Vlora and Elbasan. (BBC, Shekulli, Top News, Balkan Web - 09/07/09)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu on Wednesday (24 May) criticised the activities of the government and the intelligence services in fighting bird flu, describing them as "embarrassing". According to media reports, Basescu -- who is recovering from recent surgery -- insisted on leaving a hospital in Bucharest for several hours to attend Wednesday's cabinet session, telling the ministers that the way the latest avian influenza crisis is being handled seems "chaotic and random" to outsiders. 
Neighbouring Bulgaria, meanwhile, called an emergency meeting Thursday of its National Crisis Headquarters. Agriculture Minister Nihat Kabil said extra measures to prevent the re-emergence of the deadly H5N1 virus would be discussed. (Nine o'clock - 25/05/06; Rompres - 24/05/06)

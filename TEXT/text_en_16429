SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling on Friday (November 10th) criticised a proposal by Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik to cut wages of magistrates in the Bosnian Serb entity by 30%. Dodik says the cut would serve as an incentive to boost performance. According to Schwarz-Schilling, however, the idea represents an attack by politicians on the judiciary. The High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council also weighed in on the issue, warning that any attempt by the executive and legislative power to decrease wages would be in direct conflict with the principles of judicial independence.

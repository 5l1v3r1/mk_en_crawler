THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Monday (17 January) sentenced two Bosnian Serbs for their involvement in the Srebrenica massacre. Vidoje Blagojevic, the commander of the Bratunac Brigade, was given 18 years in prison for aiding and abetting genocide. The court found his role was limited to assisting the forcible transfer of Muslims. Dragan Jokic, chief engineer of the Zvornik Brigade, received a nine-year prison sentence for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Jokic, the judges said, provided resources for the digging of mass graves for the Srebrenica victims. Prosecutors were seeking longer sentences for each.

TIRANA, Albania -- More than 350 adult orphans aged 25 to 40 have been deprived of their right to sufficient shelter, according to a report by Amnesty International on Wednesday (November 21st). Orphans must largely fend for themselves in a society that is centered around family ties and regards them with suspicion, the human rights watchdog said. Once they reach adulthood, orphans may end up living in dilapidated sections of secondary-school residence halls, in terrible conditions. The group urged Albanian institutions to take better care of orphans of all ages, as mandated by international covenants Tirana has signed.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Political parties wrapped up their campaigns Friday (March 27th) ahead of Sunday's snap parliamentary elections. The ruling coalition European Montenegro, led by Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic's Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), initiated the early vote, arguing it needs more time to speed up reforms that would lead to EU accession. The latest polls suggest Djukanovic's coalition will probably win a sweeping victory with 51% of the vote. The main opposition Socialist People's Party is expected to win 16.8%, followed by New Serbian Democracy with 12% and the neo-liberal Movement for Changes with 6%.

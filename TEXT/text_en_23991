ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader appealed again to the Slovenian government Saturday (January 17th) not to block Croatia's EU accession process. During a meeting in Split of his party, the Croatian Democratic Union, Sanader insisted Croatia's inability to reach an agreement on all of its borders should not block it from joining the EU. He noted that Slovenia entered the EU in the same condition, with border disputes involving Italy. Last month, Slovenia blocked the opening of several of Croatia's negotiating chapters, perhaps jeopardising its time frame for accession. (MIA - 18/01/09; HINA, 24 Sata, HRT - 17/01/09)

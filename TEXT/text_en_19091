TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha, leader of the ruling Democratic Party (DP), voiced his readiness Tuesday (May 1st) to hold talks with the opposition on the country's next president. Incumbent Alfred Moisiu's five-year term expires next month. Speaking at a news conference, Berisha acknowledged for the first time publicly that the DP-led coalition lacks the required two-thirds majority -- 84 votes in the 140-member Parliament -- to choose a nominee alone. The EU has signalled that it expects Moisiu's successor to be the result of broad political consensus. Bamir Topi is DP's choice for the job, while former Prime Minister Fatos Nano has expressed interest in being the Socialist Party's candidate.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias has lodged a second complaint with the UN to protest what he says is Turkey's obstruction of Cyprus's oil exploration activities in the Mediterranean Sea, media reported on Wednesday (December 3rd). In a second letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Christofias accused Turkey of harassing research vessels within Cyprus's exclusive economic zone on four occasions. He warned that the row with Turkey might imperil ongoing reunification talks with the Turkish Cypriot community. Turkey accuses the Greek Cypriots of violating its territorial rights, arguing the exploration vessels had entered its waters. (CNA, Reuters, Xinhua, Hurriyet - 03/12/08)

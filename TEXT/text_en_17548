SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The second round of talks on relaxing the EU visa regime for BiH citizens began in Brussels on Monday (January 29th). The European Commission (EC) delegation in Sarajevo issued a statement saying that the three days of talks should result in a general agreement on the text of a future bilateral accord. Bakir Dautbasic, BiH's lead negotiator, suggests talks are going so well that an agreement could be sealed in early March. (Dnevni avaz, Nezavisne novine - 30/01/07; PBS BiH, RTRS - 29/01/07)

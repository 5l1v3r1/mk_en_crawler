SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The missing original copy of the Dayton Peace Accord is likely in the hands of former Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic, local media reported on Friday (February 15th), citing Vladimir Lukic, the main negotiator for the Bosnian Serbs when the accord was sealed. He told the daily Press RS that after the document was sealed in Paris in 1995, it was handed over to Karadzic, who was RS president at the time, and has remained in his "safekeeping" ever since. BiH Presidency Chairman Zeljko Komsic confirmed on Thursday that the document is missing. (AP, Pincom.info, RTRS - 15/02/08)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told the European Parliament on Tuesday (13 September) that Turkey's decision to prosecute a writer for comments he made about the killing of Armenians during World War I was "regrettable", and constituted a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights. Orhan Pamuk was charged with defamation for saying in an interview that a million Armenians and 30,000 Kurds had been killed in Turkey. Rehn also expressed doubts about the interpretations of Turkey's new Criminal Code. Pamuk's trial is to begin on 16 December, the same day EU leaders plan to hold a summit in Brussels.

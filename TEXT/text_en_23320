PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government played down on Sunday (June 28th) suggestions of a border dispute brewing between Kosovo and Serbia in eastern Kosovo. The reaction came after a series of claims about a Serbian gendarmerie unit patrolling inside the village of Karacevo, an area Kosovo says is part of its territory. According to the reports, the Serbs allegedly set up a check point they say marks the border between the two places. According to the Kosovo Border Police, the Serb patrol entered an area Friday that residents consider part of Kosovo, while KFOR considers it part of Serbia. Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said the government -- together with KFOR -- will clearly define ownership of the area. For the past decade, KFOR has been patrolling a "green line" of 5km at the border. (Koha Ditore, Zeri, Epoka e Re - 29/06/09; Kohavision, RTK - 27/06/09)

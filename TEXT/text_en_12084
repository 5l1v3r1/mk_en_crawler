BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's parliamentary parties are still unable to agree on the text of a resolution condemning war crimes. Parliamentary Speaker Predrag Markovic proposed the adoption of such a document after a tape showing the 1995 execution of Bosnian Muslims from Srebrenica by a Serbian paramilitary unit. After Tuesday's (14 June) session, he said the parties only agreed on the need to condemn all war crimes committed on the territory of Yugoslavia.
In other news Tuesday, the deputy chairman of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS), Tomislav Nikolic, rejected accusations by an NGO leader, Natasa Kandic, who said Nikolic might have been involved in crimes committed against civilians in Croatia during the war. Kandic, who heads the Belgrade-based Humanitarian Law Centre, said earlier this week that the domestic military intelligence and the defence ministry could provide information about Nikolic's responsibility for the deaths of Croatian civilians in the village of Antin in 1991-1992. In a public statement Tuesday, Nikolic explicitly denied the allegations and called on the Serbian government to make his personal files public. (Politika - 15/06/05; Beta, B92 - 14/06/05)

ATHENS, Greece -- More protests are planned this week against the government's austerity package, which is aimed at slashing spending while raising revenue. Tax officials joined a nationwide strike on Monday (March 8th), as they did last month. Courts are closing for several hours a day all week long, and a huge large protest -- organised by the country's two largest trade unions, the GSSE and the ADEDY -- is scheduled for Thursday.

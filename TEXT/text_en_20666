ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader sent a letter Wednesday (August 8th) to European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso proposing the establishment of a regional forest firefighting centre for Southeastern Europe. Sanader suggested it be based in Croatia as the country can offer the necessary infrastructure, funds and skills. 
Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister of Milorad Dodik has also proposed that RS, Croatia and Montenegro form a regional firefighting brigade to deal with blazes in the triangle between Croatia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). The area would include Dubrovnik, where a dangerous fire has burned for days. 
Montenegro welcomed Dodik's initiative. Interior Minister Jusuf Kalamperovic said officials from BiH, Croatia and Montenegro would meet in September to discuss it. He suggested that the regional centre be based in Mostar. (Nezavisne novine - 09/08/07; Radio Television Montenegro, SRNA, RTRS, HRT, Javno.com - 08/08/07)

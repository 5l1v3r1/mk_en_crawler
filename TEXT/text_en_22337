PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A British expert in international public law, Michael Wood, will lead Kosovo's legal team at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), Kosovo's presidency announced on Wednesday (October 15th). The team will appear before the court to debate Serbia's motion to question the legality of Kosovo's declaration of independence in February. Prime Minister Hashim Thaci says Kosovo's case is strong. "Fifty-one countries from all over the world have already recognised Kosovo as a sovereign state with a modern constitution that provides guarantees for the rights of all citizens," Thaci stressed. Other international and local experts will assist Wood. (Koha Ditore, Express, Zeri, Kosova Sot - 16/10/08; Telegrafi, Kosovalive - 15/10/08)

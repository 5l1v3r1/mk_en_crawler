PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Hundreds of Kosovo Muslims gathered in Pristina on Friday (October 8th), insisting the government reverse a decision to ban the use of Muslim headscarves in schools. The protest was held in front of the government building. Participants carried banners reading "Stop Discrimination" and "Unveil the mind, not the head". They said they would intensify the protests unless the ban is lifted within the month. The decision to ban the display of religious freedom in schools was made last year in accordance with the constitution, which declares Kosovo as a secular country.

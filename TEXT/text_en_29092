TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Socialist Party (SP) on Monday (July 5th) urged Foreign Minister Ilir Meta to resign, after a ministry employee was arrested for drug trafficking. Almir Rrapo was detained at the US Embassy in Tirana last week. Authorities say he was a member of the technical staff, not the diplomatic corps. In a statement Monday, SP lawmaker Balla Taulant described the arrest as the latest demonstration of the governance crisis. He urged Meta to resign and take responsibility for the incident. Meta says he will resign, in three years, when his mandate expires. (NOA, Shekulli - 05/07/10)

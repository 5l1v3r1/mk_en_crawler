ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in the central Anatolian province of Corum on Monday (April 26th) sentenced seven people to life in prison over an armed attack at a wedding last year that left 44 people dead. Another defendant was sentenced to 15 years for being an accomplice. In the May 4th 2009 incident, masked men rushed into a ceremony in the Kurdish-dominated village of Bigle and killed the groom, the bride and many of the guests, including children and pregnant women. Investigators said it was due to a blood feud. (Zaman, Yeni Safak - 27/04/10; Anadolu news agency, DPA - 26/04/10)

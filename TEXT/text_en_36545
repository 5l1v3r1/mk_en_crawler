ATHENS, Greece -- The prime ministers of Greece and Turkey told reporters Friday (7 May) that they want to build a "strategic partnership" between the countries. Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Ankara and Athens would leave the past behind them and focus on the future. Costas Karamanlis confirmed that ties have entered "a new orbit" and reiterated his country's support for Turkey's bid for EU membership. Erdogan's visit to Greece came after Greek Cypriots scuttled plans for the reunification of the island in a referendum last month. Bolstering economic contacts was another focus of the trip. Erdogan brought along a group of 100 businessmen. Trade between Ankara and Athens is expected to rise to $2 billion this year, compared to $500m in 2002.

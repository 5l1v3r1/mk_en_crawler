BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Five EU member states have demanded that the European Commission monitor newcomers Bulgaria and Romania more strictly. The five countries, identified by the BBC as Finland, France, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden, voiced concerns over the two countries' insufficient progress in judicial reforms and fighting corruption. However, they stopped short of demanding implementation of the safeguard clause imposed by the EU during the accession process. (News.dir.bg, BTA, Nine O'clock - 21/04/07; Focus - 20/04/07)

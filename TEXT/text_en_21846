ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic says Croatia will complete talks to join the EU by the end of 2009. "If we organise ourselves well, we will close all negotiating chapters by then. Afterwards, it will be only a matter of time for EU member states to reach a consensus on Croatia's accession," Mesic said on Wednesday (October 22nd). He added Croatia has already fulfilled part of the reform agenda and is rapidly implementing other reforms. On Tuesday, EU sources said the European Commission would give Croatia a conditional date to conclude membership talks by the end of 2009. Observers expect a positive progress report in November.

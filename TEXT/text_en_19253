ANKARA, Turkey -- Students at the Marmara University in Istanbul protested on Wednesday (February 27th) after women at several universities were denied entry to school facilities because they were wearing headscarves. The young women were turned back by security guards. Last week, President Abdullah Gul ratified a parliamentary decision to overturn the ban on headscarves in universities. However, many rectors and university professors oppose the move. 
The secular opposition Republican People's Party filed an appeal with the Constitutional Court on Wednesday, demanding that amendments allowing women to wear headscarves in universities be annulled. (Zaman, Sabah, BBC - 28/02/08; Reuters, Anadolu news agency, AP, Hurriyet - 27/02/08)

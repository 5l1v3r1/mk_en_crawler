SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In a statement Monday (February 11th), EU High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said he expects all six ruling political parties to continue talks on police reform, according to the agreement they signed in Mostar last year. Lajcak's spokesman, Oleg Milisic, stressed that only concrete results achieved by the end of February will enable the country to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. The statement was issued after the police-reform task force announced it had failed to agree on a draft law regarding new police forces. (RTRS, NTV Hayat - 11/02/08)

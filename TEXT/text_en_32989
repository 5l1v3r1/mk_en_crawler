THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former US Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith told the UN war crimes tribunal on Wednesday (25 June) that Slobodan Milosevic was in direct control of Serb militias during the conflicts of 1992-1995. The diplomat had extensive contacts with the then president of Serbia and took an active part in all negotiations during the war. "Slobodan Milosevic was the architect of a policy of creating 'greater Serbia' and little happened without his knowing and involvement," he said. Galbraith went on to add that Milosevic was a proponent of ethnic cleansing. (AP, AFP, Reuters - 25/06/03)

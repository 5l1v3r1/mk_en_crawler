BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu began consultations with various political parties Thursday (16 February) on a crucial bill that would restructure the national anti-corruption department. The senate unexpectedly rejected the measure last week, reportedly because the ruling coalition failed to get all its deputies into the chamber for the vote. Basescu initiated the talks after Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu asked him to use his presidential powers to resubmit the bill to parliament. Corruption-fighting measures are key to Romania's scheduled EU accession next year.
Also Thursday, the opposition Socialist Party filed a no-confidence motion against the government, as expected. They claim the government's proposed reform of the healthcare sector would hurt the poor. The vote would be held Tuesday. (Nine o'clock - 17/02/06; Reuters, Nine o'clock - 16/02/06)

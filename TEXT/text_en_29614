BUCHAREST, Romania -- Authorities released 13 Turkish fishermen on Sunday (May 29th) who were detained after their ship was spotted in Romania's economic zone. All returned to Turkey except the captain, who remains in Constanta pending the completion of necessary procedures. The incident happened Friday when the Turkish boat crossed into Romania's exclusive economic zone to fish. Romanian coast guards ordered the crew to stop, but were ignored. In an effort to stop the boat, Coast Guard personnel opened fire, slightly injuring one of the crew. The ensuing chase lasted several hours before the ship was stopped in the Bulgarian economic zone.

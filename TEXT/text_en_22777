SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Use of the constitutional name Republic of Macedonia and the border demarcation process are the two key conditions for Macedonia to recognise Kosovo, Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski said on Friday (September 5th). Asked whether recognition would take place quickly now that border demarcation is under way, he said the leadership would decide based on the country's best interests. On Saturday, the Pristina daily Zeri said the border lines have been settled, including in the sensitive zone of Debelldeh. Recognition is expected to follow on September 23rd, the paper said.

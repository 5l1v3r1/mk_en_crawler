BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government will stick to its decision to resign and force early elections, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said Wednesday (13 July). He went on to add that the process leading to the new vote would be launched after his return from a trip to Brussels next week. Tariceanu announced his resignation earlier this month after the country's Constitutional Court struck down a judicial reform package adopted at the insistence of the EU.

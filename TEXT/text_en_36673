NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council on Friday (30 April) reaffirmed its position that the question of Kosovo's final status would be discussed only after the province has met a set of internationally established standards. Kosovo's Provisional Institutions of Self-Government must first attain such goals as free, fair and regular elections, free media and a sound and impartial legal system, the Security Council said in a statement. It urged the government to move quickly to rebuild or provide compensation for property destroyed by violence in mid-March. (AP, AFP - 01/05/04; Reuters, UPI - 30/04/04)

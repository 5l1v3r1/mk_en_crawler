SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bulgaria and Romania confirmed on Tuesday (4 January) that they have started deploying contingents in BiH, in line with agreements on participation in the EU mission Althea. Both Bulgaria and Romania were part of SFOR, whose duties EUFOR assumed last month. Bulgaria is contributing 160 troops, while Romania is sending 150.
In other news, cantonal prosecutors in Tuzla, BiH reportedly have launched a probe into the suspected misuse of international donations earmarked for Srebrenica. Wednesday's edition of Nezavisne novine reports that the funds in question were collected through several donor conferences.

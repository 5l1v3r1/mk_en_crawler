ANKARA, Turkey -- Admiral Caner Bener, of the Turkish Navy, has assumed command of an international naval task force established to fight piracy in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. He succeeds US Rear Admiral Michelle Howard. Turkey is the second nation to command the UN-led Combined Task Force 151, launched in January amid a wave of attacks by Somali pirates.
On Saturday, pirates hijacked a Greek-owned ship with 24 crewmen on board. The MT Ariana was seized north of Madagascar while travelling to the Middle East from Brazil. The Ukrainian crew is reportedly safe. (Hurriyet, The National - 04/05/09; Anadolu news agency, AFP - 03/05/09; ANA-MPA, Reuters, BBC, AFP, Al Jazeera - 02/05/09)

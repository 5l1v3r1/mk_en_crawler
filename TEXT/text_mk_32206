DUBROVNIK, Croatia -- The EU will recognise Croatia as an official membership candidate in 2004, according to Croatia's EU Integration Minister Neven Mimica. He made the statement Tuesday (8 October) at the opening of a three-day conference in Dubrovnik on EU integration, noting that the country had already met nearly half the obligations outlined in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
Also Tuesday, Croatia's Deputy Economy Minister Olgica Spevec and representatives of the Central Europe Free Trade Agreement signed a preliminary accord admitting Croatia to the organisation. Croatia expects to sign a final membership agreement by the end of next month. (HINA, HRT, Infoinvest -- 08/10/02)

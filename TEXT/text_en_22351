TIRANA, Albania -- Police say an Albanian fisherman was shot and wounded by Montenegrin border guards Tuesday (June 10th) in Albanian territorial waters of Shkodra Lake. Tirana has condemned the incident and asked for action by Montenegrin authorities. Montenegrin police say they are investigating and will not allow similar incidents in the future. Albanian police say two Montenegrin guards shot the man near the Shen Gjergj border point. He is recovering in a Shkodra hospital.
In other news, two teachers' unions in Tirana issued a report Wednesday, in advance of World Day against Child Labour, claiming there are more than 40,000 children working in Albania who have quit school. The report also expresses concern over the trafficking of Albanian children abroad. The International Labour Organisation estimates that traffickers have taken more than 3,000 to Greece and Italy to work as beggars and window cleaners.

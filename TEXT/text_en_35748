BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said on Friday (2 April) that Serbia-Montenegro's admission to the Partnership for Peace (PfP) initiative would be delayed. The country was to join the regional security programme, a cornerstone in the process of NATO integration, at the Istanbul summit in June. However, Scheffer said the country had failed to co-operate sufficiently with the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague, a key condition for PfP membership. This is another setback for Serbia-Montenegro; last week Washington decided to freeze most of its financial aid for Serbia. (Radio B92 - 02/04/04)

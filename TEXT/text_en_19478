TIRANA, Albania -- The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) opened on Wednesday (March 26th) the refurbished vehicle examination facility at the Qafe Thana border crossing, a primary gateway between Albania and Macedonia. The work was done under a UNODC project funded by the Italian government and assisted by the EU Customs and Fiscal Assistance Mission to Albania. Vehicle examination is another step in Albania's efforts for an integrated border management system and against illicit trafficking. (BalkanWeb, UN website - 26/03/08)

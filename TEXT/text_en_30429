ZAGREB, Croatia -- At its session Thursday (May 12th), the cabinet adopted final reports on the two most problematic chapters in the EU accession talks, those on competition and judiciary, and fundamental rights. The reports include final measures to meet the benchmarks set by the European Commission (EC) in both areas. The government also adopted a report on the privatisation of country's shipyards between the Economy Ministry and four major shipbuilders, which would help Croatia wrap up talks on the competition chapter.
Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor will present the reports to ambassadors of EU member states Friday, in hopes of finalising accession talks by the end of June. That in turn might allow Croatia to sign the accession treaty by the end of the year and join the EU in 2013. (Index.hr, HRT, Croatian government website, Dnevnik, tportal - 12/05/11)

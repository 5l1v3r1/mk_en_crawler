BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu and Iranian counterpart Mahmoud Ahmadinejad spoke by phone on Thursday (24 August) and managed to defuse a potential diplomatic row. Earlier this week, Iranian military personnel occupied a Romanian oil rig in the Gulf, shooting at the crew. Bucharest demanded an immediate investigation. During the phone call however, the two presidents agreed the incident was the result of a business dispute. 
In other news, Prime Minister Calin Popescu-Tariceanu said he would ask all National Liberal Party (PNL) members that contributed to the former secret police Securitate to resign from the party. Tariceanu, the PNL leader, added the party would not hesitate to expel former Securitate agents who refuse to leave voluntarily. (BBC, Reuters, Rompres, Mediafax - 24/08/06)

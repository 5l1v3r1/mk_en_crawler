WASHINGTON, the United States -- The UN Security Council decided on Friday (May 29th) to extend the mandate of its peacekeeping mission in Cyprus (UNFICYP) for another six months until December 15th. The Council adopted the proposal 14-1, with the opposing vote coming from non-permanent member Turkey. Ankara's representative to the UN Baki Ilkin explained that his country opposes use of the wording "Republic of Cyprus" in the draft resolution. Turkey does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus and has no diplomatic relations with it. (CNA, DPA, Reuters, Xinhua, Hurriyet, Anadolu news agency, UN News Centre - 29/05/09)

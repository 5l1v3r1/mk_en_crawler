BELGRADE, Serbia/PRISTINA, Serbia -- Serbian President Boris Tadic said on Friday (November 14th) the EU had the means to persuade Kosovo leaders to accept an agreement on the deployment of the EU's EULEX mission in Kosovo. Tadic noted the agreement did not suit the Kosovo Albanians because under the deal Belgrade would have a role in all dimensions of everyday life.
In related news Saturday, Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu said there is no pressure on the Kosovo government to accept the EULEX agreement. Sejdiu denied accusations Pristina is halting EULEX's deployment. (Makfax, Balkan Insight - 15/11/08, Beta, AFP, B92 - 14/11/08)

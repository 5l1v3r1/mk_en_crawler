SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik on Friday (June 4th) rejected a statement by Kosovo Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni, who said BiH will soon recognise Kosovo's independence. "I don't see a reason for BiH not to recognise independence and I expect this to happen soon," Hyseni said at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Sarajevo last week. 
Dodik, however, said the comment was from a minister of an illegal, self-declared state. "I can guarantee that BiH will never do that," Dodik said. (Sitel, Danas, B92 - 05/06/10)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The European Commission Liaison Office in Pristina recommended on Thursday (January 21st) that Kosovo change its election system, after the Central Elections Commission failed to finish work on municipal elections. The problem was a lack of consensus among political appointees. Among other things, the EU recommended the transformation of the Election Complaints and Appeals Sub-Commission into an administrative institution. They also called for the urgent adoption of legislation regulating political party registration and operations, including the funding of parties and campaigns. They also suggested that administrative decisions on complaints and appeals should be subject to court procedures. Government officials say they plan to reform the elections system this year.

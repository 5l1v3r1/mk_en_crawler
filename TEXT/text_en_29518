ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Tuesday (August 31st) that he expects Athens to drop its claims on disputed Aegean Sea territories in return for Ankara's decision to remove Greece from its threat list. "There is a detente in relations. Our new approach mostly carries a vision concept rather than a threat concept," Davutoglu told local private channel NTV. Local media reported last week that Turkey will remove Russia, Iran, Iraq and Greece from a list of countries deemed threats to national security. According to the reports, the decision to update the so-called Red Book of countries representing security threats will be adopted at an October session of the National Security Council.

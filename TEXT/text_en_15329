BRUSSELS, Belgium -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling lobbied for relaxation of the EU visa regime for citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), during talks with the EU justice and enlargement commissioners, Franco Frattini and Olli Rehn, in Brussels on Monday (26 June). He told the EU officials that easing the process for businesspeople, students and researchers would help maintain momentum towards Euro-Atlantic integration.
In other news, prosecutors in BiH have struck a deal with an alleged accomplice in a terror plot that purportedly involved suicide bombings in Denmark. Amir Bajric is one of five people detained in the Sarajevo Canton last November. In exchange for a guilty plea, he will receive a reduced prison sentence.

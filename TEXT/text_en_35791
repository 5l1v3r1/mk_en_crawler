BUCHAREST, Romania -- The school enrollment rate in Romania at the beginning of the 2003-2004 academic year was 74.2 per cent, down from nearly 80 per cent in 2000, according to data released by the Romanian National Statistics Institute (INS) on Monday (31 May). INS figures also show that dropouts occurred mainly in rural areas, and were likely the result of poverty. (Rompres, Evenimentul Zilei - 01/06/04)

PODGORICA, Serbia and Montenegro -- Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano and Montenegrin Deputy Prime Minister Dragan Djurovic attended an official ceremony Thursday (6 March) marking the re-establishment of railway traffic between the two countries. The line will run from Shkodra to Podgorica.
On Friday, meanwhile, two new border crossings opened between Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Croatia. The crossings at Dubrave-Pasin Potok (Velika Kladusa) and Hadzin Potok-Bogovolja (Cazin) followed an agreement on interstate border traffic signed last week during a visit by Croatian Foreign Minister Tonino Picula.

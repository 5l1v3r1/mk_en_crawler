SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Central Election Commission (CEC) has not yet presented the official results of the October 1st general vote, despite promises they would be issued by Monday (October 16th). CEC Chairman Branko Petric blames the delay on local election bodies, who he said lack training. The deadline for presenting final results is October 21st.

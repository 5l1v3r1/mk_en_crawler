BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu warned acting Justice Minister Teodor Melescanu late on Sunday (January 20th) that he verges on abuse of office regarding the investigation of eight former and current cabinet ministers suspected of corruption. Basescu, a former leader of the Democratic Party, has been locked in a power struggle with Melescanu's ruling National Liberal Party (PNL). Four of the ministers in question are from the PNL. Basescu is angry that Melescanu has asked him for more documents regarding the ministers, rather than approving the request to open investigations against them.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The judges in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic announced Friday (16 July) that they have adjourned the former Yugoslav leader's trial until the end of August because of his continuing health problems. The defence phase of the proceedings should have started in June. The judges have also asked the court's registrar to draft a list of lawyers who may be appointed to defend Milosevic. He has so far insisted on defending himself. (AFP - 16/07/04)

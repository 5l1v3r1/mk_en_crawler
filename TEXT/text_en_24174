ATHENS, Greece -- An inquiry committee presented a report to the full parliament Monday (December 15th) on a controversial real estate deal between the state and the Vatopedi monastery on Mount Athos. Two cabinet members recently stepped down as a result of the scandal, Merchant Marine Minister George Voulgarakis and Secretary of State Theodoros Roussopoulos. They were accused of involvement in the deal, under which the monastery received prime, state-owned real estate in exchange for cheap rural land causing at least 100m euros in losses to the state. The parliamentary report, however, failed to reach a definitive conclusion on who was to blame, despite examining scores of witnesses and documents over the last 45 days. The main opposition PASOK party called for a criminal investigation.
In other news, sporadic protests continued on Monday following the death of 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos, who was shot dead by a police officer on December 6th. Youths protested outside the main police headquarters in Athens and the main court, where some of the protesters arrested last week appeared before magistrates.
Also Monday, President Karolos Papoulias, 79, was fitted with a pacemaker, to correct an irregular heartbeat. He left the hospital on Tuesday. (Kathimerini, Estia, To Vima, Elepftheros Typos, Apogevmatini - 16/12/08; ANA-MPA, Naftemporiki, In.news, Reuters, AFP, AP, DPA, BBC, UPI - 15/12/08)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia does not mind Kosovo's participation in regional meetings, as long as it is done in accordance with UN Resolution 1244 and if it is presented as UNMIK-Kosovo, President Boris Tadic's office said on Wednesday (February 24th). The statement was prompted by Kosovo media reports that Tadic could meet up with Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu at next month's summit of Western Balkan leaders, in Slovenia. It was initiated by Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor and his Croatian counterpart, Jadranka Kosor. Tadic has maintained that meeting with Sejdiu would imply recognition of Kosovo's independence.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A trial against seven people suspected of killing 230 Kurds in southeast Turkey during the peak of the Kurdish insurgency in the 1990s, kicked off in Diyarbakir on Friday (September 11th) amid strong security measures. The proceedings began after an investigation which followed the discovery of human remains in wells in the city of Silopi, believed to be the bones of victims of an illegal organisation inside the gendarmerie in the 1990s. According to the prosecution, the seven suspects killed hundreds of Kurds in the area as part of what they called "anti-terrorism" measures. (AFP, Haber27 - 11/09/09)

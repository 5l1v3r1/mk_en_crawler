THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The trial of former Bosnian Serb commander Zdravko Tolimir will start at the UN war crimes tribunal on February 26th, the court announced on Friday (January 22nd). The proceedings were supposed to begin on December 17th but were adjourned because Tolimir, who is conducting his own defence, had to study new charges added to the indictment. At pre-trial proceedings on December 16th, the general pleaded not guilty. He is accused of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.

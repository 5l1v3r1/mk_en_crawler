BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic said Wednesday (21 July) that the RS Interior Ministry will begin regular searches aimed at meeting its obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. Mikerevic confirmed that police conducted raids in Bileca and Gacko, eastern BiH, earlier on Wednesday after receiving a tip that indictees might be hiding in the area. None were found. The media later reported that the fugitives in question were Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. (Nezavisne novine - 22/07/04; RTRS, NTV Hayat, AFP - 21/07/04)

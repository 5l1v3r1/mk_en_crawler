BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian General Vladimir Lazarevic will make his first appearance before the UN war crimes tribunal on Monday (7 February), according to a Serbian government statement. Lazarevic was extradited to the Netherlands on Friday. Belgrade is guaranteeing his release on bail until the trial begins. Lazarevic is one of four Serbian Army and police generals indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal on charges related to the Kosovo conflict in 1999. He surrendered last weekend. 
On Saturday, meanwhile, Serbia-Montenegro Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic said he would again formally request that the tribunal send a medical team to Belgrade to examine the other two generals wanted by The Hague -- Sreten Lukic and Nebojsa Pavkovic. Ljajic anticipates their surrender by 31 March, if the tribunal ensures them adequate medical treatment. (Politika - 06/02/05; B92, Tanjug - 05/02/05)

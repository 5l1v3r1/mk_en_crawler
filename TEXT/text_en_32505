TIRANA, Albania -- The government said Wednesday (12 March) that it supports UNMIK's initiative to hold talks with Belgrade on practical issues between Serbia and Kosovo. Last week, Michael Steiner, the chief UN officer in the province, invited a delegation from Serbia to meet local Kosovo leaders and international officials to discuss transportation and economic issues. In its Wednesday statement, the Albanian Foreign Ministry said "building up direct and constructive relations through dialogue is in the interest of development and stability of the whole region."

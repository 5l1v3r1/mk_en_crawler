BUCHAREST, Romania -- The economy and trade ministry is inviting private companies to participate in several large projects to rehabilitate thermo-power plants. Economy Minister Dan Ioan Popescu said Tuesday (23 December) the projects would give the country an opportunity to catch up to EU standards in the sector by 2007.
On a separate note, Popescu agreed to start negations with mining unions in the National Lignite Company Oltenia. That halted a strike Monday to protest planned staff downsizing. (Rompres, Bursa - 23/12/03)

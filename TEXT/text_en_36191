ANKARA, Turkey -- Commenting on the results of parliamentary elections in Greece, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Monday (8 March) he expects "positive" ties under the new government. New Democracy (ND) party leader Costas Karamanlis had said in his campaign speeches that he favours improved relations with Turkey. Erdogan stressed that Ankara had good relations both with ND and with the former ruling PASOK party prior to the elections and sees no reason this should change. Erdogan plans an official visit to Athens on 28 March to meet with the new government. (Anadolu Agency, NTV, ANA - 08/03/04)

NEW YORK, United States -- Standard & Poors has downgraded its outlook on Romania from positive to neutral over concerns about the country's stability. Analyst Remy Salters said Romania is undergoing a political crisis at a time when it should be implementing key structural reforms stemming from EU accession. The country's governing coalition recently broke up amid a feud between Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu and President Traian Basescu, and several ministers -- including reformist Justice Minister Monica Macovei -- were dismissed.
Efforts by the opposition to launch impeachments proceedings against Basescu suffered a setback Thursday (April 5th). The Constitutional Court rejected the request, saying any procedural breaches that have occurred since he took office are not serious enough to warrant impeachment. It remains up to Parliament, however, to decide whether to continue with the effort. (Cotidianul, Romania Libera - 06/04/07; Dow Jones, DPS, Mediafax - 05/04/07)

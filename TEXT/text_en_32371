WASHINGTON, United States -- Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz told a House Appropriations Subcommittee on Thursday (27 March) that Turkey requires $1 billion in aid to help offset the consequences of the conflict in neighbouring Iraq. Wolfowitz also praised Ankara for allowing US aircraft to use its airspace in the campaign against Saddam Hussein, saying a change in regime in Iraq would present new business opportunities for Turkey. As for parliament's decision not to allow the deployment of more than 60,000 US troops, Wolfowitz called it a "big, big mistake" and indicated it would lengthen the war.
In other news, a US military spokesman said some 50 US and British planes were leaving the Incirlik base in southern Turkey. They had been used to monitor the northern no-fly zone in Iraq. Some 1,400 US personnel will also be pulled, out leaving only a token US presence in the area. (AP, AFP, Reuters - 27/03/03)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The director of a new security agency to be established next year will be appointed by the president, according to agency's regulations approved by parliament in a second reading Tuesday (December 4th). The opposition had rejected the idea, arguing it would give the president too much political influence over the new agency, which will handle issues of national security, corruption and anti-terrorism -- duties now held by various agencies within the interior, defence and finance ministries. The opposition fears sensitive information could be used for political purposes. (Sega, 24 Chasa, Dnevnik - 05/12/07; BNR, Focus, Novinite, Sofia Echo - 04/12/07)

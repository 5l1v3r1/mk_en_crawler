PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt says he thinks Kosovo could become an EU member before becoming a UN member state. Bildt, who wrapped up a two-day official visit to Kosovo on Sunday (March 9th), said he knows that some countries -- such as Russia and China -- will never recognise an independent Kosovo and will block its entry to the UN. However, he insisted this would not happen in EU integration. 
Bildt said Kosovo, and the situation in the Western Balkans since Kosovo's declaration of independence last month, will be high on the agenda of Monday's EU foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels. He also insisted that the UN should remain in Kosovo as a buffer between countries that recognise Kosovo's independence and those that do not. Bildt also commented on the resignation of Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, describing snap parliamentary elections as of "critical importance for the region as a whole, including Kosovo".

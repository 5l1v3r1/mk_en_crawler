BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Bulgaria would like to join the Eurozone in 2009, two years after its accession to the EU, Finance Minister Milen Velchev said Monday (17 January). Under EU rules, a country that wants to join the zone must spend at least two years in the so-called Exchange Rate Mechanism II, in order to bring its currency into line with the euro. Velchev also said Bulgaria should keep its IMF-monitored currency board until then.
Also Monday, Bulgaria's Supreme Prosecution of Cassation announced the launch of a probe into possible abuse of office by former Prime Minister Ivan Kostov. The local newspaper Trud reported that Kostov, while in office, channelled government funds to the Union of Democratic Forces, the party he led at the time. Kostov, now a member of parliament, denies the allegation. (Trud, bTV - 18/01/05; Mediapool AFP, bTV, Nova TV - 17/01/05)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko urged officials in Mostar on Wednesday (July 8th) to speed up the mayoral election there. The Mostar City Council has met 13 times since the October 5th local elections, but has failed so far to fill the post, as no candidate has managed to attract sufficient support.
In other news, about 4,000 people on Wednesday headed toward eastern BiH as part of a peace march commemorating the 14th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre. They will walk more than 100km to the Potocari Memorial Park. A service will be held there Saturday in honour of the 8,000 Bosniak men and boys killed by Bosnian Serb troops in 1995. The march follows the route that surviving Bosniaks took to flee the enclave. (RTRS, BHRT, OHR, Fena, Pincom.info, DPA, BTA - 08/07/09)

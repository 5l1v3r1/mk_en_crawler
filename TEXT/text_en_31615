NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution Monday (14 April) giving full support to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's plan for an overall political settlement to the disputes in Cyprus. The resolution also holds Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash responsible for the failure of the last round of negotiations. Annan had hoped a reunified Cyprus could sign a treaty Wednesday on EU membership. (UN News Centre, Anadolu Agency, CAN, AFP, AP - 14/04/03)

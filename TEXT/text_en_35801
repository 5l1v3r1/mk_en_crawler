BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The four reformist parties that won parliament seats in December's general election are close to forming a coalition, according to G-17 leader Miroslav Labus. The Democratic Party of Serbia, the G17 Plus, and the Serbian Renewal Movement-New Serbia coalition have already signed an agreement on forming a government. The Democratic Party (DS) of the late Zoran Djindjic is expected to join the alliance Friday. According to Labus, all four organisations will be represented in the new cabinet. The DS has still not agreed with the other three parties on a common nominee for speaker of parliament. Lawmakers will vote again for a speaker Friday (30 January). Their first attempt failed.
In other news, Rory O'Sullivan, head of the World Bank mission in Belgrade, met with representatives of the four reformist parties to warn them that Serbia could lose a $111m loan if failure to form a government pushes the country into political crisis. (B92, Beta - 30/01/04; AFP - 29/01/04)

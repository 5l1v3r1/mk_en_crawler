BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) is set to recommend that Bulgaria and Romania be allowed to join the EU on 1 January 2007, as scheduled. The decision would be part of a progress report on the two countries due out on 26 September. It is set to include a warning, however, that the Union would trigger safeguard measures if its standards are not met. According to the Financial Times, the warnings would mostly be aimed at Bulgaria, which has been slow in meeting demands for judicial reform and additional efforts to fight organised crime and corruption in the senior levels of government.

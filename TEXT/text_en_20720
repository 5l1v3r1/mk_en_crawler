BELGRADE, Serbia -- The US, EU and Russian mediators for the new round of Kosovo status talks -- Frank Wisner, Wolfgang Ischinger and Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko, respectively -- plan to hold their first meeting with Serbian officials Friday (August 10th). The so-called Kosovo Troika meets Thursday in London with the Contact Group to receive final instructions. On Saturday, Troika members meet with officials in Pristina. The Contact Group has 120 days, or until December 10th, to complete the talks.
On Tuesday, Serbian Ambassador to Russia Stanimir Vukicevic said his country will not trade Kosovo for EU membership. The two are separate issues, he stressed. He said that while Belgrade negotiates with the European Commission on EU accession, the Kosovo issue must be resolved by the UN Security Council.

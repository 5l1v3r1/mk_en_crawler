BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Constitutional Court decided on Wednesday (November 3rd) there is a legal conflict between the government and parliament regarding the adoption of the education law, and as such, parliament should debate and adopt the law. The ruling came after Prime Minister Emil Boc insisted last week on launching an accountability procedure instead, which would enable the cabinet to adopt the education law without parliamentary debate or a vote. This, despite the fact it was already in the Senate for consideration. The manoeuvre prompted Mircea Geoana, a member of the opposition Social Democratic Party and president of the Senate, to challenge it before the Constitutional Court. The opposition also submitted a new no-confidence motion against the cabinet over the matter. (Adevarul, Evenimentul Zilei, Romania Libera, Cotidianul, Gandul - 03/11/10)

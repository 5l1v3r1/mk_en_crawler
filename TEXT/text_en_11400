PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The leaders of Montenegro are asking Serbia to agree to a split between the two republics and to establish "a commonwealth of independent states" between them. Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic and Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic wrote letters to their Serbian counterparts arguing that this new alliance would address shortcomings in the current loose union and create stability in the area. The current union between Serbia and Montenegro was formed in early 2003. Under an internationally-sponsored agreement, the two republics can hold referenda on independence in February 2006.

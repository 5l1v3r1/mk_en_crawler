TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama on Tuesday (March 16th) urged Prime Minister Sali Berisha to agree on a consensus in resolving the current political stalemate. In a letter to Berisha, Rama insisted on transparency on the 2009 general elections by allowing an investigation into the process. The reaction came after a similar request by the SP was refused earlier in the day by government representatives. "I would like to find a way out of the problem which separates the past from the European future of Albania," Rama said in his letter. He pointed out that investigating some ballot boxes does not aim to change the final outcome of the vote, but rather set a standard for future elections.

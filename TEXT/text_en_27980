BUCHAREST, Romania -- The senior ruling Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) signed a co-operation agreement Tuesday (May 18th) with the National Union for the Progress of Romania (UNPR), a new group established by defectors from the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD). The UNPR was officially founded at the beginning of the month, and doesn't have a formal parliamentary caucus yet. The party has a left-centrist platform, presenting itself as a 'modernised' PSD. It controls the votes of nearly two dozen lawmakers, a welcomed boost to the ruling coalition. Yet even with those votes, the ruling PDL and the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians lack a formal majority, and must rely on the votes of ethnic minority representatives.

TIRANA, Albania -- The major opposition Democratic Party (DP) sees no obstacle to changing the constitution to reflect changes in the election code, reported the Albanian Daily News on Thursday (15 July). According to the DP, this initially should be the task of the newly-minted commission on electoral reform; parliament would later take up the changes. The ruling Socialist Party, however, has been hesitant about modifying the constitution, sources say. (Albanian Daily News - 15/07/04)

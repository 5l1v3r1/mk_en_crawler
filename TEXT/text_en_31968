MITROVICA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- Michael Steiner, the chief international officer in Kosovo, announced Monday (25 November) that the UN has finally established control over the entire province. The announcement came after the UN moved into offices in the Serb part of Mitrovica which had been occupied by defiant local political leaders. The move was seen as important because the town has become symbolic of ethnic division and confrontation. Steiner promised to help bring foreign investment to the Serb part and provide security to its residents. The move was made with the support of authorities in Belgrade and after negotiations with local Serb leaders, Steiner said.

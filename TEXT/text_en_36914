BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Federal Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic said in an interview published Saturday (3 July) that Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic may surrender to the UN war crimes tribunal. He added, however, that Belgrade has the political will to extradite the fugitive if he is caught. Davinic repeated his government's official position that Mladic has fled the country. Separately, Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic said the government would provide convincing evidence of this.
In other news, Serbian President-elect Boris Tadic said Saturday that there was no need for early parliamentary elections, adding that they were at least a year away. Tadic says an election now would be a destabilising factor. (AFP - 03/07/04)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Changes in the government will be announced on Monday (21 February), cabinet spokesman Dimitar Tsonev said Friday. Neither he nor Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg provided details. However, the press is speculating that Economy Minister Lydia Shuleva, Regional Development Minister Valentin Tserovski and Culture Minister Bozhidar Abrashev are the most likely to lose their jobs. A shake-up has been expected since the government survived a no-confidence motion last week. 
In other news, Sofia on Friday began hosting a two-day conference on security in Southeast Europe. The forum aims to create a co-operation network among relevant institutions in the region. (Bulgarian Radio, Mediapool, News.bg, RTRS - 18/02/05)

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus on Monday (28 August) accused organisers of the Turkish Formula One Grand Prix of using a sports event for political gain. During the awards ceremony Sunday in Istanbul, Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat handed the winner's prize to Ferrari driver Felipe Massa. Cyprus government spokesman Christodoulos Passiardis denounced what he described an "unacceptable and provocative piece of theater". Turkish organisers admit they had violated the rules of FIA, the world governing motor sports body. "You cannot put a price on such promotion â¦ the Formula One race was a great opportunity. Cyprus is our national cause," said Murat Yalcintas, head of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce. An estimated 2.5 billion people around the world saw the ceremony.

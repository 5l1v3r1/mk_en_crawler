SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country has received an official road map for visa-free travel to the EU, according to a presentation Thursday (June 5th) by Michael Leigh, head of the European Commission's (EC) Directorate General for Enlargement. The document sets clear requirements for reforms in key areas such as security of documents, border management, fundamental rights and the fight against illegal migration, organised crime and corruption. The EC will monitor its implementation regularly. BiH citizens began enjoying the benefits of a visa facilitation agreement with the EU at the beginning of the year. Up to 50% of them are currently exempt from the visa fee. (Nezavisne Novine, Dnevni Avaz - 06/06/08; RTRS, Fena - 05/06/08)

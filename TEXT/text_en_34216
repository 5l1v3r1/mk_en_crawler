PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Michael Steiner on Monday (7 July) signed a Free Trade Agreement between Kosovo and Albania. Under the deal, 50 per cent of exchanged goods will not be subject to customs duties. The waiver will be extended to 90 per cent of bilateral trade over the next six years. The reaction from Belgrade was immediate: government officials insisted Kosovo cannot sign international documents. Steiner is to leave Kosovo on Tuesday to take his new post as German permanent representative to the UN in Geneva. UNMIK's deputy chief, Charles Brayshaw of the United States, will become acting head of the UN mission until Steiner's replacement is named. (AFP, ATA, B92, Albanian News, Tanjug - 07/07/03)

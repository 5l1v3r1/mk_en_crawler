ANKARA, Turkey -- A military court sentenced a lieutenant-colonel to four years in prison Thursday (February 4th), after finding a weapons cache in his home. Mustafa Donmez, whose trial was part of the ongoing investigation into the so-called Ergenekon organisation, was also discharged from the army. The Ergenekon case investigates an alleged plot to overthrow the government by provoking military intervention. The Ergenekon network is accused of plotting an indirect coup with civilian courts ordering the arrest of many military officers so far. The Constitutional Court recently annulled a law that allowed military personnel to be tried in civilian courts. (Turkiye - 06/02/10; Zaman, Nethaber - 05/02/10)

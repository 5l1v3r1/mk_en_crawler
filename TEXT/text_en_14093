SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Defence Minister Vesselin Bliznakov said on Thursday (15 September) that Bulgarian troops might remain in Iraq beyond the end of this year, possibly as part of a mission to train Iraqi soldiers. Bliznakov's comment followed a meeting with Polish counterpart Jerzy Szmajdzinski, in the framework of an informal NATO meeting in Berlin. Bliznakov said the decision to withdraw the Bulgarian peacekeeping contingent has been made and cannot be revoked, but he did not rule out the training effort. He added that Bulgaria might enlarge its participation in the international security force in Afghanistan next year. (Mediapool, news.bg, Novinite - 15/09/05)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission will probably delay its next monitoring reports for Turkey, Croatia and the Western Balkan countries by two weeks, releasing them on 8 November, rather than 24 October. Krisztina Nagy, spokeswoman for EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, told a news conference Tuesday (19 September) that the postponement is due to changes in the EC's schedule. Reports on Bulgaria and Romania, which are expected to clarify whether the two candidate states join the EU in January as scheduled, will be issued on 26 September, as previously announced.

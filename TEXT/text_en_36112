SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO's commander for Southeast Europe, US Admiral Gregory Johnson, met with members of the tripartite BiH presidency in Sarajevo on Tuesday (16 March). He said he hoped the country would be invited to join the Partnership for Peace programme at the Alliance's June summit in Istanbul. Johnson also confirmed that BiH's accession would not be made conditional on the entry of Serbia-Montenegro. The talks also focused on the planned transfer of military command in BiH from NATO to an EU-led force. Presidency Chairman Sulejman Tihic insisted that Bosnian authorities participate fully in discussions on the force's mandate. (OHR Sources - 17/03/04; PBS BiH, NTV Hayat - 16/03/04)

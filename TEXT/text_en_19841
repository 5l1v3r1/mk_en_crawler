NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The foreign ministers of the Mediterranean members of the EU said Friday (January 18th) that the EU should have a unified stance on the Kosovo status issue. Around 20 EU members have stated their intention to recognise Kosovo's independence, while Serbia firmly opposes any solution offering Kosovo more than broad autonomy. Cyprus, Russia, Greece, Slovakia and Romania are reluctant to recognise a possible independence of Kosovo fearing that it may ignite separatists in their territories. The participants unanimously agreed that the EU should send its planned police mission in Kosovo as soon as possible, France's Foreign Ministry European co-operation department head Pierre Menat said after the meeting.
Meanwhile, EC President Jose Manuel Barroso was quoted by Cyprus newspaper Politis on Saturday as saying that resolving the Cypriot issue is a prerequisite for Cyprus to become more active in the EU. He assured that the EU will make all efforts to help in the search for a solution to the dispute on the divided island. (CNA - 19/01/08; AFP, Reuters - 18/01/08)

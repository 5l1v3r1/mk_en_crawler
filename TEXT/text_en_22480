ATHENS, Greece -- Local media reports suggest Greek citizens will soon be able to travel to the United States without a visa, as talks on including Greece in the US Visa Waiver Programme are to be completed by the end of July. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis agreed on the issue during a meeting in Berlin on June 24th, the daily Ta Nea reported on Saturday (July 12th). The talks are expected to result in the drafting of a memorandum of understanding, which will go to the Greek parliament for ratification. So far, a disagreement over access to personal data of those with suspected links to terrorist organisations has impeded talks. Greece reportedly insists that the memorandum of understanding would no longer be applicable after the conclusion of a related agreement between the United States and the EU. Greece is the only one of the 15 original EU member states whose citizens need a visa to enter the United States. (In.news, Ta Nea, Kathimerini, ANA-MPA - 12/07/08)

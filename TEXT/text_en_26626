SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government has decided to tighten access to the domestic labour markets for non-EU residents, Labour Minister Totyu Mladenov announced on Tuesday (September 8th). In particular, local employers will be obliged to look for an EU-member resident at least 30 days before they offer the position to someone else. In addition, job advertisements should be published in the national press, and interviews should be monitored by labour intermediaries, to avoid any unreasonable denial of a job. The ministry says it is trying to protect positions, particularly ones that require qualified labour, for residents, in light of rising unemployment. The state employment agency has instead been issuing labour permits mostly to Turkish and Russian applicants, the former to work on road infrastructure projects, while the latter to help build a second nuclear plant.

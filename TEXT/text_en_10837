ZAGREB, Croatia -- The main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) announced Thursday (2 September) that it would ask for a parliamentary debate on the country’s standby arrangement with the IMF. SDP leader and former Prime Minister Ivica Racan said the public deserves to know what to expect in the next two years when the economic programme approved under the agreement will be implemented. He expressed concern that the planned accelerated privatisation might result in hasty and non-transparent sell-offs. Racan said the Croatian Peasants' Party would support his party’s demand for debate. (HINA, HRT - 02/09/04)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A total of 6,531,549 voters have registered for the Serbian presidential elections scheduled for 13 June, the republic's electoral commission announced Sunday (30 May). The commission has registered a total of 15 candidates.
Also on Sunday, a member of the EU president's cabinet, Sandro Gozi, reiterated that war crimes co-operation is pivotal for Serbia-Montenegro. "It's obvious that we cannot speak of a country coming closer to the standards of the EU, when it does not share the same ethics and principles we do, in this case, the fight against war criminals."

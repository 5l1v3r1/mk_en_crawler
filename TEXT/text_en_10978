TIRANA, Albania -- Integration Minister Ermelinda Meksi said Wednesday (29 December) that the main government objective in 2005 would be to achieve progress towards EU accession, including the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement. She added, however, that this would depend on the conduct of the general elections next year. Acknowledging that parliament's rejection of the election law this year slowed the reform process, Meksi stressed progress had been made in terms of structural reforms. (ATA - 29/12/04)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Security Minister Barisa Colak says efforts to revise cases of citizenship granted illegally to foreigners from 1992-2006 are on track. In an interview published in Monday's (14 August) Dnevni avaz, Colak praised the work of the special commission in charge of the revisions and said he expects it to complete its task by the end of this year. At the same time, he said an extension would be granted if necessary, since the BiH government considers cases of suspicious naturalised citizens a top priority. Most cases involve those who came to BiH during the 1990s conflicts. 
In other news, Branko Petric, chairman of the BiH Central Election Commission, is urging municipal authorities to submit data regarding the central voters list to the Citizens Identification Protection System directorate as soon as possible. In an interview in Monday's Nezavisne novine, Petric noted that the deadline is Thursday. The general elections are on 1 October. (Nezavisne novine, Dnevni avaz - 14/08/06)

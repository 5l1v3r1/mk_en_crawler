TIRANA, Albania -- Any further downsizing of NATO's troops in Kosovo will be decided in co-operation with authorities in Pristina, Albanian Defence Minister Arben Imami said on Sunday (February 7th). "Kosovo has developed into a stable country ... showing political maturity," Imami said in Tirana, after attending a meeting of NATO defence ministers in Istanbul. He added that the number of KFOR troops will reflect current security situations. NATO recently reduced its presence to 10,000 troops. Media reports predict it will be slashed to 4,000 by next year.

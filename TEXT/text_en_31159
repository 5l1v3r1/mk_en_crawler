TIRANA, Albania -- Football in Albania is again in the spotlight for suspected match fixing, media reported on Thursday (March 3rd). The executive committee of the National Football Federation -- assisted by UEFA -- is investigating three matches played during the national championship. A last round match played in Tirana is in the focus of the probe, where the reigning champion Dinamo was easily beaten by current leader Skenderbeu. 
There may also be a connection between the Football Federation and the Skenderbeu club. Reporters speculate that Federation president Armando Duka is a joint shareholder in a private company with the owner of the club from Korca, a violation of policies. (Top Channel, Alsat, Klan - 03/03/11)

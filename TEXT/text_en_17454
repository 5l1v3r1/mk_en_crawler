SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- At a press conference Monday (May 21st), Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik expressed doubts that the US-sponsored talks he will attend in Washington this week will break the deadlock over key police and constitutional reforms. Dodik is to meet with Haris Silajdzic, the Bosniak member of the BiH presidency. "The meeting is unnecessary because it will only confirm our differences and not bring us closer," Dodik said. He also called on the High Representative to stop interfering in BiH's internal matters, especially in the area of personnel appointments. He said he believes it is a mistake to try to make BiH a country with strong central institutions, as these institutions do not function well.

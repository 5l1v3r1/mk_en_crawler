MUNICH, Germany -- German Ambassador to the UK Wolfgang Ischinger could be appointed as the EU's representative in the upcoming negotiations on the future status of Kosovo, the Munich-based Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper said in a report on Saturday (July 28th). Ischinger took part in the Dayton negotiations, which ended the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and also helped launch the Stability Pact.
Currently, the EU is represented by Stefan Lehne. According to Belgrade's Vecernje Novosti, he remains the bloc's most likely choice for the new round of talks. The United States would be represented by its current envoy, Frank Wisner, while former Russian Ambassador to Serbia Vladimir Ivanovski would represent his country, the paper suggested.

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Albanian Foreign Minister Ilir Meta started a two-day visit to Yugoslavia on Tuesday (26 November), signalling improved relations between the two governments after years of tension. Meta and his Yugoslav counterpart Goran Svilanovic signed three agreements, including one abolishing visas for official travel between the two countries. Meta predicted this would help boost bilateral economic, trade and cultural exchange. He and Svilanovic announced that a free trade agreement would be signed in the coming months. They also discussed their countries' bids to join the EU, as well as the situation in Kosovo. Meta is to meet President Kostunica on Wednesday.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The ruling coalition's talks on the new territorial organisation of municipalities have entered their final stage, Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski said on Thursday (8 July). Should the final agreement be reached Friday, the government is prepared to meet at the weekend and approve the entire power decentralisation package, Buckovski added. Earlier this week, the media speculated that talks had stalled and that delayed parliamentary adoption might lead to the postponement of local elections this autumn.

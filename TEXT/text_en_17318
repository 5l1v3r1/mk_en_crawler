BUCHAREST, Romania -- The ruling National Liberal Party (PNL) will work to oust President Traian Basescu in next month's nationwide referendum on impeachment, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said on Thursday (April 26th). Asked why his party joined the anti-Basescu campaign, after being allies with Basescu's Democratic Party until just weeks ago, Tariceanu said that the president "is not the man he seemed to be in 2004". The main opposition Social Democratic Party also plans to work for his ouster, starting with a rally Friday in the town of Craiova. The referendum is scheduled for May 19th.
Meanwhile, Conservative Party Leader Dan Voiculescu said he would prove that Basescu collaborated with communist secret services before 1989. Voiculescu claimed he has hard evidence of Basescu's activities, and that it has been placed before the national council that reviews such matters.

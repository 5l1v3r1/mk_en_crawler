NEW YORK, United States -- Albanian Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha met with Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in New York on Wednesday (September 24th) to discuss bilateral relations, developments in southeastern Europe and the situation in Georgia and the Black Sea region. Basha pointed out that Kosovo is a unique case and should not serve as a precedent for other regions. Moscow has opposed Kosovo's independence for just that reason.

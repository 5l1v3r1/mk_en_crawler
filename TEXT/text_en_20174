BELGRADE, Serbia -- A total of 15 men accused of belonging to the radical Islamic Wahabi group went on trial on Monday (January 14th) in Belgrade, charged with running terrorist training camps and plotting to attack a police station. Prosecutors also contend that the group was planning to murder a Muslim cleric whom they suspected of being an American spy. Most members of the group were arrested in a series of raids near Novi Pazar in the Muslim-dominated Sandzak region. Ismail Prentic, the alleged leader of the extremists, was killed in a shootout with the police during one of the raids. Police discovered a cave full of plastic explosives and weapons allegedly belonging to the group. (AFP, BBC, UPI, AKI, Tanjug, RTS, B92 - 14/01/08)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Spanish Ambassador to Belgrade Inigo de Palacio Espana on Thursday (September 2nd) denied media allegations that his country is drafting a new resolution on Kosovo that would replace the one filed by Serbia at the UN. The diplomat stressed that his country is working with its European partners and Serbia to find a "satisfactory solution". The document Belgrade submitted is scheduled to be discussed at the UN General Assembly on September 9th. Spain is among five EU member states that have not recognised Kosovo.

ATHENS, Greece -- Police announced on Sunday (April 11th) the arrests of six suspected members of the terror group Revolutionary Struggle. The suspects -- five men and a woman --were apprehended on Saturday in Athens. A computer containing alleged terror attack proclamations was also seized, a police spokesperson said. The news triggered unrest in the capital. About 200 masked men set a garbage bin on fire several minutes after police announced the arrests. Some of them hurled stones at police officers who eventually used tear gas to disperse them. Another protest is scheduled outside the main Athens courthouse on Monday.
Revolutionary Struggle has claimed responsibility for several attacks, including the shooting of a police officer last year and a rocket attack against the US embassy in 2007. (AP, Xinhua, ANA-MPA - 11/04/10)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told Montenegrin Prime Minister Zeljko Sturanovic in Brussels on Thursday (March 8th) that Montenegro could initialise a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) agreement with the EU later this month. Noting that only the technical negotiations remain to be finalised, he suggested the document could be initialled during his visit to Podgorica next week, and formally signed in spring. However, Rehn said he still has to consult with some EU member states on the issue. The commissioner urged Montenegro to keep up its reform momentum, strengthen public administration capacity and intensify efforts to fight corruption and organised crime.

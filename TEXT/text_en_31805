CETINJE, Montenegro, Yugoslavia -- Followers of Montenegro's two rival Orthodox churches gathered to celebrate Christmas late Monday (6 January) with calls for "love and loyalty." Several thousand members of the Serbian Orthodox Church and the splinter Montenegrin Orthodox Church burned the traditional Yule logs only 100 meters apart from each other. Despite the bitter rivalry between the two groups over Montenegrin independence, the gatherings remained peaceful. (AP - 06/01/03)

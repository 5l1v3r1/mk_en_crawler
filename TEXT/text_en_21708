ANKARA, Turkey -- Justice Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin says authorities may allow Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned leader of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), to communicate with other inmates if he calls on the PKK to lay down its weapons. Ocalan is serving a life sentence in solitary confinement at a prison on the island of Imrali. "However, if he tells the PKK to quit fighting and lay down its arms, prosecutors might make a new assessment," Sahin said on Tuesday (November 25th). Just last week, the Turkish government decided to send five or six more prisoners to the island. (Hurriyet, NTV, CNN Turk - 25/11/08)

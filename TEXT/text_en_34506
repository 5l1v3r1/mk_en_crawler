NEW YORK, United States -- Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), gave an upbeat report about the future of the country's economy on Wednesday (8 October). Briefing the UN Security Council, he said that his office has started "to drive a bulldozer through the massive red tape and regulations that entangle businesses, prevent enterprise and deter investment". Ashdown promised to overhaul the current tax system and introduce a Value Added Tax by 2005.
In other remarks to the Council, Ashdown said efforts have been stepped up to find Radovan Karadzic and other war crimes suspects by attacking the networks that support them.
Also Wednesday, the EU Police Mission in BiH said it plans to expand the scope of operations against human trafficking networks in the country. BiH is used as a transit zone for trafficking people from Southeast Europe to Western Europe. (Dnevni List - 09/10/03; AFP, SRNA, FENA - 08/10/03)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police on Tuesday (25 July) arrested four people who allegedly stoned the houses of ethnic Serb returnees in the Zadar village of Biljani Donji the previous night. No injuries were reported but the homes were damaged. Police say the suspects also tried to set fires in the neighbourhood. 
President Stipe Mesic, the UNHCR office and the Serb People's Council in Croatia condemned the incidents in separate statements Tuesday. They praised local police and firefighters for their fast responses and urged zero tolerance for ethnically motivated incidents. (Novi list, Poslovni dnevnik - 26/07/06; HINA, HRT - 25/07/06)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Members of the State Information and Protection Agency (SIPA) arrested a reserve police officer Wednesday (May 18th), suspected of war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. Miralem Macic, 42, allegedly killed two Serb civilians in 1992 in the Konjic municipality village of Bradina. Macic was detained only a day after being released from prison where he had served a 12-year sentence for killing a four-member family in Konjic during the war.

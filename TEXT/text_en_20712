BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police have arrested at least 30 members of a neo-Nazi group that tried to attack an anti-fascist demonstration. On Sunday (October 7th), officers raided a recreation centre operated by the Serbian Army in Novi Sad and found several dozen members of Nacionalni Stroj (National Front) who were throwing bottles and stones at demonstrators in front of the building. The Front had been planning to hold a rally to mark the birthday of Heinrich Himmler, the Nazi security chief who was among those in charge of the extermination of Jews and Slavs in occupied Europe during World War II. The event was banned following protests by human rights groups and Jewish organisations. (Reuters, Politika, Blic - 08/10/07; Beta, Tanjug - 07/10/07)

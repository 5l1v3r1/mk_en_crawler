ATHENS, Greece -- The culture ministry on Monday (December 6th) denied a recent report alleging Greece would consider dropping its long-standing claim to ownership of the Parthenon Marbles, which are currently in the British Museum, in return for a long-term loan of the artefacts. "The permanent return of the Parthenon Marbles to the new Acropolis Museum remains the steadfast demand of the Greek state," the ministry said in a statement.
British newspaper The Times reported recently that "Greece was trying to break decades of stalemate with Britain over the Elgin Marbles by dropping its long-standing claim to ownership of the sculptures in return for the British Museum sending the Acropolis artefacts back to Athens on a long-term loan." The Marbles were at the Parthenon until 1801, when they were removed and shipped to Britain by diplomat Lord Elgin. (DPA, ANA-MPA - 06/12/10)

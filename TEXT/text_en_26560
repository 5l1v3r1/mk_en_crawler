TIRANA, Albania -- Greece, Slovenia, France, Austria and Italy sent aid to Albania at the weekend to help deal with devastating floods in the northern part of the country. A total of 35 Greek emergency team members with special boats and water pumps arrived on Sunday (January 10th) in the region of the Vau Dejes dam, where the Drini River has flooded large areas. Slovenia sent emergency teams, while France and Austria sent equipment. Two helicopters arrived from Italy. Kosovo sent the second contingent of its Security Forces, in the first mission undertaken outside its borders. The hardest hit areas appear to be Shkodra and Lezha where well over 2,000 homes have been flooded and nearly 5,000 people have been evacuated. One man reportedly died in Lezha after struggling to remove a tree that was blocking a flooded road. The opposition Socialist Party accuses authorities of mishandling the situation in the face of torrential rains. 
Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Croatia and Serbia are also fighting floods. In many regions of Montenegro -- close to the border with Albania -- authorities have begun evacuations. Heavy rain and melting snow in the mountains have raised the levels of BiH's major rivers, flooding hundreds of houses. Rescue teams are trying to reach some of the affected regions. Heavy snow in Croatia was followed by flooding. An emergency situation was declared in the central district of Lika where about 100 homes had to be evacuated. The water levels of almost all rivers in Serbia are rising due to ten days of rain. (AFP - 11/01/10; Shekulli, Top Channel, Ora News, Alsat, Klan, RIA-Novosti, Makfax - 10/01/10)

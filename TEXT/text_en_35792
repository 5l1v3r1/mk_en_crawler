WASHINGTON, United States -- State Department deputy spokesman Adam Ereli announced Wednesday (31 March) that Secretary of State Colin Powell has blocked about $25m in US assistance to Serbia-Montenegro because of the country's failure to co-operate properly with the UN war crimes tribunal. Under US law, the secretary of state was required to certify before Congress by 31 March that Belgrade has done enough to merit US aid. Unaffected by the move would be humanitarian aid, funds used for the promotion of democracy, and assistance to Kosovo. Ereli says 16 war crimes suspects, including Bosnian wartime commander Ratko Mladic, are hiding in Serbia-Montenegro. (AFP, AP, Reuters, CNN, Bloomberg, BBC, B92, Beta, FoNet, Tanjug - 31/03/04)

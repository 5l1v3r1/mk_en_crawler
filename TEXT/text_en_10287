ZAGREB, Croatia -- The head of the OSCE Mission to Croatia, Ambassador Peter Semneby, submitted a report to the OSCE Permanent Council on Thursday (25 November). The HINA news agency quotes sources who say the report was largely positive and debate on it was constructive. They said Croatia has made marked progress in reforms over the past six months, but stressed further efforts are needed in the areas of refugee return, judiciary reform and minorities' rights. Assistant Foreign Minister for Multilateral Issues Tomislav Vidosevic described it as "certainly the best report on Croatia's progress yet". (HINA - 25/11/04)

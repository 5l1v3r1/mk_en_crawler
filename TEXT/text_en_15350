BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Parliament (EP) heard separately on Monday (November 27th) from the Bulgarian and Romanian candidates for the European Commission, Meglena Kuneva and Leonard Orban, respectively. The EP is determining if the two are suitable for the posts. During Monday's hearing, Kuneva, who was named EU Commissioner for Consumer Protection, vowed to improve communication with European consumers and organisations representing their interests, and to boost inter-institutional dialogue. Orban, who is EU Commissioner-designate for multilingualism, said that if elected, he would work to boost language learning in schools and for the protection of minority languages. The EP votes on the two nominations next month. (EU website, BNR, Darik, Rompres, Mediafax - 27/11/06)

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Alexander Downer, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's special adviser on Cyprus, held separate meetings Monday (January 10th) with Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu. Downer said after meeting with Christofias that the two sides have been making steady progress in efforts to reunify the divided island. "Our assessment in the UN is that they have been working hard and putting forward different proposals and ideas and building bridges between the two sides. This is quite encouraging." His meeting with Eroglu was a first since Eroglu underwent heart surgery last month, a development that has temporarily halted the negotiations process. Talks are scheduled to resume Wednesday.

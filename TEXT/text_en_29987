TIRANA, Albania -- A court overruled three decisions Monday (April 18th) by the Central Election Commission (CEC) related to ballots for the May 8th local elections. A panel of judges decided that listing the ruling Alliance for the Citizen and the Alliance for the Future must be alphabetical and needs changing. Another decision that stemmed from a complaint filed by the opposition Socialist Party involved including the names of parties participating in the election as coalitions. Individual opposition parties were ignored in the proposed ballot paper: only the name of their coalition was mentioned. The judges decided that party acronyms should appear next to each alliance's name. The third change involved the size of the ballot paper. (Top Channel, Balkan Web, Lajmifundit - 18/04/11)

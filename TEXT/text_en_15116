BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- During a meeting with Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica on Wednesday (31 August), Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic confirmed that he is resigning from his post. The defence ministry later issued a statement saying Davinic and Kostunica agreed that resignation is the most appropriate solution to the current situation within the ruling coalition in Belgrade. Earlier this month, Davinic's own party, G17 Plus, insisted he step down, citing dissatisfaction with the management of the defence budget. (B92 - 01/09/05; Tanjug - 31/08/05)

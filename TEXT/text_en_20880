ZAGREB, Croatia -- The EU warned Croatia on Wednesday (December 5th) that imposing a protected fishing zone -- in violation of an agreement with Italy and Slovenia -- would affect Croatia's chances of joining the Union. Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn reminded Croatian leaders that the 2004 agreement had been a condition for granting Croatia candidate status. He called the dispute "a very serious issue that â¦ would have negative ramifications on the EU accession negotiations" if not resolved. President Stipe Mesic acknowledged the country must honour its international commitments and promised that a solution would be found. (Reuters - 06/12/07)

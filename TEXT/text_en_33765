ATHENS, Greece -- The process of destruction of landmines on the Greek-Turkish border has not begun yet, but will start as soon as some technical problems are resolved, Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Panos Beglitis said on Thursday (27 November). He reiterated both countries' determination to begin clearing the mines from the border as soon as possible. In September in New York, Greece and Turkey ratified the Ottawa International Treaty on prohibiting the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of antipersonnel mines. (ANA - 27/11/03)

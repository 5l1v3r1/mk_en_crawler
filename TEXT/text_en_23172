TIRANA, Albania -- The country's Committee for Integration on Wednesday (October 1st) approved a programme for Albania's membership to NATO. "We have made some achievements, but the expectations are even higher," Prime Minister Sali Berisha said. Although the country has earmarked 2% of its GDP for defence, there is still work to be done to have a professional army by 2010, Berisha noted.

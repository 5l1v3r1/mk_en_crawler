ZAGREB, Croatia -- The cabinet approved a proposal Thursday (October 28th) to hold a legally binding referendum on EU accession within 30 days of the treaty being signed. That differs from the current legislation, under which the referendum should come before signing the treaty. Earlier this year, parliament adopted a constitutional amendment, which eased referendum regulations and lowered the required quorum for passage to 50% plus one of the actual votes, instead of all registered voters.
On a related note, Vesna Pusic, chair of the committee for monitoring negotiations with the EU, said on Thursday that three more chapters of Zagreb's EU talks will be closed on November 5th. This would leave ten remaining chapters. (Nacional, Index.hr - 28/10/10)

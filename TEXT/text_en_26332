PRISTINA, Kosovo -- NATO's new Secretary-General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said on Thursday (August 13th) that KFOR will withdraw from Kosovo only if the security situation allows it. "This decision ... is conditionally based", Rasmussen stressed during his first visit to Kosovo since taking office earlier this month. Recently, Rasmussen had said that KFOR could be reduced to a small reaction force or even completely withdrawn by the time his four-year term ends. At meetings with local political leaders, he described Kosovo as a "high priority" for NATO and said the Alliance will continue to assist local authorities in developing the Kosovo Security Force. President Fatmir Sejdiu told Rasmussen he hopes Kosovo troops can join the Alliance's peacekeeping operations abroad. During his stay, the NATO chief visited a KFOR command post near the ethnically divided town of Mitrovica. (AP, AFP, BBC, RTS, Tanjug, B92 - 13/08/09)

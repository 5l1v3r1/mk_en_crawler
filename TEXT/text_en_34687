ANKARA, Turkey -- Richard Lugar, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Turkish government Wednesday (20 August) to send peacekeeping troops to Iraq, arguing that this would help stabilise the country. "We think we have common interests in a stable and democratic Iraq. So we are hopeful of Turkey's participation," he said following a meeting with Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul in Ankara. Speaking to reporters before the meeting, Gul said that Ankara's decision would not be influenced by Tuesday's attack on the UN headquarters in Baghdad. Turkey announced, meanwhile, that it would be sending a 10-man rescue team and two dogs to help search for victims of the blast.

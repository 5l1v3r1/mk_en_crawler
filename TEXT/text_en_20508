BUCHAREST, Romania -- Legal experts in Romania are considering a possible challenge of Italy's decision to deport Romanian citizens considered "dangerous", Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu told a local TV station on Friday (November 9th). He added that representatives of the foreign, interior and justice ministries are working together to analyse the directive to determine whether he should send the European Commission a letter of protest. 
Meanwhile, Romanian human rights activists protested in Bucharest on Saturday against the "discrimination" and "charging" of Romas in Italy that followed the murder of an Italian woman allegedly by a Romanian national of Roma origin. (AFP - 10/11/07; Rompres - 09/11/07)

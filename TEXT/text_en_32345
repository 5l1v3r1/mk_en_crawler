PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Kosovo Serbs plan street demonstrations this week to protest the suggested transfer of some UNMIK powers to local Kosovo institutions. Rada Trajkovic, one of the key figures of the Kosovo Serb coalition Return, announced the protests late Saturday (29 March). The Serbs oppose the transfer of powers to local authorities because they view it as a step towards independence for the province. (Tanjug, B92, BBC - 30/03/03)

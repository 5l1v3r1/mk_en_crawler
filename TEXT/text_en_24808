NICOSIA, Cyprus/ATHENS, Greece/ANKARA, Turkey/ SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH)/ SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Demonstrations against Israel's military operation in Gaza occurred in several Balkan countries on Friday (January 2nd) and Saturday, media reported. A largely peaceful protest in Nicosia on Saturday turned violent when some protesters tried to break through a line of riot police blocking the road to the Israeli embassy. 
In Athens, protesters outside the Israeli embassy threw stones and petrol bombs at police late on Saturday. Riot police used tear gas and sound grenades to disperse them.
In Turkey, thousands rallied outside mosques across the country after Friday's prayers. Some burned Israeli and US flags and recited funeral prayers for the victims in Gaza. 
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey is working on a two-stage plan to put an end to the current tension in Gaza. Erdogan announced the plan at a press conference after a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Sharm el Sheikh late on Thursday. On Saturday, Erdogan flew to Saudi Arabia as part of Turkey's efforts to help negotiate a cease-fire.
Also Friday, Jewish and Muslim leaders in BiH made a joint appeal to the international community to use its influence to stop the bloodshed. 
Meanwhile Friday, several hundred Bulgarians rallied in the southern town of Madan to protest the Israeli air raids. (CNA, Famagusta Gazette, AP, ANA-MPA, In.news - 03/01/09, Anadolu news agency, Hurriyet, NTV, AFP, Sofia news agency, Nova TV - 02/01/09)

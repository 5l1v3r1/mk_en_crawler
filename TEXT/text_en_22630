SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak reiterated on Monday (April 7th) that the EU will not compromise on police reform being the most important condition for signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with BiH. He was responding to statements from officials in the main Bosniak party, the Party of Democratic Actions (SDA), who suggested the SAA could be signed without adopting police reform legislation. Lajcak stopped that cold. "This conditionality has been stated and restated, including in recent days," he said. Debate in parliament is scheduled to begin on Thursday.
Lajcak also criticised the SDA's calls for changes to the country's basic composition. He stressed that the constitution recognises two entities and three constituent peoples: Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs. (Nezavisne Novine, Dnevni Avaz - 08/04/08; RTRS, NTV Hayat, OHR website - 07/04/08)

NEW YORK, United States -- In her regular report to the UN Security Council on Wednesday (7 June), UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte requested that the Hague tribunal be given authority to arrest six war crimes suspects who remain at large. She said Ratko Mladic, Zdravko Tolimir, Goran Hadzic and Stojan Zupljanin are believed to be in Serbia, adding that information also links Serbia to the cases of Radovan Karadzic, whose whereabouts are not known, and Vlastimir Djordjevic, believed to hiding in Russia. 
Citing what she described as administrative and political resistance to co-operation in Serbia, she expressed doubts about the readiness of authorities to arrest Mladic, saying they have wasted valuable time attempting to obtain his voluntary surrender.
In other news, Serbian President Boris Tadic is attending Thursday's ceremonial raising of the Serbian flag in front of UN headquarters in New York. Afterwards he will meet with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, who will formally acknowledge the continuity of Serbia as a member of the UN upon the secession of Montenegro.

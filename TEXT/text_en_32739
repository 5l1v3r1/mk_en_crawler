ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament voted overwhelmingly Friday (13 December) to amend the constitution, enabling the leader of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to run in future elections and eventually become prime minister. Of the 461 MPs present in the 550-seat house, 440 voted in favour of the amendments. The opposition Republican People's Party backed the AKP in the vote. Erdogan had been banned from running in elections because of a 1999 conviction for inciting religious intolerance. Following Friday's amendments, only those convicted of terrorism would be ineligible for elected office. Erdogan is thus free to run in special elections in Siirt province, which will be held in February or March. (Turkish Daily News - 14/12/02; AP, AFP - 13/12/02)

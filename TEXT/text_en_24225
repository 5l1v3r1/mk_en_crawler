NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkey will not budge from its stance on Cyprus, Turkish Parliament Speaker Koksal Toptan said Friday (June 12th) "A step backward is out of the question," he said after talks with Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat in the Turkish-run part of the divided island.
Toptan pledged Turkey's support for the ongoing reunification process, but insisted on the need of "two separate communities, two separate sovereignties and two separate states". He called on the EU to fulfil its commitments to end the international isolation of Turkish Cypriots.
Talat, in turn, reiterated his community's hopes of reaching a settlement through negotiations, though he noted that any deal with the Greek Cypriot side would have to be approved by the Turkish parliament. (Zaman - 13/06/09; Anadolu news agency, Hurriyet, TRT - 12/06/09)

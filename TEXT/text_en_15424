BUCHAREST, Romania -- An independent expert report has identified Codlea farms in the central county of Brasov as the source of the latest wave of avian influenza outbreaks. The document was discussed at Friday's (26 May) session of the government's panel on bird flu. According to the report, investigators traced the original virus to wild fowl, but said it spread to local poultry farms because bio-security norms were not observed. Complicating the matter was illegal trading of poultry products on the domestic market. 
In neighbouring Bulgaria, authorities announced on Friday that some 900 chickens without a veterinary certificate were culled in the region of Ruse, near the border with Romania. The owner, a local villager, was unable to explain the origin of the fowl. (Romanian Government Web site, Rompres - 26/05/06)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu on Tuesday (November 27th) invited parliamentary parties and representatives of ethnic minorities to meet on Thursday to discuss the majority-voting system, following a failed voter referendum on the issue Sunday. The National Liberal Party (PNL), the Social Democratic Party (PSD), the Greater Romania Party and the Conservative Party have all declined the invitation. The Liberal Democratic Party (PLD) says it will attend, however, as will the Democratic Party (PD) and the Hungarian Democratic Union in Romania.
Final results of the election for seats in the European Parliament, also held on Sunday, suggest the opposition PD, which backs Basescu, won 28.81% of the vote. The Social Democrats received 23.11%, while Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu's ruling PNL was third with 13.44%. (Nine o'clock - 28/11/07; AFP - 27/11/07)

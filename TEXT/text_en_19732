LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Miroslav Lajcak said on Saturday (December 22nd) that Kosovo's status is not directly connected with BiH. "Of course everything is connected in the region and Kosovo is sending a strong signal which will echo," Lajcak told Slovenian newspaper Vjesti. "BiH has problems of its own and they are in the hands of its leaders. Connecting them with the Kosovo status issue is only an alibi of those who have no will for a solution," Lajcak said.

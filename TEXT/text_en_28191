ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's remarks regarding a change in the nation's presidential system has prompted new debate about the aftermath of the 2011 general elections. Speaking to a group of journalists Sunday (April 18th), Erdogan said the country might discuss a US-style presidential system if next year's election results warrant it. Commenting on Erdogan's statement Monday, Parliament Speaker Mehmet Ali Sahin said it would be up to lawmakers to decide. Members of the main opposition Republican Peoples' Party (CHP) say the topic is only a distraction from the country's real problems, such as unemployment and proposed constitutional amendments CHP opposes.

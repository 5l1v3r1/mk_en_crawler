BUCHAREST, Romania -- Patriarch Teoctist, the head of the Orthodox Church in Romania, died of "heart complications" on Monday (July 30th) after undergoing prostate surgery. According to doctors, the surgery was successful, but the 92-year-old patriarch suffered complications due to his age. 
Teoctist was appointed head of the Romanian Orthodox Church in 1986. He briefly stepped down amid allegations that he collaborated with the regime of former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Ten years later, Teoctist won the public's praise for inviting the late Pope John Paul II to Romania -- the first visit of a Catholic pope to an Orthodox country since the two churches split in the Great Schism of 1054.

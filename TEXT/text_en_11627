THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A former Bosnian Croat member of a paramilitary unit pleaded guilty at the UN tribunal on Tuesday (19 July) as part of a deal with prosecutors, who dropped some charges against him. Miroslav Bralo, 37, confessed to rape, torture, murder and using prisoners as human shields to protect Bosnian Croat soldiers from sniper fire. Prosecutors reduced the charges against him from 21 to eight. Sentencing is expected in the autumn.
Also Tuesday, the tribunal approved separate requests for the provisional release of three Bosnian Serb indictees -- Mico Stanisic, Radivoje Miletic and Milan Gvero. They will await the start of their trials in Bosnia and Herzegovina. (AP, ICTY Web site, RTRS, Tanjug, HRT - 19/07/05)

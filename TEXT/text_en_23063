THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal is expected to announce a verdict Thursday (April 3rd) in the trial of former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj. The former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) commander is accused of involvement in the murder, rape and torture of Serbs and suspected ethnic Albanian collaborators between 1998 and 1999. He is being tried with two other former KLA fighters, Idriz Balaj and Lahi Brahimaj. Prosecutors are seeking 25-year prison sentences for each of them. All three have pleaded not guilty.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Events in the Balkans will remain the main challenge facing European stability in 2010, according to a report given by US National Intelligence Director Dennis Blair to the US Senate, according to the newspaper Koha Ditore on Friday (February 5th). The fragile interethnic community in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the issue of Serbs in northern Kosovo require Western, diplomatic and security involvement, Blair said. He also predicted that Pristina would remain dependent on the international community for economic assistance, diplomatic and potentially security support as it further consolidates statehood.

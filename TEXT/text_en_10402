BUCHAREST, Romania -- The World Bank board has endorsed a $150m loan for structural reforms in Romania, according a statement released Friday (17 September) by the Romanian Finance Ministry. The credit, approved by the Bank the previous day, is part of the multi-annual Programmatic Adjustment Loan, which in turn is synchronised with Romania's EU accession progress and with the country's precautionary stand-by arrangement with the IMF.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The ruling National Liberal Party's (PNL) leadership nominated party Vice-President Norica Nicolai as justice minister on Monday (December 17th). The position has been vacant since Tudor Chiuariu resigned last week amid pressure from President Traian Basescu. Chiuariu says he is the victim of a "ridiculous frame-up" by Basescu, who had officially urged Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu to dismiss both Chiuariu and Labour Minister Paul Pacuraru. Basescu said they had tarnished the government's image in light of criminal investigations against them. (Nine o'clock - 18/12/07; Rompres, Mediafax, AFP - 17/12/07)

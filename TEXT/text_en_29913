BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, said on Tuesday (April 19th) that the June target date for completing Croatia's accession talks is an ambitious but achievable goal, providing the country meets remaining benchmarks. He was speaking after an intergovernmental conference in Brussels during which Zagreb closed two more negotiation chapters -- on agriculture and rural development and regional policy. Croatia thus closed 30 of 35 chapters. EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele says the European Commission does not plan to introduce a co-operation and verification monitoring mechanism for Croatia, as it did for Bulgaria and Romania.
In Zagreb, Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor reiterated hopes that the country will wrap up accession talks in June. The two most problematic chapters are still subject to negotiation. (HRT, Hina - 19/04/11)

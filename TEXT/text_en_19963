ROME, Italy -- Authorities have ordered 117 Romanian nationals to leave the country, local media reported on Sunday (November 18th). Officials say the expats have criminal records and are believed to pose a threat to Italy's security. Several dozen Romanians have already been deported, while others awaiting flights back are in detention camps. The Italian government adopted a decree two weeks ago to allow the removal of EU nationals who pose a threat to national security. The move followed the murder of an Italian woman, allegedly by a Romanian Gypsy. (AFP, Reuters - 17/11/07)

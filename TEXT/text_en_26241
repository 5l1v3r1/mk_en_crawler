BUCHAREST, Romania -- Incumbent Traian Basescu cemented his victory in the second round of the presidential elections after a recount of ballots initially deemed invalid, local media reported on Sunday (December 13th). The Constitutional Court ordered the recount on Friday, following a request by Basescu's opponent in the runoff, Mircea Geoana. The difference between the two candidates was less than 1%. Basescu got 50.33% of the vote, edging out Geoana's 49.66%. Of the 137,000 initially invalid votes recounted, more than 2,130 were declared valid. A total of 1,169 of them favoured Basescu, while the remaining 968 were for Geoana. According to the Central Election Commission, 1,000 votes cast abroad remain to be counted, but they are not expected to affect the outcome. (Romania Libera, Gandul, Jurnalul National - 14/12/09)

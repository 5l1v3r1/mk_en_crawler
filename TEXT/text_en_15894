SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska's (RS) four members in the BiH government insisted on Sunday (21 May) on the formation of a commission to investigate the truth about Sarajevo Serbs still missing from the war. A joint statement by BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic, Justice Minister Slobodan Kovac, Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic and Transport Minister Branko Dokic criticised BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic, who suggested late last week that he would not take any initiative to establish such a panel. They also implied that the issue might affect the functioning of the government. (Nezavisne novine - 22/05/06; PBS BiH - 21/05/06; RTRS - 20/05/06)

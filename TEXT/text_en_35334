BUCHAREST, Romania -- The country's top judicial body, the Supreme Council of Magistrates, decided on Wednesday (16 June) to retire Paul Florea from his post as chairman of the High Court of Cassation and Justice on the very day Florea turned 70, the legal age for retirement. According to local press reports, Florea's retirement was eagerly awaited by the government, which viewed him as an "opposition" magistrate. He was appointed by former President Emil Constantinescu.

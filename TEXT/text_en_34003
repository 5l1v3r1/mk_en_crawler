BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU's annual report on candidate countries will point to weaknesses in Turkey's efforts to meet membership criteria, the AFP reported on Friday (31 October). The report is to be published Wednesday, but copies have been leaked to the media. The European Commission reportedly has found that Turkey still does not meet all the political criteria and complains about the armed forces' continuing influence the government. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan reacted angrily and accused the EU of using "poor excuses" for not starting accession talks. Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, on the other hand, concurred with the findings and said his government was working to address remaining issues.
In other news, Gul met with his Ukrainian counterpart, Konstantin Grishchenko, on Saturday and discussed possible co-operation in the post-war reconstruction of Iraq. They also discussed security issues and Ukraine's NATO aspirations. (AFP, Anadolu Agency - 01/11/03; AFP - 31/10/03)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A spokesman for the European Commission (EC) in BiH, Frane Maroevic, confirmed on Sunday (22 January) that technical talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) would begin Wednesday, as scheduled. That indicates that the EU team monitoring the pace reforms has determined BiH has made enough progress to launch negotiations. 
Also Sunday, the Republika Srpska legislature announced plans to debate the opposition's initiative for a no-confidence motion against the government this week. Parliament Speaker Dusan Stojicic says debate would likely begin on Wednesday or Thursday. The main opposition Union of Independent Social Democrats says it has the votes to remove the ruling Serb Democratic Party government. (Nezavisne novine - 23/01/06; PBS BiH, RTRS - 22/01/06)

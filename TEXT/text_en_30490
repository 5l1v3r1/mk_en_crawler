BUCHAREST, Romania -- The opposition will file two no-confidence motions, one over the 2011 wage bill and the other over the single wage law, Victor Ponta, leader of the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD), announced on Wednesday (December 15th). Discussions over the texts of the no-confidence motions are under way via meetings among opposition parties and trade unions' representatives. Prime Minister Emil Boc asked parliament on Tuesday to initiate the accountability procedure on the single wage law for faster adoption, giving the opposition an opportunity to file their no-confidence motion. 
In other news Wednesday, the Constitutional Court ruled that the pension law is constitutional, thus rejecting an appeal submitted by the opposition National Liberal Party (PNL) on December 8th. The party had argued that contribution periods for men and women were discriminatory due to the different retirement ages -- 65 years for men and 63 for women. The main opposition party, the PSD, submitted a similar appeal, but challenged it on procedural grounds as well. A ruling on that is expected soon. Passage of the pension law is among the conditions Romania must meet to receive hundreds of millions of euros from the IMF and World Bank.

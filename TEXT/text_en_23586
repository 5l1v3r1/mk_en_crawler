SOFIA, Bulgaria -- In an interview with Reuters on Monday (March 23rd), Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev said his Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) must win the parliamentary elections this summer to prevent the opposition Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) party from fulfilling its "dangerous economic plans". In a time of crisis, he said, "the first rule is not to act stupid". Polls show GERB is currently the most popular party. Stanishev said if the BSP wins, he would serve another term as prime minister. (Novinar - 24/03/09; Reuters, BNT, Standart, Mediapool - 23/03/09)

WASHINGTON, United States -- Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns called again on Monday (27 June) for Belgrade to fulfil obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal, according to a statement cited by the Serbian media. Burns said he also urged both Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica to authorise an official condemnation of the Srebrenica massacre ahead of its of 10th anniversary commemoration on 11 July. Burns emphasised that Belgrade should ensure that wartime Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic is extradited to The Hague before then.
In other news Monday, the Bosnian Serb Interior Ministry announced that police have arrested 11 war crimes suspects in the eastern Podrinje region. The suspects reportedly were sought by local courts rather than the UN tribunal. (B92, Blic, Beta, Reuters - 27/06/05)

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Prime Minister Janez Jansa has said Croatia's EU prospects are helping to ease bilateral relations. Zagreb media reports on Tuesday (5 April) quoted an interview Jansa gave to Slovenian TV the previous evening, in which he noted that communication between the governments in Ljubljana and Zagreb has improved lately. As for open issues, such as the border dispute, Jansa said these were too complicated to be resolved overnight. (Vecernji list, HINA - 05/04/05)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Authorities plan to tighten security measures for key government officials after a failed attack on the president's office, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said Friday (May 22nd). "The incident showed that we have to look at security procedures more seriously," Dacic said in an interview with B92 TV. On Thursday, a man carrying two hand grenades threatened to blow himself up at the presidency building. After hours of negotiations, police managed to disarm and detain Dragan Maric, 57, who explained he was protesting a court ruling involving his own company and the national air carrier JAT. He said he had warned of his plans in emails sent to a number of Serbian and European institutions and media. 
In other news, prosecutors filed charges against Damir Dokic, father of tennis player Jelena Dokic, for threatening to blow up the car of Australian Ambassador to Belgrade Clair Birgin if she did not prevent negative articles about him from appearing in the Australian media. According to media reports Friday (May 22nd), Dokic was charged with endangering Birgin's security and unlawful possession of weapons. His daughter Jelena told an Australian daily that her father had physically abused her. Dokic was arrested on May 6th. Police found rifles without proper licences and hand grenades during a search of his house in northern Serbia. (Beta, B92, AFP, Glas Srbije, Reuters - 22/05/09)

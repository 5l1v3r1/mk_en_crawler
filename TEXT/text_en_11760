LUXEMBOURG -- EU defence ministers on Friday (18 March) discussed possible troop reductions in EUFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Luxembourg Defence Minister Luc Frieden, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, said that a formal decision has not been adopted. However, he confirmed that the priority is to strengthen the local police and gradually bring down the number of foreign troops. A review of the operation will take place in May. EU security policy chief Javier Solana, meanwhile, said EUFOR would not be reduced below 5,000 soldiers. The Union currently has about 6,300 soldiers in BiH. (Reuters, AFP - 18/03/05)

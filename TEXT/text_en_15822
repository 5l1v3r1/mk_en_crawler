SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Forensic experts announced on Thursday (17 August) that they completed excavation work on the largest mass grave from BiH's 1992-1995 conflict, in the village of Kamenica near Zvornik in eastern Bosnia. They exhumed 1,153 skeletons -- 144 full and 1,009 partial. They explained that this was a secondary grave, to which bodies were moved in order to cover up the crime. The experts have also found 14 personal documents, which confirmed the victims were Muslims from Srebrenica. In July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces murdered some 8,000 men and boys in the UN-protected enclave. They were buried in more than 60 mass graves around the town.

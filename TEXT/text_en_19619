DUBROVNIK, Croatia -- The EU will extend 3.5 billion euros in pre-accession assistance to Southeast European countries by 2011, Enlargement Directorate General official Jan Truszczynski said on Thursday (November 22nd). Truszczynski, who addressed the fourth meeting of the Regional Economic Forum for Southeast Europe in the Croatian town of Dubrovnik, said the funds would be used to support regional co-operation and reform processes. "The European Commission is here to encourage the region to stay on the path of integration," he said, while stressing that he cannot guarantee the accession of SEE hopefuls would be accelerated. The forum brought together about 160 heads of state, business leaders and scientists from eight SEE countries to discuss economic co-operation and the standards for membership in the EU.

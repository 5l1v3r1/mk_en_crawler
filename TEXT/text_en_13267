SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Eight cities and towns are preparing to elect new mayors on Saturday (29 October), including Sofia, Razgrad, Devnia, Mizia, Panagyurishte, Ruse, Peshtera and Sevlievo. In all of them, the incumbents stepped down from their seats after being elected to parliament. The race is expected to be very tight in Sofia. Polls show only narrow margins among the four main candidates: the ruling party's Tatyana Doncheva, former Interior Ministry Chief Secretary Boyko Borisov, former Finance Minister Milen Velchev and former Central Bank Governor Svetoslav Gavriyski. A possible run-off would be held on 5 November.
In other news, Fernando Ponz, head of the political affairs section at the EC delegation in Bulgaria, is urging the government to implement current laws, rather than draft new ones regarding organised crime. His comment Thursday was in response to the latest apparent contract killing -- that of banker Emil Kyulev in Sofia earlier this week.

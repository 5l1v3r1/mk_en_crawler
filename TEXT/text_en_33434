BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government announced on Thursday (1 May) that it plans to reopen its embassy in Iraq as soon as possible. Senior diplomat Radu Onofrei has been dispatched to Baghdad to assess the condition of the building and talk with US officials. He will also negotiate the participation of Romanian firms in the post-war reconstruction of Iraq. The embassy was closed on 20 March, just days before the start of the conflict. Turkish diplomats are also reportedly returning, hoping to reopen their embassy within a week.
In other news, Romania's Foreign Ministry says that the government expects to sign a partnership agreement with Russia when Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov visits Bucharest next week. The countries have discussed the document for nearly ten years. (Act Media, AFP - 02/05/03; AFP, Anadolu Agency - 01/05/03)

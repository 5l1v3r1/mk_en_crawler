ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ali Babacan said on Tuesday (February 19th) that Turkey would not rule out deploying ground troops in northern Iraq to strike terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) camps. Babacan criticised the Kurdish leadership in Iraq for failing to contain the group. He called on Massoud Barzani, head of the Kurdish administration in northern Iraq, to declare the PKK a terrorist organisation and to take more concrete steps to end its presence in the region.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The country's current ambassador to Washington, Zoran Jolevski, has been named Macedonia's new representative in the name talks with Greece, government spokesperson Shefik Duraki announced on Sunday (November 30th). Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski informed President Branko Crvenkovski of the decision in a telephone conversation Saturday. It was Crvenkovski who insisted on removing envoy Nikola Dimitrov to stop some of the squabbling between Crvenkovski and Gruevski. Both Dimitrov and Martin Protoger, chief of Gruevski's cabinet, will remain on the negotiating team at Jolevski's insistence. Macedonia will formally inform the UN envoy in the talks, Matthew Nimetz, of Jolevski's nomination Monday. (Makfax, Dnevnik - 01/12/08; MIA, A1 - 30/11/08)

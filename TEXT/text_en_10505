BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Hungarian President Ferenc Madl expressed confidence Tuesday (14 September) that Belgrade would put an end to ethnic tensions in Vojvodina. After talks with Serbia-Montenegro counterpart Svetozar Marovic and Serbian President Boris Tadic, Madl said he did not believe Belgrade was responsible for the reported attacks on ethnic Hungarians in Vojvodina. He added that Vojvodina should be an example of the highest EU standards with regard to minority rights and interethnic relations. 
In other news Tuesday, the Montenegrin NGO Napredak said it has launched the republic's first classes in Croatian language, culture, history and geography. About 40 children of ethnic Croats in Boka Kotorska will attend the unofficial courses. (B92, Tanjug, AP, HINA - 14/09/04)

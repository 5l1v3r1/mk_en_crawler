THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The lawyer representing retired Croatian General Ante Gotovina submitted a series of guarantees Tuesday (August 7th) to The Hague war crimes tribunal regarding Gotovina's provisional release until trial. The guarantees came from the Croatian government, Zadar's Archbishop Ivan Prenda, as well as from Gotovina himself. Attorney Luka Misetic said the court indicated it might permit house arrest but insisted that some form of electronic surveillance be installed. Gotovina and fellow generals Mladen Markac and Ivan Cermak are indicted for their alleged roles in war crimes during 1995's Operation Storm. 
In other news, Bavarian Minister-President Edmund Stoiber announced on Tuesday that he plans a three-day visit to Croatia next week. He is retiring as Bavaria's governor after 14 years and has been prominent in German politics. (Vecernji List - 08/08/07; Javno.hr, HINA - 07/08/07)

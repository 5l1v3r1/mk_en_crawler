SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska's (RS) deputies will return to the BiH Parliament and resume work this week, after weeks of boycott. The announcement followed a meeting Friday (16 June) between High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling and leaders of the BiH House of Representatives. Deputies representing RS stopped attending sessions to protest the refusal of the BiH government to appoint a special commission to investigate the truth about Sarajevo Serbs still missing from the 1990s conflict. Now that a panel has been formed, Bosnian Serb members are expected to return to work. Schwarz-Schilling has suggested those who blocked parliament's work should be sanctioned.

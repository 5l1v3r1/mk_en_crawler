BELGRADE, Serbia -- Damir Dokic, the father of Serbian-born Australian tennis player Jelena Dokic, was sentenced Thursday (June 11th) to 15 months in prison. He was convicted of threatening the security of Australia's ambassador to Belgrade and illegal weapons possession. Dokic was arrested in his home in western Serbia on May 6th, after he called the Australian Embassy and threatened to blow up the ambassador's car with a rocket launcher. The incident was spurred by an interview Jelena had given to Australia's Sport and Style magazine, in which she claimed her father had physically abused her. Police who raided his house found seven hunting rifles, a pistol and two hand grenades. (Blic, Pink, Vecernje Novosti, B92, RTS, Mondo, 24 Saat, Dnevni Avaz - 11/06/09)

VIENNA, Austria -- A court ruling Tuesday (October 23rd) clears the way for Austria to extradite former Croatian Deputy Defence Minister Vladimir Zagorec to Zagreb. Vienna's high provincial court upheld a lower court's ruling and ordered his deportation to Croatia where Zagorec would get an opportunity to prove his innocence. A close aide of former Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, Zagorec is charged with stealing 5m euros in government funds and with abuse of office. He is also suspected of pocketing a number of diamonds that were to be used to guarantee an illegal arms deal during the 1992-1995 conflict.

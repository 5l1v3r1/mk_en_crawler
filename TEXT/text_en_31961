SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A protest by Macedonian high school students turned violent Wednesday (23 October) as teenagers rampaged stores and attacked ethnic Albanians in the streets. At least four people were injured and several were arrested. Organisers say some 15,000 teenagers took to the streets in the capital and several other towns to protest Saturday's drive-by murder of Vanco Josifivski, an 18-year-old Macedonian from Tetovo. No arrests have been made in connection with the incident, which injured two other Macedonians. A police spokesman said the assailants were ethnic Albanians, probably from the village of Poroi near Tetovo. NATO, OSCE and EU officials condemned the murder but urged the population to refrain from violence. (AP, AFP, MIA, Makfax, B92 - 23/10/02)

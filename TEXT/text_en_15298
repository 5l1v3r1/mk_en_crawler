BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) on Wednesday (November 29th) officially announced its recommendations concerning Turkey's EU negotiations, one week earlier than expected. Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said closing negotiations in 8 of 35 chapters will be conditioned on Turkey's opening its ports to Cyprus, as required under a customs union arrangement. The chapters in question are: free movement of goods; right of establishment and freedom to provide services; financial services; agriculture and rural development; fisheries; transport policy; customs union and external relations. Negotiations will not be suspended, but the process will be slowed down. The announcement follows the collapse of a Finnish initative aimed at overcoming the deadlock over Cyprus.
In his first reaction, Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan described the EC decision as unacceptable to Ankara. (EU observer, AFP, Focus, Reuters)

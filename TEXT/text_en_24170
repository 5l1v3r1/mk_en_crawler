TIRANA, Albania -- Citing a procedural violation, a court Monday (December 15th) rejected charges of corruption and abuse of power against Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha, stemming from the tender procedure for construction of a section of the Durres-Kukes Highway in 2006 when he was transport and communications minister. The court ruled that Basha had the legal right to avoid a court appearance on November 24th and, as a result, he is no longer considered a defendant.
In other news Monday, parliament postponed voting on a law dubbed "clean profile for officials", which targets former aides of the secret services during the communist regime. At the session, Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli agreed to allow discussion on several proposed amendments to the bill. Prime Minister Sali Berisha says the measure is a process all democratic countries must undergo.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Agriculture Minister Mehmed Dikme and his Turkish counterpart, Sami Guclu, agreed Tuesday (20 May) to sign a protocol for co-operation in science and agriculture. It stipulates joint projects and initiatives to improve veterinary and phyto-sanitary control in agriculture. The document also stipulates joint efforts to achieve EU standards in agriculture as part of the countries' efforts at EU integration.
Also Tuesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul and his Pakistani counterpart, Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri, met in Islamabad, where they agreed to step up bilateral co-operation. They discussed a series of issues, including reconstruction of post-war Iraq.
That rebuilding effort was also discussed Tuesday in Tehran, where Tonino Picula became the first Croatian foreign minister to visit in eight years. He also signed an accord with Iran aimed at avoiding double taxation. (BTA, Anadolu Agency, AFP, HINA - 20/05/03)

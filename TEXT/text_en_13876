THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Florence Hartmann, spokeswoman for UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte, reiterated on Wednesday (18 January) that fugitive Ratko Mladic is in Serbia. At a news conference in The Hague, Hartmann announced that del Ponte would meet in Brussels on Thursday with EU security chief Javier Solana and NATO representatives to discuss Serbia's co-operation with the tribunal. Several leading politicians in Belgrade have warned recently that Serbia-Montenegro's Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with the EU might be affected by insufficient war crimes co-operation.
In other news, Hague prosecutor Mark Harmon said Wednesday that Milan Lukic's transfer to The Hague could be expected in February. The former Bosnian Serb paramilitary commander awaits extradition from Argentina, where he was arrested in August.
Also Wednesday, Russia announced that it is guaranteeing the provisional release of Slobodan Milosevic from The Hague tribunal, so he can seek medical treatment in Moscow. An official says Russia is guaranteeing Milosevic's personal security as well as his return to The Hague within terms set by the tribunal. The court must review the request.

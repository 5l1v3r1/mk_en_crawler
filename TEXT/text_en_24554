ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian authorities denied on Friday (March 6th) that they had documents on 1995's Operation Storm that the Hague war crimes tribunal (ICTY) was seeking. "The 23 requested documents exist, but they are not now in the possession of the Croatian authorities," Justice Minister Ivan Simonovic said. ICTY's prosecutors argue the missing documents are essential to the war crimes trial of three Croatian generals. They reportedly detail the use of artillery by Croatian forces during their effort to regain control of the Krajina region. (HINA, AFP - 06/03/09)

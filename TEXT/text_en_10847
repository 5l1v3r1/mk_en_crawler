BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign policy chief Chris Patten said Thursday (2 September) that he is not satisfied with the situation involving the state union of Serbia-Montenegro. His statement came in response to rising pressure within Montenegro to walk away from the union -- a move the republic has been considering ever since the federation agreement was signed. Patten, who played a key role in mediating the agreement, said faltering integration within the union is hurting the EU aspirations of both republics, particularly Serbia. The EU Council of Ministers is to discuss the situation Saturday. (B92, Tanjug - 02/09/04)

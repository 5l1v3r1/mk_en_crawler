ANKARA, Turkey -- The ruling Justice and Development Party's (AKP) acting group chairman Nihat Ergun said on Monday (March 24th) that a new set of regulations is needed to make banning political parties more difficult. Proposals are being drafted, he said, and a constitutional amendment may be ready for lawmakers to discuss later this week. Work in parliament may soon grind to a halt, he said, noting that out that of the four parties currently represented there, three face efforts to ban them: his own AKP, the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party, and the Nationalist Movement Party. "It has become imperative to redesign laws regarding party closures," Ergun said. (Zaman - 25/03/08; AP, Reuters, Hurriyet - 24/03/08)

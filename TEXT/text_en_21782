ANKARA, Turkey -- Energy Minister Hilmi Guler told a press conference on Monday (August 18th) that Turkey and Iran are expected to complete planned energy deals within a month. Originally, observers had expected the signing of agreements during last week's visit by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Guler says technical work on the agreements is under way, with an eye to finalising them before he and Foreign Minister Ali Babacan visit Iran next month. (Turkish Press, Zaman, UPI, AP - 18/08/08)

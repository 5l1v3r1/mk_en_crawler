BELGRADE, Serbia -- Belgrade's Special Court sentenced on Tuesday (September 8th) four Wahhabis to a total of 27 years in prison for planning terrorist attacks. Adis Muric and Bajram Aslani were sentenced to eight years each, Nedzad Bulic -- to seven, and Enes Mujanovic -- to four years. They were accused of criminal association aimed at perpetrating unconstitutional activities and acts of terrorism. The four Muslims allegedly plotted terrorist attacks in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia. According to the indictment, one of the planned attacks was against a football stadium in the Serbian town of Novi Pazar. Bulic and Aslani were sentenced in absentia, as they earlier escaped from police and are on the run. (Beta, Tanjug, Fonet, B92, RTS, DPA, Reuters, AP - 08/09/09)

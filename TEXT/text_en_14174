BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Federal Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic says he has been assured that Russia would insist -- both as a member of the UN Security Council and the Contact Group for Kosovo -- on the implementation of internationally set standards in Kosovo. Draskovic said on Wednesday (14 September) that he was assured of Moscow's stance during discussions Tuesday with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov at UN headquarters in New York. Draskovic says Lavrov particularly stressed the importance of fulfilling standards related to the protection of minority rights, freedom of movement and guarantees for Serb returnees in the province.

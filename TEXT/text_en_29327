TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition Socialist Party (SP) lawmaker Vangjel Tavo announced on Sunday (October 3rd) that he is leaving the party, citing "lack of democracy". He says thousands of other socialist supporters are disappointed and feel they are not part of the political organisation due to the lack of transparency in decision-making, organising structure and internal democracy. Tavo did not reveal whether he will join another political party or work as an independent member of parliament. The SP numbers in the 140-seated parliament have now dropped to 65. 
In other news, an inmate from the Lezha Prison escaped on Sunday, causing a series of arrests among the police service and the dismissal of prison Director Mark Lleshi.

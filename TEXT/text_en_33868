SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Krug 99, an association of intellectuals, met on Sunday (16 November) and discussed legislative changes at the entity and state levels in BiH. The organisation pushed for significant constitutional amendments, saying the current version hampers the country's administrative, political, and economic development.
In other news, residents of Mostar's District North held a referendum Saturday hoping to retain independence. More than 98 per cent voted in favour of independence. The Croat communities in the Muslim-dominated region did not participate.
On Sunday, meanwhile, the Association of Former Camp Inmates in Republika Srpska said the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague would start investigating alleged collaborators of former Bosnian wartime leader Alija Izetbegovic, who died last month. The association says the death would put Izetbegovic's collaborators "in a position to answer to The Hague tribunal". (BHTV 1, HINA, SRNA, BBC - 16/11/03; Croat Radio Herceg-Bosna - 15/11/03)

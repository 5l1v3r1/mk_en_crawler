PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UN forensic experts are excavating graves in an abandoned Serb Orthodox cemetery near Pristina, looking for the remains of about 50 Serbs who went missing in the area in the summer of 1999. Jose-Pablo Baraybar, the UN official in charge of the operation, told reporters that most of the victims were probably killed in revenge attacks on the streets of the Kosovo capital. Their bodies likely had first been taken to a morgue and then to the cemetery. About 500 Serbs and 2,400 ethnic Albanians remain missing since the 1999 conflict. (Reuters, Tanjug - 24/08/05)

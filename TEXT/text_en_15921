MAVROVO, Macedonia -- The country's main political parties agreed that they must continue dialogue to overcome disputes between the ruling and opposition blocs and to ensure reforms, following a weekend meeting of party leaders in Mavrovo. At the forum, Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski sought support for the government's reform agenda and strategy for Euro-Atlantic integration. 
Media reports noted that the leaders of the two main ethnic Albanian formations, the opposition Democratic Union for Integration and the junior government partner Democratic Party of Albanians, sent deputies rather than attend. (Vecer - 20/11/06; A1 TV, Makfax - 19/11/06)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Croatia will close two more chapters in its EU accession talks Tuesday (April 19th) when a delegation finalises negotiations on agriculture and rural development and regional policy at an intergovernmental conference in Brussels. Zagreb will thus have closed 30 of 35 chapters. Talks on fisheries and other issues will be completed soon as details on those have already been agreed. The government still hopes to finalise negotiations and sign the accession treaty by the end of June. (HRT, Nova TV - 19/04/11)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen described plans on Tuesday (19 July) to establish new ministries of justice and public order in the province by year's end. According to a UNMIK press release, the ministries will be launched as part of the process of transferring police and judicial responsibilities to the Kosovo interim institutions. The UN administration would monitor the performance of the future bodies. Once they register satisfactory progress in dealing with the new responsibilities, the ministries would be given more powers. UNMIK would retain its right to intervene and to seal international agreements in the police and judicial sectors. (Scotsman - 20/07/05; KosovaLive, Beta, Tanjug - 19/07/05)

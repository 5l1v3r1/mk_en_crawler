COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- A court in Copenhagen decided on Friday (May 6th) to implement a 1995 decision to expel Bosnian war criminal Refik Saric. Saric, who fled to Denmark with his family in January 1994, was sentenced by Denmark's Supreme Court in 1995 to eight years in jail for beating prisoners of war in Croatia's Dretelj prison camp in 1993. He was released in 1999, but stayed in Denmark for security reasons, arguing he may face torture and inhumane treatment should he return to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). The court decided on Friday that these concerns no longer exist. Saric can appeal Friday's ruling at the Supreme Court. (Vijesti.ba, Beta, B92, Nezavisne Novine, SRNA - 06/05/11)

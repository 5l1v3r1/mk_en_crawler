ZAGREB, Croatia -- Before heading off to summer recess, the government approved a draft law on the protection of witnesses Wednesday (30 July). According to a press release, the bill calls for round-the-clock police protection of witnesses, as well as for providing some witnesses with new identities. The cabinet believes passage of the law would help in the prosecution of war crimes. (MIA - 31/07/03; HINA - 30/07/03)

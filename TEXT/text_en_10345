NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council on Friday (22 October) approved a plan for the re-organisation of the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) proposed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan last month. According to the document, the mandate of the UN mission in Cyprus -- initially set to expire on 15 December -- would be extended to June 2005, but UNFICYP would be downsized by one third, to 860 troops. 
In other news, British Minister for Europe Denis MacShane visited Nicosia Friday and urged Cypriot political leaders to step up efforts to reunite the island. Referring to the Greek Cypriots' rejection of a UN-sponsored proposal during a referendum earlier this year, MacShane said that he respected the Greek Cypriot voters' views but that there was no alternative to the UN plan.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic refused to respond Tuesday (October 28th) to his updated indictment during a trial conference at The Hague war crimes tribunal. Judge Ian Bonomy gave him two more weeks. During his brief appearance before the court, Karadzic argued proceedings were moving too fast. "I am not prepared for this hearing," Karadzic said, explaining that he had received the Serbian translation of the amended indictment only on Monday. He also complained that he still has no team of legal advisers. Prosecutors changed their indictment of Karadzic in September in a bid, they say, to make the proceedings more efficient. The next pre-trial conference is scheduled for January 20th. (Beta, Reuters, Blic, RTRS, Makfax, DPA, AFP - 28/10/08)

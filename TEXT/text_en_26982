ANKARA, Turkey -- Police arrested around 20 students in the northeast city Trabzon on Wednesday (November 4th) for throwing eggs at the Israeli ambassador, to protest Israel's offensive in the Gaza Strip. Protestors had gathered outside a university that Ambassador Gabby Levy was visiting. They met him at the exit, local media reported, chanting angry slogans. Last month, the Gaza offensive prompted Turkey to postpone military exercises in which Israel planned to participate. (Reuters, Anadolu news agency, Hurriyet - 04/11/09)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn announced on Tuesday (March 31st) that he will present a feasibility study report this autumn outlining how to assist Kosovo's efforts to become an EU member. In response to questions from members of the European Parliament's Foreign Policy Committee, he pledged to seek a way for Kosovo to have contractual relations with the EU for visa liberalisation in the future but admitted this will not be easy. Rehn also insisted that Kosovo should receive assistance, though not all European countries have recognised its independence.
EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon was also in Brussels Tuesday to report on the first 100 days of the EU police and judicial missions in Kosovo. He said EULEX has assumed all of UNMIK's responsibilities regarding the rule of law. He added, though, he is not fully satisfied with the state of the courts in Serb-dominated Mitrovica.
Separately Tuesday, Germany announced plans to begin withdrawing its troops deployed with KFOR, in light of stability achieved there. The drawdown is expected in the second half of the year.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Authorities have decided not to draw the last tranche from the country's loan agreement with the IMF, given the satisfactory economic progress and sufficient central bank's reserves, President Traian Basescu told a press conference Sunday (February 6th). Yet, the 1 billion-euro tranche from the European Commission (EC) is to come as planned, as it is necessary to finance the budget deficit, the president added. The Fund's representatives determined after almost two weeks of assessment that the two-year agreement with Romania may be closed successfully, as all committed targets established in the stand-by agreement have been reached, he added. As for the new IMF agreement, Basescu said it would be a precautionary one, with 3.6 billion euros kept at the cabinet's disposal. Another 1.4 billion euros will come from the EC under the same conditions. The new agreement will focus on macroeconomic consolidation, continuation of reforms and EU convergence.

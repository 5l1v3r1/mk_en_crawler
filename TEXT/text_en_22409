PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Pope Benedict XVI will pay a visit to Montenegro, media reported on Thursday (September 11th), citing sources close to the government. No date was mentioned, however. Montenegrin diplomats have been working on preparations for a papal visit for years. Efforts intensified after Montenegro's declaration of independence and the appointment of an ambassador to the Vatican in early 2007. (Vecernje novosti, RTCG, B92 - 11/09/08)

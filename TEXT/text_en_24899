SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Sarajevo-based NGO Historical Project Srebrenica has filed a claim at The Hague-based International Court of Justice against the UN and the Netherlands, media reported on Sunday (March 1st). The NGO says both failed to protect the Serbian and other non-Muslim civilians living in the Srebrenica enclave during the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH. NGO Chairman Stefan Karganovic said "We are using the same legal principle as the Mothers of Srebrenica association in its claim against the UN and the Netherlands, but our goal is to protect the Serb victims." The Mothers of Srebrenica argued Dutch peacekeeping forces failed to prevent the July 1995 massacre of Muslims by Serbs. (Blic, Tanjug, MIA - 01/03/09)

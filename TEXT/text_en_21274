SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak scolded Republika Srpska's ruling party, the Union of Independent Social Democrats, and the Federation of BiH's main opposition Social Democratic Party on Monday (April 28th) for their allegedly harsh rhetoric in recent days. Lacjak described it as "megaphone politics aimed at election campaigns rather than solutions". The two parties clashed first over reports of suspended financing for BiH state television and calls for reform of the public broadcaster, PBS. From there they traded jabs over BiH's constitutional order. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 29/04/08; OHR website, RTRS, Fena - 28/04/08)

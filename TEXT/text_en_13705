SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A committee of the BiH House of Representatives adopted on Thursday (20 October) the law on public broadcasting. Approval by both houses is the last outstanding prerequisite BiH must meet for launching negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. The committee finally approved the measure after overcoming strong opposition from Croat parties that insist it damages their constituents' interests.
In other news, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn called for the eventual reform of BiH's Constitution. During a conference in Geneva assessing the decade since the Dayton Peace Accords were signed, Rehn said the current arrangement in BiH -- three presidents, 700 deputies, 100 ministries and 13 governments -- is unsustainable in the long term.

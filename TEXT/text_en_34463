SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The government decided Monday (13 October) to resume importation of goods produced in Montenegro. In early June, BiH suspended part of its free trade agreement with Serbia-Montenegro, claiming authorities in Montenegro were not observing the free trade regime. That changed after Podgorica opted for automatic implementation of the accord.
In other news Monday, the district prosecutor of Herzegovina-Neretva Canton in southern BiH is launching an investigation into the wartime concentration camp Heliodrom, near Mostar, with the support of prosecutors at The Hague. The operation reportedly is aimed at gathering more information against former BiH Foreign Minister Jadranko Prlic. (FoNet, Onasa, Dnevni Avaz, Slobodna Dalmacija, HINA - 13/10/03)

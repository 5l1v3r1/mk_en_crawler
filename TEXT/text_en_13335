SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Co-chairman of the Defence Reform Commission Raffi Gregorian says he believes crucial reform will be implemented in BiH and related draft legislation will be passed by both entities' parliaments as scheduled. In an interview in Saturday's (27 August) Dnevni avaz, Gregorian said he was surprised that the Republika Srpska (RS) government decided to postpone the vote on the two defence reform bills until Monday. He insisted, however, that he expects the legislation -- key to a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU -- would be endorsed by the RS cabinet and then parliament. The planned restructuring of the armed forces would result in the transfer of defence and military command and control responsibilities to the state level.

ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Simitis returned Monday (25 November) from a meeting in Amsterdam with his Dutch counterpart and said he is worried that Cypriot accession to the EU might be linked to settling the territorial dispute with Turkey. After his meeting with Dutch Prime Minister Jan Pieter Balkenende, Simitis said he got the impression Cyprus might not receive the Netherlands' support if it does not endorse the peace plan presented by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan two weeks ago. Late last week, Greek Foreign Minister Giorgos Papandreou threatened to block EU enlargement unless Cyprus obtained full membership status with the remaining nine EU candidates. Simitis stopped short of that, but said Greece would work to ensure Cyprus enters the Union in the first enlargement wave. (Athens News Agency, Macedonian Press Agency - 25/11/02)

TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Fatos Nano called on the Bank of Albania (BoA) to do more to implement the government's priority programme against the informal economy and fiscal evasion. Nano issued the appeal Thursday (5 December) at a conference, stressing that closer co-operation between the government and BoA is crucial to the introduction and support of a formal market economy in Albania. Visiting Tirana on Thursday, EU External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten noted that fighting the informal economy tops the priority list in EU accession negotiations. (AlbaniaNews - 07/12/02)

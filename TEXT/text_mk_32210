WASHINGTON, United States -- The US government published its annual Report on International Religious Freedom on Monday (7 October). The document examines the situation of religious freedom around the world, with belligerent states facing the threat of sanctions. In its latest edition, the report singles out Romania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia as countries that have made substantial progress. Romania, in fact, was removed from a list of states whose legislation or policies are discriminatory. (AP - 07/10/02)

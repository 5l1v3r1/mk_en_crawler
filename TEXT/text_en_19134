BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament decided on Wednesday (February 28th) to establish an inquiry commission, which would explore whether to impeach President Traian Basescu. Two opposition parties, the Conservative Party and the larger Social Democratic Party, accuse Basescu of violating the Constitution, not respecting the Parliament and usurping foreign policies. The commission is expected to present its report to Parliament by March 21st. The document then would be forwarded to the Constitutional Court, for approval or rejection. If approved, Parliament would decide whether to proceed with impeachment. Basescu's replacement would be determined via a nationwide referendum. (Ziua - 01/03/07; Rompres, Mediafax - 28/02/07)

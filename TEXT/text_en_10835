BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Serbia has become a "safe haven" for war crimes suspects, chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte told EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and the NATO ambassadors on Wednesday (3 November), adding that Serbia's decision not to detain any of the 15 fugitives living on its territory was "a scandal". Del Ponte also voiced disappointment that Croatia has arrested neither General Ante Gotovina nor fellow suspect Miroslav Bralo. She insisted that both fugitives are still on Croatian territory, rejecting claims by Zagreb that they must have fled abroad. The prosecutor urged the arrest of the two men by 23 November, when she is due to present her regular report to the UN Security Council. 
Del Ponte also criticised Republika Srpska for failing to arrest even a single fugitive since the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina ended in 1995. She said indictees and their networks of support are "simply waiting" for the closure of The Hague tribunal in a few years. In an interview in Thursday's edition of <I>Nezavisne novine</I>, RS Interior Minister Darko Matijasevic said Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic would be arrested by the end of this year.

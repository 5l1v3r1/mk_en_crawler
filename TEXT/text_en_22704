ANKARA, Turkey -- The ruling Justice and Development Party's (AKP) deputy leader, Dengir Mir Mehmet Firat, has unexpectedly resigned for medical reasons, media reported on Sunday (November 9th). Nihat Ergun, deputy chairman of the party's parliamentary caucus, denies the resignation could trigger cabinet changes. "This is not linked to a cabinet reshuffle. It is up to the prime minister [Recep Tayyip Erdogan] whether and when to make a cabinet reshuffle," Ergun told reporters. According to NTV, former Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu will replace Firat, whom opposition parties and the media accuse of involvement in corruption. Recently, he criticised Erdogan for controversial remarks regarding tensions in the predominantly Kurdish southeast. 
Meanwhile, in a written declaration Friday, the AKP denied any links to a charity fraud case in Germany. AKP Finance Director Bulent Gedikli described the AKP's accounts as transparent and available on the party's website. Earlier last week, Turkish Chief Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya launched an investigation of the AKP's alleged links to the Deniz Feneri charity foundation, the subject of a court case in Frankfurt in September.

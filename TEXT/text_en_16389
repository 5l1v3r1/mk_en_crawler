SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Leaders of the three ruling coalition parties -- the Bulgarian Socialist Party, NMS-II and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms -- agreed on Wednesday (9 August) that Bulgaria would hold its elections for European Parliament members in 2007. No specific date was announced. Regular elections for EP deputies were held in the 25 EU member states last year. Bulgaria and Romania, expected to join the Union in January 2007, must elect their representatives upon entry. (Darik, Mediapool - 09/08/06)

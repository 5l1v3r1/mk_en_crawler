ATHENS, Greece -- Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said on Friday (January 8th) that Greece will make every effort to improve its plan to overcome its grave economic state. The statement followed a three-day visit by EU experts who discussed Greece's recently announced strategy to address its ailing public finances. "The draft will certainly be improved as a result of the visit and the discussions," Papaconstantinou said, adding that the visit "reinforced the sense the government is moving in the right direction".
Also Friday, the government announced steep hikes in taxes on alcohol and tobacco products to help counter the public debt. The higher rates take effect on Tuesday. (BBC, Ta Nea, Reuters - 08/01/10)

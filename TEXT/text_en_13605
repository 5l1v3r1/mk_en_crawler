TIRANA, Albania -- New quarrels erupted in parliament Thursday (23 March) after word that the National Guard has filed a countersuit against three deputies from the main opposition Socialist Party (SP) over recent incidents. The move came just days after the General Prosecutor's Office agreed to investigate the alleged abuse of powers by National Guard members who attempted to prevent SP members from entering parliament. SP deputy caucus chairman Petro Koci, one of three deputies in question, has suggested that the National Guard acted at the urging of the ruling Democratic Party. SP caucus chief Pandeli Majko noted that parliament members have immunity and therefore could not be the target of lawsuits. (Albanian News - 24/03/06)

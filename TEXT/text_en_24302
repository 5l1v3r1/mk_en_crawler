TIRANA, Albania -- The Supreme Court on Friday (April 10th) terminated the corruption trial of Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha, local media reported. The court announced that the prosecution failed to meet the deadline for completing its probe of Basha, who as transport minister allegedly manipulated a 2006 deal to build a section of the Durres-Kukes Highway. Basha allegedly influenced the selection of the US-Turkish company Bechtel-Enka to build the most expensive segment, causing a 114m-euro loss to the state. He denies the charges.

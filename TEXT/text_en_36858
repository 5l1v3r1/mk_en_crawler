SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Local authorities destroyed about 900 weapons Friday (9 July) at the Ilinden military barracks. The weapons, including explosives, were collected from members of the public under an amnesty programme. The event commemorated International Arms Destruction Day, a UN programme launched three years ago to prevent, combat and eliminate trafficking in small and light arms.
In other news, there is no word yet on the outcome of lengthy talks Friday among parties in the ruling coalition on the new territorial organisation of municipalities. A failure to reach agreement could delay the autumn local elections. Macedonian Radio reported Saturday that the talks are focusing on specific municipal border delineations and the use of the Albanian language in Skopje. (MIA - 11/07/04; Macedonian Radio - 10/07/04)

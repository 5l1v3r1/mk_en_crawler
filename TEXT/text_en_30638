ATHENS, Greece -- All public transport will stop for 24 hours on Tuesday (February 15th) amid a strike organised by the sector's main labour unions. It coincides with a vote by parliament on a controversial bill to restructure state-controlled transport companies. The government plans to merge all five such companies into two agencies -- one to be in charge of road transport and one in charge of fixed lines. (ANA-MPA, Kathimerini - 15/02/11)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The High Judicial Council formally discharged Lyulin Matev, a regional prosecutor from Ruse, on Wednesday (26 July), citing suspected links to organised crime. Matev finally resigned last week, after repeated demands by Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev, who said an internal investigation had revealed Matev's ties to a local racketeering gang. Velchev says the probe continues. (Dnevnik - 27/07/06; Darik - 26/07/06)

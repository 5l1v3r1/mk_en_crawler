PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The December 12th snap elections will be monitored by two organisations -- one local and one European, according to the network of NGOs Democracy in Action. The group provided details of the monitoring effort Thursday (November 18th), announcing that they are already training the observers. Democracy in Action will engage 4,800 observers, twice the number that monitored the 2009 local elections. The network is also monitoring the registration of political entities, candidates and the work of the Central Election Commission.

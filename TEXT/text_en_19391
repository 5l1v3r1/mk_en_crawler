THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- New chief UN war crimes prosecutor Serge Brammertz said on Sunday (February 24th) that the arrest of war crimes fugitives Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic remains a priority of The Hague war crimes tribunal. In his first interview since he assumed the post in January, Brammertz told the news agency Sense that he will continue to remind the international community that it must support the tribunal in its efforts to detain these most wanted fugitives. He said that long-term regional stability depends on their arrest. Both were charged 12 years ago with genocide in Srebrenica and crimes against humanity during the 1990s conflicts.

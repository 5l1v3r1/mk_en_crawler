SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Following a meeting Wednesday (17 March) with Nikola Radovanovic, High Representative Paddy Ashdown said the international community welcomes his appointment as BiH's first defence minister. Ashdown added that the move is viewed as a step towards accession to NATO's Partnership for Peace programme and other European structures. He said he was impressed by Radovanovic's ideas, though he also noted that the minister needs to secure public support. The two also discussed issues related to BiH's co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. (OHR Sources, Oslobodjenje - 18/03/04; Pincom.info - 17/03/04)

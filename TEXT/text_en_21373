PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said the Union is working to overcome obstacles to the planned deployment of the EU police and judicial mission (EULEX) to Kosovo. In Brussels on Monday (May 26th), Solana said he believes UNMIK and EULEX can function together after Kosovo's constitution enters into force on June 15th.
In other news Monday, Serbian Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic said new Serb municipal assemblies will arise soon in the regions where Belgrade organised elections on May 11th. Most were in the heavily Serb areas of northern Kosovo. In response, Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu said any efforts to establish parallel institutions would keep tensions high.

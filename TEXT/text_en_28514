ATHENS, Greece -- Government spokesman George Petalotis says Greece may renegotiate the interest rates of its EU/IMF aid package if a euro support mechanism is activated for some other country. Earlier this week, the EU unveiled a record 750 billion-euro rescue package designed to protect the 16-nation eurozone from potential disaster in the wake of the Greek crisis. "If another country uses this mechanism and gets lower interest rates, then there is a chance for us to renegotiate the interest too," Patalotis said on Tuesday (May 11th). Greece is expected to receive the first tranche of 5.5 billion euros on Wednesday. (Nafthemporiki, News In, Sitel - 12/03/10)

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu expressed hope Monday (November 15th) that a meeting Thursday in New York with Cypriot President Demetris Christofias would boost ongoing talks to reunify the island. The meeting was initiated by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. At the same time, Eroglu warned that "negotiations on the property issue have reached deadlock," which he said should be broken. Eroglu was speaking on the 27th anniversary of the establishment of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which is only recognised by Turkey. 
Referring to the Turkish presence on the island, he said that "the Turkish army is in Cyprus to prevent the Greek and Greek Cypriot invasion from spreading over the whole of the island, and the annihilation of the Turkish Cypriot people." 
"There is no land under occupation on Cyprus," he added. 
His statement provoked a sharp reaction from the Greek side. Government spokesperson Stefanos Stefanou said it demonstrates "the Turkish side lacks goodwill, and is not at all convincing that it wants a settlement." He added, "Turkey illegally invaded Cyprus in 1974 and illegally occupies 37% of the Republic of Cyprus." (Reuters, CNA - 15/11/10)

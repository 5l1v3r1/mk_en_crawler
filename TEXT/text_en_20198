THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The new chief prosecutor of the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Serge Brammertz, backs the conclusions of his predecessor, Carla del Ponte, as far as Serbian co-operation with the tribunal is concerned, his spokeswoman said on Monday (January 14th). She added that Brammertz has no plans to reassess the situation unless "significant developments" require it. Prior to leaving her post at the end of December, del Ponte remained very critical of Serbia, especially for failing to arrest wartime commander Ratko Mladic.
In other news Monday, the trial of former Serbian General and Chief of Staff of the Republika Srpska (RS) Army Novak Djukic opened in Sarajevo. Djukic is charged for his alleged role in war crimes during the 1992-1995 conflict, particularly with command responsibility for the shelling of Tuzla on May 25th 1995. A single round fired by the RS army hit the centre of town, killing 71 people and injuring more than 200. (Reuters, Jurist.com. DPA, Fena, RTRS, UPI, FoNet - 14/01/08)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- International Civilian Office head Pieter Feith and US Ambassador Christopher Dell met with political leaders Monday (April 4th) to discuss ways out of the current political situation. Kosovo has had no president since Behgjet Pacolli handed over his post following a ruling by the Constitutional Court that his election violated parliamentary procedures. The opposition has threatened to boycott another election with Pacolli the nominee and insists it be included in discussions about candidates. Opposition Democratic League of Kosovo leader Isa Mustafa says his party would accept Pacolli only if all parties agree to hold general elections in the spring of 2012. Feith and Dell met with Pacolli and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci. (Koha Ditore, Kosova Sot, Express - 05/04/11; Kohavision, Klan Kosova - 04/04/11)

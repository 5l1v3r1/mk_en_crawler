BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU foreign ministers warned Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) leaders of possible sanctions unless they immediately unlock the country's reform process. At a meeting Monday (March 21st) in Brussels, the EU Foreign Council stressed that BiH needs to form a new government and immediately implement three key reforms. Those are reworking the constitution in line with the European Convention of Human Rights, adopting a state aid law, and adopting a state-level census law. Only then, the EU concluded, would BiH's membership application be deemed credible. (RTRS, Srna, Nezavisne Novine - 21/03/11)

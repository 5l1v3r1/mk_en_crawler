PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK said Monday (22 December) that residents of Kosovo can participate in Serbia's upcoming general elections, overriding a declaration adopted by parliament earlier in the day that said Serbian elections cannot be held in the province. UNMIK insists Kosovo residents can participate in Sunday's elections on territory in the province, not only in Serbia proper.
In other news, Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova said Monday that he had asked Pope John Paul II to use his clout to win independence for Kosovo. At the Vatican, Rugova also expressed gratitude for the beatification of Mother Teresa. (B92, BBC - 22/12/03)

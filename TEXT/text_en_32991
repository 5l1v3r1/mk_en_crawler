BERN, Switzerland -- Noting rapid improvement in the situations in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Macedonia, the Swiss government on Wednesday (25 June) listed both countries as safe and said it would no longer consider applications for asylum from their nationals. Of the other Balkan countries, Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania are also on the safe list.
In other news, an EU police spokesman told reporters on Wednesday that the crackdown on illegal prostitution in BiH has been highly successful, though raids on bars have prompted organised crime operators involved in human trafficking and forced prostitution to switch tactics: they now work out of private apartments.

LUXEMBOURG -- Brussels will lift travel visa requirements for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) in October, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said on Monday (April 26th), after EU foreign ministers met with EC Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele in Luxembourg. Citizens of Albania and BiH will travel without visas in EU countries by the end of the year, Frattini said. He and Slovenian counterpart Samuel Zbogar sent a letter to the Spanish EU Presidency on Monday, urging preparations for scrapping these visa requirements be accelerated. 
Separately Monday, High Representative to BiH Valentin Inzko also predicted Bosnians can expect visa-free travel later this year. Conditions have been met, he said, but not in time to enjoy the benefit over the summer travel period.

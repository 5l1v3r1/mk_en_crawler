BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Momir Malic of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats was elected on Monday (December 27th) as chairman of Republika Srpska (RS) parliament's Council of Peoples. His deputies will be Croat Zoran Lipovac and Miroslav Mikes, representing other ethnicities. Bosniak representatives walked out of the constitutive session as their candidate for chairman, Mirsad Djapo, did not receive the votes needed for election. Malic says the Bosniaks could have nominated another representative but refused to do so. Because the third deputy chairman should be Bosniak, delegates decided that Mujo Hadziomerovic, chairman of the club of Bosniak delegates, would perform the duties until Bosniaks nominate their own representative for the post. Hadziomerovic, however, says they will not come up with a nominee, and will instead challenge the issue before the Constitutional Court of RS. (RTRS, Fena, Radio Free Europe - 27/12/10)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Boyko Borissov, informal leader of the election-winning Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) and incumbent mayor of Sofia, was elected by parliament Monday (July 27th) as the country's new prime minister. Most of the smaller parties in parliament -- the nationalist Attack, the Blue Coalition and the conservative Order, Law and Security party -- supported Borisov's nomination. The new cabinet will have 15 ministries. Historian Bozhidar Dimitrov, whose nomination spurred wide criticism due to his past as collaborator of the communist-era state security services, will be minister without portfolio in charge of Bulgarians abroad. Speaking to lawmakers Monday, Borissov reiterated that his government's priorities will be to improve living standards, combat corruption and implement judicial reforms.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A delegation of members of the US Congress met with members of BiH's tripartite presidency on Sunday (July 22nd), assuring them that BiH is a US foreign policy priority. Representatives Melissa Bean, Carolyn Maloney, Mike Ross, Steve Chabot, Russ Carnahan, Jim Cooper, Jim McDermott and Ben Chandler also said that US experts could help BiH draft its new constitution. The delegation also pressed the need for political dialogue to achieve EU related reforms and progress in Euro-Atlantic integration. 
On Friday, US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney commented that the present constitutional order of BiH is not sustainable and must be changed. He ruled out any notion of dividing the country by national communities, amid grumbling by Croats that they are under-represented. 
In other news Friday, High Representative to BiH Miroslav Lajcak summoned Security Minister Tarik Sadovic to discuss the work of his ministry and the functioning of the Council of Ministers. Lajcak reminded Sadovic that unbiased and professional security agencies would be crucial to police reform. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 23/07/07; Fena, OHR, RTRS - 20/07/07)

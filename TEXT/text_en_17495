BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu on Friday (April 20th) reversed an earlier decision and said he will not resign in the wake of parliament's decision to impeach him. He said stepping down would only deepen the ongoing political crisis. Prior to the parliamentary vote, Basescu had pledged to resign "five minutes" after being impeached and run again for president in a snap election. However, leaders of the Social Democratic Party and the Liberal Party have been saying they might seek changes to the election law, barring him from entering the race. A referendum on Basescu's impeachment will now be held on May 20th. European Commission President Jose Manuel Durao Barroso spoke by phone with Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu about the latest developments, reportedly stressing that all moves related to impeachment must comply with constitutional and democratic procedures.

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Calling early parliamentary elections in Serbia will be the top priority of Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia in the new year, said deputy party head Dragan Marsicanin. He announced Thursday (26 December) that the priority has shifted from drafting a new Serbian constitution to calling new elections. He also accused the government led by Zoran Djindjic of becoming a major stumbling block in the process of adopting a new constitution. (B92, Blic, Tanjug - 26/12/02)

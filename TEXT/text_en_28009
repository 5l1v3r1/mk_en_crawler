BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Prosecutor's Office has decided to alter charges against Slobodan Milosevic's widow, Mirjana Markovic, to prevent them from expiring, prosecutor's office spokesperson Tomo Zoric announced on Tuesday (September 21st). The indictment has been changed from incitement and illegal mediation to abuse of office, which carries a sentence of two to 12 years in prison. The original charges were to expire on October 13th. Prosecutors also suggest Markovic should be tried in absentia. The former first lady has been on the run since 2003 and has been living in Russia. She was originally charged with using her influence to illegally allocate a state-owned apartment to her grandchild's babysitter in 2000. Markovic and her son Marko are also being investigated for cigarette smuggling. (Blic, Tanjug, Beta, FoNet, DPA, Xinhua - 21/09/10)

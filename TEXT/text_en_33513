PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- A UNMIK spokeswoman announced Wednesday (24 September) that Serbia and Kosovo would begin direct talks by mid-October. Harri Holkeri, the top UN officer in the province, met representatives of the Contact Group - Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, the United States, and the EU - in New York on Tuesday. Members of the group approved the start of negotiations in Vienna. The talks will focus on technical issues such as transport, energy, missing persons and the return of refugees. The Contact Group warned, however, that any attempt to discuss Kosovo's final status would be unacceptable. (AFP, B92, Tanjug, BBC, Beta, FoNet - 24/09/03)

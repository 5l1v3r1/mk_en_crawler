TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha, leader of the ruling Democratic Party, called on the opposition Sunday (13 August) to co-operate in preparations for local elections this winter. Through his spokesman, Neritan Sejamini, the prime minister said dialogue and co-operation are the sole ways to guarantee a democratic electoral process. Opposition parties in parliament have been threatening to boycott the vote because of disputes over the recent selection of a Central Election Commission member and the procedure for compiling the voter registration list.

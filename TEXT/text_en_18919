TIRANA, Albania -- The Constitutional Court ruled on Monday (December 4th) that a parliamentary probe into Chief Prosecutor Theodhori Sollaku earlier this year violated the constitution. Sollaku approached the court after a parliamentary panel investigated him and recommended his removal from office earlier this year. The judges agreed that the legislature could request and receive reports by a chief prosecutor but could not evaluate his performance. The ruling Democratic Party had sought Sollaku's removal for alleged violations and links to organised crime. (Albanian News - 05/12/06)

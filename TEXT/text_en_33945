BUCHAREST, Romania -- The ministries of defence and interior are working jointly on a new draft law on military service, according to Defence Minister Ioan Mircea Pascu. He said Thursday (6 November) that the new bill is needed since the recently amended constitution stipulates that military service is no longer compulsory for all, an issue not covered by existing legislation. The draft law would be in compliance with NATO standards, he added. (ACT Media - 07/11/03)

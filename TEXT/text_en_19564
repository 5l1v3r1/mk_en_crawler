SOFIA, Bulgaria -- In a report published on Monday (September 24th), the World Bank said Bulgaria must increase productivity to 5% if it wants to catch up to the economies of older EU members. The Bank's experts noted that the current productivity level in Bulgaria is a steady 2%. Boosting it to 5% by 2015 and maintaining it at that level until at least 2040 would match the EU's average per capita GDP. To do this, the Bank says Bulgaria must strengthen its education system, invest more in research and development, maintain a flexible labour market and focus on competitive sectors of the economy.

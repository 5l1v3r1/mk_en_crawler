LUXEMBOURG -- The Western Balkans will be the focus of a EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg on Monday (11 October). The agenda will include talks on the Stabilisation and Association Process in the region, the situation in Kosovo ahead of the 23 October parliamentary elections, as well as the former Yugoslav republics' co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. Chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte will report on how each country is doing in terms of co-operation. 
On Saturday, Croatian President Stipe Mesic said he expects a positive assessment from del Ponte. Earlier in the week, Croatian Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul predicted no "surprises" in the report. (B92, Tanjug, HINA, HRT - 09/10/04)

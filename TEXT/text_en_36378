BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission on Wednesday (19 May) asked EU foreign ministers to adopt a package of measures that the Greek government should implement to lower the country's budget deficit. EU auditors found that Greece's 2003 budget deficit was 3.2 per cent of GDP, rather than 1.7 per cent as the previous government had estimated. This exceeds by 0.2 per cent the ceiling under the EU Stability Pact.
In Brussels, Greece's new EU Commissioner, Stavros Dimas, made his first public appearance Wednesday since assuming the post. He called for a revision of the directive on national exceptions regarding overtime work. He wants regulations consolidated to protect workers' health and safety while preserving business competition. (AP, AFP, ANA, MPA - 19/05/04)

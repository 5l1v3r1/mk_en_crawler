BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana says he is not worried that Kosovo may end up being partitioned. He met with NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer in Brussels on Monday (February 25th) to discuss security developments in Europe and beyond. At a joint press conference, Solana said the EU had started deploying its EULEX mission and that it will include the entire territory of Kosovo. Serbian media reports, however, suggest some glitches in the process have left parts of northern Kosovo -- where a sizable number of Serbs live - without EULEX coverage.
For his part, de Hoop Scheffer expressed support for the EU mission and insisted it does not violate UN Security Resolution 1244, as Serbia and Russia maintain. He also stressed that NATO would be keen to boost its partnership with Serbia. (Dnevni Avaz - 26/02/08; Tanjug, Beta, B92, Fena, Xinhua - 25/02/08)

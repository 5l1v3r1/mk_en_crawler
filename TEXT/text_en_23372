PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Women MPs have requested an amendment to the law on elections, saying they do not have fair representation. At a meeting Monday (May 25th), a bloc of female lawmakers called for changes to the current system, which is based on closed lists. Under that system, they said, voters usually support the leader of a party, and all parties are currently led by men.
Furthermore, they said, under current electoral law the quota for women in parliament is 30%, but under the gender equality law it should be at least 40%.
In other news, the interior ministry presented a national border management strategy Monday and named an executive board to supervise it. The programme is based on a four-point plan drafted by the European Commission and given to all Western Balkan states in 2001.

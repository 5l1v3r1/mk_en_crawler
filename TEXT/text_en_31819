ANKARA, Turkey -- Ruling party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced Sunday (5 January) he will leave Tuesday for Central Asia, meeting heads of state in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. After that, he will travel to China. The focus of the week-long trip will be trade relations, as Turkey works to revitalise its ties in the region. Central Asia is rich in natural resources and there are a couple of pipeline projects that involve Turkey - including the Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline, which would provide access to Azerbaijani petroleum. Ahmet Han, professor of international relations at Bilgi University, says Turkey has a potentially strong appeal among Central Asian states, as it shares the same cultural and religious heritage.

ATHENS, Greece -- The agriculture ministry announced at the weekend that six new cases of the deadly H5N1 virus strain have turned up among dead swans found in the country's northeast. That makes 32 known cases of H5N1 in Greece. 
Romania meanwhile adopted a new set of measures against the possible spread of bird flu, after several domestic birds tested positive for the H5 virus. Further testing will determine if they died from the H5N1 strain. (Kathimerini - 13/03/06; Reuters, AP - 12/03/06)

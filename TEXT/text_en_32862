BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Serbia's ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition stopped short of announcing blanket support for Vojislav Kostunica's Serbian presidential bid. DOS leaders failed Friday (29 November) to agree on a common stand; thus each party in the coalition will decide individually whether to support Kostunica in the 8 December vote.
In other news, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic announced Saturday that the Yugoslav government has decided not to drop its lawsuit against NATO. Yugoslavia is suing the alliance before the International Court of Justice for damages inflicted during the 1999 air strikes in Belgrade. Dropping the suit is a pre-condition for membership in certain international organisations, including NATO's Partnership for Peace programme. (Tanjug - 30/11/01; B92, Tanjug, BBC - 01/12/02)

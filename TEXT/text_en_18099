ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police in Split have arrested Croatia's most wanted fugitive, drug dealer Jaksa Cvitanovic-Cvik. An Interior Ministry spokesman confirmed the Wednesday (January 17th) arrest. Cvitanovic was first apprehended in July but managed to escape, prompting an international arrest warrant for him. He is believed to head a 20-member drug dealing gang, one of the largest in the country. Cvitanovic says he came to Split to surrender and co-operate with police.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown says one of the chief developments in the three years since he took the post is that BiH is finally at the doors of the EU and NATO. In an interview published in Monday's (23 May) edition of Dnevni avaz, he cites BiH's progress in becoming a self-sustainable state with a single tax system and customs administration, as well as a state-level judiciary. Goals that have yet to be achieved include establishment of an efficient state-level police organisation and reform of the public broadcasting system, Ashdown said.
In other news, members of the BiH Defence Reform Commission met in Sarajevo on Friday and approved a draft concept for the structure of the BiH armed forces and the army reserve forces. The panel also agreed on a concept of "active" reserve based on Slovenian and German models. (Dnevni avaz - 23/05/05; Fena, PBS BiH, NTV Hayat - 20/05/05)

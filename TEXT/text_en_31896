ATHENS, Greece -- The European Court of Human Rights ruled Thursday (28 November) that the Greek government must pay 13.7m euros to the former king, Constantine, his sister, Princess Irene and his aunt, Princess Ekaterini. The funds are for monetary damages and court expenses related to the Greek government's expropriation of real estate and other property once held by the monarchy.Constantine has been in exile since 1967, the year of the military coup in Greece. In its ruling, the court stipulated that the property in question will remain under the authority of the Greek government and will not be returned to the Crown heirs. Prime Minister Costas Simitis says he is pleased with the outcome, as the original claim was for some 494m euros. (Kathimerini - 29/11/02; Athens News Agency, Macedonian Press Agency - 28/11/02)

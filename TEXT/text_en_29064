ZAGREB, Croatia -- Vesna Pusic, president of parliament's committee for monitoring EU accession negotiations, says Croatia could wrap up its talks with Brussels by June 2011. After a committee meeting Tuesday (September 7th), she said that Zagreb could close the remaining 11 negotiation chapters by March and complete the negotiations in June during Hungary's term at the helm of the rotating EU presidency. The three most difficult negotiation chapters await -- competition, judiciary and financial and budgetary provisions. (HRT, Vecernji List, HINA - 07/09/10

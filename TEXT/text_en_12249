SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The commission formed to map new police regions met in Sarajevo on Thursday (12 May) and came up with three alternatives. One, proposed by the commission's chairman, Wilfred Martens, would establish five police regions. The second is High Representative Paddy Ashown's so-called 9+1 police area solution. Under the third, proposed by RS Interior Minister Darko Matijasevic and his team, police regions would be kept within ethnic borders. The three maps will be forwarded to BiH's political leaders for discussion Monday. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 13/05/05; FENA, PBS BiH - 12/05/05)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Edita Tahiri, Kosovo's chief negotiator in the dialogue with Serbia, is down playing any possibility of Kosovo's division being a future subject of negotiations. Officials in Serbia have mentioned the possibility, stating Belgrade is ready to discuss such issues with Kosovo. Tahiri believes that any talk about division is a provocation that might lead to destabilisation of the region, the daily Express reported on Sunday (April 24th). "Our concept of the dialogue is exclusively on technical issues and we will never accept political subjects," Tahiri said in an interview. Kosovo and Serbia have met a few times in Brussels with mediation by EU officials, but no progress has been reported in the so-called technical issues discussed so far.

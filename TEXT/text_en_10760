BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet criticised Greece on Thursday (7 October) for underreporting its budget deficit, saying the country has lost credibility as a result. He added that reporting procedures "must not be vulnerable to political and electoral cycles". Greece recently acknowledged having posted incorrect deficit figures since 2000.

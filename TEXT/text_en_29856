BELGRADE, Serbia -- Authorities have confiscated property worth 250m euros this year under the law on seizure of property stemming from criminal acts. Slobodan Homen, state secretary at the justice ministry, said on Sunday (December 26th) the law is crucial in fighting organised crime. He expects authorities will seize more property worth about 100m euros next year. Most of the properties seized, he says, belonged to drug traffickers and those tied to corruption.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul resigned on Tuesday (4 January) over corruption allegations, but denied any wrongdoing. In a letter to Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, Zuzul said he must leave because of the burden his presence placed on the cabinet and the foreign ministry. Local media reports had accused him of receiving bribes and of involvement in fraudulent privatisation deals.
In other news Tuesday, Croatia and Iraq agreed to establish diplomatic ties.

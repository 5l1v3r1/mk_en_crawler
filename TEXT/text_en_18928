PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Officials began implementing the Montenegro Demilitarisation Programme (MONDEM) on Tuesday (July 3rd) by cutting the main gun barrel of the first of 61 surplus T 55 tanks. MONDEM is a joint project of the Defence Ministry, the OSCE and the UNDP, based on UN and NATO standards. It is aimed at reducing the national defence stockpile from around 11,700 tonnes to 2,000 tonnes and reducing the number of locations where ammunition is stored.

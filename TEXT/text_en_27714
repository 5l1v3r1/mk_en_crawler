BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) announced on Sunday (October 24th) that at Athens' request, it is sending a team of border officials to Greece to help it deal with the growing number of immigrants seeking illegal entry into the EU from Turkey. The FRONTEX rapid intervention team will be the first deployed since its creation in 2007. EU Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malstrom explained that the decision to send the experts was made amid "alarming proportions" of illegal immigrants crossing from Turkey. Greece, she added "is manifestly not able to face the situation alone". (Radio Free, Europe, AFP, DPA - 24/10/10)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria reported an unprecidented outbreak of avian flu among domestic fowl on Thursday (20 July). Agriculture Minister Nihat Kabil said preliminary tests showed that the virus was responsible for the death of a number of hens in a private yard in the village of Slunchogled, in southern Bulgaria. Authorities introduced a 3km quarantine zone around the village, and have begun to cull fowl. Kabil said poultry from the village has not been sold at markets recently, eliminating the danger of the disease spreading to other areas. Samples have been sent to an EU laboratory in the UK to check for the H5N1 strain, which can be lethal to humans. (Sega, Monitor - 21/07/06; BNR, bTV, Darik, Reuters - 20/07/06)

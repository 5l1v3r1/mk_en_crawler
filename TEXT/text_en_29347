BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Parliament (EP) Rapporteur for Serbia Jelko Kacin said on Wednesday (June 2nd) he believes that sending fugitive Ratko Mladic's diaries to The Hague war crimes tribunal will result in a very positive report by the tribunal, and will allow EU member states to begin ratifying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA). Kacin met with Serbian Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac and members of the EP in Brussels to discuss defence sector reforms and Serbia's participation in peacekeeping missions. 
Belgrade currently has peacekeepers with UN missions in the Ivory Coast, Liberia, Congo and Chad but plans to send missions to Lebanon and Cyprus, possibly this year. Sutanovac assured officials that the Serbian government remains committed to catching Mladic and said that if he is hiding in Serbia, he does not have the support or protection of any state institution. A positive report by Hague chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz is a condition for unblocking the ratification of the pre-membership agreement between Serbia and the EU.

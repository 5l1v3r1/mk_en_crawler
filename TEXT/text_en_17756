SOFIA, Bulgaria -- US President George W. Bush has called on Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi to intervene in the case of six foreign medics, including five nurses from Bulgaria, sentenced to death for allegedly infecting hundreds of children with HIV. According to media reports in both Libya and Bulgaria on Wednesday (April 18th), Bush insisted on the immediate release of the five nurses and one Palestinian doctor as a condition for fully restoring bilateral ties with Libya. Washington also seeks full compensation for the families of victims of the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am plane over Lockerbie, Scotland. 
Separately, relatives of the nurses are in Brussels for talks Thursday with members of the European Parliament (EP) and with Bulgarian EU Commissioner Meglena Kuneva. 
Also Thursday, the Bulgarian Supreme Administrative Court upheld a decision by the Central Election Commission (CEC), barring the five nurses from being registered as candidates for the EP in upcoming elections. The small Order, Rule of Law and Justice party wanted to nominate them as a means of getting them out of Libya. Confinement in Libya, however, kept them from residing in an EU member state as required under Bulgaria's election laws. (Novinar, Dnevnik, Novinite.com - 19/04/07; BNR - 18/04/07)

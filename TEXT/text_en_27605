ATHENS, Greece -- Workers at state-owned railway company OSE are launching a three-day strike Monday (September 27th), staggering work stoppages throughout the days. The strike will affect international transport, railway lines from Athens to its suburbs, as well as the subway connecting Athens and the airport.

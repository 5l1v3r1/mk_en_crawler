BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Bulgarian Deputy Foreign Minister Ivan Petkov met on Tuesday (23 September) with top Kosovo officials. He conferred with President Ibrahim Rugova, Prime Minister Bajram Rehxepi and UNMIK deputy leader Charles Brayshow. The main topic was the situation in Kosovo and the proposed Belgrade-Pristina dialogue. Petkov has been paying an official visit to Serbia-Montenegro, to assess issues in advance of Bulgaria assuming chairmanship of the OSCE in 2004. Petkov begins a visit to Macedonia on Wednesday.
In other news, a Gallup poll released Tuesday suggests that the majority of Bulgarians view immigrants positively. Those described as xenophobic make up 7 per cent of the population, which Gallup says is lower than in many other democratic countries. (Dnevnik, Trud, 24 Chassa - 24/09/03; BTA, BNR - 23/09/03)

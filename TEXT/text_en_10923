BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte announced Friday (1 October) that The Hague tribunal has transferred a case to Serbian authorities, the first time it has done so. Following what she described as "very fruitful" talks with Serbian chief war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic, del Ponte said the move was a sign of good co-operation with the Serbian judiciary. She indicated that more cases would be transferred if authorities demonstrate they are processing them properly. (Srna, Danas, Nezavisne novine - 02/10/04; B92, Beta, Reuters, AFP - 01/10/04)

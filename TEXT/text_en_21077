MOSCOW, Russia -- The government reportedly has attached a new set of conditions to the Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline project it is eyeing with Bulgaria and Greece. Media reports say Russia now wants each of the three parties to provide a share of the oil that would run through the pipeline, in proportion to their stakes in the future company. For Bulgaria and Greece, which each have 24.5% stakes, this would translate into 8.5 million tonnes of oil each. Earlier, it was agreed that Russian companies would secure all the oil for transportation.
Stefan Gunchev, who chairs the company handling Bulgaria's part of the deal, told Dnevnik on Sunday (September 2nd) that the new demands are "surprising". He suggested that Russia may not have the levels of exportable oil needed to make the pipeline work at full capacity. (Darik, Focus, BGNES, Standart - 03/09/07; Dnevnik - 02/09/07)

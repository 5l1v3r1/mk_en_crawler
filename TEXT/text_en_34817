SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BHTV1 television station has launched investigations into a road construction deal between BiH and Serbia-Montenegro, following suspicions that it may have been tied to refusal of court proceedings. On Tuesday (5 August), the TV station alleged that Serbia-Montenegro authorities might have offered to build 100km of a road section to Europe in exchange for commitments that BiH would withdraw demands for war case investigations filed with the UN war crimes tribunal. BiH state officials firmly rejected the allegations, while the embassy of Serbia-Montenegro said it had no official information concerning the case. (BHTV1, BBC - 05/08/03)

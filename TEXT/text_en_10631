ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Germany on Tuesday (12 October) extradited a high-profile Turkish Islamic militant and cleric who is due to stand trial in his country for trying to overthrow its secular regime. Metin Kaplan, also known as "the Caliph of Cologne", spent four years in a German prison for inciting followers to murder a fellow cleric. Turkey accuses Kaplan of planning to fly a small explosives-laden aircraft into Ataturk's mausoleum in Ankara while thousands of people were attending an event marking the 75th anniversary of the secular republic. 
In other news, German media reported Tuesday that Berlin is planning to sell hundreds of second-hand Leopard II tanks to Turkey if EU leaders decide that the country has made enough progress to start accession talks. The deal would likely be worth $8.6 billion. (The New York Times, NTDV - 13/10/04; BBC - 12/10/04; AFP, AP - 11/10/04)

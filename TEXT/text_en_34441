BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro - A threatened no-confidence vote against parliament speaker and interim President Natasa Micic failed to materialise Tuesday (14 October) and has been rescheduled for Thursday. According to local media reports, the opposition managed to garner enough votes to oust the government, but the ruling coalition managed to buy some time as Micic never arrived to open the plenary session. Discussions among the ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia members continued throughout the day in a bid to resolve the situation. (B92, Tanjug, Beta, BBC, FoNet - 14/10/03)

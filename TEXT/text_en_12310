ANKARA, Turkey -- The IMF urged the Turkish government on Thursday (10 February) to revise its plans for creating jobs in underdeveloped areas. The Fund fears that the move could strain the budget and prevent Ankara from meeting the targets that were laid down in an agreement on a new $10 billion loan package from the IMF.
In other news Thursday, a suspicious package aroused concern at the Ankara Airport and led to 39 people being quarantined. The package emitted a strong smell that was later discovered to be garlic. Most of those quarantined were baggage handlers. (NTV, Anadolu Agency - 11/02/05; Reuters - 10/02/05)

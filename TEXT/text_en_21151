MOSCOW, Russia -- The Federal Migration Service (FMS) announced on Friday (February 29th) that it sees no reason to extradite the widow and son of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to Serbia. Marko Milosevic has lived in Russia since 2000. His mother Mira Markovic joined him three years later, after being investigated for embezzlement in Serbia. Both of them have asylum status in Russia. "Under the Russian law and international conventions, people who have been given an asylum status in our country are not subject to extradition to the country they came from," the FMS said in a statement Friday. The FMS says it has received no written extradition request from Belgrade, contradicting claims by Serbian Justice Minister Dusan Petrovic. (ITAR-TASS, Vesti - 29/02/08)

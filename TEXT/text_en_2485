In the eastern Bosnian town of Divic, near Zvornik, an Orthodox church stands on land formerly occupied by a mosque. The issue, which local government has been attempting to resolve for years, has hampered interethnic relations and could be said to symbolise the difficulties of reconciliation in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
Muslims who returned to Divic after the BiH conflict are demanding that the church be moved and the mosque rebuilt at its original site, while local authorities would prefer to find another location and leave the church where it is. 
The local government has paid the Islamic community 30,000 euros in compensation for the mosque's destruction, and the human rights commission in BiH, as an ultimate judicial authority, has ordered the municipality of Zvornik to provide a building site for a new mosque. 
Zvornik superintendent Dragan Jeftic says that two sites have already been proposed, but the Islamic community rejected them both. 
The situation has sparked protests by Muslims, causing services at the church to be disrupted. Behara Efendic, one of the demonstrators, says she does not mind the church, but adds that it would be much better to give the Muslims back their mosque. 
Serbian refugees from other parts of BiH came to Divic during the conflict. The town was renamed Saint Stefan -- after one of the most respected Serbian saints. However, only one Serb now lives in the town. Risto Djuretic is retired and admits he does not get along well with his neighbours. Police had to intervene when he was verbally attacked and firecrackers were thrown at his house. 
The tensions over the mosque issue are being fuelled, in part, by the dire economic situation in the area. Only a few members of the 185 families in Divic have permanent jobs, though most have high school diplomas. Residents say they get by on humanitarian aid and small pensions.

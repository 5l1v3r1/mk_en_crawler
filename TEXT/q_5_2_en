FINANCIAL SERVICES

A. General 

1. Have you analysed the differences between: a)      the treatment that you offer to third countries in terms of establishment of subsidiaries of companies and the rights of establishment within the Community? b)      the treatment you give to subsidiaries of foreign companies established in your territory and the treatment the Community gives to subsidiaries of foreign companies established on its territory? Please provide the findings of these comparisons. 

a) The establishment of trade companies, and in this respect the establishment of their subsidiaries, is regulated by the Company Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 28/04). Foreign trade companies and sole proprietors, under conditions prescribed by the law, enjoy equal conditions with the domestic companies for the establishment and work on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia. The Company Law does not recognise any additional restrictions regarding the freedom of subsidiaries and provision of services on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia, nor does it make a difference in the treatment of business activities of companies from third countries and the European Union member states.  The provisions in the Company Law are relevant to the decisions which regulate the right to business activities and the right to their establishment in the community.  The Company Law takes into full consideration and implements in entirety the company management and establishment models, which are derived from and are in accordance with the European legislation, particularly the Decree on the position of the so called European Company (Societas Europea) 2157/2001 of 8 October 2001.  b) Regarding the entitled rights and entailed obligations, the Company Law does not make a difference between domestic companies and subsidiaries of foreign companies conducting business activities on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia.  Subsidiaries of foreign companies have to be registered and act in accordance with the Macedonian legislation, and in this respect there is no difference as to their treatment in the community, when it comes to business activities on its territory.  2. Does your legislation contain any discriminatory provisions – such as language, nationality or residence requirement – that may affect the right of EU operators to establish in your country? If so, please provide a list of such requirements. 
The legislation of the Republic of Macedonia does not contain discriminatory provisions regarding the language, nationality and conditions of stay, which may affect the rights of EU operators that intend to establish business activities in the Republic of Macedonia.  3. What comparisons has your country drawn between its laws governing the entry and employment of third country nationals as "key personnel" and the laws in force in the Community? 
Entry and employment of foreign citizens in the Republic of Macedonia is regulated with the Law on Movement and Residence of Foreigners (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” Nos. 36/92, 66/92, 26/93 and 45/02) and the Law on Terms for Establishing Working Relations with Foreign Citizens ("Official Gazette of SFRY” Nos.11/78 and 64/89).  These regulations regulate the entry and employment of foreigners in a consistent, equal manner, regardless of the nationality and type of activity.  Regulations of the Republic of Macedonia that regulate the entry and employment of foreign citizens - the Law on Movement and Residence of Foreigners (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia “Nos. 36/92, 66/92, 26/93 and 45/02) and the Law on Terms for Establishing Working Relations with Foreign Citizens ("Official Gazette of SFRY” Nos.11/78 and 64/89), compared with the regulations that are in force in the Community, in particular with the Resolution on Limited Access for Employment of Foreigners from Third Countries on the Territory of Member Countries (“Official Journal” C 274, 19/09/1996 p.  0003-0006), do not make any difference in the treatment during the entry and employment of citizens from third countries.   Compared with the provisions contained in the Resolution for Limited Access for Employment of Citizens from Third Countries on the Territory of Member Countries (“Official Journal” C 274, 19/09/1996 p. 0003-0006) pertaining to „key personnel“ from third countries, our regulations provide for the following:  As provided for in the Resolution for Limited Access for Employment of Citizens from Third Countries on the Territory of Member Countries (“Official Journal” C 274, 19/09/1996 p. 0003-0006), the Law on Terms for Establishing Working Relations with Foreign Citizens ("Official Gazette of SFRY” Nos.11/78 and 64/89) also stipulates that the employment of foreigners will be made on the basis of a previously obtained work permit, which is a pre-condition for approval of temporary residence.  In accordance with Article 12 of the Law on Movement and Residence of Foreigners (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” Nos. 36/92, 66/92, 26/93 and 45/02), it is prescribed that for visa issuance for the purposes of employment, professional development, scientific research or conduct of certain professional activity, the Diplomatic Missions of the Republic of Macedonia requires consent from the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  After the foreigner has entered in the Republic of Macedonia, the same registers him/herself in the Employment Agency and obtains an approval for work (work permit) that s/he uses as an application for filing it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for obtaining an approval (permit) for temporary residence.  ( for more details see Chapter 02_III_E_1).  Temporary residence is approved for a period of one year, with a possibility for multiple extensions, until the existence of reasons for the work of the foreigner, i.e. for extension of the temporary residence.  Article 13 of the Law on Movement and Residence of Foreigners (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” Nos. 36/92, 66/92, 26/93 and 45/02) provides for the issuance of business visa.  Business visa can be issued to a foreigner for the purposes of performing business activities, stipulated in the regulations of the Republic  of Macedonia, pertaining to foreign investments and foreign trade.  It can be issued to a foreigner who performs professional activities defined with a contract for business and technical cooperation, for long-term production cooperation, for technology transfer, as well as for foreign investments. Business visa is also issued for intracorporative transfers. The term intra-corporative transfers means temporary transfers of foreigners for providing services with commercial presence in the Republic  Macedonia, who are on leading managerial and executive functions, or who possess higher education or qualifications in demand on the labour market, which are essential for the operation of the trade company in the Republic  Macedonia, that corresponds to the definition for "key personnel" defined in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and EU, Article 53, Paragraph 2.  Business visa is issued for the period that is necessary for performing the working duties for which it has been issued (from 90 days until 3 years, with a possibility for its extension), but not exceeding the validity of the passport.  Business visa issued to a foreigner has the status/validity as the temporary residence permit.   Currently, a new Labour Relations Law and Work of Foreigners is underway.  It regulates the manner of employment of "key personnel".  The Labour Relations Law and Work of Foreigners, in its first phase has been reviewed by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, and its final adoption is expected by the end of 2005.  The Labour Relations Law and Work of Foreigners will be harmonised with the EU standards and regulations. 4. Does your legislation distinguish between EU companies wishing to establish in your country and those who wish to provide services there temporarily? If it does, what is the distinction? Is it possible for a company established in an EU Member State to provide services on the territory of your country without establishing a subsidiary there? 
The Company Law (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 28/04), which regulates business activities in the Republic of Macedonia, does not make a difference between trade companies intending to establish business activities in the Republic of Macedonia and those intending to offer temporary services.  Furthermore, the Company Law provides that foreign trade companies and sole proprietors are equally treated in their operation with the domestic companies. In case they have not established a subsidiary in the Republic of Macedonia, they have to set up a branch office in order to be able to perform activities on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia.

B. Horizontal regimes 

6. Do you have any horizontal legislative or administrative requirements which apply to all businesses wishing to trade in, or with, your country? If yes: a)      Do these apply equally to businesses wanting to establish in your market and to businesses established in the EU supplying cross-border services? If not, what are the differences between the regime applying to establishment and the regime applying to service provision? b)      What are the procedures for obtaining a licence (or other form of authorisation)? c)      What are the requirements which have to be met to obtain a licence or authorisation? (For example, are there nationality or residence requirements, or does documentation have to be provided from the country of origin of the service provider?) d)      To what extent are requirements which the business has already fulfilled in its state of establishment taken into account? e)      How long does it take to obtain a licence? f)        Is there a fee for the licence? If so, how much is it? g)      Is the licensing requirement combined with mandatory membership of a chamber of commerce, trade association or other body? If this membership involves a fee, how much is it? h)      What is the justification in policy terms for the licensing system? 
a)      The legal and administrative requirements for all companies which intend to trade in or with the Republic of Macedonia are equal for all companies and provided in the Company Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 28/04). Foreign companies and sole proprietors cannot perform activities on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia unless they have established a branch office. Foreign companies have to comply with the legislation in the Republic of Macedonia for their work in the Republic of Macedonia.  
b)      The Company Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 28/04) provides a procedure for establishing a branch office. Through its branch office, the foreign company is entitled to perform activities in accordance with its form and area of activity, gain or undertake responsibilities, and access courts and other bodies in the Republic of Macedonia, under the same conditions as the domestic companies of the same form or subject of work, unless otherwise provided by the law. The foreign company and/or sole proprietor, applies to register the establishment of its branch office in the trade register in line with the seat of the branch office. The trade registration procedure is initiated when a written application form is filed by an authorised applicant. The application for a company registration is filed by the management body, i.e. an authorised member of the management body, unless otherwise provided by the law.  The application can be filed by an authorised applicant’s warranty holder, notary verified, unless otherwise provided by the law. The application for registration is accompanied with the required appendices which contain evidence to be entered in the trade register. When it is determined that the registration conditions are met, i.e. that the submitted application has suitable contents and is filed by an authorised person, as provided in this law, and that all appendices (identification and evidence) provided by this law are attached, the decision on registration is reached within eight days from the application filing date without hearing. The decision on registration in the trade register is written on the form in accordance with the registration type with no further explanation. When conditions for legal trade register entry are not met, the court reaches a decision by which the registration application is rejected. The decision contains an explanation as to why the application has been rejected.  
c)       In accordance with the Company Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 28/04), the following documents are to accompany the registration application: 1.  extract from the register in which the foreign company or foreign sole proprietor to establish the branch office is registered, which presents the registration contents and date; 2.  transcript of the company’s incorporation agreement or statute, or another act comparable to them, according to the foreign company’s legislation, verified by a state body authorised for this according to the legislation of the company’s country of origin, as well as a certificate issued by the foreign country’s authorities that the agreement or statute, or another act comparable to them according to the legislation of the foreign country is still in force. In cases when, according to the laws of the country of origin, a written agreement or statute or another comparable act is not required according to the foreign country’s legislation, a certificate of the relevant diplomatic or consular representation office of the Republic of Macedonia is submitted, which states that the company exists, lists the share-holders, i.e. partners and their shares of responsibility, whereas for foreign sole proprietors a certificate that they have not been erased from the register; 3.  a list of individuals that have been entrusted with representation of foreign companies and foreign sole proprietors in the Republic of Macedonia, stating their name and surname, citizen personal identification number, i.e. passport number for foreign  natural persons, and their citizenship and place of residence. The list is accompanied by evidence that these individuals have been legally appointed, according to company acts and country-of-origin legislation; 4.  decision of the responsible foreign company body or foreign sole proprietor to establish a branch office; 5.  a certificate of good standing for the foreign company or sole proprietor, issued by a relevant state organ or authorised auditor, in accordance with the legislation of the company’s country of origin; 6.  description of the activities and work to be performed by the branch office; and 7.  if the law provides, permits, approval or another act, in which case the application is also accompanied with this evidence. The requirement for other permits or requirements is not necessary for the establishment and registration of trade companies.  
d)       The requirements already met by the company in its country of origin, are entirely taken into consideration while establishing a branch office or subsidiary. These conditions are the basis and precondition for the approval to work on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia in the two forms or organisation listed above.  Without evidence that the company has met the requirement in its country of origin (registration), the company cannot work on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia. e)  In accordance with the Company Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 28/04), the procedure for registering a trade company or branch office, i.e. their registration in the trade register, is a matter of urgency. The competent court is obliged to apply equal treatment of subjects and respect the order in which applications have been filed with the court.  In case the application is clean, the judge is obliged to reach the decision within eight days of the application filing date. In the case the application is not clean, the judge is obliged to reach a decision in which the person authorised to file the application is instructed to clean the application.  f) The registration taxes, i.e. the registration of trade companies or branch offices in the trade register, are provided by the Law on Court Fees (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 46/90. 65/92, 20/95 and 48/99). The trade registration fee is 1.200,00 MKD. The company establishment registration fee is 2.000,00 MKD  The registration evidence is published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia. This costs 500,00 MKD.  g)  The permit issuance, i.e. the trade company’s registration in the trade register, is not conditioned by previous membership in the Chamber of Commerce or other trade association.   h) Additional permits are necessary for other activities that the branch office or the subsidiary of the foreign trade company may perform. Their aim is to protect the activity and ensure legal operation, as well as control of the manner and conditions under which the activity is performed.  In case of specific areas which are regulated by specific legislation and conditions of work (e.g. flammable substance transport, passenger transport, weapon supply and distribution, health and pharmaceutical services etc.) and require additional permits, the ability of the branch office subsidiary regarding technical and expert facilities for performing such activities is subject to control, aimed to ensure the elimination of possible damage and consequences on people’s life and health, their property, the environment and other values.  All conditions as set forth in the provisions apply equally to both domestic and foreign legal and natural persons which are engaged in the performance of commercial activities.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands â The UN war crimes tribunal decided Friday (1 December) to suspend the trial of Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj because of the defendant's weakened condition as a result of a 22-day hunger strike. The judges also signaled that they could order medical intervention if Seselj continues to refuse to take any food. 
On Saturday, thousands of SRS supporters held a rally in Belgrade on behalf of Seselj. (Politika - 03/12/06; RTS, B92, Reuters, AP, BBC - 02/12/06; UPI, Beta, Tanjug - 01/12/06)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz will visit Croatia early next week, The Hague announced on Wednesday (September 23rd). During his visit Monday and Tuesday, Brammertz will meet with President Stipe Mesic, Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor, Justice Minister Ivan Simonovic and State Prosecutor Mladen Bajic to discuss issues regarding Croatia's co-operation with The Hague tribunal. In his report to the UN Security Council in June, Brammertz gave a positive assessment of Croatia's war crimes co-operation, noting Zagreb responded in a timely fashion to most tribunal requests, apart from some issues related to the 1995 Operation Storm. Zagreb failed to submit the so-called "artillery diaries" for use in trials against several Croatian indictees, including retired General Ante Gotovina. (HINA, Vjesnik, Javno - 23/09/09)

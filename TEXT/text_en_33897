ZAGREB, Croatia -- The main opposition party Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) is urging Serb refugees to return, and promises to defend their rights. HDZ leader Ivo Sanader said in an interview on Wednesday (12 November) that his party would also work to improve ties with Serbia if it wins the 23 November parliamentary elections. Polls indicate the HDZ is ahead, but is unlikely to win enough votes to form a government on its own. Prime Minister Ivica Racan says meanwhile that he will resign as head of the Social Democratic Party if it does not do well in the elections.
Also on Wednesday, OSCE mission chief in Croatia Peter Semneby said that monitors are generally pleased with the campaign process at this point. He said media coverage has been objective and that his staff will pay special attention to voting by Croat refugees in Serbia-Montenegro. (MediaScan - 13/11/03; AFP, HRTV, Dnevnik - 12/11/03)

ANKARA, Turkey -- President Abdullah Gul emphasised during a visit to Diyarbakir on Thursday (December 30th) that Turkey must accept linguistic and religious differences among its citizens, but must, at the same time, remain a united country. "[Although] the official language of Turkey is Turkish," Gul said "we have citizens using different languages," including Kurdish and Arabic. "All these are ours; [they are] our languages," he added. 
The visit came a day after the National Security Council said that no challenges to the official Turkish language will be accepted. The Kurdish minority has been insisting on more rights, including the right to education in their mother tongue and the use of Kurdish in public areas. 
In other news Thursday, police announced the arrests of ten people suspected of ties to al-Qaeda. The suspects were detained during operations Wednesday in Bursa and Istanbul, following tips that they were plotting attacks ahead of New Year's Eve.

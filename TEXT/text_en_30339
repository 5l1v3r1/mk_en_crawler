BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska's (RS) parliament convenes a special session Wednesday (April 13th) to debate the validity of the BiH Court and Prosecutor's Office. RS President Milorad Dodik is expected to propose holding a referendum on whether these institutions should exist in their present form. He claims that RS has never given its consent about establishing these institutions, set up by the High Representative. Bosnian Serbs are unhappy with the BiH Court and Prosecutor's Office work on war crimes cases involving Serbs. (BHRT, RTRS, Nezavisne Novine - 12/04/11)

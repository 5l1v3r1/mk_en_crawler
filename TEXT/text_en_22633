TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha says Albania will increase its number of troops in peacekeeping missions around the world by 100. Currently, it has a total of 350 troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Afghanistan and Iraq. Berisha said on Monday (April 7th) that a unit will also join peacekeepers in Darfur, Sudan. Albania was formally invited to join NATO last week. Berisha says membership will make Albania a more secure country that will attract huge foreign investment. (BalkanWeb, Dtt - 07/04/08)

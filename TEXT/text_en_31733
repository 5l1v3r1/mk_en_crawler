SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Supreme Administrative Court ruled Thursday (9 January) that the government lacked the authority to promise the EU that it would shut down the third and fourth reactors at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant in 2006. Shortly before last month's EU summit in Copenhagen, Sofia agreed to decommission the two units if EU inspectors found them unsafe. But the National Assembly had adopted a decision that the reactors could be closed only after Bulgaria has been admitted to the Union, and on Thursday the judges ruled that the government was compelled to abide by parliament's decision. A spokesman for the cabinet said ministers would appeal the ruling. Bulgaria shut down the first and second reactors at Kozloduy on 31 December. (AFP, BNR, BNT, bTV, BTA, Mediapool - 09/01/03)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Police arrested a former Bosnian Serb police officer Tuesday (June 3rd) for his alleged role in the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre. Zoran Tomic, 37, also known as Zgembo, was taken into custody near the eastern Bosnian town of Zvornik. He belonged to a Serb special police unit that operated in the Srebrenica area and as such allegedly participated in the genocide against Bosniak men and boys. The police suspended him on war crime suspicions last year, along with 34 other officers. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 04/06/08; RTRS, Fena, Reuters, VOA, DPA - 03/06/08)

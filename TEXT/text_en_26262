ANKARA, Turkey -- Mehmet Ali Agca, who wounded Pope John Paul II in a 1981 assassination attempt, said on Wednesday (January 13th) that he will answer questions about the shooting after he is released from prison next week. It has long been rumoured that both Bulgaria and the Soviet-era secret service, KGB, were involved in the attempt. The pope met with Agca and forgave him in 1983, while Agca was serving a 19-year sentence in an Italian prison. On Monday, he will complete a separate ten-year sentence for the 1979 murder of a Turkish journalist. He was sentenced for this crime in Turkey but escaped from prison there in 1981.

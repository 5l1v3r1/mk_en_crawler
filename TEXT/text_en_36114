BUCHAREST, Romania -- European Integration Minister Alexandru Farcas says the government's priority in the upcoming period of EU accession negotiations will be the reform of public administration. Speaking Tuesday (16 March), he said Romania might not close EU accession negotiations by the end of this year, but rather in early 2005. The delay is reportedly due to slow progress in negotiations. Farcas was attending the second meeting of the EU-Romania Committee on Public Administration Reform. (Rompres - 16/03/04)

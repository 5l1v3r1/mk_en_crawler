BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Greece will soon be submitting its plan to restore its financial stability to the European Commission (EC) for approval. Amelia Torres, spokesperson of EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, said on Monday (January 4th) that due to the country's grave situation, it will be asked to send its plan earlier than other bloc members. Their submissions are due at the end of the month. Reuters quotes unnamed Greek Finance Ministry officials as saying that the plan will be discussed during a joint visit by EC and European Central Bank experts, who are expected to arrive in Athens on Wednesday.

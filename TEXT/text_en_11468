TIRANA, Albania -- The Export-Import Bank, the official export credit agency of the United States, is prepared to back projects aimed at building a power plant in Vlora and a pipeline from Bulgaria to Albania via Macedonia, the government in Tirana announced Wednesday (20 April). The bank sent a letter to Prime Minister Fatos Nano, saying it has been approached by US exporters who want to take part in the projects, in light of "the tremendous progress the country has made over the past several years".

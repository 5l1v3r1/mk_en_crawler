PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia/BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian and Kosovo Albanian representatives will meet in Baden, Austria, on Monday (November 26) for the last round of talks on the province's future. Negotiations are scheduled to end on December 10th, when the troika of international mediators will present a report to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. While Serbia continues to insist on retaining nominal control of Kosovo, the province's ethnic Albanians remain adamant in their demands for independence.
UN foreign policy chief Javier Solana said on Friday that if no compromise is reached in the Kosovo status negotiations by December 10th, the decision on the breakaway province's future will be made by Ban Ki-moon. Solana expressed hope, however, that a breakthrough in the talks will be made before the deadline. Meanwhile, Croatian President Stjepan Mesic suggested that Serbia and Kosovo follow the model set by a 1972 treaty between the two Germanys. The agreement guaranteed the borders and granted both parts of the then-divided nation autonomy in internal and external affairs.

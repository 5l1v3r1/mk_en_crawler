SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- On Tuesday (1 July), High Representative Paddy Ashdown presented a list of 14 people banned from entering EU member countries. The list includes persons accused of helping war crimes suspects. Some are believed to have assisted former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, while others are reportedly involved in hiding retired Croatian Gen Ante Gotovina. Ashdown said local and international authorities will update the file regularly. (Dnevni Avaz, Dnevni List, Vecernji List - 02/07/03; SRNA, BHTV, FTV, HINA, ANANOVA - 01/07/03)

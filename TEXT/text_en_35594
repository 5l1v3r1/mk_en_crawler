ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic said on Saturday (7 February) that Ante Gotovina, one of the UN war crimes tribunal's most wanted indictees, should surrender to authorities. "I still think it is more useful for Gotovina, Croatia, and the Croatian Army that he answers the questions of the court in The Hague," the president said. The retired general went into hiding in 2001 when the UN court announced that he would be tried for the deaths of more than 150 Serbs during a military operation in 1995.(NTV Hayat, AFP - 07/02/04)

WASHINGTON, United States -- The State Department has released its annual report on trafficking in persons, which includes assessments of countries' efforts to combat the problem. All Balkan nations have been placed in the three-tier system's second tier, which includes "countries whose governments do not fully comply with the minimum US standards, but are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with those standards." Greece, however, was placed on a special Tier Two watch list. (AP - 04/06/05)

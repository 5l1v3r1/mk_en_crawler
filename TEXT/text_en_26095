BELGRADE, Serbia -- During a visit Tuesday (December 15th), UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz praised the professionalism of those searching for war crimes fugitives, but insisted on further efforts to capture Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic. During a conference in Belgrade, he said that UN prosecutors have every reason to believe that Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb commander, is in Serbia. Full co-operation by Serbia is crucial to eventual EU membership. (Tanjug, Politika, Beta, B92, AP - 15/12/09)

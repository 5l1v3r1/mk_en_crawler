ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey's Constitutional Court head, Hasim Kilic, told a news conference Thursday (March 27th) the court will likely hold a preliminary hearing Monday on a request to shut down the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). Supreme Court of Appeals Chief Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya submitted a request for the ban earlier this month, claiming the party is undermining the secular character of the state. If the Constitutional Court decides to take the case, the AKP, led by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, will have one month to submit a preliminary defence.
On Thursday, both Erdogan and AKP deputy chairman Nihat Ergun reiterated that they would continue to lobby for a constitutional amendment that would make such party closures more difficult. (Radikal, Zaman - 28/03/08; Anadolu Agency, NTV, Cihan - 27/03/08)

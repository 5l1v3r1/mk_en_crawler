SOFIA, Bulgaria -- In a joint operation last week, Bulgarian, Czech and Bavarian police broke up a euro counterfeiting ring, according to Bulgarian Interior Ministry Chief Secretary Boyko Borissov. During a press conference Tuesday (22 June), he and Europol Director Jurgen Storbeck announced that two Bulgarians and two Albanians are being held on charges of forging 230,000 euro banknotes. The counterfeiting ring had operated for two years.
Also Tuesday, it was reported that Austria will finance the construction of a prison in Bulgaria, intended to house Bulgarians sentenced for crimes committed in Austria. A similar project, costing 3m euros, has been implemented in Romania. (Sega - 23/06/04; BTA, BNT, Nova TV - 22/06/04)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EU security chief Javier Solana said in a press interview that EUFOR will remain in BiH as long as needed, and would be ready to intervene in any part of the country in case of emergency. In the interview, published in Monday's (December 4th) edition of Dnevni avaz, Solana confirmed that Brussels is conducting a regular assessment of the Althea operation in BiH, adding that if changes are made, it would be a sign of progress achieved by BiH. 
As for efforts to support the UN war crimes tribunal's activities in BiH, Solana said the responsibility for full co-operation lies with BiH authorities, especially Republika Srpska. US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney stressed the same point in a separate interview Monday with the newspaper Nezavisne novine. (Dnevni avaz, Nezavisne novine - 04/12/06)

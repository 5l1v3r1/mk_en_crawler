SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The court of BiH decided on Wednesday (February 9th) to extend the extradition detention of Croatian war veteran Tihomir Purda by six months, and will use the time to decide on Serbia's extradition request. Purda's attorney, Josip Muselimovic, vowed to appeal the decision. Purda was detained in January at the border between Croatia and BiH, based on a Serbian arrest warrant. Belgrade wants him for alleged war crimes committed in Vukovar in 1991. (Srna, RTRS, Radio Free Europe - 09/02/11)

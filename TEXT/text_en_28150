ATHENS, Greece -- Lawmakers approved legislation Thursday (July 15th) envisioning reforms in the pension and social security system amid a national strike and peaceful protests outside parliament in Athens, and in other cities. The bill aims to bring public sector pensions further in line with those in the private sector, raise the retirement age and transfer separate pension funds for the public sector into the main pension fund. It was passed by a vote of 156-128, with one abstention. 
Meanwhile, the GSEE labour union and major employers' groups signed an agreement Thursday to freeze salaries this year, and then raise them -- depending on inflation in the eurozone -- in 2011 and 2012. The deal affects all workers in the private sector, roughly 2 million people. The first planned salary raise, a year from now, is expected to be around 1.5%. The second one, about 1.7%, is due in July 2012. (Wall Street Journal, ANA-MPA, Xinhua - 15/07/10)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian President Ion Iliescu met with his Turkish counterpart, Ahmet Necdet Sezer, on Friday (9 July). The two leaders reportedly emphasised the strong bilateral ties between their countries. The focus of the talks was largely economic; Romania is Turkey's largest trading partner in the Balkans. In the wider Black Sea area, it is second only to the Russian Federation. The presidents agreed they would work to continue boosting economic and political ties. (Rompres - 09/07/04)

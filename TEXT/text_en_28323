SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Energy Minister Traycho Traykov and Gazprom CEO Alexey Miller met on Friday (October 15th) in Sofia and agreed to speed up proceedings for the South Stream gas pipeline. In part, they will establish a Bulgarian-Russian joint venture that will operate the Bulgarian section of the pipeline by the end of November, four months ahead of schedule. A feasibility study to determine the cost of the project will also likely start soon. The agreement seems to counter rumours that Bulgaria could be left out of the South Stream project in favour of neighbouring Romania. (Dnevnik, BNT, Darik - 15/10/10)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The country's Orthodox Church has a new patriarch. Daniel, 56, Metropolitan of Moldova and Bucovina, was elected to the post by the National Clerics' Council on Wednesday (September 12th). He will succeed Patriarch Teoctist, who died in July. Daniel is seen as a member of the reformist wing of the church who favours improved relations with other Christian churches. He beat out Metropolitan Bartolomeu Anania, 86, a former political prisoner during the communist regime. 
A number of local media reports have suggested that the new patriarch was a Securitate agent during the regime of Nicolae Ceausescu. Romania's commission for declassifying the Securitate files has said that it was looking into the clergy's dossiers but refused to provide further details.

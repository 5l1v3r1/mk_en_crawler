PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Several hundred ethnic Albanians gathered in downtown Pristina on Saturday (June 30th) to demand the immediate declaration of independence and an end to talks on the province's future. The event was organized by the Self-Determination movement, which has criticised the Kosovo leadership for allegedly making too many concessions to Serbia. Unlike the large rally in February, which turned violent and ended with the death of two protesters, Saturday's demonstration was peaceful. International police put the number of participants at between 500 and 600. At the end of the march, the demonstrators threw a package symbolizing former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's status plan into the yard of the main building of UNMIK, urging the UN to leave the country.

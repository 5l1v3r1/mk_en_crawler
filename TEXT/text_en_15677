SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament voted Thursday (22 June) to lift the immunity of Volen Siderov, leader of the ultranationalist Attack party. With 147 votes in favour, the legislature decided to allow the prosecution to press charges and investigate Siderov in connection with an April traffic incident. The most probable charges are abetting a crime and obstruction of justice. (Darik, bTV, Mediappol - 22/06/06)

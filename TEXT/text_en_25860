TIRANA, Albania -- Human Rights Watch (HRW) applauded a recently adopted law against discrimination as an important step to guarantee equality for all. "The government has had a leading role to ensure equality," the watchdog group said in a letter to Prime Minister Sali Berisha on Tuesday (February 16th). The legislation, adopted earlier this month, protects Albanians from all forms of discrimination, including sexual prejudice. The HRW assisted Albania in drafting the measure.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The main opposition Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) will again boycott the vote for a new president if there is no general consensus among the parties on the candidate. Party leader Isa Mustafa made the announcement after a meeting of the LDK General Council on Sunday (April 3rd). "The election of the president should be a result of a political agreement that would express the interests not only of the ruling political entities but also those of the opposition, namely of the citizens of the Republic of Kosovo," Mustafa told reporters after the meeting. 
Two other opposition parties, the Vetevendosje Movement and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo, have also indicated that they will boycott the session if Behgjet Pacolli runs for president again. The Constitutional Court found last week ruled that his election by parliament violated the constitution.

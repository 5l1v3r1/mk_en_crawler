ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic has said for the first time that he would not object to holding the next general elections this autumn. In an interview with the Zagreb daily <I>Jutarnji List</I>, Mesic said that despite his personal opinion that the elections should be held next spring, he would schedule the vote for this fall if both the ruling coalition and the opposition demand it. Last month, Prime Minister Ivica Racan said the elections should take place in the second half of November. (HINA - 19/08/03)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Police have arrested seven alleged members of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), in connection with an attempt to plant a large bomb in downtown Ankara last week. The suspects, including two women, were picked up in eastern Van province as part of a major operation by law enforcement agencies. A van carrying 600kg of explosives was parked in a multi-story parking lot in Ankara on September 11th. Police disarmed the bomb before it could be detonated by a mobile phone, a favourite method of PKK bombers in the past. Two other suspects have been arrested in Ankara.

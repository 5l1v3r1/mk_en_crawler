TIRANA, Albania -- The head of the European Commission delegation in Tirana, Lutz Saltzman, urged Albania on Thursday (28 October) to start implementing EU integration projects early next year. Saltzman said that the EU would decide soon on funds to be released to Albania in 2005-2006 under the CARDS programme, and that important projects should be launched as soon as possible. Integration Minister Ermelinda Meksi said efforts to prepare an action plan are encountering difficulties due to weaknesses in the public administration and public finance management.

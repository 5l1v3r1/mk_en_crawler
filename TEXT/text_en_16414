BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The chairman of the BiH presidency, Sulejman Tihic, spoke Friday (12 May) about his meetings with US officials, including Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice. Washington continues to support the constitutional reform process in BiH, Tihic said, despite disappointment over the BiH Parliament's recent failure to adopt the changes. On Friday, the BiH presidency chairman also held talks with US Senator John Kerry, who praised the country's participation in the international peacekeeping mission in Iraq.

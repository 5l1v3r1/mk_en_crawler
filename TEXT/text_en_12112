SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The international judge at the BiH Court, Stephen Swanson, confirmed on Friday (11 March) indictments against the Croat member of the BiH presidency, Dragan Covic, BiH Constitutional Court President Mato Tadic and five other people charged in the so-called Ljanovici case. Swanson said that the seven face 12 counts -- including embezzlement, abuse of office, bribery and tax evasion -- in connection with the 6m-euro tax exemption scandal involving the local meat industry in 2000. Covic served as Federation of BiH finance minister at the time. On Friday, the Office of the High Representative again urged him to resign from the presidency.

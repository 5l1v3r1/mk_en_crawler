ANKARA, Turkey -- The foreign ministry has summoned US Ambassador to Ankara James Jeffrey over last week's speech by US President Barack Obama, marking the Armenian Remembrance Day of 1915, media reported on Monday (April 27th). In his speech last Friday, Obama did not use the word "genocide" to describe the killings of 1.5 million Armenian civilians by Ottoman Turks in 1915-1917. Instead, he branded the events as "one of the great atrocities of the 20th century". That stirred angry reactions from Turkey's political leaders. President Abdullah Gul told reporters that hundreds of thousands of Turks also lost their lives in the 1915 events. (Anadolu news agency, Hurriyet, Zaman - 27/04/09)

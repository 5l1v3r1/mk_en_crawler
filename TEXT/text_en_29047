PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Three of the closest associates of alleged drug trafficker Darko Saric have left Montenegro using fake documents, thus avoiding arrest. Dejan Djurovic, head of Montenegro's Interpol Office, said on Sunday (November 7th) that authorities have stopped looking for Goran Sokovic, Dejan Sekularac and Drasko Vukovic, but are assisting Serbia in efforts to locate them. Saric and his group are suspected of smuggling 2.5 tonnes of cocaine from South America. (RTCG, Radio Free Europe, Tanjug, B92 - 07/11/10)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said on Wednesday (10 September) that the government plans to set up a special group to monitor implementation of the democratic reforms required for EU membership. Several NGOs, civic and political organisations have formed a separate task group to promote Turkey's image abroad. Ankara is speeding up reforms ahead of an EU summit in 2004, where it will be decided whether Turkey meets the conditions for opening accession negotiations.

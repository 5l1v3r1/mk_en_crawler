THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal has handed its first case to a court in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), a spokesman for the international court announced on Thursday (29 September). Radovan Stankovic, a Bosnian Serb accused of rape and enslavement of Muslim women in Foca during the 1992-1995 conflict, will stand trial at the new war crimes chamber of BiH's State Court. He will be tried under BiH criminal law. The trial is expected to begin within 100 days. 
High Representative Paddy Ashdown described the transfer as recognition that the BiH court "can provide the highest international standards of justice in these most difficult, and sensitive, criminal cases". (AFP, ICTY Web site, OHR Web site, PBS BiH, Fena - 29/09/05)

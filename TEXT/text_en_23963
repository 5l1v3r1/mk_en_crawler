BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) remains unhappy with Sofia's reported progress in judicial reforms and in reducing corruption and organised crime, EC President Jose Manuel Barroso told Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev on Thursday (December 18th). Stanishev was on an official visit to Brussels, reportedly to negotiate a political compromise so that the EC does not propose activating a safeguard clause in the judicial sector. An EC delegation is expected to visit Bulgaria next month and to issue a technical report on Bulgaria's progress in reforms and absorbing EU funding in February. "The reform process must speed up rather than slow down. We need a consensus in Bulgaria that treats the fight against high-level corruption and organised crime as [an issue] of national importance," Barroso said.

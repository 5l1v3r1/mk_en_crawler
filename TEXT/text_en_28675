THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The trial of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic resumed Tuesday (April 13th) at the UN war crimes tribunal with prosecutors expected to present their first witness -- Ahmet Zulic, from Sanski Most. Last week, the tribunal turned down Karadzic's latest in a series of requests to suspend the proceedings. He maintains a fair trial is impossible, as the court has already accepted thousands of pieces of evidence from earlier cases and testimony from witnesses without giving him a chance to cross examine them. Karadzic is charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. (Beta, Politika, Radio Free Europe - 13/04/10)

STRASBOURG, France -- The Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) confirmed on Tuesday (23 August) that a delegation led by PACE rapporteur Tony Lloyd is visiting Libya to discuss the fate of five Bulgarian nurses sentenced to death on allegations that they infected patients with HIV. PACE issued a statement noting that the Bulgarians were arrested by the Libyan police in 1999 without charges and were reportedly tortured until they offered confessions. Lloyd is to prepare a report on the five prisoners. Libya's Supreme Court is expected to rule on an appeal of the death sentences in November. (Sega - 24/08/05; CoE Web site, bTV - 23/08/05)

LUXEMBOURG -- Noting that Greece is making adequate moves to cut its public deficit, EU finance ministers approved the country's revised Stability and Growth Programme on Tuesday (12 April), during a meeting in Luxembourg. The ministers also backed a stance by the European Commission (EC) earlier this month. The EC decided that since Greece is working to bring its deficit below the eurozone ceiling of 3 per cent of GDP, no further disciplinary action is needed for the time being. 
In other news Tuesday, the EC issued a final warning to Greece over continued violations of EU waste management rules on the island of Crete. An EC press release criticised Athens for failing to clean up an illegal rubbish dump, over which Greece was fined in 2000, as well as a temporary waste storage site.

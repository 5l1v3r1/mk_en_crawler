PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK has retaken control over the municipal and district courts building in the Serb-dominated northern part of Mitrovica. KFOR had been supervising them since deadly rioting there in March. UNMIK spokesman Alexander Ivanko said on Monday (September 22nd) that the courts will resume work on October 3rd, staffed initially by international judges and prosecutors. Ivanko added that UNMIK police would be positioned inside the building and around it. KFOR troops will also be deployed but in smaller numbers. On March 17th, UNMIK police stormed the building, which former Serb employees had seized, demanding to be allowed to return to their jobs. During the ensuing clashes, one Ukrainian policeman was killed and 64 UNMIK policemen were injured. Two dozen KFOR troops and several Serb demonstrators were also injured.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Parliament narrowly adopted the 2010 budget proposed by the government during a marathon session Monday (November 23rd). Just 62 of 120 lawmakers supported the draft. Opposition lawmakers boycotted the vote, arguing they "did not want to be part of manipulations with public money". The budget amounts to 1.461 billion euros, which is 6% higher than the 2009 budget. Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said that the budget is based on Kosovo's priorities that include boosting capital investments, infrastructure projects, and opening new embassies.

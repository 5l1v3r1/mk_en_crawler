OHRID, Macedonia -- The popular tourist destination Ohrid expects to attract more foreign guests this summer season than in the past. The optimism partially stems from the huge interest in the Ohrid summer festival, which opens Tuesday (12 July) with a performance by one of the world's greatest tenors, Jose Carreras. The presidents of Albania, Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro reportedly will attend the concert. (Utrinski Vesnik - 11/07/05; MIA, A1 TV - 10/07/05)

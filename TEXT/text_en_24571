ZAGREB, Croatia -- Five former Croatian military officers now face charges of committing war crimes against Serbs during the 1991-1995 conflict, state prosecutors announced on Thursday (January 8th). The five allegedly humiliated, tortured and physically and psychologically abused prisoners of war in the Lora prison in Split, southern Croatia. Many prisoners suffered serious injuries and three died, the statement said. Two of the suspects, identified by local media as former prison warden Tomislav Duic and former prison guard Emilio Bungur, are on the run. All five were part of a group of people already sentenced in absentia by the Split court in 2006. They received eight years in prison for the torture and murder of Serbs at Lora, separate from the new war crimes charges. (AFP, HINA - 08/01/09)

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- An estimated 10,000 Serbs staged a peaceful protest against Kosovo's decision to split from Serbia at a rally in Banka Luka on Tuesday (February 26th), organised by the Serbian Movement of NGOs (SPONA). Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik told the crowd that BiH would never recognise Kosovo, even under pressure from the West. He added that if any attempt to abolish BiH's present constitutional order is made, he would immediately organise a referendum on independence.
Shortly after the rally ended, a small group marched to the US consulate in Banja Luka, destroying several shops and vehicles along the way. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowd. The United States said it has temporarily sent its Banja Luka staff to Sarajevo, in anticipation of more demonstrations.

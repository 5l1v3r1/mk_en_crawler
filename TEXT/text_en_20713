BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU finance ministers plan to criticise Montenegro's adoption of the euro as its national currency, according to a draft of a memo circulated by the international media Sunday (October 7th). It denounces the practice of adopting the single European currency unilaterally. Montenegro adopted the euro in 2002 while it was still part of a union with Serbia. Kosovo is also unilaterally using the European currency. The statement is expected to be adopted ahead of the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Montenegro next week.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Construction of a bridge connecting the Peljesac peninsula with the mainland starts on Wednesday (October 24th). The bridge, which will be the biggest in the Western Balkans, should be finished in four years. Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) has opposed the facility, initially claiming it would block access of large ships to its Neum harbour. Croatia sought to accommodate Sarajevo by changing the design of the bridge. But earlier this year, BiH renewed its protest, insisting construction should be postponed until issues regarding sea borders between the two countries are resolved.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The first war crimes trial of Serbs started in Republika Srpska (RS) on Monday (17 May). Eleven former police officers are charged with detaining and then murdering an ethnic Croat priest, Father Tomislav Matanovic, and his parents in the summer of 1995. Their bodies were discovered in a mineshaft in 2001. The UN war crimes tribunal authorised holding the trial in RS.
Also Monday, the RS government demanded the immediate resignations of special police chief Dragan Lukic and his deputy, Dragan Ribic. At issue was a botched raid seeking indicted war criminals that ended up killing a civilian. (OHR Sources, Nezavisne novine, Dnevni avaz - 18/05/04; AFP, Fena, PBS BiH, RTRS - 17/05/04)

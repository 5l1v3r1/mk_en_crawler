BELGRADE, Serbia -- Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac announced on Thursday (March 19th) that Serbia expected to maintain its record-level arms exports this year but will cut the workforce at its weapon plants to boost profits. Arms sales are an important industry, accounting for 4% of the country's total exports. A government report on the industry's development last year listed the United States, Iraq, Libya, Burma and Israel among the country's export destinations. (Tanjug, Biznis Novine, MIA - 19/03/09)

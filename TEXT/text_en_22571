SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj on Saturday (May 10th) rejected speculation that the country's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU is being delayed for non-technical reasons. He said the EU's translation office is currently translating the document into all EU languages but will not be able to meet an expected deadline of May 26th. He added, however, that the work will certainly be finished by June 16th. Alkalaj added that EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana has announced that the SAA should enter into force on July 1st.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Secretary of State Colin Powell called on Bosnians to vote for reform or return to "the dark and dangerous path of ethnic divisions, economic stagnation and international isolation." In a televised address Monday night (30 September), he urged voters to elect "those who will continue to work on democracy, prosperity and peace." The EU also issued a statement, saying voters have the opportunity to elect a government that would lead them towards Union membership. BiH will elect a central parliament, its tripartite presidency and the assemblies of the Serb and the Muslim-Croat entities on Saturday.
In other news, the BiH State Border Service on Monday assumed control over the Strmica border crossing with Croatia, thus officially taking full control over the entire 1,500-km borderline. (OHR Sources - 01/10/02; AFP, UNMIBH web site, PBS BiH, RTRS - 30/09/02)

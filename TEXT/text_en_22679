SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Opposition parties have agreed to file a common no-confidence motion against the government based on its failure to meet EU membership standards, the co-chairman of the Bulgarian People's Union, Stefan Sofiyanski, said on Thursday (July 10th). The main reason for the motion is damage stemming from the non-absorption of European structural-aid funds. Within a year and a half of EU membership, Bulgaria has lost over 1 billion euros due to incompetency, and there is no guarantee of recouping the funds in the next few months, Sofiyanski said. The opposition hopes to collect signatures necessary to submit the motion within a week. (24 hours, Dnevnik - 11/07/08, BTA, BTV, Mediapool, BNR - 10/07/08)

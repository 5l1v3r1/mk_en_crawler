SOFIA, Bulgaria -- At least four people were killed Sunday (August 26th) by wildfires that burned several homes to the ground. Two died in Haskovo and two more died in Svilengrad, where local authorities have declared a state of emergency. High winds whipped the flames to the border of northwestern Turkey.
Romania, meanwhile, is fighting heavy rains and hurricane-force winds, on the heels of last week's devastating heat wave. Two people died on Sunday, including a child. Storms and flooding have cut off electricity in central, northern and eastern Romania. Authorities are evacuating stranded tourists in Brasov County. The historic Sambata de Sus monastery has been badly damaged by flooding. (Hotnews.ro - 27/08/07; BTA, BGNES, Focus, Darik, ITAR-TASS, Makfax, AFP, Realitatia, AP, News in, BBC - 26/08/07)

TIRANA, Albania -- US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Countryman urged institutions in Albania on Wednesday (February 9th) to respect the constitution. Preparations for the May local elections should go as planned and any boycott is unacceptable, Countryman said. He also noted that Washington offers its full support to prosecutors investigating the violent demonstrations of January 21st. He met with President Bamir Topi, government and opposition leaders, urging all parties to start dialogue and find a solution to demonstrate that the rule of law is applied in a NATO-member country. Countryman was supposed to visit Kosovo but that changed due to "travel problems", the US Embassy in Pristina announced. (Shekulli, Top Channel, VoA, Balkan Web - 09/02/11)

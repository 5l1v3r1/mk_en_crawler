SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH presidency confirmed four appointees to the future BiH armed forces' general staff on Wednesday (5 May) and forwarded the nominations to parliament for approval. The four passed SFOR's vetting process. Acting Chairman Sulejman Tihic said the presidency wants meetings with the SFOR command and the Office of the High Representative before continuing the process, to seek procedural clarifications. He has said he does not intend to nominate new candidates until that happens. (OHR Sources - 06/05/04; PBS BiH - 05/05/04)

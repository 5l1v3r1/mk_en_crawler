BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government decided on Thursday (April 17th) to go ahead with local elections in Kosovo despite UNMIK's opposition. Serbian Trade Minister Predrag Bubalo said correspondence with UNMIK is ongoing but that "whatever UNMIK's answer may be, elections will be held in Kosovo and Metohija". Serbia is due to elect a new parliament and local officials on May 11th. 
According to media reports in Kosovo, UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker has told Belgrade that organising Serbian local elections in Kosovo would violate UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and would be inconsistent with UNMIK's authority in Kosovo. He reiterated that UNMIK would accept holding Serbian parliamentary elections in Kosovo. Belgrade wants to organise local elections in 23 municipalities where Serbs live. Serbian Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic has suggested Ruecker "close his eyes" on May 11th, saying the UNMIK chief had already done so on February 17th when Kosovo declared independence.

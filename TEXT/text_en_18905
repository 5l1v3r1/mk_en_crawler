TRIPOLI, Libya -- Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi on Thursday (January 4th) dismissed calls for the immediate release of five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor as "meaningless nonsense". Talking to a gathering of officials, religious leaders and reporters in Tripoli, Qaddafi went on to say that the international charitable fund, established by Bulgaria and the EU to care for HIV-infected children in Benghazi, is a lie and that no money has been donated to it. EC and several member states have disbursed some 3.5m euros to the fund in 2005 and 2006, while Bulgaria has sent medical equipment worth some 300,000 euros. Qaddafi is seeking 4.4 billion euros in compensation. (Sega, Financial Times - 05/01/07; bTV, Nova TV, Focus, Darik Radio, BNR - 04/01/07)

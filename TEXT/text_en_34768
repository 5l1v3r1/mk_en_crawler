PLOVDIV, Bulgaria -- The second contingent of the 450-strong Bulgarian military unit being deployed in Iraq left for Kuwait on Monday (11 August). The 145 servicemen will join an advance team of 30 soldiers who left for the region late last month. The rest will arrive later this week. The soldiers will spend several days in a transit camp in Kuwait, awaiting the arrival of heavy weaponry and equipment to be delivered by ship. The Bulgarian unit is to be deployed south of Baghdad and will be part of the Polish-led multinational division. (Dnevnik, Trud, 24 Chassa, Sega - 12/08/03; BTA, BNT, bTV - 11/08/03)

ATHENS, Greece -- Actress Thalia Prokopiou on Thursday (25 March) lit the Olympic flame, starting the countdown to the Summer Games on 13 August. The ceremony involves catching sunlight in a concave mirror and directing the rays to the torch. Thursday's ceremony went off without a hitch. Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis invited people all over the world to attend the "best and safest Olympic Games". In his speech, International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge praised the hosts for organising the first ever global tour of the Olympic flame. Torchbearers plan to carry it to five continents, as symbolised by the interlocking Olympic rings. (Reuters, AFP, ANA. MPA - 25/03/04)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko reiterated on Thursday (May 12th) that if Republika Srpska (RS) does not give up its plans to hold a referendum on the legitimacy of state-level court and prosecution, he would have to block it because it is illegal. He also told the Dnevni Avaz newspaper he could consider more serious sanctions against RS including the replacement of President Milorad Dodik. 
Meanwhile, it was announced that EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton arrived for a surprise visit to Sarajevo late Thursday. She meets with Inzko and Dodik on Friday. 
Dodik, for his part, demonstrated readiness to withdraw the referendum plan if the EU meets his political demands. RS wants to initiate a debate on judicial reform to guarantee unbiased state courts and prosecutions. The EU has said it would be ready to debate that. (RTS, SRNA, Dnevni Avaz - 12/05/11)

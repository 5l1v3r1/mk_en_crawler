SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Council of Europe (CoE) Secretary-General Thorbjorn Jagland voiced hope Monday (April 12th) that the name dispute between Skopje and Athens would not overshadow Macedonia's priorities at the helm of the organisation. Macedonia takes over the chairmanship of the organisation's Committee of Ministers in May. Jagland met with Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki, who said Macedonia's priorities would include the rule of law, human rights, and the social inclusion of all marginalised groups in Europe.

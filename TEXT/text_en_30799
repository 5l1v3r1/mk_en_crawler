BRUSSELS, Belgium -- High Representative Valentin Inzko said on Monday (April 4th) that speculation about the disintegration of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is unacceptable. Inzko was in Brussels for talks with EU officials about reinforcing the bloc's presence in BiH. Inzko told reporters that the new representative of the EU in BiH will be in charge of the reforms process related to Union integration and will be able to impose sanctions on politicians who obstruct the reform process and the normal functioning of local institutions. The Office of the High Representative is expected to be relocated outside of BiH. (Beta, Blic, Tanjug, Radio Free Europe - 04/04/11)

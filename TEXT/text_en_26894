ATHENS, Greece -- Police arrested a suspected member of the Conspiracy Nuclei of Fire terrorist organisation Tuesday (January 5th). Nikos Bakopoulos, 26, was detained based on an arrest warrant issued last week. His fingerprints matched those discovered by police at a place where the organisation is believed to hold meetings in the Athens district of Halandri. Bakopoulos was also arrested in May 2006, over incidents during an Athens rally by the European Social Forum. Under Greek law, anyone found guilty of belonging to an outlawed terror group faces up to life in prison. (Reuters, Sky - 05/01/10)

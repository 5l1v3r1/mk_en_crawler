PRISTINA, Kosovo -- European Parliament (EP) member Doris Pack says Kosovo needs 12 to 18 months to meet the EU-set criteria before it can benefit from visa liberalisation. "It depends on politics. If Kosovo authorities work faster, the processes can move faster too," Pack was quoted as saying by public broadcaster RTK on Sunday (February 7th). Pack said progress generally has been uneven. She noted that many Serbs participated in the November municipal elections, describing their involvement as key to the process. (Info Press, Epoka e Re - 08/02/10; RTK, Telegrafi - 07/02/10)

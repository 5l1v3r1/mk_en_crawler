ANKARA, Turkey -- Visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Ankara on Monday (March 29th) to open its ports and airports to Cypriot vessels and aircraft. Speaking at a joint press conference with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Merkel said that the enduring fight over Cyprus is the main barrier to Turkey's EU membership bid. She opposes full membership, backing instead privileged partnership, which Ankara rejects. 
Merkel and Erdogan also discussed the Turkish minority in Germany. Erdogan recently said they should be allowed to open Turkish schools. Merkel said on Monday that the idea does not trouble her, but insisted the Ã©migrÃ©s must also become integrated into German society, including learning to speak German.

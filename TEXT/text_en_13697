TIRANA, Albania -- The Democratic Party (DP) declared victory Monday (22 August) in two of three constituencies -- in Lushnje and Gjirokaster -- that held rerun elections Sunday. The party also expects to win the repeated vote in the third constituency, in Shkoder. The Central Election Commission is expected to announce the official results Tuesday. The reruns had to be held due to irregularities in the 3 July parliamentary elections, which were won by the DP.

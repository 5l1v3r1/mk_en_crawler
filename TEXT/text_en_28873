ZAGREB, Croatia -- Ivan Mravak, a former CEO of Croatia's state-owned power company, was arrested Friday (May 7th) on suspicion of embezzling millions of euros. He was sacked from his post last September. Under his management, Hrvatska Elektroprivreda (HEP) allegedly purchased electricity at high prices via international tenders, but then sold it to a private local company at prices that were several times lower. Croatia's anti-corruption agency, USKOK, says HEP suffered 82m euros in losses due to fraud perpetrated by Mravak and two others. (HRT, Vecernji List, Jutarnji List, AFP - 07/05/10)

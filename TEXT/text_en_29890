TIRANA, Albania -- Residents of the city of Fushe-Kruja spent the weekend signing a petition against the upcoming census, media reported on Sunday (March 27th). An alliance of organisations gathered under the name "Red and Black" are opposing the census, which will require citizens to state their religion and ethnicity. Concerns have been growing that many are willing to change their original identity for benefits offered by neighbouring Greece. About 20,000 signatures are necessary for the petition to be submitted to parliament. The alliance claims they have collected 50,000 signatures. The government had already decided to postpone the census from April until the autumn to avoid overlap with campaigning ahead of the May 8th local elections.

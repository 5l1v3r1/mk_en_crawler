BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The former prime ministers of Italy, Sweden and Belgium and the former president of Germany have written a letter to EU leaders, urging them to continue with the Union's enlargement in the Balkans. "Europe can survive the crisis with the European constitution. What Europe cannot survive is a new Srebrenica," Giuliano Amato, Carl Bildt, Jean-Luc Dehaene and Richard von WeizsÃ¤cker wrote in their message, addressed to the upcoming EU summit. They argued that Europe's problems must not allow the "quest for peace" to pause.
The EU foreign ministers decided meanwhile to drop the item on the Union's enlargement from the agenda of the summit. International media interpreted this decision as an attempt to avoid further controversy following the scuttling of the European Constitution at referenda in France and the Netherlands.

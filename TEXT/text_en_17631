BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament's lower house overwhelmingly approved a bill Tuesday (March 27th) concerning the access high-ranking officials have to classified information. The measure stipulates that access would be limited to material that pertains only to their official duties, in a bid to strengthen control over the work of the secret services and security agencies. 
In other news Tuesday, President Traian Basescu met with the chairman of the Czech Senate, Premysl Sobotka. They discussed bilateral co-operation opportunities, particularly the Czech Republic's offer to help Romania better utilise EU structural funds. (Nine O'clock - 28/03/07; Rompres - 27/03/07)

LUDWIGSHAFEN, Germany -- Thousands of Turks and Germans gathered on Sunday (February 10th) to mourn the victims of a fire in Ludwigshafen that killed nine Turks and injured 60 others last week. The coffins were covered with Turkish flags and placed in front of the ruins of the building where the fire occurred. The blaze angered many in Turkey who suspect it was arson prompted by xenophobia against Germany's largest immigrant community. Police continue to investigate the incident. The bodies of the victims, including five children, will be returned to their hometown in the southeast Anatolian province of Gaziantep, for burial. (Zaman - 11/02/08; Deutsche Welle, AP - 10/02/08)

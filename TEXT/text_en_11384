PARIS, France -- Parliament Speaker Jean-Louis Debre and his Croatian counterpart, Vladimir Seks, agreed on Wednesday (26 January) that Zagreb's talks on EU membership should start on 17 March, as scheduled. The officials met on the second day of Seks' two-day visit to the French capital. Seks reiterated that Croatia is making every effort to remove obstacles. Zagreb's incomplete co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal is considered the key stumbling block that needs to be addressed.
Also Wednesday, Croatian President Stipe Mesic met with Prime Minister Ivo Sanader for the first time since Mesic's re-election. The talks were aimed at harmonising institutional positions ahead of the EU accession talks. (Vecernji list - 27/01/05; HINA, HRT, Index.hr - 26/01/05)

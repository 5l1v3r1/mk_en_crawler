ATHENS, Greece -- Four policemen have been suspended over a controversial video that shows police abusing two detainees -- an Albanian immigrant and a Greek citizen -- at the Omonia police station in central Athens last June. The footage, captured on a mobile phone and aired on Greek national TV on Saturday (June 16th), shows one of the officers beating the detainees, who were also verbally abused and forced to hit each other. They had been arrested for allegedly trying to steal a purse. Two other policemen apparently watched the beatings, as their voices can be heard in the background. All three were suspended, along with the head of the police station, who was not involved but has been ordered to stay away until an investigation is complete.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Ion Iliescu defended his country's support for the US position on Iraq in an article Monday (17 March) in <I>The Washington Post</I>. He wrote that his people's thirst for democracy and freedom were compelling his government to line up with the United States."We know the difference between good and evil because we have seen evil's face," Iliescu said, referring to former Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. "Some dictatorships decay over decades, some crumble in months. But some dictatorships disintegrate in hours when the people are aware of their right to live in freedom and wish to make their voices heard." (The Washington Post - 17/03/03)

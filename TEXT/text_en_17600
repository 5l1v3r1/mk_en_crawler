PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- A bomb went off outside a building in the town of Gnjilane early Sunday (January 28th). The explosion damaged part of the structure but caused no injuries. The building previously belonged to the local branch of the ruling Democratic League of Kosovo. Recently, however, a faction led by former Parliament Speaker Nejad Daci split to form the Democratic League, which may be using it now. (RTS, AP - 28/01/07)

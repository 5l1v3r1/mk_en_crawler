TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition New Democrat Party (NDP) has filed a request for debates and a possible no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Fatos Nano. NDP official Nard Ndoka said on Friday (21 May) that the party initiated the move in response to the worsening economy. Debate would focus on the gray economy, corruption and domestic market monopolies. NDP tried last year to force Nano from office but failed to attract support from other right-wing parties.

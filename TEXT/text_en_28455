ANKARA, Turkey -- Cabinet ministers and senior representatives of the EU will hold a critical meeting Tuesday (July 13th) in Istanbul. Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and chief EU negotiator Egemen Bagis will lead the Turkish delegation. The EU will be represented by foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele, and European Commission (EC) and the EU Council officials. The ministerial-level political dialogue meeting will discuss counter-terrorist measures, the latest constitutional reform efforts, Iran's nuclear programme, the Israeli raid on a Turkish-led aid flotilla that left nine people dead, and other issues. Bagis told the local press Monday that the meeting will not discuss Turkey's EU process alone, rather, would include regional and global issues. Diplomatic sources say the Turkish delegation is expected to ask for more effective support from the EC and EU member countries to fight the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Turkey is determined to continue seeking the extradition of top PKK leaders from Europe. (Hurriyet, Anadolu news agency - 12/07/10)

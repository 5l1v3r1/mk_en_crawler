TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi on Thursday (May 19th) voiced regret that European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso opted to cancel his planned visit to Tirana, due to political tensions stemming from the vote count in Tirana's mayoral election. Topi said it is a lost chance for Albania to get closer to the EU. "The main responsibility for the delaying of this possibility falls squarely on the Albanian political parties, their leadership, militants and their behaviour," Topi said. 
Barroso was scheduled to visit on Friday as part of a Balkan tour, to offer support to reforms that would help the country achieve benchmarks needed for EU membership. A spokesperson explained that discussion with political leaders would not be productive at this stage. (News 24, VoA, Top Channel, Balkan Web - 19/05/11)

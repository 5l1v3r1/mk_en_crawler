VIENNA, Austria -- A court in Salzburg on Monday (December 27th) extended by one month the custody of former Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader. A local judge cited the possibility that he is a flight risk who might try to tamper with evidence. The next hearings in the case are scheduled for January 27th. This week however, the court will discuss Croatia's request for extradition. Sanader was arrested on December 10th in Austria based on an international arrest warrant issued by Croatia, where he is being investigated for possible criminal actions and abuse of power.

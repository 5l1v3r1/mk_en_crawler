ANKARA, Turkey -- With the resignation of Deniz Baykal, longtime leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), a fresh split has arisen within the party. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, deputy chairman of CHP's parliamentary group, has declared his candidacy for the post, sparking immediate debate. During meetings of provincial party leaders on Tuesday (May 18th), Kilicdaroglu attracted significant support. But the party's Central Decision and Administration Board is urging Baykal to reconsider his resignation and return to the post. He stepped down after video surfaced on the internet this month, showing him in an affair with a female CHP lawmaker, eight years ago. The party holds its convention at the weekend to decide between Baykal and Kilicdaroglu. (Radikal, Hurriyet, Zaman, Sabah, Cumhurriyet - 19/05/10; Journal of Turkish Weekly - 18/05/10)

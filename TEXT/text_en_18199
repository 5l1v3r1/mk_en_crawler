BELGRADE, Serbia -- NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer expressed support Friday (July 13th) for a new Western-sponsored draft resolution on Kosovo at the UN Security Council, saying that it might be the "last chance" for a controlled political solution to the status issue. De Hoop Scheffer was in Belgrade for talks with officials including Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic. The Serbian officials reiterated their objections to both the Ahtisaari plan and the new UN draft resolution, insisting that the outcome must respect Serbia's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

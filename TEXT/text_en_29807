TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament adopted a financial amnesty measure Thursday (April 21st) despite protests from the opposition. The amnesty covers all debts accumulated before 2008 in the form of fines and obligations on energy and water supply fees, vehicle fees and social insurance contributions. The main opposition Socialist Party (SP) accused the government of using the measure to win votes in the May 8th local elections. Opposition lawmakers urged the government to pull the draft back for discussion in hopes of reaching a broad consensus on the issue. (Shekulli, News 24, TVSH, Klan - 21/04/11)

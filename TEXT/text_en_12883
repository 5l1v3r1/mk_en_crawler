SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Academy of Science is hosting a two-day seminar dedicated to the current demographic dynamics, in light of the 2002 census. There will be 26 scientific presentations on the topic. Cvetan Grozdanov, president of the Macedonian Academy of Science and Art, said Thursday (2 June) that the previous census could have been biased, given the general political and economic environment in which it was conducted.
In other news, Canada announced on Thursday that it would recognise Macedonia only under the name that results from negotiations between Skopje and Athens. Ottawa also insists that the name dispute be resolved under the auspices of the UN. (Telma TV, MPA - 02/06/05)

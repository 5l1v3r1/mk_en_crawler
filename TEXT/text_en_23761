SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Croatian parliament member Branimir Glavas has received an ID card confirming his BiH citizenship, media reported on Wednesday (May 20th). According to the Zagreb daily Vecernji List, Glavas is now a resident of the Bosnian town of Ljubuski. He fled to BiH earlier this month after being sentenced in Zagreb to ten years in prison for war crimes committed against Serb civilians during Croatia's war of independence in the early 1990s. Last week, he was detained briefly by Bosnian police on an international arrest warrant issued by Croatia. He was released after the State Court ruled there are no grounds for detention because of his valid BiH citizenship documents. (Fonet, B92, Vecernji list, RTRS, SRNA - 20/05/09)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- NATO peacekeeping troops will transfer responsibility for the protection of the Gracanica Serb Orthodox Monastery to the Kosovo police. KFOR Commander Markus Bentler said Thursday (August 5th) that the move came as a result of the improved security situation in Kosovo. Media quoted Bishop Teodosije of Lipljan as saying that this decision was not taken with the consent of the Serbian Orthodox Church, and will jeopardise the security of eight monasteries in Kosovo. 
In other news, Kosovo police and EULEX officials came under attack in two separate incidents in the country's north. A EULEX patrol was stoned as it was coming back from the Brnjak border crossing, and a Kosovo police bus was stoned close to the village Ibarska Sllatina of Leposavic. No one was hurt in either incident. Local media are reporting that the attacks were carried out by Serb extremists.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu said on Friday (June 20th) that Kosovo will not launch status new talks with Serbia and would never agree to the secession of its northern part. "Kosovo exists for all of its citizens. This is a multiethnic community with territorial integrity that enjoys international protection," the president said. 
Separately Saturday, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica thanked Moscow for preventing the UN Security Council from adopting Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's proposal on handing over UNMIK's authorities in Kosovo to EULEX. "Russia has been consistently defending the UN statutes and the acting Resolution 1244, which guarantees the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia," Kostunica said.

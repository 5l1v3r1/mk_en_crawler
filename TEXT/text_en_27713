TIRANA, Albania -- Authorities in Tirana smashed a ring of forgers Saturday (October 23rd) who had allegedly set up equipment to produce fake documents. The economic and financial crime units, together with Tirana prosecutors, raided a dozen locations in the capital, arresting ten people. Seized items seized included scanners for producing documents, blank forms, Schengen visas, permits and other travel documents. Police say the ring forged documents, ID cards, passports and visas, stamps and forms, and assisted in illegal border crossings. Each document sold for between 800 and 4,000 euros. Experts say it is highly possible that state officials and embassy staff were also involved. (Top Channel, Lajmifundit, VoA, Shekulli - 24/10/10)

The song "Lako je sve" ["Everything is Easy"] by Croatian pop group Feminnem won the best song at the Croatian Eurosong competition earlier this month in Opatija. The ballad received the most national jury and tele-voting votes. 
The band represented Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 2005 Eurovision contest. This year, Pamela Ramljak, Nika Antolos and Neda Parmac, members of the trio will represent Croatia in Oslo. 
This is the group's third attempt to win Europe's best song contest. Last year they came in 2nd place. In 2005, the band finished at 14th. 
All three members of the group started their careers as talent show contestants. Ramljak and Parmac are original band members. Antolos, 20, is the newest member. 
 Feminnem has participated in all regional festivals while scoring a handful of mainstream pop hits. 
The band said that they are "sure" of a win in Oslo and hoped they can meet the expectation of their fans. 
There was much excitement and many tears amid campaigning for votes, including on Facebook, where band members communicate daily with fans. 
Scandals are a regular occurrence at national song contests in Opatija and this year was no exception. The media questioned the authenticity of the song, claiming it sounds much like the Russian 2008 Eurovision winner, "Believe". 
Branimir Mihaljevic -- composer of "Everything Is Easy" -- dismissed the accusations. 
Croatian contestants at Eurovision have not been successful in the past with serious debate whether the Balkan nation should compete this year. Last year's representative from Croatia -- Igor Cukrov singing his ballad "Lijepa Tena" -- placed 18th.

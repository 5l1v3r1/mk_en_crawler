BUCHAREST, Romania -- Candidates running in the November 30th parliamentary elections must -- for the first time -- pay for airtime on private radio and TV stations during the campaign, the National Audiovisual Council (CNA) said on Tuesday (September 30th). Airtime on public TV and radio, however, will be free, the CNA announced, as will be access to talk shows. CNA President Rasvan Popescu says each private TV and radio station can set its own rates, though they must be uniform for all candidates. (Realitatea TV, Mediafax, Ziare - 30/09/08)

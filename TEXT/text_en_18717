SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Opposition members are demanding the resignation of Interior Minister Rumen Petkov, blaming him for alleged police brutality that occurred during a protest by miners at the Maritza Iztok complex Thursday (July 5th). The Democrats for Strong Bulgaria and nationalists from Ataka say police exceeded their authority in trying to get the rally under control. Petkov says they acted in full compliance with the law.

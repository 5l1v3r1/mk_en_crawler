PRISTINA, Kosovo -- KFOR confirmed on Tuesday (September 15th) that the Kosovo Security Force (KSF) has reached its initial operational capacity, making it fully functional. The KSF is a non-military, multi-ethnic lightly armed force under civil control. The 2,500-strong mission is to act in cases of natural disasters and other emergencies. The first group of members came from the Kosovo Protection Corps, which was dissolved in June. 
In other news Tuesday, a group of Kosovo hackers attacked 15 Serbian websites, including those of the Defence Ministry, government departments and museums. The Kosova Hackers Group, known for posting the Albanian double-headed eagle in its messages, disabled the websites. The police agreement reached between EULEX and Belgrade last week is believed to be the motive. Late last month, the group hacked into EULEX's website to protest the agreement.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- On Thursday (14 November), High Representative Paddy Ashdown removed Pero Markovic, general manager of the forestry company Suma Herceg Bosne and former president of the municipality of Capljina. Markovic was removed for what was described as his long record of grossly and exceptionally mismanaging public resources. Among other things, he transferred ownership shares to the financial detriment of his municipality and offered land plots to associations in which he was a member. Markovic is currently charged with several cases of gross mismanagement, amounting to criminal conduct.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The country's relations with NATO have become a hot button issue after the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), one of the ruling coalition members, used sharp rhetoric against the Alliance. Over the past few weeks, several DSS ministers and senior party officials accused NATO of wanting to create its own military state in Kosovo. On Monday (September 3rd), Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's DSS officially proposed scheduling a parliamentary debate on Serbia-NATO relations and the adoption of a measure that would bar Serbia from joining the Alliance.
In response, President Boris Tadic, leader of the Democratic Party, issued a statement Monday warning that it is "extremely harmful" to discuss proposals based on expectations of a negative outcome of the ongoing Kosovo status talks. He urged all politicians to put the interests of the state before those of their parties. (Vecernji Novosti - 04/09/07; Beta, B92, RTS - 03/09/07)

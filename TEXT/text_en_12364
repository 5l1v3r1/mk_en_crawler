WASHINGTON, United States -- The top US and NATO military commander in Europe, General James Jones, told a House of Representatives committee Wednesday (9 March) that negotiations on establishing US bases in Bulgaria and Romania will start very soon. Jones said the Pentagon was now "at the launching point, as opposed to the conceptual point" of its redeployment plans. He said a rotational brigade, typically consisting of between 3,000 and 5,000 troops, would be deployed in the two Balkan countries as part of the Pentagon's plans to restructure deployment around the world. Jones praised Bulgaria and Romania as "extraordinarily accommodating" and expressed a strong desire to have part of the US European Command on their soil. (VOA - 09/03/05)

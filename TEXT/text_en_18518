NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The tripartite ruling coalition broke up on Tuesday (July 10th) after the largest party in parliament, the Communist Party (AKEL), withdrew from the government. The news was confirmed after a meeting among President Tassos Papadopoulos and leaders of the three parties -- AKEL, Papadopoulos' Democratic Party and the Movement of Social Democrats. It was announced that AKEL's four ministers would step down and the president would appoint replacements. The split followed a recent decision of AKEL not to back Papadopoulos' bid for a second term in the February 2008 presidential elections. Media reports suggest AKEL views Papadopoulos' approach to reunification efforts as too hardline. (Kathimerini, Politis - 11/07/07; CNA - 10/07/07)

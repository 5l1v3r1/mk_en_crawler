ATHENS, Greece -- The government has rejected calls from the opposition to put the new European Constitution to a popular vote. A spokesman for the cabinet told reporters on Friday (29 October) that parliament would ratify the new European main law. Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis was quoted as saying that Greece, particularly its islands and tourist industry, would benefit from the constitution. Socialist leader George Papandreou had called for the referendum. 
In other news, Greece and Albania have agreed to revise school textbooks in both countries and remove passages promoting hostility or hatred. Both Athens and Tirana are expected to form special commissions for the task.
Meanwhile, a new report by Greek police finds organised crime was less active last year than in 2002. But police found increased activity by foreigners, especially by gangs in the border areas of northwest and eastern Greece. (Kathimerini - 30/10/04; AFP, MPA - 29/10/04)

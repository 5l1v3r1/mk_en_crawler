ANKARA, Turkey -- Seven Turkish soldiers died when their outpost in eastern Turkey came under attack by members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) on Monday (June 4th). Three guerrillas rammed a vehicle into the military post and threw hand grenades at the troops. The soldiers returned fire, killing one of the attackers, who was wearing a suicide explosive belt. The other guerrillas escaped after suffering injuries. News of the attack came as Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul was meeting senior EU officials. They discussed, among other issues, the problem of PKK terrorism and Turkey's warnings that it might launch strikes across the border with Iraq. (AP, DW - 04/06/07)

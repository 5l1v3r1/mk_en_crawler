BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica called on voters to go to the polls during Sunday's (8 December) Serbian presidential elections. Wrapping up his campaign Thursday with a final rally in Belgrade, Kostunica insisted that a high voter turnout is necessary, both to validate the election results and to continue reform efforts. If none of the candidates receives 50 per cent of the vote, there will be a runoff on 22 December. (B92, BBC, Tanjug - 05/12/02)

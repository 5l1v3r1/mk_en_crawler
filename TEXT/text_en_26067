TIRANA, Albania -- The Council of Ministers decided on Wednesday (October 14th) to establish a one-stop control system at all borders, including ports. Prime Minister Sali Berisha said that bringing the police, customs and other necessary border controls together will simplify procedures for both officials and members of the public. He added that Albania is only doing what other countries did nearly ten years ago. (NOA, Telegrafi, Top News - 14/10/09)

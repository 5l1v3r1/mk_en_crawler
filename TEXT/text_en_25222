ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police detained former Economy Minister Damir Polancec on Tuesday (March 30th) and took him in for questioning in Zagreb regarding business deals involving local food producer Podravka. Last year, several company officials were detained over their alleged involvement in a series of illicit financial transactions that began in 2006. Investigators say the suspects intended to buy out Podravka's shares and take over the firm using its own money, which cost the country losses of 34.5m euros. Polancec resigned from the cabinet in October amid strong public criticism. He worked at Podravka prior to his 2005 government appointment. (Vecernji list, HRT, Index, Nova TV, Tanjug - 30/03/10)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The EU funding source known as Pillar with UNMIK will cease its activity by June 30th since the European Commission has decided against funding it any longer. Pillar with UNMIK head Paul Acda said on Friday (April 4th) that most of the economic competencies will be transferred to the Kosovo government, in line with former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's blueprint for final status. Acda explained that the move is also consistent with the deployment of an EU police and judicial mission to Kosovo. 
In other news Friday, the Mitrovica Municipal Assembly called for the dismissal of UNMIK Regional Administrator for Mitrovica Gerard Gallucci. Mitrovica Mayor Bajram Rexhepi says the catalyst was Gallucci's response to unrest on March 17th following the take-over of the courthouse in northern Mitrovica by Serbs. Rexhepi says Gallucci wanted extensive talks with protesters while "we demanded that the rule of law be restored." 
On Sunday, meanwhile, the NGO "Cohu" (Wake up!) filed a complaint with Kosovo's Special Prosecution Office against Prime Minister Hashim Thaci. Cohu accuses him of conflict of interest and corruption, stemming from appointments made to the agency responsible for the privatisation process.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- On Thursday (17 July), parliament approved the cabinet reshuffle announced Wednesday by Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg. The vote followed heated debates on the proposed changes, with the opposition insisting they do not go far enough. Some described the establishment of the post of deputy prime minister for European integration as inappropriate. But Saxe-Coburg says the move sends a clear signal regarding Bulgarian integration into the EU.
In other news Thursday, Energy Minister Milko Kovachev discussed joint energy projects with US Deputy Commerce Secretary Samuel Bodman. They also discussed the possible participation of US companies in the privatisation of the regional power distributors, as well as in the tenders for gas distribution licenses.

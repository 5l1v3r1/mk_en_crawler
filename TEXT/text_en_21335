NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat say they are upbeat about upcoming reunification talks, expected to begin in three weeks, according to separate statements Tuesday (May 27th). Christofias met with leaders of Greek Cypriot parliamentary parties to brief them on discussions between two task forces preparing for the talks. "This is our goal: to have a clear basis ... to decide on a date to start face-to-face negotiations," Christofias said. "I am really optimistic, because there is a change on the Greek Cypriot side," Talat told AP. (AP, Financial Mirror, DPA - 27/05/08)

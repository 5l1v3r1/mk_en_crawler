BELGRADE, Serbia -- The country's war crimes prosecutors said on Wednesday (9 August) that they have launched a probe into crimes allegedly committed by two former Bosnian Serb paramilitary commanders, Branko Grujic and Branko Popovic, against the civilian population in the BiH municipality of Zvornik. Prosecution spokesman Bruno Vekaric says the two are suspected of ordering the killings of some 700 Bosniak civilians from villages around Zvornik in early June 1992. The bodies were buried in different locations, in an effort to cover up the crime. (RTS, PBS BiH - 09/08/06)

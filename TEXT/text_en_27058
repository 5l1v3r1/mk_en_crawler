PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Education Minister Sreten Skuletic tendered his resignation Wednesday (December 30th), citing insufficient public support for implementing reforms in the sector. He mentioned in particular the Cetinje Gymnasium, where last autumn high school students staged a 40-day protest after the Education Ministry voided a decision by the local board in July to re-appoint their principal to another year-long term.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Police arrested senior Democratic Union of Integration (DUI) member Sadul Duraku on Sunday (6 October), charging him with treason and war crimes. An interior ministry spokesman said Duraku's alleged crimes were not covered by the amnesty granted NLA fighters under the Ohrid peace accords. Unofficial reports said he was being charged in connection with cutting the water supply to Kumanovo during last year's insurgency. DUI members are complaining the move is aimed at raising tensions in the last days of Ljubco Georgievski's cabinet. There is also an outstanding arrest warrant against DUI leader Ali Ahmeti, who led the now disbanded NLA. (Dnevnik, Utrinski vesnik - 07/10/02; AFP, MIA, A1 TV - 06/10/02)

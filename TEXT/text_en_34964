ZENICA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR personnel raided the village of Serici near Zenica Thursday (11 December), blocking it off for about four hours. Witnesses told local media that SFOR helicopters were included in the operation and that civilians were barred from entering the area. SFOR says it was part of the Operation Harvest weapons collection programme, but the media is reporting that the raid was actually related to suspected connections to the al-Qaeda terrorist network. Two computers were confiscated from targeted houses. (OHR Sources - 12/12/03; PBS BiH, Onasa, Fena, BBC - 11/12/03)

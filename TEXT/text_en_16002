SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The ultranationalist opposition formation Attack, the fourth largest power in parliament, is close to collapse over a growing scandal involving leader Volen Siderov and his deputy, Pavel Chernev, according to local press reports Tuesday (18 April). Two weeks ago, the two reportedly were involved in a traffic accident and ensuing altercation, but accounts of the incident have been constantly changing. Chernev now says he was not present at all, but was forced to lie about it by Siderov, who was trying to protect his driver. That could lead to charges against Siderov. On Monday, Attack official Petar Beron suggested a restructuring that might remove Siderov from his leadership post. (Sega, Monitor, 24 Chasa - 18/04/06; Mediapool, Darik - 17/04/06)

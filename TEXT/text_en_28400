SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Police arrested 16 people Thursday (April 15th) in an operation code-named "The Untouchables". Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said the targets worked in the energy sector and were involved in fraudulent VAT schemes. Three dozen offices were raided in Sofia, with police seizing computers, banking and accounting documents along with drugs and money. Tsvetanov said the group was dubbed "Untouchables" because they have been able to avoid prosecution so far. (Dnevnik, Novinar, Sega, Trud, Pari, 24 Chasa - 16/04/10; BNT - 15/04/10)

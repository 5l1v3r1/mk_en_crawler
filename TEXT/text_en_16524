NOVI PAZAR, Serbia -- The extraordinary elections for members of the local assembly in Serbia's mainly Muslim-populated municipality of Novi Pazar on Sunday (10 September) were marred by the murder of Ruzdija Durovic, a candidate of the List for Sandzak coalition. Police say gunmen fired from a passing car, hitting Durovic in front of a polling station late in the afternoon. Police reportedly have caught two suspects and are seeking a third. Voting eventually resumed. Preliminary results suggest the List for Sandzak coalition won 53.42 per cent of the vote. The coalition Together for Novi Pazar was second with 23.44 per cent.
In other news, Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic warned leaders of his G-17 party that Serbia is in danger of slipping back into nationalism. He said chauvinism, populism and hate speeches were increasingly common. The pro-democracy parties must work together to prevent radicals from returning to power, he said.

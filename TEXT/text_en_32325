SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Over 1,000 farmers staged a protest outside the parliament building Tuesday (1 October) marking the International Day of Older Persons. Their original idea was to round up 240 sheep, one for every deputy in parliament, led by a goat, symbolising Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. But in the end, the protesters managed to find just a goat. Beforehand, farmers gave away free food to older people who agreed to attend the protest. (Dnevnik, Sega, Standart, 24 Chasa - 02/10/02)

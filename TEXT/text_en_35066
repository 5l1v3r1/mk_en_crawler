ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government decided on Thursday (29 April) to offer to host the NATO Security Forum planned for the spring of 2005. Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul said the event would be one of the most important in the political sphere. NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer would serve as chairman of the forum, which would draw between 200 and 300 participants.
In other news, Croatia will pay 198,000 euros to two Serb children whose family were murdered by local policemen in 1991. Five police reservists shot the father dead in his home in Zagreb in December 1991, then abducted his wife and 12-year-old daughter and killed them near the city. They were apprehended, but a local court dismissed the case on procedural grounds. (Vjesnik, Vecernji List - 30/04/04; HINA, AFP, UPI - 29/04/04)

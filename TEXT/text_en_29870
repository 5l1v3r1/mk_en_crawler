JERUSALEM, Israel -- Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman on Sunday (December 26th) rejected a demand from Ankara to apologise for a deadly raid on a Turkish-led aid flotilla to Gaza that left nine Turkish national dead in May. Speaking at a gathering in Jerusalem, Lieberman called instead for Turkey to apologise for "supporting terror". 
On Saturday, Turkish counterpart Ahmet Davutoglu had said that Ankara is willing to reconcile with Israel but that that Tel Aviv should apologise and offer financial compensation. (Zaman - 27/12/10; VoA, Hurriyet, Xinhua, AP - 26/12/10)

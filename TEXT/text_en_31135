PRISTINA, Kosovo -- An EULEX judge confirmed on Friday (March 4th) indictments against four people involved in the Medicus Clinic case in Pristina, where human organs were illegally removed. Lufti Dervishi, Driton Jilta, Sokol Hajdini and Ilir Rrecaj are charged with unlawful exercise of medical activity and abusing official position or authority, EULEX said in a statement. The clinic was closed in 2008 by UNMIK and Kosovo police after a months-long investigation. (Beta, Radio Free Europe - 04/03/11)

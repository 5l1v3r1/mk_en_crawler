BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn on Wednesday (March 25th) offered another proposal to resolve the border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia. He met with both countries' foreign ministers and said afterwards he expects quick responses from each government in order to meet again next week. Slovenia rejected Rehn's previous proposal to sign a joint statement claiming that no single document determined the border dispute. The inability of Croatia and Slovenia to compromise on the issue has stalled Croatia's EU accession.
In other news Wednesday, Croatia's parliament overwhelmingly ratified the NATO treaty, paving the way for the country's NATO accession. Croatia is on track to participate in NATO's summit next week as a full-fledged member.
In related news, Slovenia's constitutional court on Wednesday rejected a request by the Slovene People's Party, which sought a referendum on Croatia's NATO entry. The court's ruling removed the final obstacle to Croatia's NATO accession. (Javno.com, STA, HRT, Xinhua, HINA, Beta - 25/03/09)

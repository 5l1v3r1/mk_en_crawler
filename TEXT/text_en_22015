SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A court on Wednesday (April 16th) acquitted former Croat officer Zdravko Mihaljevic of charges stemming from the persecution, murder and torture of Bosnian Muslims in the 1992-1995 conflict. The court ruled that, although Mihaljevic belonged to the Croatian military at the time, prosecutors failed to prove he participated in the crimes or that he was present during their perpetration against civilians in the town of Kiseljak.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak promised to intensify efforts regarding judicial reform, saying it and a national war crimes strategy are among his top priorities. "We discuss this issue almost every day with representatives of the judiciary â¦ and we will not give up on this," Lajcak said in online answers to questions from the public, published Sunday (February 24th) on the reci.ba website. Lajcak declined to give a timeframe as to when BiH could join the EU. "This is like asking a sportsman how much time he will need to run a marathon when he has not even started the race," he said.
In a separate statement Sunday, Lajcak rejected accusations by the main Bosniak Party, the Party of Democratic Action (SDA), that he does not do his job. "It would be useful if SDA representatives acted more and used less rhetoric," Lajcak replied. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 25/02/08; Fena - 24/02/08)

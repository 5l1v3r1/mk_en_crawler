ANKARA, Turkey -- Renowned writer and Nobel laureate for literature Orhan Pamuk has called off a trip to Germany planned for Friday (February 2nd), reportedly over safety concerns. Pamuk's publisher, Munich-based Hanser, confirmed cancellation of the visit but refused to say why. Last month, a prominent Turkish Armenian journalist, Hrant Dink, was shot dead by an assassin angry over his comments about the mass killings of Armenians during World War I. Pamuk has also spoken out on the issue and, like Dink, was charged under a controversial penal code article that makes it a crime to "insult Turkishness". 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has issued an order providing security guards to those tried under the clause, but Turkish press report that the order has not been carried out. (Zaman, Sabah, Radikal - 01/02/07)

THESSALONIKI, Greece -- Heavy rain and floods battering northern Greece since Saturday (October 7th) prompted the introduction of a state of emergency in the prefecture of Thessaloniki. A number of houses reportedly were flooded around Olympiada, Apollonia, Melisourgos and the Chalkidiki peninsula, prompting evacuations. 
In neighbouring Bulgaria, officials warned on Sunday that heavy rains and flooding are expected in 17 regions in the coming days. Hardest hit would be the Veliko Tarnovo, Ruse and Svishtov districts. (Naftemporiki, Monitor - 09/10/06; ERT, BNR - 08/10/06)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- Police have arrested three people in Pec on suspicion they carried out an attack against a police station, a UN spokesman reported on Sunday (2 February). Ten days ago, an anti-tank weapon was fired at the regional police headquarters in Pec, causing damage but no injuries. The police believe the attack might have been intended as a warning by local criminal groups who are unhappy with the current crackdown on smuggling. (AP, AFP - 02/01/03)

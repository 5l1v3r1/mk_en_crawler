BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Ion Iliescu said Friday (26 March) in Brussels that it is still possible, in his opinion, for Romania to complete EU accession talks by the end of the term of the current European Commission in October. Iliescu also refuted media speculation that Romania has asked for a three-month extension of the deadline. Romania has closed 22 out of 31 chapters so far and hopes to join the Union in 2007 with Bulgaria. (Mediafax, Rompres - 28/03/04)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Bulgaria and Romania will seek the establishment of a trilateral commission with Serbia -- and the participation of independent international experts -- to assess the environmental damage the Danube River suffered from a recent oil slick, blamed on a lead at a Serbian refinery. The panel will also draft measures to overcome the damage. The agreement followed a meeting Wednesday (October 11th) in Bucharest between Minister of Environment and Waters Sulfina Barbu and Bulgarian counterpart Dzhevdet Chakurov.

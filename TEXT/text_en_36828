SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Officials from the French Embassy signed an agreement Wednesday (14 July) giving the interior ministry 2.5m euros in aid for a special security programme. The grant is viewed as an indication of the successful co-operation between Bulgarian and French police.
In other news Wednesday, the Bulgarian Appeals Court confirmed the Sofia City Court's decision to restore Stefan Sofianski to his post as mayor. Although the ruling is final, Sofianski's future in office remains uncertain. The municipal court must still review a second suspension request submitted by prosecutors late last week. They have accused Sofianski of mismanagement. (Dnevnik, Info radio - 14/07/04)

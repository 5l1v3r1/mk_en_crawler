VIENNA, Austria -- Turkish President Abdullah Gul urged the EU on Monday (May 2nd) to ease visa restrictions for Turkish citizens travelling to the bloc. He made the statement at a joint press conference after meeting with Austrian counterpart Heinz Fischer in Vienna. Gul expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that the EU has discussed easing visa restrictions for citizens of Ukraine and Russia, but not for Turkey. "This is something that discredits not Turkey, but the EU," he pointed out. Fischer said his country wants fair accession talks with Turkey. "On the other hand, however, these are difficult negotiations and no one, including the Turkish side, can predict the outcome," Fischer said. (Zaman, Hurriyet, World Bulletin - 02/05/11)

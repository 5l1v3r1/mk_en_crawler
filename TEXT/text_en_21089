SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Cabinet personnel changes can be expected in January, according to senior Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) official Petar Kanev. He confirmed for state radio on Sunday (December 2nd) that National Movement for Stability and Progress (NDSV) leader Simeon Saxe-Coburg has requested the replacement of Education Minister Daniel Valchev, Defence Minister Veselin Bliznakov, Public Administration Minister Nikolay Vasilev and European Affairs Minister Gergana Grancharova. All have supported a faction in the NDSV that differed with Saxe-Coburg on electing new party leaders this summer. Kanev said the personnel changes could affect the portfolios held by the BSP and the Movement for Rights and Freedom.

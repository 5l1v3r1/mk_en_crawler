THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Dutch Foreign Minister Bernard Bot said Monday (15 November) that Turkey could join the EU in ten years if it pushes ahead with reforms and if there are no "unforeseen circumstances". The minister, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said 2015 was a realistic date for Ankara's accession. At the same time, he urged the country to improve its record on freedom of religious expression. The EU member states are expected to decide next month whether to launch accession negotiations with Ankara. (AFP, TurkishPress.com, AFX - 15/11/04)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- A court in Zagreb sentenced the former head of Croatia's mission to the UN, Neven Jurica, to 18 months in prison Thursday (April 22nd) for embezzling more than 90,000 euros of state funds. He was also banned from diplomatic activities for five years. The court rejected his arguments that he spent the money on lobbying activities, rather than for private purposes, as charged. Last year, Jurica asked to be relieved of his duties, citing health issues. In November, the anti-corruption office USKOK charged him with abuse of power and embezzlement.

ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis declared a nationwide state of emergency on Saturday (August 25th) as wildfires pushed by strong winds burned thousands of acres of forest and brush, engulfed homes and villages, and killed at least 46 people. Dozens have been hospitalised with burns and smoke inhalation. Fifteen villages in the Peleponnese were evacuated. A three-day period of mourning has been declared.
Some 9,000 fire fighters, 1,000 soldiers, 1,800 fire engines, as well as planes and helicopters, are battling the fires. France has said it will send two fire fighting planes, and 12 other planes and 11 helicopters are expected from other countries. They will be deployed to fight the approximately 100 fires that were burning as of Sunday.
Authorities suspect arson may have played a role in the disaster. The prime minister, saying that so many fires starting at the same time could not be a mere coincidence, has vowed that those responsible will be brought to justice. Police have reported the arrest of a 65-year-old man who will be charged in the deaths of six people in Areopolis, in the southern Peloponnese. Two teenagers have also been detained for arson in Kavala, northern Greece.
Meanwhile, the election campaign in Greece has come to a halt. In an official letter addressed to President Karolos Papoulias and political parties, Greek ecological organisations called for the vote to be delayed by three months. George Papandreou, leader of the opposition PASOK party, urged the president to convene an urgent meeting of all political leaders in the country.

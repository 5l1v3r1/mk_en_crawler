KOZLODUY, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria shut down on Sunday (December 31st) units 3 and 4 of its Kozloduy nuclear power station, in line with EU obligations. The two 440-MW reactors were switched off from the Bulgarian power grid at around 10 pm local time. Two other reactors -- the 1,000-MW units 5 and 6 -- remain active. In 2002, the country decommissioned the oldest units, 1 and 2, to begin EU membership talks. 
Lyubomir Velkov, CEO of Bulgaria's power utility, said Sunday that there was no risk of a breakdown in the national energy system. However, the price of electricity produced by the power station is expected to jump by 18%. (BNT, bTV, Nova TV - 01/01/07; Darik - 31/12/06)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- War crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic has received a new death threat, prosecution spokesman Bruno Vekaric said on Tuesday (June 17th). The threat stemmed from war crimes fugitive Stojan Zupljanin's extradition to The Hague next week. Police captured him near Belgrade last week. The call to Vukcevic's private phone came from the Netherlands. "This was a very dramatic and pointed threat. The voice said Zupljanin's arrest would be the last one tolerated, but Vukcevic will not be forgiven for any more extraditions," Vekaric said. A bomb threat followed Zupljanin's transfer to prison in Belgrade. Earlier this year, police uncovered an assassination plot against Vukcevic. (SRNA, RTS, B92, Reuters, AP - 17/06/08)

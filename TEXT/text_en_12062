LUXEMBOURG -- During a meeting Tuesday (14 June) of the EU-Romania Association Council, top EU officials called on Bucharest to accelerate reforms in order to enter the Union on schedule in 2007. Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn, whose country currently holds the EU's rotating presidency, said Romania has made important progress but should intensify preparations for membership. He cited in particular the need to strengthen the fight against corruption. Romanian Foreign Minister Mihai Razvan Ungureanu said he believes the reforms will be completed on time and the accession schedule will be observed.

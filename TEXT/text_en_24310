ZAGREB, Croatia -- A parliamentary committee stripped member Branimir Glavas of his immunity Monday (May 11th), clearing the way for his arrest. Immediately after the decision, the judge who last week sentenced Glavas to ten years in prison for war crimes committed against Serb civilians during Croatia's war of independence in the early 1990s issued a warrant. For the time being, the arrest warrant is valid only for Croatia, but local authorities are working to get an international warrant. Glavas fled to Bosnia and Herzegovina and has applied for a Bosnian ID card.
In other news, the government made a last-ditch effort Monday to avoid a potentially crippling public sector general strike scheduled for Wednesday. Education workers are organising it to protest the fiscally stressed government's unilateral decision to abolish a 6% wage hike for public sector employees. On Monday, the government proposed having arbitrators resolve the matter. (HINA, HRT, BHRT, SRNA, RTRS, Tanjug, BTA - 11/05/09)

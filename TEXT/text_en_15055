SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The European Commission (EC) delegation and the Office of the High Representative (OHR) in BiH on Saturday (1 October) rejected a proposal by Republika Srpska's (RS) government for a new concept of BiH police reform. Banja Luka presented the suggestion the previous day, claiming it was a compromise solution that could help resolve a several-month deadlock over the reform. 
The RS proposal envisaged the transfer of legislative and budget competencies for the police to the state level, as well as the depoliticisation and organisation of police regions on the basis of technical and operational principles. However, it also called for retaining the entity-level interior ministries -- a demand which conflicts with EU-set police reform principles. 
In separate news, the RS government Friday adopted the report of its task force charged with investigating the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. Details about the report will be made public later after consent from the OHR, said cabinet spokesperson Cvijeta Kovacevic.

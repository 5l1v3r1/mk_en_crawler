SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR troops conducted an operation to nab Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic in Kasindo, near Sarajevo, on Wednesday (13 August) but could not find him. The peacekeepers issued a statement saying that they had been tipped off that the general might visit his mother's home shortly after her death. SFOR expressed regret over the timing of the operation but said it would be in the best interests of all BiH citizens if Mladic were arrested. This was the first known effort to apprehend him in BiH. Until recently, UN prosecutors had insisted that he was hiding in Serbia. The local daily <I>Dnevni Avaz</I> cited sources Wednesday who said Mladic arrived in BiH from Serbia-Montenegro six days ago. (Reuters, AFP, HINA, Dnevni Avaz, Onasa, SRNA - 13/08/03)

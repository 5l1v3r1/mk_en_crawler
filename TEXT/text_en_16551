BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Several Southeast European (SEE) states are on alert, as levels of the Danube River and a tributary, the Sava River, rise. In Serbia, authorities in Belgrade and Novi Sad introduced emergency measures as the Danube reached a record high of 740cm on Sunday (9 April). The public has been asked to help monitor the riskiest areas and participate in sandbagging and other reinforcement activities. 
In neighbouring Croatia, emergency measures have been introduced in the towns of Osijek and Vukovar. The Danube rose to 707cm and 711cm respectively on Sunday. 
In Bulgaria, authorities say the most critical areas are Vidin, Lom and Nikopol, where the river level was 868cm Monday morning. Floodwaters have swamped several local facilities. 
In Romania, a state of emergency is in effect in ten riverside counties. Defence Minister Teodor Atanasiu has ordered the army to be prepared to assist with evacuations. Peak water levels are expected mid-week. (Danas, Vecernji list, Monitor, Nine o'clock - 10/04/06; AFP, Tanjug - 09/04/06)

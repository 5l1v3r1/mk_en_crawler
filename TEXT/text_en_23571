NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias expressed concern on Monday (March 23rd) that election results in the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) may harm ongoing reunification talks between the two Cypriot communities. A possible win by political opponents of Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat's Republican Turkish Party (CTP) would make it "very difficult" for the two sides to reach a deal, Christofias said. "If we do not reach an agreement with Talat, who is considered progressive, I do not know if we would ever reach one," the president noted. The TRNC will hold early parliamentary elections on April 19th. Polls indicate the right-wing opposition National Unity Party is ahead of the CTP. (CNA, Famagusta Gazette, AP, Xinhua - 23/03/09)

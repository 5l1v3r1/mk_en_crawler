GRACANICA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Hundreds of Kosovo Serbs protested in the central Kosovo town of Gracanica on Monday (19 September), following the arrest of four fellow Serbs charged with war crimes. The protestors, who claim the arrests were unjust, blocked a main road, snarling traffic for several hours. They intend to continue roadblocks unless the four are released. Officials say the four Serbs are suspected of killing ethnic Albanians in the village of Slovinje in 1999. (Beta, Tanjug - 19/09/05)

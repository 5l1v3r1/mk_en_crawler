PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK spokesman Russell Geekie said on Monday (August 16th) the mission is willing to facilitate talks between Pristina and Belgrade. "UNMIK supports and encourages depoliticised talks on technical issues, but it depends on what Pristina and Belgrade have decided to talk about," Geekie was quoted as saying by Radio KiM. He noted that UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton have exchanged letters expressing their willingness to play a role in potential talks. Serbia wants to open talks on its former province's status, while Kosovo institutions agree to hold talks on everything but status. (Zeri, Koha Ditore, Kosova Sot, Express - 17/08/10)

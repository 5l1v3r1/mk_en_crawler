BREMEN, Germany -- EU security chief Javier Solana again called on Friday (March 30th) for the formation of a new Serbian government as soon as possible, saying this is key to resuming Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks between Belgrade and the Union. Solana emphasisedthat the EU considers Serbia an important partner in the region and wants to see the country advance on the road to EU integration.
The call came amid the continued failure of the democratic parties to reach an agreement on forming a ruling coalition. Negotiations began soon after the January 21st parliamentary elections. On Monday, the heads of the parliamentary caucuses are meeting to discuss the continuation of the legislature's constituent session, which was focusing on budget issues when it was suspended on February 14th.

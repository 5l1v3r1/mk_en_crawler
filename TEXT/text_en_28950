ANKARA, Turkey -- The Constitutional Court decided on Tuesday (June 8th) to review the constitutional reform package on procedural grounds only. The main opposition Republic People's Party is challenging the package, based both on procedures and contents. But in line with the opinions of the government and the majority of legal experts, the court decided to hear the case without regard to the contents. Only two items of the 27 amendments drew criticism from opposition parties. They involve making structural changes to the Constitutional Court itself and to the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors. The court will deliver its ruling on July 5th.

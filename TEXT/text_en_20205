SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A peaceful protest against the rising juvenile crime rate turned violent Wednesday (February 13th) in Sarajevo, leaving three security personnel and two civilians injured. Several people were arrested. An estimated 3,000 people demanded that Sarajevo Mayor Semiha Borovac and Sarajevo Canton Prime Minister Samir Silajdzic resign due to the deteriorating situation. A similar rally Saturday brought 10,000 people to Sarajevo's central square to demand urgent measures against crime. 
The protests were sparked by a recent series of high-profile attacks. A 17-year-old boy died recently after being beaten on a tram in Sarajevo. Reportedly, no one on board tried to help him. Before that, three teenagers attacked an elderly woman outside her home, poured oil over her body and burned her. Last Friday, a 21-year-old man died after a fight in a Sarajevo disco.

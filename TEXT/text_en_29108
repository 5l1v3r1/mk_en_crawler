BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic announced on Monday (September 6th) that a number of people have been detained stemming from a weekend incident in Novi Pazar. Several police officers were injured on Saturday in the Muslim-dominated town when clashes erupted during a protest staged by members of the Islamic Community in Serbia against alleged confiscation of a land parcel in the town. The community, led by Muamer Zukorlic, opposes the decision to build a preschool facility on the disputed plot, supposedly received as an endowment. The Bosniak National Council is urging EU observers to be dispatched to Sandzak, in a bid to ease tensions and promote dialogue. But the mayor of Novi Pazar, Meho Mahmutovic, wants no part of that. Those arrested after Saturday's brawls are accused of attacking police officers and disturbing the public order. (RTS, Tanjug, AP - 06/09/10)

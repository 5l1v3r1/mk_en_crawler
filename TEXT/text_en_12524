BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Top NATO and EU officials repeated during talks with Bosnian Prime Minister Adnan Terzic on Monday (7 February) that full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal remains the major condition for advancing in Euro-Atlantic integration. Terzic, who kicked off a three-day visit to the Belgian capital, held talks with NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, EU security chief Javier Solana and members of the North Atlantic Council.
In Republika Srpska (RS) meanwhile, the Serb Party of Democratic Progress again demanded that RS President Dragan Cavic call a meeting of the main parties to discuss the continuing government crisis. Cabinet resignations prompted by international sanctions back in December have affected the governments of both RS and BiH.

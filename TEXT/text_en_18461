TIRANA, Albania -- Deputy Interior Minister Ferdinand Poni says a total of 2,897,313 voters are eligible to cast ballots in Sunday's (February 18th) local elections. The final voter lists were officially posted on Tuesday. 
On Tuesday, a monitoring board chaired by President Alfred Moisiu issued a statement voicing concern over the growing number of violations of the Code of Conduct in the final days of campaigning. Separately, Albanian NGOs urged parties to respect candidates' right to privacy.

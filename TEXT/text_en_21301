NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The advisers to leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities met on Wednesday (August 27th) to discuss procedural issues before the start of direct reunification talks on September 3rd. But they failed to reach an agreement on the opening of a new crossing point at Limnitis, on the border between the Turkish northern and the Greek southern parts of the island. The effort is expected to continue, however, so that officials can announce an agreement when Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat meet next week.

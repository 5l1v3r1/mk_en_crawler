BUCHAREST, Romania -- The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) has not given up the idea of a single-chamber parliament, leader and Prime Minister Emil Boc said Saturday (January 30th). President Traian Basescu floated the idea of a unicameral legislature during his November re-election campaign. Voters backed the idea of one chamber, which would reduce the number of lawmakers from 471 to 300. 
Also, the National Liberal Party (PNL), the third largest party in the country, announced on Saturday its congress would take place from March 5th to 7th. Leader Crin Antonescu says he'll seek another term. No one else appears to be running. Former PNL leader Calin Popescu Tariceanu refuses to say whether he will compete for the office.

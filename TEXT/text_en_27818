BELGRADE, Serbia -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele delivered the European Commission's (EC) questionnaire to Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic on Wednesday (November 24th), an important step forward in Serbia's EU bid. At a joint press conference with Cvetkovic in Belgrade, Fuele said Kosovo is not covered by the questionnaire but noted that some questions relate to co-operation between Belgrade and Pristina. Based on the answers to the nearly 2,500 questions, the EC will assess Serbia's readiness for official EU candidate status. Cvetkovic said that Belgrade will complete its responses by the end of January. (Beta, RTS, Tanjug, B92 - 24/11/10)

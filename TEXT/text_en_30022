SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EU envoy Miroslav Lajcak said in Sarajevo on Thursday (February 24th) met with leading politicians to discuss the ongoing failure to form a government. Though BiH held regular general elections on October 3rd, there is still neither a government in the Federation of BiH, or a new state-level cabinet due to disagreements among the main Bosniak and Croat parties. 
Separately Thursday, High Representative Valentin Inzko also reiterated calls to speed up efforts to form a new government. He was speaking at the opening of a "Parliament for Europe" initiative session held at the EU delegation building in Sarajevo. 
In his video address to participants, EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said BiH is at a critical crossroad, with one direction pointing to clear political determination regarding the country's future and the other pointing to disagreement, which would result in BiH lagging behind the rest of the region.

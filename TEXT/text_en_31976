JOAKIM OSOGOVSKI, Macedonia -- Foreign Ministers of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Macedonia participated in a symbolic ceremony Sunday (24 November) by laying a pyramid-shaped cornerstone at the point where their borders meet. With the ceremony, Macedonia and Yugoslavia officially launched the demarcation of their common border, 11 years after Macedonia proclaimed its independence from the former Yugoslavia. Skopje and Belgrade signed a border agreement last year, but implementation was delayed by the security crisis in Macedonia. The meeting of three ministers continued in the nearby St Joakim Osogovski monastery in northwestern Macedonia, where they pledged to develop co-operation and intensify joint work within the Stability Pact's initiatives, particularly involving the pan-European transport corridors 8 and 10.

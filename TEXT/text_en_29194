ANKARA, Turkey -- The trial against a senior prosecutor and an army general suspected of participation in the so-called Ergenekon network began in the city of Erzurum on Tuesday (May 4th). The Ergenekon organisation is accused of planning to cause enough chaos to topple the government of the ruling Justice and Development Party. General Saldirai Berk, commander of the Third Army in Erzincan, and the city's chief prosecutor, Ilhan Cihaner, are on trial along with 12 other suspects. They each face up to ten years in prison if convicted of membership in a terrorist organisation. Berk, the highest ranking official to stand trial as part of the three-year probe, did not attend Tuesday's session. (Haberturk, Radikal - 05/05/10; AFP, Press TV, Anadolu news agency - 04/05/10)

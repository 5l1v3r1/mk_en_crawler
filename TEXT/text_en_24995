ATHENS, Greece -- A second extremist group, the "Terrorist Guerrilla Group", claimed responsibility Tuesday (December 29th) for a bombing Sunday near the National Bank of Greece and a big insurance company in Athens. The first group to claim it, the "Conspiracy Nuclei of Fire", said in a statement posted on the internet Monday that the attack was to protest "the Christmas consumer mood" and displays of wealth. According to it, the explosive device used in the attack had an "improved construction" intended to cause serious damage. The group threatened to use even more powerful bombs in the future and expressed solidarity with anarchists serving prison time in Greece, Chile and Germany. (Kathimerini, BTA - 29/12/09)

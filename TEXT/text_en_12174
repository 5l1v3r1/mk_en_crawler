BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- During a visit to Belgrade on Monday (11 April), Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) top international envoy, High Representative Paddy Ashdown, said both BiH and Serbia-Montenegro must transfer all war crimes indictees to the UN tribunal in order to complete co-operation requirements. Following talks with senior Serbian officials, Ashdown said that recent collaboration between Belgrade and Banja Luka on extraditions to The Hague opened a new path for both states and would enhance their bids for Euro-Atlantic integration. 
However, BiH Ambassador to NATO and the EU Sven Alkalaj said in a press interview Monday that he doesn't expect his country to receive an invitation to join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme during the Alliance's summit in Vilnius next week. While acknowledging recent progress, he said the level of co-operation was still short of that requested by UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte.

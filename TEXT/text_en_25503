PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu says Pristina is poised to open an embassy in Sofia. "I have already signed a decree to send a Kosovo ambassador to Bulgaria and I expect that it will soon take effect," Sejdiu told Bulgarian National Radio on Saturday (November 21st). He added that relations between the two countries are excellent. Bulgaria decided to transform its office in Pristina into an embassy after recognising Kosovo in March 2008.

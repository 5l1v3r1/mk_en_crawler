SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A Bulgarian hacked into an al-Qaeda Web site on Tuesday (10 August) and posted a message urging his nation to take a firm stand against terrorists. "Remain generous, don't be vindictive, whatever the tests to endure," he wrote on the homepage of the Tawhid wal Jihad organisation. The terrorists used this site to post video clips of the executions of a Korean and a Bulgarian hostage in Iraq. "Our motto is not an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth," the unknown hacker wrote. Bulgarian hackers had warned that they would launch an attack on terrorist-related sites following the execution of a Bulgarian hostage in July and the disappearance of another Bulgarian captured at that time.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The EU expects talks on crucial police reform in BiH to take place in the coming weeks, enabling a consensus agreement to be in place by May, according to a statement Wednesday (6 April) from the Office of the High Representative. It said the EU has delivered this message on two separate occasions -- during a meeting between High Representative Paddy Ashdown and British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw in London, and again in a letter sent by EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn to BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic. Rehn has urged implementation of the remaining requirements from the European Commission's Feasibility Study before an EU assessment delegation visits BiH in May.
Also Wednesday, EUFOR Commander Major General David Leakey met with BiH Security Minister Barisa Colak in Sarajevo. They discussed the current security situation and collaborative activities to curb organised crime in BiH. (Nezavisne novine, Dnevni avaz - 07/04/05; OHR Sources, Fena, RTRS, Pincom.info - 06/04/05)

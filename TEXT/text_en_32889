SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- At the request of the United States, BiH authorities on Friday (29 November) banned three humanitarian organisations: the Saudi-based Islamic Al-Haramain Foundation, the US Global Humanitarian Foundation and the Sarajevo-based Bosanska Idealna Futura. All three are suspected of co-operating with and funding terrorists. Milan Lovric, head of BiH anti-terrorism co-ordination team, said that in his opinion, nearly ten humanitarian organisations from Islamic countries that operate in BiH are closely linked to terrorists.

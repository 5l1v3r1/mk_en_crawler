SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Special police forces in Macedonia launched a massive operation on Wednesday (November 7th) against Albanian armed criminal groups hiding in the Sar mountain area. The operation in part targeted two of seven inmates convicted of crimes including terrorism who escaped Kosovo's maximum security Dubrava prison in August. The Macedonian Interior Ministry says at least eight members of an "armed criminal group" were killed in a shootout with police in the villages of Brodec, Vesala and Vejce. Five people were arrested.

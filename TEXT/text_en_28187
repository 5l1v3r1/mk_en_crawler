TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on Monday (April 19th) that he has reassured European officials he will make every effort to resolve the political stalemate in Albania. Berisha said that the legal system and other state institutions are capable of investigating the June 2009 general elections. The government's refusal to open some ballot boxes has prompted the opposition to stage an on-again off-again boycott of parliament for the past several months. Berisha is just back from Brussels, where he delivered Albania's responses to a questionnaire that is crucial to achieving EU candidate status. (Lajmifundit, Shekulli, Top Channel - 19/04/10)

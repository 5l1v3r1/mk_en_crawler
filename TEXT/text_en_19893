ATHENS, Greece -- The chief of the Data Protection Authority resigned on Monday (November 19th) to protest the use of street cameras to monitor a demonstration planned for downtown Athens on Saturday. Dimitris Gourgourakis said the authority's independence was being undermined. The deputy chief and two other members of the authority have also stepped down. 
The resignations came after a long row with the government about the use of the 350 cameras that were installed for the 2004 Olympics. The authority argues that using them for monitoring purposes infringes on people's privacy. However, a prosecutor recently issued orders allowing them to be used to monitor Athens' frequently violent protests. (AP - 19/11//07)

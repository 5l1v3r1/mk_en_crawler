ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Tuesday (22 April) that he was looking forward to fair elections in Iraq and a government that represents all Iraqi people. He said he hopes that a civilian administration will come to power as soon as possible, but noted that the US presence should continue in the short term. He also noted Turkey's desire to participate in the reconstruction next door, a message echoed by Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul. He said authorities are ready to provide any kind of assistance, not only soldiers. Ankara is considering a US request for peacekeeping troops and technical experts. Iraqi reconstruction and Turkey's prospects for joining the EU were the focus of talks Tuesday between Gul and visiting French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said on Friday (August 20th) that Serbia is open to "changes" to the draft resolution on Kosovo it submitted to the UN General Assembly last month. Presently, it states that the International Court of Justice's July 22nd advisory opinion, which found that Kosovo's independence declaration did not violate international law, does not give Kosovo Albanians the right to secession. It also calls for reaching a "mutually acceptable solution to all open issues" through dialogue. Dacic says Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic has informed the government that the draft was discussed with partners from the EU, the US, Russia and China prior to its submission, but no agreement had been struck on the text.

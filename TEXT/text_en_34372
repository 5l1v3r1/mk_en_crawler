ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Simitis expressed strong support for the draft EU Constitution in a speech to parliament on Wednesday (22 October). He said that despites some flaws in the document, Greece should be among the countries ready to adopt the constitution, as it basically corresponds to domestic goals. Simitis also praised Greece's achievements during its turn as EU president, especially with regard to the Iraq issue.
Main opposition leader Costas Karamanlis, however, sharply criticised the current government. Addressing parliament after Simitis, Karamanlis said that the standard of living in Greece still falls short of other European countries and that the PASOK-led government had failed to utilise EU funds.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said on Thursday (11 September) that his country would support Turkey's efforts to start negotiations for EU membership in 2004. He pledged that his government would set aside its historical differences with Ankara to ensure that Turkey joins the EU. Papandreou warned, however, that Turkey must help solve the Cyprus dispute. He said Ankara's efforts in this area would be reflected in the European Commission's report on Turkey's readiness to begin accession talks with the EU. (AFP - 11/09/03)

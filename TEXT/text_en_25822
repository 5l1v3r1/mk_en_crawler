TIRANA, Albania -- Turkey has abolished the fee of 10 euros per visa for Albanian citizens, following an agreement between the respective foreign ministers Sunday (October 18th) in Tirana. "We decided to put an end to the visa fee for Albanians as a gift," Turkey's top diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu said. His Albanian counterpart, Ilir Meta, said that removing the fee lifts "a psychological barrier". Tirana and Ankara plan to boost economic exchanges and to increase co-operation in tourism, the officials said at a joint press conference.

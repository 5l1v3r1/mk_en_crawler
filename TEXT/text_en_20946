MOSCOW, Russia -- The first direct talks between Belgrade and Pristina officials will be held in New York on September 28th, Russia's representative in the Contact Group troika, Alexander Bostan-Kharchenko, told the Moscow newspaper Vremya Novostei on Tuesday (September 4th). The talks will start immediately after the next Contact Group meeting on September 27th, the envoy said, adding that he expects "a breakthrough in the negotiations process" this time.
Wolfgang Ischinger, the EU's representative in the troika, insisted on Tuesday in Belgrade that negotiations on the Kosovo should focus on the status issue, rather than on peripheral issues such as cultural and religious rights. Ischinger met with Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, who reiterated his country's opposition to any unilateral declaration of Kosovo's independence. 
During a visit to Bucharest on Tuesday, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic struck a conciliatory note. He said a real attempt must be made "to reconcile our legitimate demands for preservation of sovereignty and territorial integrityâ¦ with the legitimate demands of the Albanian ethnic community in Kosovo for the maximum degree of self governance".

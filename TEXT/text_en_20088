ATHENS, Greece -- Greek Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis said Saturday (October 20th) that the time has come to resolve the dispute between Greece and Macedonia about the latter country's official name. Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis also urged the Macedonian political leadership to give up their "stubbornness". However, Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki said "the national identity and the constitutional name (of Macedonia) are above everything".
Also on Saturday, a 150-member team of Macedonian athletes walked out of the first Southeastern European Countries Games youth competition, held in northern Greece. The move was in protest against being introduced as citizens of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. (AFP, RTRS, SRNA, Net TV, ERT, Kathimerini, Ta Nea, AP- 20/10/07)

HISARYA, Bulgaria -- Emil Koshlukov, a parliament member from the ruling National Movement Simeon II (NMS II), suggested Saturday (12 October) that Gen Boyko Borisov run as NMS II's candidate for mayor of Sofia in next year's local elections. Koshlukov was attending a weekend seminar among the parliamentary groups of NMS II, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) and the government at a Hisarya resort. Acknowledging he had not consulted the ruling coalition's parties or Borisov himself, Koshlukov said he believes the popular chief secretary of Bulgaria's Interior Ministry would make the best possible candidate. Senior representatives of NMS II and MRF expressed general support for the idea but said it should be discussed further.
In other news, Interior Minister Georgi Petkanov said Saturday that there was no connection between a recent blast and bomb threat in Sofia and Ruse. Police reportedly defused a bomb aboard a passenger ship that had left Ruse, days after a car bomb killed a woman in Sofia.

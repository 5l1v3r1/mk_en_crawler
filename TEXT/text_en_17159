TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament adopted a resolution on Tuesday (October 31st) calling for the opening of all communist-era secret police files. It said that crimes committed by the Enver Hoxha regime must be recognised as such and informers who served with his secret police, the Sigurimi, must be exposed. Democratic parliamentary group head Bamir Topi said MPs and civil servants who worked for the secret police during the regime should be removed from their posts. The opposition Socialists boycotted the vote.
In other news Tuesday, Fatos Klosi, a former chief of the Albanian intelligence service SHISH, was attacked at his home, reportedly by a disgruntled former SHISH employee. Klosi, now a university professor, recently criticised former members of the service and linked his alleged assailant to the 1995 disappearance of businessman Remzi Hoxha.

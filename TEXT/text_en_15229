BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU decided on Wednesday (28 June) to speed up accession talks with Croatia by opening two negotiating chapters -- the ones on competition and customs. A spokesman for the EU's Austrian presidency said only a single chapter, the one on competition, will be opened in negotiations with Turkey. He explained that the European Commission is still scanning Turkey's customs laws because of Ankara's failure to extend its customs union with the EU over Cyprus. 
In other news Wednesday, the Croatian government adopted a long-term strategy for development of the armed forces, envisioning a fully professional force by 2010. Under the document, covering the period 2006-2015, the modernisation of the army would cost around 2 billion euros, one third of which would be secured from loans. Parliament must still approve it.

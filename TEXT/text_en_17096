SKOPJE, Macedonia -- New Parliament Speaker Ljubisa Georgievski said on Tuesday (1 August) that he expects voting on the future government to take place in two to three weeks. He was speaking to reporters after the legislature approved his nomination, proposed by VMRO-DPMNE, which controls the most seats following the 5 July elections. Georgievski also said he would meet with representatives of the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), whose leaders are furious that VMRO-DPMNE did not invite DUI to join the new cabinet.

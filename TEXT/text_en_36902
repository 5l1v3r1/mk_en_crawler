ANKARA, Turkey -- Local press reports Monday (5 July) suggest that a civilian may soon head the National Security Council, possibly as early as next month. Turkey's Permanent Representative to the UN Umit Pamir is widely viewed as the top contender for the position, now occupied by an army general. The change is significant in terms of the country's EU aspirations, as the Union wants less military involvement in Turkish politics.
In other news, the ruling Justice and Development Party reportedly has decided to drop its demand to amend the penal code. The effort was related to the fight over whether headscarves could be worn in universities. President Ahmet Necdet Sezer is opposed to allowing the practice. (Anadolu Agency - 05/07/04)

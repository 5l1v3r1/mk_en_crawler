BUCHAREST, Romania -- European Commission (EC) Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini expressed optimism about Romania's judicial and interior sector reforms, during a visit to Bucharest on Monday (13 March). Frattini also suggested that the EC's May monitoring report on Romania's progress would reflect results achieved in border security and other areas. He stressed however that the government must now step up implementation of necessary measures, so Romania meets all its pre-accession obligations to the EU.

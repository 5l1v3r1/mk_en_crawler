ATHENS, Greece -- The wife of kidnapped Greek businessman Pericles Panagopoulos appealed again to her husband's abductors Saturday (January 17th) to release him, saying she is ready to "co-operate". "I am begging the abductors to connect with me as soon as possible. I haven't had any news from them for two days," Katerina Panagopoulos said in an interview broadcast by the Net TV channel. According to Net, the abductors have demanded a ransom of 35m euros. Other media reports suggest it is far more than that, 100m euros. Panagopoulos, 74, was abducted near his home on January 12th. The shipping tycoon is in poor health and needs daily medical attention, including insulin injections. (AFP, AP, Net, Antenna, Mega - 17/01/09)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Local sources say Serbian Economy Minister Dragan Marsicanin will be the ruling coalition's nominee in the 14 June presidential election. Marsicanin is the deputy head of Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia. His selection was the result of talks among members of the coalition Wednesday (14 April). Velimir Ilic, the leader of coalition partner New Serbia, has decided not to run. Marsicanin's formal nomination is expected Thursday.

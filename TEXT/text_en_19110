NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The government said on Wednesday (January 31st) that it would complain to the UN and the EU about what it called Turkey's warnings and threats regarding plans for an exclusive economic zone for oil exploration between Cyprus, Lebanon and Egypt. Last month, Cyprus, which has sealed related agreements with Lebanon and Egypt, unveiled plans to hold an international tender in February for issuing licences for offshore oil and gas exploration. Turkey reacted strongly. 
Earlier this week, the Foreign Ministry in Ankara warned Lebanon and Egypt not to go ahead with the deals, arguing the rights of the Turkish Cypriots should be taken into account. On Wednesday, Cypriot government spokesman Christodoulos Pasiardis described that as groundless and provocative. (Kathimerini - 01/02/07; CNA, AP, ANA-MPA - 31/01/07)

ATHENS, Greece -- Following three days of heated debate, Parliament rejected a no-confidence motion against the New Democracy (ND)-led government Sunday (February 4th). It had been filed by the main opposition PASOK last week. PASOK accuses the ruling ND and Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis' government of constant failures, irresponsibility and incompetence. The next parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place in the spring of 2008. (Eleftheria - 05/02/07; ERT, ANA-MPA - 04/02/07)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Anti-graft office USKOK has started investigating former Economy Minister Damir Polancec over his alleged role in a corruption scandal involving local food producer Podravk, according to media reports on Thursday (January 21st). Polancec has said he is not aware of any action against him. Podravka, a leading food and pharmaceutical company, has been subjected to media scrutiny in the last few months as a result of a corruption probe against some of its senior management. The scandal forced Polancec to step down from his cabinet post in late October. (HRT, Nova TV, Javno, Jutarnji List, Croatian Times - 21/01/10)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The June 28th parliamentary elections will be decisive for Albania's EU integration process, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Tuesday (March 3rd). "A fair and transparent election process is a crucial condition while evaluating a country which applies for EU candidate status," Rehn told journalists, responding to recent statements by Albanian government officials, who said the country would apply for EU candidate status by June.

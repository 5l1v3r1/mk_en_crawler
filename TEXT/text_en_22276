ANKARA, Turkey -- The government proposed on Monday (August 11th) the establishment of a Caucasian countries' alliance to help resolve conflicts in the region such as the fighting this week between Russia and Georgia. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters "Turkey can take such a role. The Russian Federation should be included, as it would bring Caucasian states together," he said. "The situation is very worrisome," Erdogan added. Later, he discussed his proposal in a phone call with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili called Erdogan on Monday to discuss humanitarian assistance, according to media reports.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EU facilitator in the talks between Kosovo and Serbia Robert Cooper presented a proposal Wednesday (May 4th) in Pristina for the solution of issues discussed in the dialogue so far. The possible framework of the agreement includes the issues of energy, telecommunication, free movement of citizens, and customs stamps. Cooper met for several hours with the head of Kosovo's delegation in the talks, Edita Tahiri, who confirmed she had received the proposal. Her side has until May 17th to analyse and then offer comments during the fourth round of talks in Brussels later this month. 
Meanwhile, the government has given Serbian negotiation team leader Borislav Stefanovic permission to visit Kosovo. Stefanovic, however, has been asked to abide by certain conditions and to avoid rhetoric. Belgrade supports the visit and meetings with Kosovar officials ahead of round four.

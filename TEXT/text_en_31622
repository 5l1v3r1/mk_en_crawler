SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The presidents of Bulgaria and Romania issued a joint statement on Monday (14 April), calling on the EU to confirm 2007 as the year of the two countries' accession. The statement came as the Union was preparing to sign accession agreements with ten new members in Athens. "The two countries express their hope that the perspective of a 27-member EU in 2007 will be confirmed," presidents Georgi Parvanov and Ion Iliescu said. "We expect that any country should be considered on its individual progress, rather than its position on this or that international issue," Parvanov added, in an apparent reference to criticism from French President Jacques Chirac concerning Bulgaria's decision to side with the United States on Iraq.

TIRANA, Albania -- Socialist Movement for Integration head Ilir Meta was the only one from the left-wing coalition Thursday (March 22nd) to support the "five reforms" proposal of opposition leader Edi Rama. The Tirana mayor and head of the opposition Socialist Party had offered to sign a co-operation agreement with Prime Minister Sali Berisha on crucial reform laws, to avoid early elections. "Co-operation with all political parties is important," Meta said. Social Democratic Party leader Skender Gjinushi refused to join Rama in the initiative, saying it showed weakness by the opposition. Other parties on the left complained that they had not been consulted. (Top-Channel, KohaJone, AlbanianNews, Shekulli - 23/03/07)

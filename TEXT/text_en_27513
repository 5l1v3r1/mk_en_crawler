PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Roma and other minority groups that are returned to Kosovo are facing discrimination and extreme poverty, the group Human Rights Watch said in a report Thursday (October 28th). This, in turn, is a violation of human rights, the organisation added in the 77-page document entitled "Rights Displaced: Forced Returns of Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians from Western Europe to Kosovo". According to the organisation, once returned to Kosovo, these minorities face difficulties getting ID documents and control over property that belonged to them before they left. They also have difficulty getting access to shelters, health care, jobs and social protections. Many of them have been separated from their families. This is particularly hard for children, many of whom don't go to school due to language barriers, differences in educational programmes and poverty, the report noted.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Senators convened on Tuesday (August 26th) to decide whether to allow high-level corruption probes against former Economy Minister Codrut Seres and current Labour Minister Paul Pacuraru. The vote will be secret, and each senator will vote for each of the two cases separately. Seres faces charges of espionage and treason stemming from the privatisation process, as well as of providing classified commercial information related to the sale of state-owned companies. Pacuraru faces charges of bribery and abuse of office. Prosecutors say a company owned by his son won a contract with a state-owned company in exchange for keeping a senior official with the Gorj labour inspectorate at his post.

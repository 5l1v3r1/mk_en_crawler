PRAGUE, Czech Republic -- Romanian Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu said on Tuesday (January 22nd) that the planned US missile defence system should be shifted eastward, to cover Romania and Bulgaria, as NATO's concept of defence solidarity should extend to Southeast Europe. Tariceanu was in Prague for meetings with his Czech counterpart, Mirek Topolanek. The US shield will be discussed at NATO's April summit, which will be hosted by Bucharest.

ATHENS, Greece -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis spoke in favour of Turkey's eventual membership in the EU, saying in an interview that Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government had made an enormous effort to institute reforms. Europeanisation is "in the interests of Turks themselves, of countries neighbouring Turkey and the EU," Karamanlis said, adding that the Cyprus issue would not be an obstacle to launching talks with Ankara. Speaking generally about the EU enlargement process, Karamanlis said Greece wanted to be among "the avant-garde" of the EU through increased co-operation. (EU Observer - 09/08/04)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian Parliament is set to hold a debate on a new law that would authorise the government to issue high-tech IDs to Serbian citizens. According to the bill, formally submitted to the lawmakers on Wednesday (17 May), the new cards will have a microchip containing biometric information, as well as the digital picture, electronic fingerprints and signature of the holder. The government says the new card will help curb crime by enabling quicker identification. (UPI, Beta, UPI, Tanjug - 17/05/06)

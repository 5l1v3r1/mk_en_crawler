BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu has decided to establish a presidential commission to analyse new accusations against former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase, local media reported on Wednesday (September 12th). The decision was in response to a request from the National Anticorruption Division, asking Basescu for permission to press bribery charges against Nastase. This would be the third criminal charge against Nastase, stemming from his acquisition of an expensive building in downtown Bucharest. (Nine o'clock - 13/09/07; Hotnews.ro, ACT Media - 12/09/07)

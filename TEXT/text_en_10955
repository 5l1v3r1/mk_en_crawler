TIRANA, Albania -- Political will is needed to resolve problems in Albania, according to the head of the OSCE Presence in Tirana, Pavel Vacek. The Albanian Daily News quoted him Friday (29 April) as saying that, among other issues, the current voting system offers the opportunity for tactical voting. "The provisions of the Constitution and the Electoral Code do not explicitly prohibit such practices but that does not render them acceptable, let alone desirable," Vacek said.
In other news, parliament on Thursday adopted a methodology of land evaluation. The draft, adopted in the absence of the opposition, should allow the process of land compensation to proceed. The opposition had criticised the methods stipulated in the document. (Albanian Daily News - 29/04/05)

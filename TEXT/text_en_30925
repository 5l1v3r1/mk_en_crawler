SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said on Wednesday (May 4th) that Sofia supports French and Italian proposals to reform Schengen rules, even though the country is still a candidate to join the border-free zone. "Bulgaria will back the proposals for changes â¦ which provide for temporary freeze of a country's membership in the event of emergency circumstances," Tsvetanov told EU ambassadors in Sofia at an event on human trafficking sponsored by Norway. 
The European Commission has announced proposals -- including modification of the Schengen agreement -- to deal with the influx of migrants from the Middle East and North Africa after the wave of violence there. (Novinite, Focus, BNT - 04/05/11)

TIRANA, Albania -- A legal adviser to the main opposition Socialist Party (SP), Ylli Manjani, said on Wednesday (23 August) that SP does not intend to participate in or support the work of the Central Election Commission (CEC) as it prepares for local elections this winter. His comment was in response to the CEC's announcement that it was unable to start selecting representatives to the local election commissions, as SP failed to submit its list of candidates. Manjani says the SP would not be submitting nominees, since it views CEC's current composition as illegitimate. The opposition accuses the ruling Democratic Party-led majority of "stealing" one seat in the CEC from the opposition during new member appointments a few weeks ago.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Serbian Democratic Party of Republika Srpska (RS) has appointed President Dragan Cavic as its acting chairman in the place of Dragan Kalinic, party officials announced Saturday (3 July). Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in BiH, sacked Kalinic and 59 other Bosnian Serb officials last week for failing to detain major war crimes suspects.
In other news, the Party of Democratic Progress (PDP) said it would ask Cavic to call new general elections in the entity following the removal of the 60 senior officials. Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic, who is also head of the PDP, called for the removal of three cabinet members from the mostly Muslim Party of Democratic Action.
Meanwhile, SFOR troops patrolled BiH's border with Serbia-Montenegro for a third day Friday. A spokesman for the peacekeepers said this was "a routine operation", unrelated to any particular search for war crimes suspects. (AFP - 03/07/04; AP, AFP, BBC - 02/06/04)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police arrested 35 people on Monday (March 9th) -- including 19 fellow police officers -- suspected of fraud, embezzlement and abuse of office, an anonymous interior ministry official announced. According to the source, the suspects will undergo questioning about smuggling oil, alcohol and other excise goods across the Kosovo border. They also allegedly committed money laundering, tax evasion and bribery. The operation, conducted early Monday in the southwestern towns of Raska, Novi Pazar and Kraljevo, followed a promise by President Boris Tadic last week to fight organised crime and corruption. If convicted, the suspects each face up to 15 years in prison. (Reuters, B92 - 09/03/09)

TIRANA, Albania -- Albania's opposition Democrats staged a massive rally in the capital on Saturday (21 February), urging Prime Minister Fatos Nano to resign. Thousands of people gathered in downtown Tirana to hear opposition leader Sali Berisha accuse the government of corruption and ties to organised crime. Berisha, the first post-communist president of Albania, urged the protesters to remain calm and refrain from violence. About 2,500 police in riot gear stood watch at Saturday's events, but did not intervene. (AFP, ATA - 21/02/04)

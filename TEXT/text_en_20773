ATHENS, Greece -- Severe storms lashed most of the Balkans on Monday (August 6th), following the heat wave last week. Northern Greece was among the hardest hit areas, with heavy flooding reported in Thessaloniki and Alexandroupolis. Hundreds of hectares of cotton and tobacco crops were destroyed.
Romanian authorities expect strong winds, heavy rain and hail for the next few days. The Environment Ministry issued an alert for 23 prefectures in eastern and southern Romania. Three people died in Constanta on Monday when strong winds knocked a tree onto their car. 
In Bulgaria, four women and a man drowned in floods Tuesday caused by torrential rain in the town of Tsar Kaloyan near the Black Sea coastal city of Burgas. Ten people were injured and four remain missing. 
Torrential rains helped extinguish wildfires raging for more than two weeks in Macedonia. A cold front Sunday night forced temperatures below zero degrees Celsius at the Solunska Glava mountain summit, covering it with snow. 
Croatia got a taste of extreme weather as well, with temperatures in some parts of the country dropping to 7.5 degrees Celsius. (Jurnalul national - 07/08/07; ANA-MPA, Reuters, RIA Novosti, A1, Focus, Hotnews.ro, Makfax - 06/08/07)

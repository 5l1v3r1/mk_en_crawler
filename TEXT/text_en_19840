ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Thousands gathered in Istanbul on Saturday (January 19th) to honor the memory of Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink, who was gunned down in front of his office one year ago. The editor of Agos was outspoken in his condemnation of the killings of Armenians in Turkey during World War I, which he described as genocide. In 2006, a Turkish court gave him a six-month suspended sentence for "insulting Turkishness". The gathering in Istanbul demanded a thorough investigation into Dink's murder. His killer and several accomplices have been arrested, but many believe that details about the conspiracy are still unknown.

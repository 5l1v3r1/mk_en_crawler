ANKARA, Turkey -- The army on Friday (January 16th) criticised broadening investigations into the so-called Ergenekon organisation, which is suspected of plotting a coup against the government. "Basic human rights and principles of law are being breached," including the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial, Brigadier General Metin Gurak, spokesman of the General Staff, told a press conference. It was the first comment by the army since last week's arrest of 40 more people in connection with the case. A total of 86 people, including retired army officers, politicians and lawyers, have been charged with involvement in the organisation's activities.
In other news, police announced on Saturday the seizure of a record 3.9 tonnes of hashish in the southeast village of Yalaza, north of Diayarbakir. Authorities say it was to be sold in order to provide funding for Kurdistan Workers' Party terrorists.
Also Saturday, an earthquake measuring 4.5 on the Richter scale rattled southeast Turkey. The epicentre was in the town of Osmaniye. The quake caused minor damage but no injuries. (RBK, Hurriyet, Anadolu news agency - 17/01/09; Reuters, AP - 16/01/09)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The international community's High Representative in BiH, Paddy Ashdown, was expected to announce on Wednesday (2 April) political changes that will be made in the wake of the Orao affair. The Office of the High Representative said Tuesday that the decision would address both the issue of political responsibility for the violations of the UN arms embargo in the Orao case, as well as the need for systemic reforms to prevent a repeat of such deals. Ashdown has said measures may include replacing Mirko Sarovic, the Serb member of the BiH Presidency, who served as Republika Srpska (RS) president at the time of the illegal trade to Iraq by the RS-based Orao company.

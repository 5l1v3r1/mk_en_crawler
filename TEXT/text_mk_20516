BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said on Thursday (January 10th) that the situation in Kosovo is volatile but that no one should delude themselves into thinking violence will determine the province's final status. DPA quotes him as saying NATO has a clear role in Kosovo "to protect minorities and majorities alike". He also stressed the need for close collaboration between NATO and the EU. NATO has approximately 16,000 KFOR peacekeepers in the province. 
In other news Thursday, Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko, the Russian member of the international troika that mediated between Kosovo's Albanians and Belgrade, warned that Moscow will use its veto power in the UN Security Council to block any motion for granting independence to Kosovo. The Council is due to discuss a UNMIK report on the situation next week. (Beta, Tanjug, B92, DPA, Ria-Novosti - 10/01/08)

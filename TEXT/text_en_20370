BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliament Speaker Oliver Dulic announced on Wednesday (December 12th) that presidential elections will be held on January 20th. If necessary, a run-off would be held on February 3rd. Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) responded by saying Dulic's Democratic Party unilaterally decided on the date, in violation of a coalition agreement that calls for making key decisions by consensus. The DSS insists that the date be set after the UN Security Council debates Kosovo's final status next week. (Danas - 13/12/07; RTS, AFP, Tanjug, Blic, RIA Novosti, Reuters, DPA - 12/12/07)

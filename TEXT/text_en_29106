BELGRADE, Serbia -- The country's Gay Pride parade is scheduled for October 10th in downtown Belgrade, organisers said on Monday (September 6th). They say it will provide an opportunity to urge the government to strengthen the fight against violence and discrimination. Some cabinet ministers and political parties have already vowed to support the event. Last year's parade, scheduled for Belgrade in September, was cancelled at the last minute due to threats. The October event would be the first since 2001, when marchers were beaten by ultranationalists, football fans and skinheads. (Beta, B92 - 06/09/10)

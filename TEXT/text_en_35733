SREBRENICA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte told the families of 8,000 Muslims killed in Srebrenica in 1995 that the international tribunal would not be closed until Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic are brought to justice. During a daylong visit to the site of the massacre on Wednesday (2 June), del Ponte said the two top suspects would probably be arrested by the end of the year. In Sarajevo, meanwhile, she promised five new indictments by late December.
In other news, the UN tribunal announced Wednesday that it has postponed the sentencing of Milan Babic, the president of the self-proclaimed Serb republic of Krajina during the 1991-1995 conflict. He pleaded guilty to one count of persecution in January. (Dnevni avaz - 03/06/04; Reuters, AFP, Pincom.info, PBS BiH - 02/06/04)

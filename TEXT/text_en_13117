BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Visiting Belgrade on Tuesday (27 December), Italian Foreign Minister Gianfranco Fini called for preserving the state union between Serbia and Montenegro, stressing that a clear line must be drawn between the cases of Kosovo and Montenegro. Both are seeking independence from Serbia: Podgorica via an independence referendum next year and Pristina via future status talks. Fini also stressed his belief that political and democratic forces in Serbia-Montenegro need unity on the issue of Kosovo's final status. He visits Pristina Wednesday.
Separately, Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic announced that the Serbian platform for the status talks must be ready within ten days. It would be based on the principle of maintaining existing borders in the region. 
In other news, Serbs demonstrated in the northern part of Mitrovica on Tuesday, demanding better protection, following the shootings of two Serbs there earlier this week.

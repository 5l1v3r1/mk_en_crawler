TIRANA, Albania -- Transparency International Albania (TIA) urged local institutions on Wednesday (January 19th) to initiate changes to the constitution regarding the immunity of state officials. A special parliamentary session needs to address the issue of stripping lawmakers, ministers, judges and every leader of an institution of their immunity, according to the organisation. "Statements and rhetorical support on immunity are not sufficient to break the barriers held by immunity and open the way for investigating officials," it added.

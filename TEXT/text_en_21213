SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The second election rerun in 15 polling stations Sunday (June 29th) wrapped up peacefully and without violations, says State Elections Commission Chairman Jovan Josifovski. Authorities re-staged the balloting in a number of Albanian-populated villages where violence and irregularities marred two earlier rounds. If no challenges emerge, officials will certify the results. On Sunday, EU Ambassador to Skopje Erwan Fouere said the election "took too long".
During a visit Friday, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Rosemary DiCarlo said Macedonia should quickly form a new VMRO-DPMNE-led government and proceed with implementation of its Euro-Atlantic integration reform agenda. At a press conference with DiCarlo, Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki said he expects the new government to be formed within two weeks, with the participation of at least one ethnic Albanian party.

THE HAGUE, the Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Thursday (December 24th) turned down former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic's request to replace his British court-appointed lawyer, Richard Harvey. Karadzic had said he wanted someone who "shares his cultural heritage and language". The court, however, noted that Karadzic's main legal adviser, Peter Robinson, comes from the United States. 
Karadzic's trial started on October 27th but was suspended until March of next year, due to Karadzic's refusal to attend the sessions. He says he has not been given enough time to prepare his defence. (AP, Reuters - 24/12/09)

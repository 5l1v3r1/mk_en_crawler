BUCHAREST, Romania -- A strike in the public sector fizzled as unions decided on Wednesday (June 2nd) to suspend the action only three days after it began. Protests continue in the education sector, but participation is lower than desired, as teachers decided not to suspend graduation exams. Furthermore, the government announced that wages in the CFR, the state railway company, would not be affected by planned austerity cuts. Next week, the government will face a vote of confidence that it initiated itself, seeking support for its measures. Most are taking effect now, including a 25% cut in salaries of public sector employees and a 15% cut in pensions and unemployment benefits. (Cotidianul - 03/06/10; Mediafax - 02/06/10)

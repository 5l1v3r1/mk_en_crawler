PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) Veterans Organisation is urging all war veterans not to recognise EULEX's authority in Kosovo. The organisation issued a press release Sunday (May 8th) telling all veterans not to respond to EULEX's requests for questioning or to provide statements under any circumstances, even if arrested.
This is in response to EULEX arresting a number of former KLA members accused of war crimes, which, according to the KLA, is an attempt to criminalise its 1990s liberation war. "Systematic arrests of our fellow fighters, their maltreatment and violation of all preliminary legal procedures, violation of fundamental human rights in those cases -- the council of the KLA war veterans unanimously concluded that this is not about establishment of justice," the organisation said in a statement.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday (May 5th) denied media reports saying he was planning to establish a new political party if his Justice and Development Party (AKP) is banned by the Constitutional Court, which has initiated a closure case against it on charges of Islamist activities. Turkish TV channel Kanal D reported on Monday that Erdogan announced his plans at a dinner with a small group of journalists on Saturday. Erdogan said these claims are not true and represent mere speculation by their authors. (Zaman - 06/05/08; Al Jazeera, Reuters - 05/05/08)

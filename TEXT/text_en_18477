BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The North Atlantic Council (NAC) ambassadors welcomed Macedonia's progress in implementing NATO integration-related reforms and urged the country to keep up the pace, during a meeting with top Macedonian government officials in Brussels on Wednesday (May 9th). Foreign and defence ministers Antonio Milososki and Lazar Elenovski, respectively, visited the Pact's headquarters and held talks with NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer and the NAC envoys. Macedonian officials caution however that the positive evaluation does not guarantee an invitation to join NATO at its summit next year. (Vecer, MRT - 10/05/07; MIA - 09/05/07)

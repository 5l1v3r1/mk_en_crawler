BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police detained on Monday (August 17th) a man who made veiled death threats against Zarko Korac, president of the opposition Social Democratic Union, and Milos Vasic, a journalist at the Vreme weekly. Sinisa Vucinic, self-described president of the Republika Srpska Serb Chetnik Movement initiative committee, told Bosnian Serb media in July that Korac and Vasic could face the same fate as their friend, Zoran Djindjic. The Serbian prime minister was assassinated in Belgrade in March 2003. Vucinic will remain in custody for eight days pending an investigation. (B92, Tanjug, RTS, Beta, AP -17/08/09)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Elections Committee fears that many municipalities may be unable to finance local elections next year, according to a report Sunday (24 August) by Radio BH1. Quoting Elections Committee Chairman Hilmo Pasic, the station reported that local authorities have approved budgets for 77 out of 148 elections committees. In an interview with the local news agency FENA, Pasic expressed concern that nearly half of the approved budgets would be insufficient to finance the ballots.

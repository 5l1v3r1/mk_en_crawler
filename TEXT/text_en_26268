MOSCOW, Russia -- Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday (January 13th) that significant progress has been made in getting Ankara to agree to build part of the South Stream pipeline in its Black Sea territorial waters. The statement followed a meeting with Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Moscow. "We have agreed that by November 10th the Turkish government will carry out an audit and will give us permission for construction," Putin said. The pipeline would allow Russia to bypass Ukraine in delivering its gas to Europe. 
During Erdogan's visit, the two countries signed a declaration to build a nuclear plant in Mersin, Turkey. The energy sector is key to both countries. The tender for the plant on the Mediterranean coast was announced in September 2008. The only participant was a consortium of Russia's Atomstroyexport, Inter RAO and Turkey's Park Teknik.
Another issue discussed during Erdogan's visit were steps to remove visas for citizens travelling between Turkey and Russia. Erdogan said he hopes it will happen by May or June. (AFP, Reuters, Radio Free Europe, ITAR-TASS, BBC - 13/01/10)

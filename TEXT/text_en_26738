TIRANA, Albania -- A parliamentary committee adopted a draft law Wednesday (March 10th) on the State Intelligence Service (SHISH) which, if passed, would give the prime minister more power to decide on co-operation with foreign intelligence services. The draft also stipulates that SHISH would have no police or military duties. The full parliament will discuss the bill next week. (Lajmifundit, Top Channel, Vizion +, Klan - 10/03/10)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The trials of those charged in connection with the assassinations of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic and former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic will not start before September, according to Serbian Supreme Court President Sonja Brkic. On Sunday (4 May), she announced that a special group of three magistrates and nine criminal judges would be formed to conduct the trials. She also said it would be impossible to keep their names out of the news, given the tremendous appetite for media coverage. (FoNet, B92 - 05/05/03)

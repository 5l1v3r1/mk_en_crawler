ANKARA, Turkey -- Around 1,000 people, most of them cafe owners, protested on Tuesday (August 18th) outside the health ministry building in Ankara against the recently-introduced ban on smoking in cafes, bars and restaurants. The angry owners, from different provinces, say the ban is hurting business in an already tough economy. The ban brings Turkey in line with most EU member countries. But data compiled by the Turkey Chambers and Stock Markets Union suggests cafes are seeing 20% fewer customers since the ban was introduced last month. (Zaman - 19/08/09; AFP - 18/08/09)

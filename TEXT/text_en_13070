SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH State Court sentenced former Federation of BiH (FBiH) Defence Minister Miroslav Prce to 18 months in prison Friday (24 February), following his conviction for abuse of office. The charges stem from his move to disband the FBiH Army's Croat component in March 2001, when illegal Croat self-rule was proclaimed in the entity. Prce is already serving a five-year sentence for embezzlement related to the Hercegovacka Banka scandal. On Monday, the judges rolled the two sentences into one, for a total of six years.

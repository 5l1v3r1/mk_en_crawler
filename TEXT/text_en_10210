BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU will tie the launch of accession talks with Croatia to Zagreb's co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, AFP reported Monday (29 November), quoting the draft text of the EU 17 December summit's final statement. While the draft does not provide a tentative date for the start of negotiations â€“ an issue to be decided at the summit itself -- it makes it clear that the EU must be convinced of Croatia's co-operation with the UN court before the talks can get under way. Croatia hopes the negotiations will begin in March 2005. 
Also Monday, Croatian Deputy Prime Minister and presidential candidate Jadranka Kosor urged President Stipe Mesic and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader to resolve their ongoing dispute. Mesic wants counterintelligence chief Josko Podbevsek dismissed over the case of a detained journalist. Sanader has refused to sign the dismissal decree.

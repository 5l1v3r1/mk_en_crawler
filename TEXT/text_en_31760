BOURGAS, Bulgaria -- The left-wing opposition party BSP has decided not to seek a no-confidence vote over the cabinet's policy on Iraq, amid concerns it could lead to a consolidation of positions by the ruling NMS-II party and the right-wing opposition UDF. The decision was announced Sunday (6 April) by BSP deputy chairman Rumen Ovcharov. He pointed out however that the party was still considering a vote against the government on domestic issues, including the failed privatisation tender for Bulgartabac and the draft privatisation contract for BTC telecom.
In other news, Czech Foreign Minister Cyril Svoboda arrived in Sofia on Monday to meet with his Bulgarian counterpart Solomon Passy.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The Turkish Foreign Ministry said Wednesday (16 April) that a gradual redeployment of NATO forces in Turkey is the most appropriate way to proceed, as levels of threat from Iraq have decreased. Before the war, NATO deployment in Turkey consisted of surveillance aircraft and crews, missile defences and chemical and biological defence equipment. (Anadolu Agency, TRT 2 - 16/04/03)

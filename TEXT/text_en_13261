SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski said on Sunday (27 November) that his country is neither part of the Kosovo problem nor part of the solution, during his meeting with the UN special envoy for Kosovo status talks, Martti Ahtisaari, in Skopje. It was the last stop in Ahtisaari's weeklong tour of the Western Balkans, aimed at hearing the views of all sides related -- in one way or another -- to Kosovo. According to Skopje media reports, Crvenkovski told Ahtisaari that Macedonia would back any solution that is found via internationally mediated negotiations and that respects existing borders in the region.

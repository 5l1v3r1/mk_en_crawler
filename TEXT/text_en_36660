TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament on Friday (30 April) discussed a warning by the Parliamentarian Assembly of the Council of Europe (CoE) that another problematic election might result in the exclusion of Albania from CoE structures. The CoE noted that despite progress over the past three years towards a functioning pluralist democracy and the rule of law, such achievements are threatened by organised crime and corruption.

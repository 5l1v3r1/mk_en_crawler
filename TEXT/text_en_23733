SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Regional prosecutors in Haskovo on Tuesday (April 21st) launched an investigation of astrologist Emil Leshtanski for spreading panic in the city with his forecasts of a destructive earthquake on Easter. On Saturday, hundreds of people left their homes and spent the night in tents and cars after Leshtanski warned an earthquake measuring up to 7.0 on the Richter scale would rock the city of 80,000 at night. When nothing happened, panic gave way to anger. Transport companies said they would sue the astrologist because of the dozens of cancelled tickets on the day before Easter. Leshtanski publicly apologised to residents in the newspaper that carries his daily horoscopes. (Reuters, Darik, BNT, 24 Chasa, Dnevnik, Actualno - 21/04/09)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The police announced on Saturday (August 8th) that they have arrested former mujahedeen Karaj Kamel bin Ali, also known as Abu Hamza, who escaped from the Zenica prison two weeks ago. Bin Ali was detained close to the prison where he failed to return after a 25-day leave granted for good behaviour. Hamza is serving a 46-month sentence for armed robbery and domestic violence. He is on BiH's list of people who pose a threat to national security because of suspected ties to terrorist organisations. (Fonet, Beta, B92, AP, Radio 202 - 08/08/09)

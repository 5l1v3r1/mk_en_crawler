TIRANA, Albania -- OSCE Parliamentary Assembly Deputy Chairman Wolfgang Grossruck said on Friday (August 21st) that he June 28th general elections were Albania's best ever. Grossruck was in Tirana to meet with Democratic Party (DP) leader Sali Berisha, and Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI) leader Ilir Meta. "We saw a lot of improvement and therefore we can say that they were the best elections ever organised in Albania. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of work to be done and more to be achieved. I invite Albanian politicians to collaborate for the good of this country," Grossruck told Berisha. Opposition Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama disagreed, saying the elections were a "deformation of democracy". 
In other news, Meta's decision for SMI to enter a coalition with the ruling DP has caused a division among party members. Senior SMI member Pellumb Xhufi told journalists on Friday the deal with is self-destructive for the party. "The votes given to the leftists cannot be a vote in support of Berisha's government. We do not want to command respect to anyone, but we cannot accept any talks with the DP," Xhufi said. (Makfax, Alsat, BTA - 22/08/09)

TIRANA, Albania -- Justice Minister Ilir Rusmajli resigned on Wednesday (November 14th) a day after the general director of the country's prison service accused him of corruption. Rusmaji described his resignation, which was requested by the opposition Socialist Party on Tuesday, as a "moral act". Prison Director Saimir Shehri triggered the chain of events by announcing his own wish to step down, claiming Rusmajli's relatives had threatened him over a tender. At issue was the construction of a pre-trial detention facility in Durres. Rusmajli denies the allegations, and said Shehri wants to step down because he cannot do his job.

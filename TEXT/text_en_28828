SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- About 15,000 Bosnian Muslims gathered in Banja Luka, capital of the Bosnian Serb entity Republika Srpska (RS), on Thursday (September 9th) for a service to mark the Bayram holiday and pray for peace, co-existence and tolerance. For the first time, Haris Silajdzic, the Muslim member of BiH's tripartite presidency, attended the service. "I have come here with a message for a better life, tolerance, and respect for each other," he said. (B92, FoNet, Radio Free Europe, Nezavisne Novine - 09/09/10)

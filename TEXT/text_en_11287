SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In an interview published in Friday's (25 March) Nezavisne Novine, US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney urged Republika Srpska (RS) to continue defence reforms. McElhaney stressed that last week's opposition to defence reform legislation in the RS Parliament meant a new setback in the process. He reiterated that BiH has three priorities if it wants to move further towards Euro-Atlantic integration: defence reform, war crimes co-operation, and police reform.

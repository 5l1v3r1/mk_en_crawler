BUCHAREST, Romania -- Germany will restrict the access of workers from Bulgaria and Romania to its labour market after the two Balkan countries join the EU in January, German Labour Ministry State Secretary Gerd Andres announced during a visit to Bucharest on Monday (October 23rd). Andres cited the high unemployment rate in Germany -- some 10% on average but soaring to 22% in eastern areas -- as the main reason. (BNR, Rompres, Mediafax - 23/10/06)

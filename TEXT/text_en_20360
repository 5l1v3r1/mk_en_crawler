SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak will address the UN Security Council on Thursday (November 15th), telling members that BiH's biggest problem is its non-functionality, according to a statement by his office Tuesday. Lajcak will say that the crisis provoked by measures he proposed on October 19th only proves the country needs serious constitutional reform. He will stress that there are two options for the future of BiH -- escalation of the artificial political crisis, which leads to isolation, or an easing of the crisis and a moving forward along the path to European integration. 
Separately Tuesday, EUFOR spokesman Major David Fielder said the political crisis is not affecting security for the time being. (OHR website, Fena, RTRS - 13/11/07)

VIENNA, Austria -- A year of negotiations on the future of Kosovo have ended without agreement, UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari announced on Saturday (10 March), as the last round of talks wrapped up in Vienna. "No amount of additional negotiations will change that. It is my firm conclusion that the potential of negotiations is exhausted," he said, explaining that the two sides were not able to find any common ground on the revised version of his plan for Kosovo. Ahtisaari said he will now prepare the final version of his blueprint and forward it to the UN Security Council within a month. The Council has not said when it would hold a debate on the proposal. 
Serbian leaders reiterated their objections to the Ahtisaari plan, saying it contains elements of independence for Kosovo and is thus unacceptable to Belgrade. President Boris Tadic repeated Serbia's offer of "substantial autonomy with international guarantees". Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders, meanwhile, welcomed the plan and stated again that their goal is complete independence. "Independence is the alpha and omega -- the beginning and end of our position," Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu said.

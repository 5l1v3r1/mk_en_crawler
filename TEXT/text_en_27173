ZAGREB, Croatia -- The trial for the murder of prominent Croatian publisher and journalist Ivo Pukanic has been adjourned until March 15th in order to give the fifth man charged in the case time to prepare his defence. Bojan Guduric, who was extradited to Croatia last week, appeared before a court in Zagreb for the first time on Wednesday (March 3rd). He told the judge that he prefers to hire his own lawyer rather than have one appointed by the court. The Serb turned himself in to police in Banja Luka on February 1st. Four other suspects in the case are already on trial in Zagreb. Pukanic, co-owner and editor-in-chief of the weekly Nacional, died in a car bombing in downtown Zagreb on October 23rd 2008, along with the newspaper's marketing director, Niko Franjic.

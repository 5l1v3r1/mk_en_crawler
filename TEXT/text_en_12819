TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Fatos Nano met on Wednesday (2 February) with Italian Ambassador to Tirana Attilio Iannucci, who described measures Rome is taking to assist the legal labour force from Albania. Italy has set an annual quota of 3,000 legal workers from Albania, which Iannucci described as the highest issued by the EU member state. 
In other news, the Tirana press reported Thursday that the country's two main political forces -- the ruling Socialist Party and the opposition Democratic Party -- are again attempting to strike a deal on new election zones. Representatives of the parties met at the OSCE Presence in Tirana but failed to reach an agreement. (Albanian News - 03/02/05)

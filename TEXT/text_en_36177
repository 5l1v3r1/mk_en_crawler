ZAGREB, Croatia -- OSCE Secretary General Jan Kubis said Tuesday (9 March) that Croatia needs more international aid to prepare for the return of its refugees. According to estimates, 280,000 ethnic Serbs fled Croatia during the 1991-1995 war; only about 100,000 have returned so far. Their return is a condition Croatia must meet for eventual EU accession.
In other news, the deputy head of the OSCE Mission in Croatia, Robert Becker, criticised the lack of co-operation between local authorities and ethnic Serb, Albanian and Bosniak minorities in the district of Zadar. After meetings with minority representatives from several regions, he said the situations in Vukovar and Osijek were much better.
Also Tuesday, a court in Vukovar indicted ten people for war crimes against civilians and prisoners of war. They are also charged with destroying cultural and historical heritage monuments in Vukovar in the autumn of 1991. (HINA, SRNA - 09/03/04)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj will appear before The Hague war crimes tribunal on October 28th, as prosecutors appeal his earlier acquittal, according to an announcement Wednesday (August 26th). Haradinaj was found innocent in April 2008 of all charges for crimes he allegedly committed in Kosovo between March and September 1998. He and two co-defendants, who were also former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, were indicted for kidnapping, torture, rape and murder of Serbs, Roma and fellow Albanians. Co-defendant Idriz Balaj was also cleared of charges, while Lahi Brahimaj was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison. Prosecutors are appealing all three verdicts.
In other news, a group of Kosovo Serb journalists staged a protest Wednesday outside the EULEX headquarters in Pristina, demanding investigations into cases of journalists who went missing between 1998 and 2000. The protesters held large banners in Serbian and Albanian reading "Bring us back our colleagues." (RTK, Telegrafi, Klan Kosova, B92 - 26/08/09)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Peace Implementation Council (PIC) Board's political directors approved High Representative Paddy Ashdown's near-term mission-implementation strategy for BiH during their session in Sarajevo last week. According to the PIC board's statement, the strategy aims at assisting the BiH authorities in completing set administrative and legal reforms and the consolidation of defence, police and intelligence sectors. It was stressed that a major task at that stage is to make the BiH State Court and the BiH government fully operational, as well as to conduct VAT and customs reforms.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) said on Monday (September 20th) it is extending a month-long ceasefire that was to end Monday by another week, in order to observe political developments. "Until a new statement is made, we have extended the non-action," PKK spokesman Roj Welat said. One such political development is the September 12th public referendum on a series of constitutional reforms; the amendments got solid support from voters. The PKK also said they support an initiative by Kurdish groups to boycott school this week, the first of the new school year, to pressure the government into allowing Kurdish-language education for Kurdish children.

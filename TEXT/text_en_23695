SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The interior ministry has implemented massive layoffs of senior personnel at local police departments, according to media reports Thursday (May 21st). It has forced most of the senior officials into retirement. Opposition officials accused the ruling coalition of trying to strengthen its position in the interior ministry ahead of July's parliamentary elections. But Interior Minister Mihail Mikov says the cutbacks will allow for future pay hikes. (Trud, Darik, BGNES, Mediapool - 21/05/09)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Intelligence Security Agency (OSA) has laid off 500 agents, local media reported Monday (3 January). The OSA was formed by the merger of the Serb and Muslim-Croat intelligence agencies in May 2004. The current move is part of an ongoing reform aimed at consolidating and streamlining the two entities' security and defence establishments.
In other news Monday, BiH High Representative Paddy Ashdown's office announced a yearlong extension of the Defence Reform Commission's mandate. The panel's main task will be to devise a proposal for the legal and institutional measures needed for transfer of the entity competences in the defence field to the state level. Republika Srpska leaders oppose abolishing the entity defence and army structures. (Nezavisne novine - 04/01/05; AFP, Fena - 03/01/05; OHR sources - 31/12/04)

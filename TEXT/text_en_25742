BERLIN, Germany -- Finance ministry spokesman Martin Kreienbaum on Saturday (February 20th) denied media reports that Berlin is co-ordinating the actions of Eurozone members in providing financial aid to Greece. Kreienbaum said Germany has no specific plan to help Greece overcome its debt crisis. The statement came after the German newspaper Der Spiegel reported on its internet site earlier Saturday that the German government is co-ordinating Eurozone members in providing up to 25 billion euros. The report suggested that Germany would provide about 20% of that. Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said at the weekend that Athens wants political support for its actions to overcome the crisis, rather than financial assistance. (Xinhua, AFP - 20/02/10)

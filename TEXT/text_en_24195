BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Ending weeks of speculation, the European Commission (EC) on Wednesday (July 15th) recommended abolishing visa requirements for citizens of Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia, effective in January. EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and Justice Commissioner Jacques Barrot announced the EC's decision at a joint press conference in Strasbourg, saying the three countries have met the conditions required for visa-free status. The visa liberalisation proposal, which must still be approved by the EU's justice ministers, will not apply to Serbs in Kosovo. (Tanjug, Beta, RTCG, Fonet, MIA - 14/07/09)

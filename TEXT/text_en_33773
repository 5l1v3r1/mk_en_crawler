BUCHAREST, Romania -- Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said Wednesday (26 November) that Romania could join the EU in 2007 even if it is unable to complete accession talks by the end of 2005. Romania and Bulgaria hope to complete the negotiations in 2004 before the end of the term of the current European Commission. The Netherlands will hold the rotating EU presidency in the second half of 2004 and is the largest investor in the Romanian economy. (AFP, Mediafax, Rompres - 26/11/03)

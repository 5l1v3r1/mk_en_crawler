TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha responded to allegations of corruption regarding highway construction Saturday (June 14th) during the last stop of his Albania in NATO tour. After opening a new market in Kukes and promising further investments in the region, Berisha visited the Durres-Kukes highway, a future expressway leading to Kosovo. "This road is designed by two of the most renowned companies in the region, making the project transparent. No accusation can darken this amazing act," said Berisha, responding to accusations by the opposition of procedural violations and reduction of income for the government. The controversial deal led to the arrest of several senior officials last September for allegedly rigging construction-related tenders.
In other news, lawmakers are voting on Monday whether to lift the immunity of former Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu, who has been implicated in the deadly March 15th blasts at an ammunitions depot in Gerdec. Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli said on Sunday she hopes this will be the last time parliament applies current procedures against a member.

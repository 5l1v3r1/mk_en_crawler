WASHINGTON, United States -- Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Romania are among 30 countries that have offered to help the United States in Iraq by contributing to military or police operations, according to an announcement Monday (28 July) by the US State Department. Washington has agreed to pay more than $200m for the airlift and support of these troops.
In other news, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said his government might need several months to decide whether to send peacekeepers to Iraq. He said the move would require approval by parliament, which is in recess from August to October. Gul also said he believes recent problems between Ankara and Washington over Iraq have been overcome.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Sarajevo hosted a forum of experts in the field of visa liberalisation and harmonisation from the South East Europe Co-operation Process (SEECP) countries on Thursday (22 January). Representatives of Albania, BiH, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia-Montenegro and Turkey attended. They decided during the meeting that they would officially submit a proposal to the SEECP political directors, elaborating on an action plan that liberalises the visa regime in the region. BiH initiated the idea last year, when it held the rotating presidency of SEECP. It has since gained support from the EU. (RTRS, PBS BiH - 22/01/04)

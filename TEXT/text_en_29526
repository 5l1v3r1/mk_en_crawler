NEW YORK, United Nations -- The UN Security Council issued a statement Monday (May 31st) urging a "prompt, impartial, credible and transparent" inquiry into the Israeli attack on a flotilla carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza. At least ten people were killed and dozens were injured in the raid. The UN statement came after hours of discussions. In it, the Council insisted on the immediate release of the ships and civilians held by Israeli authorities. Later Tuesday, NATO ambassadors will hold an emergency meeting requested by Turkey to discuss the raid. (BBC, AP, Xinhua, Zaman, AFP - 31/05/10)

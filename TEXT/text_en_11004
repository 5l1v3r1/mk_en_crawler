BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The city of Belgrade will form a co-ordination centre to include Romas in the day-to-day life of the capital, Mayor Nenad Bogdanovic announced on Thursday (28 July). The panel will focus primarily on tackling the issues of employment, housing, education and healthcare. Romas face significant problems in housing. The latest attempt to build them temporary housing was met with protests by those who fear the value of their real estate will fall once Romas move to their neighbourhood. Belgrade's long-term plan is to provide so-called social housing for Roma families. (B92, Beta - 28/07/05)

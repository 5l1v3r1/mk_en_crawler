BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Wednesday (23 May) that -- pending the final results of Montenegro's independence referendum -- proposals for separate Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) negotiating mandates for Montenegro and Serbia would be prepared. The proposals, to be submitted to the EU Council of Ministers, would provide for a new mandate for Montenegro and an amended one for Serbia. "The European perspective is open to Montenegro, as it is to Serbia, once Serbia fulfils the various criteria, in particular, co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal," said Rehn. 
In other news Tuesday, Svetozar Marovic announced plans to resign from the posts of Serbia-Montenegro president and head of the federal Council of Ministers this week. He is expected to hold the last Council session on Thursday. (Blic, Danas - 24/05/06; EU Web site, AFP, RTS, Srna - 23/05/06)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Dutch Foreign Minister Uri Rosenthal reiterated in an interview Wednesday (May 25th) with the Belgrade-based daily Vecernje Novosti that Serbia's further progress in the EU integration process will depend on its co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal. Chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz will present his report to the UN Security Council next month. The Netherlands insists on Belgrade's full co-operation, a key condition for Serbia to be offered EU candidate status. (Vecernje Novosti, B92, Radio Free Europe - 25/05/11)

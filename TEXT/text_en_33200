PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic and UNMIK head Michael Steiner said Friday (13 June) that the first direct talks between the Serbian government and the leaders of Kosovo could start at the end of June or early in July. Representatives are also expected to meet on the sidelines of the EU summit in Thessaloniki later this week. Steiner pointed to Brussels as the venue of the future talks, saying "the dialogue will be about a full implementation of UN resolution 1244." Zivkovic said the return of Serb refugees would be a priority for his government. (AFP - 13/06/03)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prosecutors have launched a corruption probe against Federation of BiH (FBiH) Prime Minister Nedzad Brankovic and 12 other senior state officials in connection with the restructuring of the entity's energy sector. Prosecutors explained on Tuesday (April 8th) that the officials were suspected of "abuse of office in making decisions". The group includes Industry Minister Vahid Heco and several managers of the main FBiH power utility, Elektroprivreda BiH. Prosecutors say the officials gave preferential treatment to certain investors and tried to award them lucrative contracts while skipping some legal requirements related to public procurement.
Media reports cite the awarding of contracts in 2006 to the Austrian consortium APET to build four hydroelectric power plants. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 09/04/08; RTRS, Fena, AFP - 08/04/08)

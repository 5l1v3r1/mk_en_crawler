ZAGREB, Croatia -- Cardinal Josip Bozanic, Archbishop of Zagreb, visited the site of the notorious Jasenovac concentration camp on Thursday (September 24th), the first such visit by a local head of the Catholic Church. Bozanic mourned the tens of thousands of people killed there by the country's pro-Nazi World War II regime. "Here in Jasenovac we feel a deep pain due to all the victims, especially those who suffered and were killed here by Croatian people and notably by members of the Catholic Church," he said. However, Bozanic offered no apologies and instead, defended the Church. "Although we recognise the sin of those who unworthily bore the Catholic name, the Catholic Church never took part or supported those crimes," he said. The cardinal also honoured the victims of the Communist regime. Critics accuse the Church and World War II-era Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac of collaborating with the Ustasha regime.

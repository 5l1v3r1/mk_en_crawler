SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Senior Deputy High Representative to BiH Peter Bas-Backer reiterated calls for progress in crucial EU integration-related reforms, in an interview in the local Nezavisne Novine daily on Saturday (May 19th). He implied that the stalemate over the initiative for constitutional amendments must not affect implementation of other crucial measures, required for sealing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. Bas-Backer said key measures include the restructuring of BiH's police sector and public broadcasting sector, and the fulfilment of remaining obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Parliament's constitutional committee is expected to approve two documents related to the new draft constitution Monday (August 6th). These, along with the constitution bill approved by the panel last week, would then move to the full parliament for debate. Opposition parties said on Sunday their members would skip Monday's committee session. The opposition walked out of parliament on July 30th, after its request for an open session was ignored.

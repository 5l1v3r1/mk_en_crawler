BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Thursday's (9 December) edition of the Banja Luka daily Nezavisne novine reported that war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic might have stayed in eastern Republika Srpska (RS) in June and July. Citing an unnamed international official, the publication said that Mladic, former military commander of the Bosnian Serbs, was in the Crank Reject complex in Han Peak, under the protection of the RS Army. The source said he was moved to that location because of the presidential elections in Serbia and the NATO summit in late June, amid concerns that the circumstances might lead to Mladic's arrest and extradition to The Hague tribunal.

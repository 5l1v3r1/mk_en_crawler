ROME, Italy -- Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said in an interview with the Italian national television channel RAI on Sunday (September 14th) that his country has fulfilled all NATO membership criteria and 75% of EU membership criteria. Gruevski was speaking on the second day of a visit to Italy, where he is participating in one of the biggest forums in the European and Mediterranean region, Fiera del Levante, in Bari. On Saturday, Gruevski met with Italian counterpart Silvio Berlusconi and discussed bilateral economic co-operation, Macedonia's EU prospects and the name dispute with Greece.

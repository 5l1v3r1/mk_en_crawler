PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX is working to help locate mass graves and will start a field operation early next year, Alberto Perduca, head of EULEX's justice component, said on Monday (October 19th) after meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Rame Manaj. "It is crucial to move forward in identifying as many grave sites as we possibly can, in order to increase the number of exhumed body remains and to accelerate their identification," said Perduca. EULEX is in charge of gathering information from Serbia about possible mass graves in Kosovo from the 1998-1999 war. Manaj says identifying 1,900 missing persons of all ethnicities in Kosovo is a top priority. (Koha Ditore, Zeri, Lajm, Express - 20/10/09; Kohavision, TV 21 - 19/10/09)

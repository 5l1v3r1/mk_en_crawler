BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's Deputy Prosecutor for War Crimes Dusan Knezevic on Friday (25 November) demanded 20-year sentences for each of the 16 indictees on trial in Belgrade for the murder of Croatian prisoners outside Vukovar in November 1991. Nearly 200 prisoners were transported to the nearby Ovcara pig farm and gunned down after Serb-dominated Yugoslav Army forces retook the area from newly independent Croatia. The atrocity is considered one of the worst slaughters of POWs during the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s, and Serbia's conduct of the trial is being viewed as a key test of its judicial system's ability to handle war crimes cases. 
In his final statement before the jury, Knezevic said "hatred, rage and cruelty deserve a maximum sentence" of 20 years. The defence is expected to present its final statement in early December. (Danas, HRT, AP - 26/11/05)

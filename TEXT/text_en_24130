LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- The government approved on Thursday (May 14th) amendments to EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn's proposal to resolve the border dispute with Croatia. Prime Minister Borut Pahor pointed out that without these amendments there can be no deal on arbitration, as envisioned in Rehn's proposal. According to Croatian media, Ljubljana's response contains five amendments. The European Commission has said it will wait for Ljubljana's formal reply before commenting. Resolving the border dispute would speed up Croatia's EU accession bid. (Tanjug, STA, HRT, Javno - 14/05/09)

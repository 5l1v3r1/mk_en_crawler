SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH) -- US authorities deported to BiH on Wednesday (April 28th) a Bosnian Serb genocide suspect. Marko Boskic, 45, was taken to prison upon his arrival in Sarajevo. Bosnian authorities accuse him of genocide committed in Srebrenica in 1995. He immigrated to the United States after the conflict, but failed to reveal that he had served in the Bosnian Serb army and was sentenced in 2006 for immigration fraud.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Prosecutors at the UN war crimes tribunal on Thursday (February 10th) requested prison terms of up to 40 years each for former Bosnian Croat leader Jadranko Prlic and five co-defendants charged with committing crimes against Muslims. Prlic, 51, a former prime minister of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia, faces 26 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The other defendants in the case are former Defence Minister Bruno Stojic, and four ex-senior military officials. The trial, now wrapping up, began in April 2006. 
Separately Thursday, judges at The Hague approved a six-week suspension of the trial against Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic. He sought a three-month suspension to allow his lawyers time to study new material provided by prosecutors. (Vecernje Novosti, Press Online, e-novine, RTRS, Nacional, Dnevni Avaz, Srna - 10/02/11)

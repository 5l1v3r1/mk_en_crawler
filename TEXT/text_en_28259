ZAGREB, Croatia -- A parliamentary committee on Monday (August 16th) stripped convicted war criminal Branimir Glavas, a lawmaker from the Croatian Democratic Party of Slavonia and Baranja, of his parliamentary status. Commission Chairman Damir Sesvecan said that Glavas' mandate was terminated in accordance with the law, after the Supreme Court upheld his conviction for war crimes against Serbian civilians during the 1991-1995 conflict. In late July, his prison sentence was reduced from ten to eight years for 1991 war crimes committed against ethnic Serbs in the city of Osijek. (HRT, Nova TV, tportal.hr, Tanjug - 16/08/10)

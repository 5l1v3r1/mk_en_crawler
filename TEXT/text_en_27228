BELGRADE, Serbia -- German police have arrested Serbian neo-Nazi leader Goran "the Fuhrer" Davidovic, media reported on Wednesday (February 3rd). Justice Minister Snezana Malovic said authorities have requested his extradition. Interpol issued an arrest warrant for Davidovic who was sentenced in Serbia to a year in prison for inciting national, ethnic and religious hatred stemming from a 2005 attack against participants of an anti-Fascist meeting. He was arrested on the warrant last April in Italy but was freed on appeal. Authorities are not sure how he made it to Germany. (B92, Tanjug, Beta, RTS - 03/02/10)

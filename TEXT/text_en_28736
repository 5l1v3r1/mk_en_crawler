TIRANA, Albania -- Mayor Edi Rama wants to continue rehab work on the city's main square, the Skenderbej. Rama visited the site Sunday (April 11th), and confirmed that the historic square should be modernised to meet 21st century standards. Rama, leader of the main opposition Socialist Party, said the most challenging part is the underground work, which will be multifunctional, as well as managing traffic around the square. The ruling Democratic Party says the project lacks the necessary licenses. (Shekulli, Top News, Lajmifundit, Klan - 11/04/10)

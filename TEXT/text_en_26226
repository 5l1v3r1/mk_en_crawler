SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Expert teams from the United States and the EU arrived in Sarajevo again on Monday (October 12th) to prepare for the next round of talks with party leaders aimed at breaking the longstanding political stalemate. It has impeded progress towards EU and NATO accession for months. The first round was held Friday at Camp Butmir near Sarajevo. Leaders of seven Muslim, Croat and Serb parties attended, along with senior EU and US officials. The next round is scheduled for October 20th. 
High Representative Valentin Inzko said in an interview with German political weekly Der Spiegel on Monday that the international community will no longer tolerate any foot-dragging as regards implementing necessary reforms. (BHRT, RTRS, Srna, Onasa - 12/10/09)

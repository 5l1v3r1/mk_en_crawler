WASHINGTON, United States -- The US-led international coalition has backed Bulgaria's idea on taking a common stand against terrorists' demands in Iraq. "We're united in our resolve to make no concessions to terrorists nor to succumb to terrorist threats," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said in a statement Thursday (5 August). He went on to add that Bulgaria initiated the idea on a joint stand as a means to counter incidents of kidnappings and killings of foreign civilian workers. Bulgaria has 480 troops in Iraq. Albania was among the first countries to endorse the US statement Thursday. (Reuters, AFP, AP, UPI, Bloomberg - 05/08/04)

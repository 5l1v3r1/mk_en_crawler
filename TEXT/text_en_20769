ATHENS, Greece - The government is preparing to call national elections next month, according to senior government sources quoted by Kathimerini on Tuesday (August 7th). According to the sources, Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis plans to announce the date later this month, with September 23rd considered the most likely choice. Sources say the goal would be to take advantage of the largely positive response to new social benefits announced by the government. Public approval, however, has been tempered somewhat by anger over the handling of forest fires this summer. (Kathimerni, Ethnos - 07/08/07)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn have prepared a document aimed at supporting stabilisation in BiH and will present it to EU foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels next week, Solana spokeswoman Cristina Gallach told the SRNA agency Wednesday (November 5th). According to a version obtained by the Beta news agency, the document will say the EU must strengthen its influence in BiH so that the duties of International High Representative Miroslav Lajcak can shift to an EU special envoy. The document also argues that "widespread international engagement" in BiH must go on "primarily in co-operation with the EU, not individually". Solana and Rehn also make a point of criticising the worsening political climate in BiH, a reference to strident nationalistic rhetoric that is slowing reforms.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A court on Monday (20 June) handed down a life sentence to a prominent Islamic militant after it found him guilty of plotting to crash an aircraft into the mausoleum of Kemal Ataturk in Ankara. According to prosecutors, Metin Kaplan and his group, Caliphate State, planned to attack the site during celebrations marking the 75th anniversary of the founding of secular Turkey in 1998. The plot was foiled when the police arrested 23 conspirators. Kaplan fled to Germany but was extradited in October 2004 following Ankara's revocation of the death penalty. His group wants to topple Turkey's secular government and create an Islamic state. Kaplan's lawyers say they will appeal. (AP, TurkishPress.com, AFP - 20/06/05)

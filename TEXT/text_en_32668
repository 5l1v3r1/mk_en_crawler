TIRANA, Albania -- Bilateral relations with Yugoslavia improved substantially during the past year, Foreign Minister Ilir Meta said in a report presented Saturday (21 December) to a Socialist Party commission. Meta said 2002 had seen new developments in relations with both Yugoslavia and Kosovo, with one highpoint being the signing in early September of an agreement raising relations with Belgrade to the ambassadorial level. Meta also noted some important developments in Albania's relations with Greece, especially in the areas of energy and fighting organised crime. (Tanjug -22/12/02; ATA - 21/12/01)

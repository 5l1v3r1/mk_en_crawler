ANKARA, Turkey -- Security officials confirmed that bomb squad experts foiled another bombing attempt late on Thursday (September 13th), by defusing a massive explosive device hidden in a minibus. The vehicle, carrying about 500kg of the powerful substance PTN, was intercepted on the road to Ankara. Police were notified of the suspicious van by Bulgarian customs officers, who found some discrepancies in the declarations of two Swedish citizens travelling in it. Earlier this week, Ankara police prevented another terror assault, defusing a 300kg bomb found inside a van parked in a car park in the centre of the city. Investigators reportedly are looking for a man in his early 20s in connection with that. Unconfirmed reports suggest he spoke Turkish with an Arabic accent, which might add a new twist to an investigation that has focused on terrorists with the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
In other news, a court sentenced a PKK rebel to life in prison without parole for the 1999 bombing of an Istanbul park that killed one person and injured more than 30. Mesil Demiralp also was convicted of planting a bomb in a cafÃ© at the same time. It did not go off. (Hurriyet, Focus - 14/09/07; NTV, AFP - 13/09/07)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Representatives of BiH's leading political powers and the international community gathered on Monday (16 February) to discuss possible changes to the Dayton Peace Accord and the constitution. The roundtable was organised by several German foundations. Opening the event, the chairperson of the European Parliament's Committee for Southeast Europe, Doris Pack, said it is time to put Dayton on the agenda and assess the agreement's current impact on BiH's chances to join the EU. Most local party representatives agree on the need to revise aspects of the accord.
In other news, officials say a murder late last week in Sarajevo has been linked to an illegal shipment of heroin from Istanbul, Turkey. They say Zihad Hasanovic may have been killed after Turkish police scuttled the shipment and confiscated 15 kg of heroin.

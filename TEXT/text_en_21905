NICOSIA, Cyprus -- UN Undersecretary-General for Political Affairs Lynn Pascoe met separately on Tuesday (June 17th) with Greek Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat in an effort to launch fresh talks on the island's reunification. Afterwards, Pascoe said he is hopeful the process will move forward rapidly. Greek Cypriot government spokesman Stephanos Stephanou said Christofias briefed the UN official on Cyprus' wish to resolve the issue based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation as stipulated in UN resolutions. Talat said he used the opportunity to brief Pascoe on problems Turkish Cypriots face due to their economic isolation. He and Christofias hope to begin talks later this month.

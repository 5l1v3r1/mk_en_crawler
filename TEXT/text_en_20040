SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The European Commission (EC) progress report on BiH, currently being prepared and due to be released in November, is extremely negative, the Dnevni avaz daily reported on Sunday (September 16th), citing the head of the EC's enlargement department for BiH, Dirk Lange. Reportedly, the draft will mention only limited progress in certain areas. The only development that could change the negative conclusion would be striking a deal on police reform by the end of this month. 
Lange told the newspaper that the enlargement directorate has already forwarded to BiH a list of 27 issues to embark upon by the end of September to achieve a more favourable report. He added the EU strongly trusts High Representative Miroslav Lajcak and his abilities to bring the country to the desired breakthrough. (RTRS, Dnevni Avaz - 16/09/07)

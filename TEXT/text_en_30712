ZAGREB, Croatia -- Human rights watchdog Amnesty International on Friday (February 11th) slammed the lack of political will in Croatia to prosecute war crimes committed during the 1991-1995 conflict. The organisation's investigator for Croatia, Marek Marczynski, said that 15 years after the end of the war, there remain 700 unresolved war crimes cases. Currently, the country processes about 18 cases a year.
Marczynski's statement came in reaction to the Croat Justice Ministry's response to Amnesty's December report on the country. The document accused Deputy Parliamentary Speaker Vladimir Seks of failing to prevent or investigate crimes that took place in Osijek while he was in a commanding position. The ministry argues he could not have been aware of these crimes. (Nacional, AKI, Tanjug B92, Radio Free Europe - 11/02/11)

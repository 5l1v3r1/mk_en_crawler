SHKODER, Albania -- Albanian and Montenegrin border police chiefs met on Thursday (15 April) in the northern Albanian town of Shkoder to discuss co-operation in fighting cross-border crime. Albania's Arjan Ruci and his Montenegrin counterpart, Milan Paunovic, pledged to intensify collaboration against all types of trafficking, with the support of the EU. Such co-operation, they said, could provide a model for the entire region. A similar joint programme two years ago helped reduce trafficking along the border.
In other news, a Croatian-Montenegrin Friendship Council opened Thursday in Zagreb. Croatian President Stipe Mesic said it offers a "new type of communication between the two countries and within the region". Film director Veljko Bulajic was elected chairman of the council.

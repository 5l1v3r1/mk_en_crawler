PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Prosecutor's Office asked parliament Monday (October 26th) to strip lawmaker Agim Veliu of his immunity, in light of corruption charges. A member of the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), Veliu is suspected of abuse of power during his stint as education minister in the previous government. He is LDK's candidate for mayor of Podujeva/Podujevo in the November 15th municipal elections. Parliament is expected to discuss the request Tuesday.
In other news, the Central Election Commission (CEC) has accredited another 3,249 observers to monitor the upcoming elections. CEC Chairwoman Nesrin Lushta says it is important to have as many observers as possible to guarantee transparent elections. As of now, these first local elections since Kosovo declared independence will be monitored by 20,000 domestic and 1,000 foreign observers. (Express, Koha Ditore, Kosova Sot, Zeri - 27/10/09)

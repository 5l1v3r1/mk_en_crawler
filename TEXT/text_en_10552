SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The EU's special envoy to Macedonia, Michael Sahlin, has warned that if a referendum succeeds in derailing the country's new decentralisation laws, Macedonia's Euro-Atlantic integration would be delayed. In an interview with RFE late last week, Sahlin said that while no one questions the constitutionality of the November referendum, decentralisation is a key element of the Ohrid Framework Peace Accords, and a "no" vote would mean a setback.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn visited both Croatia and Slovenia on Wednesday (January 21st) in an apparent effort to lift the blockade that Slovenia has placed over Croatia's EU accession process. Due to a long-standing maritime border dispute, Slovenia is blocking certain chapters of Croatia's acquis. While Zagreb has called for international arbitration, Slovenia insists on EU involvement. Rehn has reportedly sought ways out of the crisis, which threatens to delay Croatia's accession. Croatian Foreign Minister Gordan Jandrokovic sounded optimistic Wednesday that the dispute could finally proceed to some form of international arbitration. EU representatives have said the countries themselves should resolve the dispute, without holding Croatia's accession process hostage. (HINA, 24sata, HRT - 21/01/09)

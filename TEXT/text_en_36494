THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal said Monday (9 August) that it has consulted Slobodan Milosevic on the possible appointment of a lawyer to help him with his defence. The court did not disclose Milosevic's response. The move came a week after prosecutors asked judges to appoint a defence council for the accused because of Milosevic's failing health. In the past, the defendant has opposed the idea of getting a lawyer. (AFP - 10/08/04; AFP, AP - 09/08/04)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The IMF has reportedly agreed with the government to consider a possible hike in public sector wages and pensions. Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic noted on Monday (May 17th) that Serbia has emerged from economic crisis, and returned to an annual GDP growth of 1% in the first quarter of this year. He acknowledged however, the public has not felt this improvement in terms of the standard of living. Under its programme with the IMF, Serbia has committed to reduce its budget deficit, cut public administration by 10% and freeze public sector wages and pensions until April 2011.

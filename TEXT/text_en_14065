ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said late Saturday (12 November) that his much talked about visit to Turkey would likely occur early in 2006, rather than later this year. He blamed relations that have grown more strained recently. It has been 40 years since a Greek prime minister paid an official visit to Turkey. (Kathimerini, ANA - 14/11/05; ERA - 13/11/05)

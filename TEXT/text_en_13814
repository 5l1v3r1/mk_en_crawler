BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus said Saturday (17 December) that Belgrade was expected to make concrete steps in co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal by February 2006. The next round of Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with the EU will probably be held around 20 February to 22 February, Labus noted, adding that implementation of outstanding obligations toward the UN court is a leading condition.

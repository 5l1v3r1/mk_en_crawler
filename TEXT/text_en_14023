SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) is urging the governments and parliaments of the two BiH entities -- Republika Srpska (RS) and the Federation of BiH -- to complete all tasks related to crucial defence reforms by the end of this year. On Wednesday (14 December), OHR spokesperson Sanela Tunovic noted that a new state-level defence law takes effect on 1 January.
Also Wednesday, the RS Parliament endorsed amendments to the entity constitution, envisioning the transfer of entity responsibilities in the defence sector to the state level. 
In other news, RS police detained six people Wednesday suspected of involvement in war crimes. They are accused of alleged crimes committed against non-Serb civilians at the Manjaca detention camp in 1992, where the six were reportedly serving as guards.

 The EU's newest members began recovering from the global downturn in the second half of 2009 and are set to return to growth this year, the World Bank said Thursday (April 1st) in a new report. 
The report cautioned that that the recovery would be moderate at best. Known as the EU10, the former communist counties in the 27-nation bloc are Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. 
 "It will take until the second half of 2011 before real output will regain its pre-crisis level, and until 2013 or 2014 in most countries before actual output will close the gap to potential output," the report said. 
The region was hit hard by the global financial crisis among emerging markets. As a result, the ten economies contracted by 3.6% on average last year said the World Bank, relying on latest government forecasts. Poland was the only country in the group to experience positive real GDP growth in 2009. 
The economies of the EU10 region are projected to expand by an average of 1.6% this year and 3.6% in 2011. If this occurs, the ten would outpace the group of 15 states that made up the Union until 2004, the Bank said. 
But the pace of recovery will vary across the ten countries, reflecting the different initial conditions at the time when they were hit by the crisis as well as shocks experienced as a result of their policies in response to the turmoil. 
"While the recovery in the global economy is under way, the outlook for the EU10 region remains uncertain," said Kaspar Richter, senior economist in the Bank's Europe and Central Asia Region and lead author of the report. "Unemployment is still rising and is expected to decline only in 2011." 
 Unemployment rates in the EU10 rose from 6.5% in June 2008 to 9.5% in January 2010, increasing the number of jobless from 2.9 million to 4.6 million people, the Bank said. The picture was even worse among the 15- to 24-year-olds, given the 8% increase in the unemployment rate for this group during the same period. 
Job prospects for workers with basic education levels and little work experience are expected to remain weak for the next several years, said the World Bank It also noted that in January 2010, male unemployment was higher than female unemployment in all EU10 countries. 
The Romanian government was the only one among the ten that did not expect the country's unemployment rate this year to exceed that in 2009. 
"For a sustained revival, governments need to revisit old issues that have come back to haunt them," the Bank said, noting that government's need to become "slimmer and smarter."

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- US Ambassador to Pristina Christopher Dell on Tuesday (April 13th) reiterated Washington's stance that the status of Kosovo as a sovereign nation is a closed issue and that Serbia should stop insisting on new negotiations regarding it. Dell said that any time is suitable for talks between the neighbouring countries and called for dialogue on practical issues. Commenting on the strategy for Serb-dominated northern Kosovo, Dell said that it is fully supported by both the United States and the UN, but implementation takes time. Dell was visiting the new Kllokot municipality, which was established after the November local elections. (Zeri, Koha Ditore, Epoka Re, Kosova Sot - 14/04/10)

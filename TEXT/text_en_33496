SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- James Locher, chairman of the defence committee in BiH, said all members of the panel supported the draft bill for defence reforms late Thursday (25 September). Locher and High Representative Paddy Ashdown hailed what they described as a breakthrough in the reform process. The committee urged other local authorities to endorse the bill, which would establish a central command for the armies of the two entities. Though remaining separate, the armies would have a shared headquarters, uniforms and flag. Approval by parliament is expected to make BiH a full-fledged member of the Partnership for Peace programme, a first step towards NATO integration and EU accession.
In other news Thursday, the Bosnian Muslim Commission for Missing Persons said forensic experts have so far recovered the remains of 565 people from a mass grave near Zvornik. Work on the site is expected to continue until the end of next week. (SRNA, BBC - 26/09/03; AFP - 25/09/03)

 BELGRADE, Serbia -- Patriarch Irinej, new head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, called for dialogue with the Roman Catholic Church during his first press conference Thursday (January 28th). Patriarch Irinej said that the 1,700th anniversary of the Edict of Milan in 2013 would be a good opportunity for representatives of the two churches to meet. He suggested holding the celebrations in the Serbian town of Nis. The Edict, signed by Nis-born Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, proclaimed religious tolerance for Christians. Irinej emphasised that the Serbian Orthodox Church has always respected all religions and religious communities. He also backed Serbia's EU bid as long as Europe respects the country's identity, culture and faith. (RTS, B92. Beta, Tanjug, AP, AFP, Reuters - 28/01/10)

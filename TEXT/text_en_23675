SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Former Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku was arrested Tuesday night (June 23rd) at a border crossing between Bulgaria and Macedonia. The arrest was based on a warrant Serbia issued in 2002. Ceku was detained as he travelled to Sofia, for what Kosovo media reports describe as an official meeting with Deputy Foreign Minister Milen Keremedchiev. But he says no such invitation was extended. Ceku is no stranger to arrest: it happened in Slovenia in 2003, then in Hungary a year later, and in Colombia earlier this year. Serbia accuses Ceku of involvement in crimes against civilian Serbs during the Kosovo conflict.

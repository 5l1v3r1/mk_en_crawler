ATHENS, Greece -- The foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey told the media on Tuesday (21 October) that they have adopted a step-by-step approach to improving ties between their countries. "Our relations are pervaded by trust... the era of tensions is over," said Turkey's Abdullah Gul. His Greek counterpart, George Papandreou, said the new approach was illustrated by agreements to clear mines along the common border, cancel military exercises in Cyprus, and work together to enhance security during the 2004 Summer Olympics. The two ministers also announced deals to boost tourism and trade and signed an agreement that eliminates double taxation for companies doing business in both countries.

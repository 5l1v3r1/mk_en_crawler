PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- Michael Steiner, the chief UN officer in Kosovo, unveiled a package of political, economic and security measures Tuesday (1 October) for the development of the Serb section of Mitrovica. He described the Serb part of the ethnically divided city as a grey area of lawlessness and unemployment. The plan provides for self-government, improved security with the participation of Serbs in police patrols, and an international donor conference to provide money for local investment. Steiner ruled out any integration of the two sections of the town, saying that UN police and KFOR will continue to guard the bridge that separates the ethnic communities. On Monday, he condemned the kidnapping and gang rape of two teenage girls from Mitrovica. Two ethnic Albanians have been arrested.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The prosecutor's office in Osijek has pressed charges against two former members of the Yugoslav National Army for war crimes committed against Croatian civilians and prisoners of war in Serbia in 1991-1992, media reported on Tuesday (April 12th). The office has issued an international arrest warrant for Aleksandar Vasiljevic and Miroslav Zivanovic, as they are Serbian citizens and are not within reach of the Croatian justice. Prosecutors say the two are responsible for torture and inhumane treatment. (HRT, RTS, Blic - 12/04/11)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The opposition Alliance for the future of Kosovo (AAK) expressed concern Sunday (March 27th) regarding preparations for the census expected to take place from April 1st to 15th. According to the party, the government has violated the Census Law, when it comes to the headcount in Mitrovica North. AAK official Melihate Termkolli says the census in that region will be conducted by an international organisation, the UN Office for Project Services - UNOPS, which represents a violation of international standards. "By violating the law, the Kosovo government, consciously or unconsciously, has admitted that de facto and de jure Kosovo's partition has happened," Termkolli said. She urged the government to postpone the census, to correct what she described as "so many failures". (RTK, KLAN Kosova, Kohavision - 27/03/11)

BLOOMINGTON, Indiana, United States -- Former Congressman Frank McCloskey, an Indiana Democrat and prominent proponent of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, died of cancer on Sunday (2 November). He was 64. McCloskey, who served in Congress from 1983 to 1995, became interested in Balkan affairs at the start of the disintegration of former Yugoslavia. He called for intervention in BiH as early as 1992 and alerted the US public to acts of genocide. McCloskey also demanded war crimes trials for Slobodan Milosevic and other politicians.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's government has decided to replace the current management of the flag carrier JAT with an interim administrator. The move was announced Tuesday (15 February), though the name of the receiver as well as a new restructuring plan for JAT wonât be disclosed until Thursday. JAT employees have threatened to stage a general strike Friday if the cabinet fails to introduce a concrete strategy for the ailing company. 
In other news, Serbian President Boris Tadic returned to Belgrade Tuesday after a two-day visit to Kosovo. Tadic says he will initiate a plan to resolve problems experienced by Kosovo Serbs, especially those related to security and electricity. EU security chief Javier Solana described Tadic's visit as a positive step towards the launch of a dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina. 
Along the same lines, the WTO on Tuesday accepted Serbia's and Montenegro's separate applications for WTO membership. After suspension of the joint, single bid by the federal union about a year ago, the two republics applied separately and will be considered sovereign states with regard to trade policy.

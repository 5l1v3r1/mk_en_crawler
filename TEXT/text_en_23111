BUCHAREST, Romania -- Public servants threatened on Thursday (October 2nd) to stage a full-scale strike next week unless they receive a 50% pay hike to match that granted to personnel in the educational system. "Since teachers received a 50% salary raise, we will not settle for anything below this figure," said Vasile Marica, president of the Federation of Public Servants' Unions. "We have not estimated the financial consequences of a full-scale strike, but I'm afraid Romania could be thrown into chaos," Marica warned. Romanian lawmakers approved the pay hike for those in education Tuesday. (Mediafax, Agerpres, Ziare - 02/10/08)

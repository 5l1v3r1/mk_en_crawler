SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EUFOR returned direct control of the military movements of personnel, weapons and equipment in BiH to the Balkan country on Friday (January 25th). "This makes a hugely significant step in the ongoing defence reform process that began in 1995 after the Dayton peace accord was signed," EUFOR said in a statement. The EU mission assumed control of BiH's military movements from NATO in 2004. 
In other news, a parliamentary commission revoked the passports of 661 BiH citizens between March and December last year, local media reported on Saturday (January 26th). The commission has reviewed 1,255 cases of people who acquired citizenship during the war in former Yugoslavia. Some 18,506 people applied for BiH citizenship during the 1992-1995 conflict. The mandate of the commission expires in the middle of February, but its chairman Vjekoslav Vukovic has proposed to extend it by another year.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The interior ministry will begin issuing bilingual identity cards Thursday (15 May), with information appearing in both Macedonian and Albanian, as stipulated in the Ohrid peace agreement. The move was announced in a statement issued Wednesday. The ministry hopes to apply the changes, by year's end, to all other identity documents, including passports, driver's licences and car registrations.
In other developments, Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro agreed Wednesday to start the procedure of signing a bilateral agreement on the protection of minorities' rights. It would include the establishment of a National Council of Macedonians in Serbia-Montenegro. (Dnevnik, Utrinski Vesnik - 15/05/03; MIA, A1 TV- 14/05/03)

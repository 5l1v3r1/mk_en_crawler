WARSAW, Poland -- The OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights said Wednesday (18 May) that it has launched its Election Observation Mission for the 3 July parliamentary elections in Albania. The mission will include 12 monitors already based in Tirana, 25 long-term monitors -- to be deployed across the country later this week -- and 400 short-term ones, who will arrive in Albania shortly before Election Day. Monitors will be present at the opening of polling stations, as well as during voting, counting of ballots and tabulation of results. (OSCE Web site - 18/05/05)

The Serbian Telecommunications Agency (RATEL) has given the Norwegian company Telenor the second license for "fixed" [or non-cellular] phone service in Serbia. The Norwegians offered a little more than 1m euros. 
The deal obligates Telenor to begin providing service a year after obtaining the license. 
Currently, the state-run Telekom Srbija provides service to about three million home and business customers. RATEL Director Milan Jankovic says competition is in the public interest. 
"For the citizens of Serbia this will be an opportunity to choose their fixed phone operator in the coming period, and to have competition regarding services and the quality of services that those operators will offer," Jankovic said. 
Telenor Serbia was the sole bidder in the tender for the license, which was issued for ten years with the possibility of a ten-year extension. Neighbouring Romania -- with about 20 million people -- has some three dozen fixed telephone providers. 
Telenor will have to lease the telecommunications infrastructure from rival Telekom Srbija. Representatives of the Norwegian company say they will soon send Telekom an offer. If the two companies cannot reach agreement, RATEL will break the stalemate to keep the deal alive. 
Telenor Serbia General Manager Kjell-Morten Jonsen says the success of the deal depends on ensuring "fair access" and use of the existing infrastructure, as well as the right for the private company to build its own. 
Telekom Srbija issued a statement saying that the reputation of Telenor in the cell phone industry "informs us that this is a respectable and strong, but also a fair competitor". 
In 2006, Telenor purchased the Serbian mobile phone operator Mobi063 for 1.5 billion euros. The Norwegian company now has about 2.8 million mobile phone users. It is expected to start providing fixed telephony and internet services by the end of the year.

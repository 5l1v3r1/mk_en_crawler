ZAGREB, Croatia â EU dissatisfaction with Croatia's judicial system could pose a major obstacle in the accession negotiations, media reported Friday (September 5th), citing sources in Brussels. The Croatian negotiating team in Brussels reportedly received a letter from the EU that criticises the way war crimes cases and other judicial issues are handled. In particular, Brussels is unhappy with the trial of Branimir Glavas and six other war crimes indictees. The trial has been adjourned and will have to start from scratch for a second time, due to procedural reasons. 
On Saturday, meanwhile, the head of the European Commission delegation to Podgorica praised Montenegro as a regional leader in the EU integration process. "This means that Montenegro's chances of joining the EU are very good," Leopold Maurer said. (Beta, Vecernje List, B92 - 05/09/08)

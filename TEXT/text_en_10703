THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal's chief prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, remains sceptical about Belgrade's willingness to co-operate, according to Serbia-Montenegro Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic, who visited The Hague on Tuesday (7 September). Ljajic, also head of the state union's council for co-operation with the UN tribunal, described the talks with del Ponte as "very difficult" and "uncomfortable", especially with regard to former Bosnian Serb commanders Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic and four Serb generals sought by The Hague. 
Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, meanwhile, warned Tuesday that Podgorica's representatives might be withdrawn from the council for co-operation. He said Montenegro would not be a victim of Serbia's failure to co-operate. (Tanjug, B92, Beta - 07/09/04)

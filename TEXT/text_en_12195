BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic arrived in Brussels Tuesday (14 December) for talks with EU security chief Javier Solana. Discussions are expected to focus on the state union's bid for EU integration and the "twin-track" approach suggested by Brussels. 
During meetings with President Filip Vujanovic and Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic on Monday, the outgoing head of the OSCE mission to Podgorica, Ambassador Rudolf Bogner, praised ongoing co-operation between the organisation and the Montenegrin government. Bogner urged further reforms that would lead to Euro-Atlantic accession. 
Also Monday, Serbia's Parliament started discussing draft legal changes aimed at enabling the processing of war crimes cases by domestic courts. The amendments would provide for the use of evidence found outside the territory of the republic -- including evidence collected by the UN war crimes tribunal -- in such trials.

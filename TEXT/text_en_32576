ANKARA, Turkey -- The country's military said Wednesday (5 March) that it backed a government motion, rejected by parliament at the weekend, to allow US troops to form a "northern front" in a possible war against Iraq.
"The Turkish armed forces' view is the same as the government's and is reflected in the motion our government sent to parliament," Chief of General Staff Hilmi Ozkok said. "The war will be short if a second front is opened from the north," he told reporters.
On Tuesday, ruling party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan indirectly confirmed that a new motion concerning US troops would be presented to parliament, though he did not indicate when. The local channel NTV says it may occur after Erdogan is elected to parliament and appointed prime minister. (Reuters - 05/03/03; Anadolu Agency, NTV, AFP - 04/03/03)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian Parliament adopted a plan for Kosovo on Thursday (29 April) aimed at protecting the rights of the Serb and other non-Albanian minorities in the province. The plan envisions the establishment of five autonomous Serb regions that would be responsible for their own elections, security, education and health care systems. They would also have their own parliaments and a local court system.

But the operation, conducted near the western town of Valjevo, failed to establish the whereabouts of the former Bosnian Serb Amy leader. (B92, Beta, Tanjug - 29/04/04)

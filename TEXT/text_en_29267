ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament rejected on Monday (May 3rd) a proposal to amend legislation on political parties that would have made it much harder to ban them. The decision was a blow to the government's constitutional reform efforts. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would continue his plan, viewed by critics as an effort on the part of his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) to strengthen control over state institutions and undermine secular principles. The AKP, rooted in political Islam, argues that it has no ambitions to build an Islamist country, rather, believes the constitutional changes are necessary to bring Turkey closer to the EU's democratic standards. Erdogan says he will approve a referendum, should the AKP fail to attract the votes necessary to pass the whole package of amendments.

TIRANA, Albania -- The third and final round of presidential elections takes place in parliament on Wednesday (July 4th). Two previous rounds failed because the main parties could not agree on a consensus candidate to succeed outgoing President Alfred Moisiu. If the third round fails, parliament must be dissolved and early parliamentary elections called. The ruling Democratic Party and main opposition Socialist Party held last-ditch negotiations Tuesday evening, but no statements were released.

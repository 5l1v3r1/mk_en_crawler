PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Slovakia has ended its participation in KFOR, the NATO mission said in a statement Friday (November 19th). According to the announcement, the country's last troops were withdrawn from Kosovo last week. The move comes after Slovakia's parliament decided in October to withdraw all of the country's 140 troops operating in Kosovo. 
Also Friday, the foreign ministry announced that Tuvalu has recognised Kosovo as a state. The Pacific island state became the 72nd state to recognise the independence of the former Serbian province, announced in February 2008. (AFP, DPA, Tanjug, New Kosova Report, B92 - 19/11/10)

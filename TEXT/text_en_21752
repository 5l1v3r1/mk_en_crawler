TIRANA, Albania -- Workers at a munitions depot near the village of Gerdec and residents of Vlora staged a protest Sunday (April 20th), demanding compensation promised to them by the government shortly after a series of blasts at the factory killed 29, injured 300 and destroyed hundreds of houses in the region. Police prevented the crowd from approaching the site where the blasts occurred on March 15th. The demonstrators said that Prime Minister Sali Berisha lied to them about promised compensation and that nobody had received any yet. (Koha Jone, Shqip - 21/04/08; Shekulli, BalkanWeb - 20/04/08)

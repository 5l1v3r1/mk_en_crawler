ANKARA, Turkey -- Security forces have seized about two tonnes of drugs in the first two months of the year, allegedly smuggled through channels linked to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Local media reports Tuesday (March 4th) cited a statement on the Turkish General Staff's website that said security forces not only dealt a serious blow to PKK forces during the recent ground military offensive, but also cut their financial resources by targeting cross-border drug smuggling routes.

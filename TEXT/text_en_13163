ANKARA, Turkey â Turkey's GDP will increase by 5.8 per cent in 2005 and 6.0 per cent in 2006, the OECD forecasted in its latest Economic Outlook, released Tuesday (29 November). The report stressed that the government should persist with a prudent macroeconomic policy, which will accelerate the inflow of direct foreign investments and long-term international loans. Robust growth will gradually reduce the unemployment rate.

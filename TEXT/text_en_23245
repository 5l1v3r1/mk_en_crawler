SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Forensic experts completed on Friday (May 29th) the exhumation of a newly discovered mass grave in eastern BiH, the Missing Persons Institute said. The team exhumed 16 bodies that are believed to be the remains of Muslim civilians killed in the Srebrenica massacre in July 1995. The bodies had their hands tied behind their backs with wire, the institute said. A number of bullet casings were also found in the grave. The mass grave was discovered earlier this week in the village of Mrsici, near the eastern town of Vlasenica. An estimated 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were killed in the Srebrenica massacre.

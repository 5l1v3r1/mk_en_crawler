NEW YORK, United States -- Prime Ministers Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain and Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey appeared before the UN Security Council on Monday (December 18th) to brief its members on establishing an "Alliance of Civilisations", aimed at stopping the growing "wall of hatred and misunderstanding between the West and the Islamic world". The two leaders noted that 40 countries already have joined the alliance. They unveiled a report containing measures to promote long-term understanding among cultures, including youth exchange programmes and a media campaign against discrimination that would also increase awareness about the plight of women in some parts of the world.

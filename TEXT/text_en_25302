BELGRADE, Serbia -- The International Court of Justice (ICJ) will deliver its opinion on the legality of Kosovo's independence near the end of the year, the Belgrade-based daily Politika reported on Sunday (March 28th), quoting diplomatic sources in Brussels. The ruling is expected in November instead of May or June, the daily said, adding that the international community expects that by that time, Serbia will have arrested former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic. According to Politika, his arrest could affect Serbia's position. Hearings at The Hague-based ICJ were held in December. (Politika, B92, FoNet - 28/03/10)

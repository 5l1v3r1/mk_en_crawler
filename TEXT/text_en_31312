ANKARA, Turkey -- The rebel Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) on Monday (February 28th) called off a unilateral ceasefire declared in the mid-August, describing it as "now meaningless, given the policy of the government which aims at ignoring and destroying", according to the Firat news agency. The rebels say they would not be the first to attack, but would defend themselves "more effectively" against operations by the Turkish Army. The PKK also reiterated its calls for an end to military operations against its members, improved prison conditions for its jailed leader Abdullah Ocalan and the release of detained Kurdish politicians.

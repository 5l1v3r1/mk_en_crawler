ANKARA, Turkey -- A powerful explosion believed to have been caused by members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) hit a pipeline transporting natural gas from Iran to Turkey late Tuesday (August 24th), officials said on Wednesday. The blast, in the eastern province of Agri, was a result of "an attack by a separatist terrorist organisation", Governor Ali Yerlikaya said in a statement. No injuries were reported. The flames are out and repair work is under way with no gas shortages expected. The PKK has been blamed for two bombings on pipelines over the past two months. One of them, earlier this month, killed two people. (Anadolu news agency, AFP, Businessweek, Hurriyet - 25/08/10)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu on Tuesday (May 12th) responded to accusations from Social Democratic Party (PSD) leader Mircea Geoana over inefficient reforms in the judiciary and poor results in fighting corruption. In an open letter to the president, Geoana blamed Basescu for appointing corrupt people in the judicial system which, he said, may prompt the EU to cut funds for Romania. In reply, Basescu said Geoana's statements are "regrettable and obviously electoral". He also accused the PSD of delaying the adoption of the country's judicial code and impeding investigations in high-profile corruption cases. (Mediafax, Hotnews, Ziare, NewsIn - 12/05/09)

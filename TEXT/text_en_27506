PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Two independent lawmakers, Naim Rrustemi and Driton Tali, have asked the Central Elections Commission (CEC) to exclude the ruling Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) from participating in the next general elections, local media reported on Wednesday (October 27th). Their request is based on a CEC regulation requiring each political entity to hold internal elections in all of its branches and to re-elect its delegates or name new ones. The PDK held a party convention last week, re-electing leader Hashim Thaci, who ran unopposed, and adopting minor changes to the party statute. 
Rrustemi and Tali said the convention resembled those organised by North Korea leader Kim Jong-il. They did not rule out taking the issue to the Constitutional Court. It was Rrustemi and Tali who complained to the Constitutional Court about Fatmir Sejdiu serving as both president of the country and leader of his party. The court ruled that a violation of the constitution, a decision that eventually led Sejdiu to resign as president. (Telegrafi, Kohavision, Zeri - 27/10/10)

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Police prevented a protest Sunday (November 2nd) organised by the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) in Istanbul and reportedly detained 27 DTP supporters, including the chairman of the party's Istanbul office, Halil Aksoy. When a group of around 60 people tried to rally at Taksim Square, police used tear gas to disperse them. That demonstration followed a recent wave of protests in Turkey's southeastern and eastern regions in support of Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned leader of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Followers allege his jailers have mistreated him.
Meanwhile, tension remains high in the predominantly Kurdish southeastern provinces of Van and Hakkari, where Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited at the weekend. In the Hakkari town of Yuksekova, about 3,000 DTP supporters protested Erdogan's visit and clashed with police Sunday. On Saturday, similar clashes erupted during a pro-Kurdish demonstration in Van.

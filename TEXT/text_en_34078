ZAGREB, Croatia -- Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) minister for human rights and refugees, Mirsad Kebo, held talks with Croatian Minister for Public Works Radimir Cacic in Zagreb on Wednesday (23 July). The two ministers agreed on the need to accelerate the process of refugee returns in the region, and announced the establishment of a joint committee that would also work to reconcile differences concerning the number of refugees in question. BiH believes 24,000 should return to Croatia, while Zagreb estimates there are 2,600 refugees. "The final figure will most probably be higher than 2,600, but probably fewer than 24,000," Cacic said.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari will organise a meeting between Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and his Kosovo counterpart, Agim Ceku, on the status issue, Ahtisaari's spokesperson said Wednesday (21 June). The meeting is expected to take place at the end of July. 
Also Wednesday, Serbs in the western Kosovo region of Klina protested the murder of Dragan Popovic, 68, who was shot dead in his house by an unknown gunman earlier this week.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Police used pepper spray to disperse hundreds of people during an unauthorised workers' protest in Ankara on Thursday (April 1st). The rally, staged by employees of state tobacco and liquor producer Tekel, was aimed at drawing public attention to the fate of about 10,000 workers who were fired when the company was sold to British American Tobacco Investments Ltd. They were offered 11-month renewable contracts by the government to work elsewhere, but say they want permanent jobs instead. (Zaman, Vatan - 02/04/10; AP, Hurriyet - 01/04/10)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci reiterated on Monday (May 19th) that the authority of Kosovo's institutions will extend across the whole territory after June 15th, when the constitution will enter into force. "After June 15th, Kosovo institutions will operate in Kosovo's entire territory with full state authority deriving from Kosovo's Constitution," Thaci said at a cabinet meeting. He added that while the government will be the sole decision-maker, local authorities will seek recommendations from the international civilian and NATO presences.
Also at that meeting, Thaci stressed that no partisanship will be tolerated within Kosovo's soon to be established Intelligence Agency. "The agency has to be a service for the best of the country and its citizens and in no way with partisan or political influences," he said, calling for quick approval of laws creating the agency.

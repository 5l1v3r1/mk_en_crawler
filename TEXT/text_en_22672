All parties and independent candidates have until May23rd to register with the CEC. Party or coalition lists must be submitted by June 25th.
On Wednesday, parliament adopted a controversial election law amendment that allows all former citizens of Srebrenica to vote in October. On Thursday Clifford Bond, the OHR's special envoy to Srebrenica, urged parties to stop speculating about it. Some say the amendment is the first step towards granting special status to Srebrenica, outside the jurisdiction of Republika Srpska. Bosnian Serb forces massacred 8,000 Muslim men and boys there in July 1995. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 09/05/08; RTRS, PBS, Fena - 08/05/08)

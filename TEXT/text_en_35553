ZAGREB, Croatia -- US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld praised the progress Croatia has made in reforming its defence system and said he looks forward to the day the country becomes a member of NATO. During his three-hour visit Sunday (8 February), he also discussed the possibility of a broader Croatian commitment in Afghanistan. Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said his government would consider increasing the number of personnel it has in Kabul, as well as a possible mission to Iraq. He added that there was broad public consensus that the country must be part of the Washington-led anti-terror alliance. Rumsfeld also met with President Stipe Mesic to discuss closer bilateral military co-operation. (Vjesnik - 09/02/04; AP, AFP, HRT, HINA - 08/02/04)

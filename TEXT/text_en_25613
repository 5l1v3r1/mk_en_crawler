SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko's recent decision to extend the mandates of foreign judges and prosecutors working in BiH courts violates the rule of law, Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said in a letter to the Office of the High Representative on Thursday (January 21st). Dodik also reiterated that his government intends to ask the RS parliament to call a referendum on the decision. 
In October, BiH lawmakers voted against extending the mandates of foreign magistrates. But on December 14th, Inzko overruled that by extending the mandate of foreign judges and prosecutors working on war crime cases in BiH until December 31st 2012. Inzko also decided that international judges and prosecutors dealing with organised crime and corruption will remain in BiH as advisers
Also Thursday, the House of Peoples passed a law on amendments to the criminal code, its last precondition for eventual visa-free travel to EU countries. Speakers of the two chambers of parliament urged other institutions to meet obligations for visa liberalisation. (Dnevni Avaz, Fena, RTRS, Srna - 21/01/10)

PRAGUE, Czech Republic -- The Czech presidency of the EU announced on Thursday (April 23rd) it decided to postpone indefinitely an intergovernmental accession conference with Croatia that it had scheduled for Friday. "A new date [for the conference] is to be set subject to positive development," the EU presidency said in a statement. The postponement resulted from Croatia and Slovenia's failure to reach an agreement on resolving their long-standing border conflict, which prevents resumption of Croatia's accession talks. The two sides failed to settle their differences despite recent intervention by the European Commission (EC), which decided to act as a mediator in the conflict. On Wednesday, Croatia and Slovenia held another round of talks with EU officials in Brussels, at which EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn reportedly offered a fresh proposal involving an ad hoc arbitration commission.
Meanwhile, media reports in Slovenia suggest that Ljubljana has decided to postpone a planned meeting between Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and Slovenian counterpart Borut Pahor. The two were to meet next week to discuss Croatia's accession talks. The meeting will now take place in the first week of May, though neither side offered an explanation.

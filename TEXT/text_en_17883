ANKARA, Turkey -- Two of Turkey's main opposition parties announced on Thursday (May 17th) that they are forming a coalition to challenge the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in the July 22nd general elections. Deniz Baykal, leader of the Republican People's Party (CHP), said candidates from his party and those of Zeki Sezer's Democratic Left Party (DSP) plan to run on one ticket to ensure better results. Popular in the 1990s under Bulent Ecevit, DSP's base eroded during the 2001 financial crisis. Joining with CHP should help DSP attain the threshold of support now required to win seats in Parliament.
In other news, Istanbul's local authorities caused an uproar among secularists when they asked store owners to request permission to display billboards showing women in bathing suits. The popular Cumhuriyet daily accused the AKP of turning the country into an Islamic state. 
Also Thursday, the Turkish military complained that two Greek F-16 fighter planes had violated the country's airspace, the third such incident in a week. The latest one occurred north of Limnos Island. (Zaman, Sabah, Cumhuriyet, Hurriyet, Radikal, Turkish Daily News - 18/05/07; NTV, Reuters - 17/05/07; Reuters - 16/05/07)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Kurdish human rights activist Leyla Zana said Thursday (14 October) she does not believe there is systematic torture going on in Turkey. She spoke to the European Parliament in Brussels, where she was given the Sakharov Prize for human rights, nine years after she had been awarded it. Zana acknowledged that fundamental changes have occurred in Turkey. At the same time, she urged further efforts for the peaceful and democratic settlement of the Kurdish issue. In 1991, Zana became the first Kurdish woman to be elected to the Turkish Parliament. She was later sentenced to prison, along with three fellow parliament members, for links to the Kurdistan Workers' Party. They were released in June. (EU Observer, NTV - 14/10/04)

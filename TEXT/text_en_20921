ANKARA, Turkey -- Twenty-three officers of the Turkish armed forces have been dismissed due to pro-Islamic "reactionary" activities or lack of discipline, the military announced Saturday (August 4th). The dismissals were approved at a four-day meeting of Turkey's Higher Military Council, which ended on Saturday and was chaired by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The Council also appointed Admiral Metin Atac as head of the Turkish Navy and General Aydogan Babaoglu as commander of the country's air forces. 
Also on Saturday, the new Turkish parliament was sworn in. The opening session was chaired by its oldest member, 83-year-old Sukru Elekdag of the opposition Republican People's Party. He will preside until a new speaker is elected. The ruling Justice and Development Party, which won a decisive victory in the July 22nd early elections, has 341 of the 550 parliamentary seats.

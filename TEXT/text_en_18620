SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A court on Tuesday (January 9th) ordered a 30-day detention in absentia for Stanislava Cocorovska-Poletan, the suspected mastermind behind the transport of 486 kilos of cocaine seized at Blace border crossing two days ago. Police say Poletan has dual citizenship -- Macedonian and Serbian -- and lives in Serbia. The driver of the truck loaded with cocaine was arrested and is described as a close associate of Poletan for more than 20 years. Police say Poletan's companies were involved in cigarette and alcohol smuggling during the Milosevic regime. (Makfax, MIA, RTS, Telma TV, A1 TV - 09/01/07)

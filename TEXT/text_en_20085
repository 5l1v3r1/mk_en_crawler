THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The Hague war crimes tribunal has evidence that former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj is guilty of war crimes, chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte told the German magazine Der Spiegel on Saturday (October 20th). Del Ponte, however, added that the court was constantly losing witnesses in the case against Haradinaj due to threats. He has been indicted for alleged war crimes committed when he was a commander in the Kosovo Liberation Army during the 1998-1999 conflict in the contested Serbian province.

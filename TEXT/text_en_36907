SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague will probably not handle the so-called Rashtanski Lozja case, Macedonian Justice Minister Ixhet Memeti said on Sunday (4 July) in an interview with Radio Free Europe. He added that a domestic court would probably tackle the case, which involves the 2002 murders of six Pakistanis and one Indian by Macedonian security personnel, who claimed the foreigners were Islamic terrorists.
In other news, parliament on Friday passed a law on the rights, pensions and benefits given former presidents and their families. The measure was necessitated by the death of Boris Trajkovski in a February plane crash. (Utrinski Vesnik - 05/07/04; A1 TV -04/07/04; MIA - 02/07/04)

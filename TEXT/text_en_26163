ZAGREB, Croatia -- Slovenian Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar said on Monday (September 14th) that Ljubljana will lift its blockade on 11 of 14 negotiating chapters during Croatia's EU accession conference, later this month or in early October. On Friday, Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor and Slovenian counterpart Borut Pahor reached an agreement aimed at resolving the countries' longstanding border dispute, the sticking point in the EU accession process. Croatia agreed on Friday to withdraw all documents submitted to the European Commission that may pre-judge the border conflict. (HINA, Dnevnik, HRT, Vecernji List, STA - 14/09/09)

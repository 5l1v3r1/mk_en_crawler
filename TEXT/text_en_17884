SAMARA, Russia -- Kosovo is the focus of discussion Friday (May 18th) at the EU-Russia summit under way in Samara, amid reports that Russia has decided to veto Martti Ahtisaari's plan for the province's final status. Late Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency. Russian Parliament member Mikhail Margelov said the European leaders won't change Moscow's position on Kosovo. "Russia's stance is that no decision on Kosovo would be legitimate without consent of both sides," he said.
Separately Thursday, US Army General Bantz J. Craddock, the Supreme Allied Commander Europe for NATO, told a US Senate panel that further delays in the status process would do nothing but create the conditions for new violence in Kosovo. "I believe that the longer the resolution is delayed, the longer it takes to come to closure in the Security Council, the greater the opportunity for mischief and the more likely there will be violence in Kosovo," he said.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu on Friday (January 28th) expressed his country's full support for Croatia's EU accession. "There should not be any kind of interpretation concerning our position on Croatia's accession to the EU," Basescu told Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor, who was making a one-day official visit to Bucharest. 
Earlier this month, Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Baconschi had suggested Bucharest could insist on the introduction of a Co-operation and Verification Mechanism (CVM) for Croatia. (AP, Xinhua, Hotnews.ro, Ziare - 28/01/11)

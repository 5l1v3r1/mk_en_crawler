BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia expects the status of Kosovo to be on the agenda of upcoming talks between Belgrade and Pristina, Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic said on Sunday (September 19th). He added that since the recently passed resolution on Kosovo at the UN General Assembly did not recognise its independence, any future talks should allow for the inclusion of all issues, including Kosovo's status. Interior Minister Ivica Dacic echoed that, calling for talks on status and any other unresolved issues. Dacic said negotiations should begin as soon as possible, potentially at the end of October.

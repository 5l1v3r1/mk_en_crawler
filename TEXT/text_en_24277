ZAGREB, Croatia -- Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov said Skopje will reply to UN mediator Matthew Nimetz's latest proposals on the name dispute with Greece by the end of August. After a meeting in Croatia with his counterpart Stipe Mesic on Monday (July 13th), Ivanov welcomed Athens' willingness to resolve the row according to international law. Ivanov also praised Sweden's position that bilateral issues should not obstruct further EU enlargement. Sweden assumed the rotating EU presidency earlier this month. Mesic, in turn, reaffirmed his country's support for Macedonia's EU and NATO bids.
Also Monday, EU Ambassador to Macedonia Erwan Fouere held talks for the first time with newly appointed Deputy Prime Minister for European Integration Vasko Naumovski. Fouere stressed that Macedonia should focus on implementing reforms needed for EU membership, especially reforms in the police and judiciary. (A1, Makfax, MIA, Sitel - 13/07/09)

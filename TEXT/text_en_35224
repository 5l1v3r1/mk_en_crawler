BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Bosnian Serb government reported Friday (20 February) that its voluntary weapons collection programme has been largely successful to date. The police have taken in 2,225 rifles, 347 rocket launchers, 5,320 hand grenades, 1,299 anti-personnel mines, several hundred explosive devices, 500 kg of explosives, and 564,515 rounds of small arms ammunition, a spokesman said.

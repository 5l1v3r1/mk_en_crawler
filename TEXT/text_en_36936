BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Washington is pleased with the positions Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and President-elect Boris Tadic are taking on the country's future development. In an interview Wednesday (30 June) with Tanjug, US Ambassador Michael Polt said, "The intentions they have expressed to me in terms of which direction they intend to take, in large part coincide with the expectations we have from the relationship we have." He noted, however, that a few issues should be resolved to enhance relations. Arresting war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic tops the list.
Meanwhile, at a press conference in Washington, State Department South and East Europe Director Charles English called for strong co-operation between the Serbian government and Tadic. He also spoke about the need to combine government and presidential efforts to meet international obligations, especially bringing accused war criminals to justice. (Tanjug - 30/06/04)

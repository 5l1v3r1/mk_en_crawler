BELGRADE, Serbia -- Negotiations on the Kosovo status will continue after the December 10th deadline set by the UN, Serbia's Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic said in an interview with Tanjug on Saturday (November 10th). Meanwhile, the Kosovo Albanian team in the negotiations has warned the breakaway province would declare independence unilaterally after the December 10th deadline, which Samardzic said would result in a "period of serious insecurity". He added that the EU is not indifferent to the situation Serbia would find itself in if this occurred. 
Meanwhile, Ireland's Foreign Minister Dermot Ahern said in Pristina on Saturday that the EU will decide on the Kosovo status issue after December 10th. Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu said the province will take adequate measures in co-ordination with the international community after the deadline. (Tanjug, BTA - 10/11/07; Itar Tass - 09/11/07)

VIENNA, Austria -- A court in Vienna set a 1m-euro bail Thursday (March 15th) for former Croatian Deputy Defence Minister Vladimir Zagorec. He was arrested on Tuesday evening on an international warrant issued by Croatia. He allegedly stole diamonds that he, as a senior defence ministry official, had received as collateral from a German arms dealer in 1993. Extradition to Croatia could take several weeks.

Each had reportedly paid up to 3,443 euros to human traffickers in the western Croatian town of Lanisce. (Vecernji List, Vjesnik - 16/03/07; HINA, HRT, Index.hr, UPI, B92, AP - 15/03/07)

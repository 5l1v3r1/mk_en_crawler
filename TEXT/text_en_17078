BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- US Ambassador to Belgrade Michael Polt said Thursday (1 June) that the Serbian government is capable of locating, arresting and extraditing fugitive Ratko Mladic to the UN war crimes tribunal, but is not doing all it can. Polt was speaking to reporters in Belgrade a day after Washington decided to freeze $7m in financial assistance to Serbia's cabinet for failing to resolve the Mladic case. Polt stressed that other funding for initiatives aimed at strengthening democracy was not affected. (Blic - 02/06/06)

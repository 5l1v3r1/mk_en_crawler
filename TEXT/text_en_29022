ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police detained a prominent communications expert Wednesday (April 7th) over the internet leak of a register of war veterans. Marko Rakar was taken to a police station for interrogation and his apartment was searched. Rakar was freed before midnight. The police launched a probe after sections of a confidential list containing names of people who served during the 1991-1995 war appeared on a website Tuesday.
Rakar, a well-known blogger, had been tapped as an advisor to President Ivo Josipovic but his appointment fell through because of tax problems. (HRT, Nova TV, Jutarnji List, Vecernji List, Index - 07/04/10)

PARIS, France -- The EU cannot continue to expand forever, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin said on Wednesday (18 January). He expressed hope that Bulgaria and Romania would join the EU in 2007, but warned that they must meet a number of conditions first. The European Commission is due to send a team to inspect the two countries' progress in reforming their judiciaries and combating corruption and crime. De Villepin said the launch of negotiations with Turkey reflected the geopolitical changes in the region and Turkey's efforts. The outcome of the talks, he added, must remain open and progress must be reviewed carefully at every stage. (Reuters - 18/01/06)

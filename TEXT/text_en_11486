TAMPA, United States -- The US Central Command announced Sunday (20 February) that Romania will host a conference dedicated to security in Iraq. Representatives of the United States, Iraq and most coalition members will meet in Bucharest on Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss participation in efforts to rebuild Iraq following last month's elections.
In other news, Romania's National Bank announced Sunday that it will allow local firms to purchase dollars and euros without restrictions. Until now, firms could purchase foreign currency only with permission from the central bank. The move is aimed at helping companies hedge against currency fluctuations that are hurting profits.

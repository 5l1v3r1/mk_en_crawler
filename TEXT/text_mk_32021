SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The official results of the BiH general election released Saturday (19 October) confirmed strong gains by the nationalists but left the moderates hoping to retain control over the Muslim-Croat entity and perhaps form a government in Republika Srpska. The tripartite presidency, however, has gone to the nationalists despite the international community's hopes for a pro-reform government. Serbs will be represented by Mirko Sarovic. Dragan Covic will represent Croats and Sulejman Tihic will represent Muslims. Turnout in the elections was just 55 per cent, the lowest since the country gained independence.

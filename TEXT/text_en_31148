HELSINKI, Finland -- Finnish authorities announced on Monday (January 3rd) they have launched a preliminary investigation into suspected bribery in the sale of armoured vehicles to Croatia by local company Patria. Local police suspect "money was handed to civil servants and decision makers" in 2007 when the company secured the 112m-euro deal. Suspicions arose during a corruption investigation into Patria's dealings in Slovenia, where former Prime Minister Janez Jansa and four other people are charged with seeking 2m euros to help Patria win a 2006 tender.

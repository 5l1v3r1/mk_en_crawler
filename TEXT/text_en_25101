THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The appeal against the acquittal of Alliance for the Future of Kosovo leader Ramush Haradinaj started at the UN war crimes tribunal on Wednesday (October 28th). Haradinaj, former commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), was acquitted in April 2008 of all charges stemming from crimes he allegedly committed in Kosovo between March and September 1998. He and two co-defendants, who were also former KLA members, were charged with kidnapping, torture, rape and murder of Serbs, Roma and fellow Albanians. One co-defendant was also cleared of charges; the other was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison. Prosecutors appealed the verdict in July, insisting that new witnesses should be heard.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel voiced her support for dialogue among politicians and all religions, during a meeting Friday (October 6th) with Muslim, Christian Orthodox and Jewish leaders in Istanbul. The talks came at the end of her two-day official visit to Turkey. The same day, she and her Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, participated in a German-Turkish business forum. Addressing the forum, Merkel again said that the EU would keep its promises and that no new conditions would be brought to Turkey's EU bid. However, she added, Turkey must fulfil its obligations under the 2005 extended customs union with the EU, including Cyprus. 
On Saturday, following her return to Berlin, Merkel said that while accession talks are under way with Turkey and Croatia, the bloc can't accept any other member states beyond Bulgaria and Romania "in the foreseeable future". Germany is due to take over the EU's rotating presidency on January 1st. (AFP - 08/10/05; Zaman, Cihan, ANA-MPA, UPI, Xinhua - 07/10/06)

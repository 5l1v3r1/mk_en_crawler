ANKARA, Turkey -- The government announced Friday (23 January) that Turkey, the United States and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees had agreed on the return of 13,000 Turkish Kurd refugees from Iraq. The agreement, valid for one year, must still be ratified by the respective officials. It envisions the voluntary repatriation of refugees in "conditions of safety and dignity". Thousands of Kurds fled to Iraq since 1990 to escape the conflict between the Turkish Army and Kurdish rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party, who launched an autonomy bid in 1984.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele urged the government to boost efforts to fulfil EC conditions for candidate status this year. A positive report by The Hague war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz and concrete progress in bilateral talks with Pristina are key conditions to be met, Fuele told B92 in an interview on Friday (May 13th). He welcomed the March government reshuffle, saying the new cabinet has accelerated reforms. 
Fuele will visit Serbia next week. Brammertz, who was in Serbia last week, said he was unhappy with Belgrade's war crimes co-operation. He still believes fugitive Ratko Mladic has been hiding in Serbia and says the cabinet must do more to locate him and Goran Hadzic. (B92 - 13/05/11)

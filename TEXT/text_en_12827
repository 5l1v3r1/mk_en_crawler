ANKARA, Turkey -- Arriving on a two-day official visit, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Tuesday (3 May) that the decision to start EU accession talks with Turkey should not be altered, as it was reached on the basis of mutual commitments by both sides. During talks with top government officials, Schroeder emphasised that he believes in the continuation of reforms in Turkey, as well as the sealing of the enlarged customs union protocol, which includes Cyprus, by 3 October. That is when Ankara is scheduled to launch negotiations with the EU. Schroeder visits Istanbul on Wednesday.

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Montenegro's pro-independence alliance on Thursday (18 May) held its last and biggest rally before Sunday's referendum on whether to end the state union with Serbia. Tens of thousands of people gathered in downtown Podgorica to hear Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic predict a victory for his group of up to 60 per cent. Opponents of independence are equally confident of success. Predrag Bulatovic, the leader of the unionists, said his alliance would get at least 200,000 votes, more than enough to preserve the union.
A 15-member delegation of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe was due to arrive in Podgorica on Friday to observe the referendum. The delegation will meet representatives of the independence bloc, the pro-union bloc, the government and the media, as well as officials in charge of organising the referendum.

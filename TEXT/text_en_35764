ZAGREB, Croatia -- Six former Bosnian Croat officials are to surrender to the UN war crimes tribunal on Monday (5 April), a local newspaper reported Saturday. The six indictees are Jadranko Prlic and Bruno Stojic, the former prime minister and defence minister of the self-proclaimed state of Herceg-Bosna; retired generals Slobodan Praljak and Milivoj Petkovic; Valentin Coric, a former Bosnian Croat military police commander; and Berislav Pusic, a former member of the Commission on Prisoners of War. They have been charged with participation in a criminal enterprise to drive Muslims and other non-Croats from parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1992 and 1995. Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader reiterated that the state objects to some of the text in the indictments, saying the government is ready to defend the country's position in the "homeland" war.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader announced on Friday (October 10th) that a package of anti-mafia legislation will be adopted soon that will boost co-operation among authorities responsible for security. The decision came on the heels of the mafia-style murder of 26-year-old Ivana Hodak, the daughter of a prominent lawyer, in broad daylight in Zagreb on October 6th. After a meeting of the National Security Council, Sanader said the package envisions collecting DNA samples from all convicts in the country, a common practice in some European countries. The package would also create a national office of police. (Makfax - 11/10/08; Javno.com, HRT - 10/10/08)

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Ombudsman Sefko Crnovrsanin presented his annual report on human rights Monday (June 4th), which concluded that the record remained unsatisfactory last year. He found that despite gains since 2005, violations were registered at all levels, in nearly all areas of society. Crnovrsanin found persistent weaknesses in the work of the state administration in 2006, poorly applied regulations, as well instances of civil servants mistreating members of the public. According to the report, 495 complaints were submitted to the Ombudsman's office in 2006.
In other news Monday, Montenegro's Court of Appeals overturned an acquittal issued by the High Court in 2003 for 15 people charged with involvement in drug trafficking, prostitution and illegal gold trading. The appellate judges called for a new trial. (Vijesti - 05/06/07; RTCG - 04/06/07)

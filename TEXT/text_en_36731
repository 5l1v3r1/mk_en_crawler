SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament on Friday (23 July) unanimously approved the rotation of the country's peacekeeping unit in Afghanistan. Macedonia presently has 11 soldiers in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), but will increase its participation by eight. The unit will be included in the German contingent of ISAF forces. Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski stressed that continued participation in the ISAF demonstrates Macedonia's determination to assist in the international effort against terrorism and is an important part of its NATO aspirations.

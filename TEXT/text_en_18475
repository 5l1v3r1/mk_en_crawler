BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Senate on Tuesday (February 13th) evening passed a no-confidence motion against Justice Minister Monica Macovei following hours of heated debate. Opposition parties introduced the measure, charging that Macovei has failed to reform the judiciary. She insists the opposition is actually trying to block such reforms and has refused to step down unless Prime Minister Calin Popescu-Tariceanu requests her resignation. His National Liberal Party said it would ask the Constitutional Court for guidance. Macovei's reform efforts have received broad support from both the EU and the United States.

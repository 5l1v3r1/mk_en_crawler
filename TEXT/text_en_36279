ZAGREB, Croatia -- Amnesty International urged Croatian authorities on Friday (28 May) to implement recommendations by the UN Committee Against Torture, released earlier this month. According to the group, authorities failed to investigate properly cases of abuse that occurred during the conflicts of the 1990s, as well as subsequent attacks against refugee returnees. Amnesty International also called for full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. (HINA, Amnesty International Web site - 28/05/04)

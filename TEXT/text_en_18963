VIENNA, Austria -- The views of the Belgrade and Pristina negotiation teams on the future status of Kosovo remain "diametrically opposed" despite two rounds of talks that concluded on Friday (March 2nd). UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's office says the Serbian side continues to reject the possibility of independence for Kosovo, while the Kosovo side would accept nothing less. According to a press release from Ahtisaari's office, the two sides differ too over other key issues such as constitutional provisions, decentralisation, and cultural and religious heritage. After he reviews their suggestions, he will hold the second and final round of talks in Vienna on March 10th. Senior representatives of the six-nation Contact Group for Kosovo, NATO and UNMIK will attend. (Politika, Blic - 03/03/07; UN website, AP - 02/03/07)

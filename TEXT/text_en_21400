BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission's (EC) first progress report on Serbia --expected on November 5th -- will say the country could become an official EU candidate next year, according to media reports Thursday (October 30th). The report will reiterate that full co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal remains the main condition for candidate status, according to a draft quoted by media. The tone will be generally positive, especially regarding progress towards building a free-market economy. Criticism will touch on the need to reform the judicial system and insufficient progress in fighting corruption and organised crime.
Meanwhile, the EC's progress report on Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) will criticise the country for political instability and a lack of reform. The tone is expected to be extremely negative. The EC will warn against provocative rhetoric and any attempts to undermine the Dayton Peace Accords.
Separately, the EC is expected to reject the start of accession talks with Macedonia, due to its failure to meet necessary conditions. "Macedonia made some progress in the course of the last year, but it does not yet meet the political criteria," a draft of the EC's progress report on the country said. The EC will also criticise Skopje for scattered violence that marred June's parliamentary elections. (Reuters, AFP, Dnevnik, EUObserver, EUBusiness, Beta - 30/10/08)

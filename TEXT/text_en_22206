NICOSIA, Cyprus -- A solution in Cyprus is possible only if the Turkish Cypriot side demonstrates goodwill and takes reasonable positions, President Demetris Christofias said on Sunday (September 14th). He also stressed an agreement depends on Turkey co-operating "towards a just, viable and functional solution in the best interest of all Cypriots". On Thursday, Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat resume substantive negotiations aimed at reunifying the divided island. The talks began last Thursday.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Oliver Knezovic, who is suspected of killing a Sarajevo football club fan earlier this month in the Bosnian town of Siroki Brijeg, has turned himself in to authorities in Zagreb, police confirmed on Tuesday (October 20th). Knezovic showed up at a police station accompanied by his lawyer. First arrested by Bosnian police shortly after the killing of Vedran Puljic, Knezovic managed to escape from detention and reportedly fled to Croatia. Puljic was shot dead in clashes that broke out as soon as fans of the Sarajevo team arrived in Siroki Brijeg to watch the game against the local soccer squad.

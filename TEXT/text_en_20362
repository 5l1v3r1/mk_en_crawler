ANKARA, Turkey -- There are conflicting reports on whether the army hit terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) bases inside northern Iraq on Tuesday (November 13th). The Cihan news agency quotes Iraqi Kurdish officials as saying some deserted villages had been hit near Zakho, a Kurdish-dominated town near the Turkish border. No casualties were reported. But the Iraqi Kurd government officially denies such reports, saying two Turkish planes had merely thrown flares while flying over a village. 
In other news, four Turkish troops were killed and nine were injured in a shootout with the PKK in the Sirnak province in southeast Turkey.
Also Tuesday, a military court in eastern Turkey banned the media from reporting on the trial of eight Turkish soldiers who spent two weeks in PKK captivity before their release last week. The eight were arrested shortly after they returned to Turkey and charged with dereliction of duty. (Cihan, Reuters, CNN Turk, AP, DHA, NTV, DPA, Hurriyet, Zaman, AFP, Reuters, BBC, UPI - 13/11/07)

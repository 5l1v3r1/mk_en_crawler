ATHENS, Greece -- The country's Supreme Court imposed an exit ban Thursday (May 27th) on former Transport Minister Anastasios Mantelis, who has admitted to receiving bribes from a foreign company. In the course of a corruption investigation, Mantelis told a parliamentary panel that he had received the equivalent of 100,000 euros in 1998 from the Greek branch of the German electronics and engineering giant Siemens, in the form of a "campaign donation". Mantelis was also charged with money laundering. Prime Minister George Papandreou has pledged rigorous measures against corruption in Greece. (ERT, ANA, Ekathimerini - 27/05/10)

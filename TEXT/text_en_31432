NEW YORK, United States -- After almost a year, Macedonia and Greece resumed talks on their name dispute Thursday (24 April) in New York. At issue is Macedonia's constitutional name, which Greece does not recognise for historical reasons. Because of this, the name is not recognised internationally either.
In Skopje meanwhile, the seven lawmakers representing the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) officially withdrew from parliament on Thursday, in line with a decision to boycott announced last weekend. DPA official Zamir Dika said the duration of the walkout would depend on how quickly the provisions of the Ohrid peace accord are implemented. (Utrinski Vesnik, Vest - 25/04/03; A1 TV - 24/04/03)

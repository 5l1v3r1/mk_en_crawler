SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Former Macedonian Public Security Chief General Goran Mitevski was interviewed at the Skopje office of the UN war crimes tribunal Monday (9 August). According to reports, two Hague prosecutors questioned him regarding a special operation in the village of Ljuboten in August 2001. Ten civilians died during the operation. Mitevski's lawyer, Saso Dukovski, said the tribunal's probe into the case was entering a final phase. He insisted that his client had no responsibility for the events that took place, and said Mitevski had co-operated fully with the tribunal. The prosecutors are expected to interview 17 additional individuals during the coming days. The main suspect in the Ljuboten case, former Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski, is thought to have fled Macedonia. (Utrinski Vesnik, Dnevnik - 10/08/04; A1 TV - 09/08/04)

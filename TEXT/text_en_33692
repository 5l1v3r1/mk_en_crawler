SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Chairman of the BiH presidency Dragan Covic predicted Thursday (4 September) that unity in the city of Mostar would be restored in the short term. Covic discussed the ongoing reforms with Werner Wendt, the deputy high representative in BiH, saying regulations on the statute of the city would be in place by year's end. He noted that the recently reconstructed Old Bridge would help reunify the ethnically divided municipality. (SRNA, Onasa - 04/09/03)

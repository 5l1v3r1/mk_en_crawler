BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliament adopted on Monday (October 26th) the Defence Strategy and the National Security Strategy, which were submitted for debate earlier this month. According to the documents, Serbia's strategic priorities are speeding up the EU integration process, continuation of economic reforms and maintaining good relations with Russia, the United States and countries in the region. Serbia believes that active co-operation among all Western Balkan countries and members of NATO and the Partnership for Peace programme is the way to lasting regional stability and progress, according to the National Security Strategy. The document stresses that Kosovo's unilaterally-declared independence represents the main threat to Serbia's security. (Beta, RTS, Tanjug, B92 - 26/10/09)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told Serbia it has come to a fork in the road, following Kosovo's declaration of independence last month. "Serbia has a very crucial choice to make -- it can either stick to the European future or risk a self-imposed isolation," Rehn told reporters after the EU foreign ministers summit Monday (March 10th) in Brussels. Stressing the benefits of EU accession, Rehn and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana expressed hope that pro-European forces would win Serbia's snap parliamentary elections in May.
In other news, the UN Security Council will convene on Tuesday to discuss Kosovo, at the request of Serbia and Russia. Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic is expected to insist UNMIK remain in Kosovo under UN Resolution 1244, during his speech to the Council.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party (DS) suggested in a newspaper article Monday (March 31st) that the riots in Belgrade and northern Mitrovica following Kosovo's declaration of independence in February were the work of Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Serbian Democratic Party (DSS). Dragan Sutanovac, Serbia's defence minister and senior DS whip, told the Blic newspaper that the unrest "did not happen by chance". Insisting that violent demonstrations were part of a co-ordinated campaign, he went on to accuse Kostunica and Serbia's Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic.
In a statement later in the day, Kostunica's DSS rejected the accusations as "ruthless and false" and accused the DS of dirty campaign tactics ahead of the May 11th elections. (B92, Beta, Tanjug, Blic - 31/03/08)

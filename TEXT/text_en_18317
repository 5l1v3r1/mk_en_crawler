BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serb parties stressed their determination to preserve the entity police force, during a meeting Thursday (February 15th) with Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, President Milan Jelic and party representatives. Jelic called the talks ahead of Friday's consultations among the main BiH political groups, aimed at unblocking crucial BiH police reforms. The reforms are key to sealing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. Following Thursday's meeting, Dodik said RS backs the concept of police sector restructuring, but would insist on retaining its own entity police as part of broader state structures.

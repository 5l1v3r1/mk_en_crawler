PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Clashes erupted in the northern town of Mitrovica on Tuesday (December 30th) after a street fight left a Serb teenager injured. Police arrested two ethnic Albanian suspects for stabbing the teen, who authorities hospitalised. Hundreds of Kosovo Serbs set several Albanian shops on fire and destroyed cars with Kosovo licence plates in retaliation for the stabbing. Gunfire wounded an ethnic Albanian man during the incidents, but police could not say if rioters were targeting him. NATO peacekeepers stepped up their presence in the area following the incidents. KFOR armoured vehicles blocked traffic across the two bridges over the Ibar River, which divides the Serb and Albanian parts of Mitrovica. 
Separately Thursday, the commander of the German contingent in KFOR, General Harald Fugger, suggested KFOR could reduce its presence in Kosovo, as the situation is generally calm. The final decision rests with NATO political leaders, he stressed.

TIRANA, Albania -- The US Embassy in Tirana denounced on Thursday (March 13th) a physical attack on journalist Besar Likmeta by parliament member Tom Doshi. US Ambassador to Albania John Withers called on authorities to investigate the incident, witnessed by another lawmaker. Doshi, a deputy from Albania's ruling centre-right coalition, hit Likmeta in the face with a thick leather file folder in the bar of a Tirana hotel Monday after Likmeta, a reporter with Balkan Insight, asked him about his apparently bogus law degree from Tetovo University in Macedonia. Likmeta, who ended up with a black eye, has since filed a lawsuit against Doshi. (VOA - 14/03/08; BalkanWeb, TopChannel, Balkan Insight -13/03/08)

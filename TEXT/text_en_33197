CHICAGO, United States -- Federal prosecutors released papers on Friday (13 June) that charge the head of an Islamic charity with misleading donors and sending fighters to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Chechnya. They also say Enaam Arnaout, the head of the Benevolence International Foundation, "allowed violent persons both inside and outside of the al-Qaida network to flow to areas of conflict and survive there under the cover of an American charity". Arnaout has admitted knowing Osama bin Laden, but has denied supporting his terrorist methods. Prosecutors, contending that he has not made good on a plea bargain agreement to provide information on the world's most wanted terrorist, are seeking a 20-year sentence in his current racketeering trial.

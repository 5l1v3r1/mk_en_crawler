DIYARBAKIR, Turkey -- The terrorist organisation Kurdistan Workers Party claimed responsibility for the suicide bomb attack that killed three and injured 19 people in Van, southeast Turkey, last week, according to a statement sent to the media Sunday (12 March). It claimed the bombing was in response to the "unfair" process being waged against its jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan. 
Also Sunday, local media reported that Turkish security forces detained four people in connection with an ambush on police in Batman earlier last week. Four police officers died in the attack. (Reuters - 13/03/06; TurkishPress.com, AP - 12/03/06)

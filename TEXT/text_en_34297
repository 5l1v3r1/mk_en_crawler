ZAGREB, Croatia -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told reporters on Thursday (30 October) that his country supports Croatia's bid to join the EU in 2007. He noted that Zagreb has already caught up with Sofia and Bucharest, who also want to become members of the Union that year. He also praised the reformist policies of Prime Minister Ivica Racan, who like Schroeder, heads a party of Social Democrats. Croatia holds parliamentary elections on 23 November. Unlike other Western leaders, Schroeder defended Croatia's record of co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal and argued that Croatia's application for EU entry should not be linked to the arrest of fugitive General Ante Gotovina. That co-operation is the subject of a speech UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte makes to the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna on Friday. (AFP, HINA, BBC, OSCE Web site - 30/10/03)

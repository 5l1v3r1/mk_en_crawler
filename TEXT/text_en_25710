TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama said on Wednesday (October 21st) that his party is sticking to its demands to establish a parliamentary commission that will shed light into the June 28th elections, which he insists were "manipulated". He reiterated that his party will continue to boycott parliament until that investigation is conducted. 
Prime Minister Sali Berisha, who heads the ruling Democratic Party, described the SP's request and parliamentary boycott as a "bluff" by Rama. At the same time, Berisha says he will help establish a parliamentary panel to investigate the broader electoral process and give the SP the majority of seats on it.

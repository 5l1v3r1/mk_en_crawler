BELGRADE, Serbia -- Agriculture Minister Slobodan Milosavljevic met with Croatian Petar Cobankovic on Tuesday (August 28th) and agreed that Serbia will return a herd of 74 famed Lipizzaner horses. Ownership has been disputed since the horses were brought to northern Serbia from Croatia in 1991 during the Balkans conflict. It sparked more attention a month ago, amid claims the horses had been neglected. (Vjesnik - 29/08/07; HRT, HINA, Tanjug, Beta, AP, Reuters - 28/08/07)

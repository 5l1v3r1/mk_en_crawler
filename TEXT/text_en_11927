ATHENS, Greece -- The ministers of transport and finance announced on Thursday (14 April) that they have received five bids for Olympic Airlines (OL), in what would be the government's last attempt to save the debt-ridden carrier. According to media reports, the offers came from Aegean Airlines, Deutsche British Airways, British firm Klesch, a Greek-American consortium, and the Dutch investment fund Sure Estates. The ministers said the next two months would be crucial for the sale. Several previous attempts to sell OL ended in failure. (AFP, MPA - 14/04/05)

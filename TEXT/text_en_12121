BRUSSELS, Belgium -- If they join the EU in 2007 as scheduled, Bulgaria and Romania will chair the EU in 2018 and 2019 respectively, according to a plan endorsed by the EU member states. The document, published by the Brussels-based publication EU Observer on Tuesday (14 December), includes the list of EU presidencies until 2020. Also Tuesday, Dutch Foreign Minister Bernard Bot, whose country currently holds the rotating presidency, confirmed that Bulgaria and Romania would sign the EU accession treaty in early May at the latest.
Meanwhile, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn ruled out the possibility Tuesday of reopening chapters already closed with Romania. President-elect Traian Basescu had said he would seek renegotiation of some issues included in the Competition and Energy chapters.

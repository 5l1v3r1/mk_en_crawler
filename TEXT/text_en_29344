PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The EU-Western Balkans meeting in Sarajevo on Wednesday (June 2nd) reaffirmed that countries in the region have EU membership prospects, and afterwards, Kosovo Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni noted "All participants ... asked for acceleration of the integration process." He added that the meeting underscored a commitment to expand visa liberalisation to all Western Balkans countries. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos described the conference as a "historic day" in which the EU and the Western Balkans arrived at a "new agreement" for hope, the future and full integration with EU institutions. 
For the first time since Pristina declared independence in 2008, Kosovo and Serbian foreign ministers sat on the same table. UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier also attended the meeting, which Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said demonstrated that Kosovo was represented by UNMIK.

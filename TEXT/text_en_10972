ANKARA, Turkey -- Three more parliament members -- Ibrahim Ozdogan, Serpil Yildiz and Omer Abusoglu -- have resigned from the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), according to statements Wednesday (30 March). Local media reported that the resignations were the result of a deepening division between factions in the AKP. All three deputies said they would join the parliamentary caucus of the centre-right Motherland Party. This makes nine resignations from AKP since mid-February. (NTV - 30/03/05)

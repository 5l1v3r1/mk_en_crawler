ATHENS, Greece -- Firefighters went on alert Thursday (August 20th) after wildfires threatened homes near Athens and in the western part of the country. At least one warehouse was destroyed by the flames in Magula, about 30km northwest of the capital. Strong winds complicated the situation; flames were only about 100m from nearby houses. Traffic was blocked for hours after the main road to Magula was closed. Two other fires threaten the Markopoulos residential area in Athens. Forest fires are reported on the resort island of Kefalonia in the Ionian Sea and near the border with Albania. (AP, DPA - 20/08/09)

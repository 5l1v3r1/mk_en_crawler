SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The parties represented in the new BiH Parliament have reached a general consensus about the planned reform of the BiH Council of Ministers, according to the Office of the High Representative (OHR). The announcement Wednesday (27 November) followed a meeting of party representatives at the OHR earlier that day, when the parties had to present their final proposals on the issue. Despite some disagreement, the parties agreed in general to abolish the current principle of rotating the BiH Prime Minister position among the three constituent peoples. They also agreed to expand the Council, though the exact number of ministries has not been announced. (OHR Sources - 28/11/02; PBS BiH, RTRS - 27/11/02)

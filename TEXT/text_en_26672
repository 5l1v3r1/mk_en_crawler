ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor and opposition leaders failed to find common ground on constitutional changes during a meeting Tuesday (February 9th). The main point of contention relates to voting procedures for the Diaspora community. Talks will continue on Friday. The amendments, required by the country's EU accession process, need the support of two-thirds of lawmakers. (HRT, HINA, Poslovni - 09/02/10)

NEW YORK, United States -- The UN General Assembly voted Thursday (23 October) to elect Romania, Algeria, Benin, Brazil, and the Philippines to two-year terms as non-permanent members of the Security Council. Romania ran for the seat unopposed. It was nominated by the group of East European states to replace Bulgaria, whose two-year term expires at the end of December.
In other news Thursday, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy said his country would pledge $1m in aid to Iraq at the donor conference in Madrid. Passy indicated, however, that Sofia is not prepared to write off Iraq's $1.7 billion debt to Bulgaria. (Standart, Trud - 24/10/03; Reuters, AFP, BNT, UN Web site, Rompres, BTA - 23/10/03)

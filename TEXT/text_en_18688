SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The government of Republika Srpska and the local police have begun preparations for events marking the 12th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre. Thousands of people are expected to gather at Potocari on Wednesday (July 11th) to remember the 8,000 victims of Europe's worst post-war atrocity, which has been termed a genocide by the International Court of Justice. As many as 1,200 Bosnian Serb police officers will be deployed with members of other security agencies. 
In other news, Serbian President Boris Tadic said on Friday that Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic and the other war crimes suspects still at large will be arrested before the end of the year. Speaking at a press conference with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso in Brussels, Tadic said that bringing war criminals to justice is "a strategic goal" and "moral obligation" of his country. Barroso told reporters that Serbia's progress towards membership in the EU hinges on the arrest of the remaining fugitives. Tadic also met with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn. 
Also Friday, Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic and the head of the national council for war crimes co-operation, Rasim Ljajic, said they would propose to the UN Security Council that Serbs convicted by The Hague tribunal be allowed to serve their prison terms in Serbia. They urged all former Yugoslav republics to follow suit. (RTS - 08/07/07; B92, Beta, AFP, dpa, ONASA - 06/07/07)

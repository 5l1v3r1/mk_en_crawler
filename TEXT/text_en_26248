SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Branimir Mladenov, Bulgaria's ambassador to Turkey, has resigned, the foreign ministry confirmed on Friday (November 13th) amid media reports that his counterpart in the United States, Luchezar Petkov, would soon follow suit. The two diplomats were to be sacked over electoral violations in the July general elections, despite objections by President Georgi Parvanov, who argued the dismissals were not co-ordinated with his administration. His refusal triggered a major conflict with the government. Centre-right parties that support the government then started talks on an impeachment procedure against Parvanov, something the ruling GERB eventually decided not to support.

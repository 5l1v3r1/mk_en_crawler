THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A judge at the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague suspended the provisional release of six former senior Bosnian Croat officials on Wednesday (4 August) after prosecutors appealed the decision. Prosecutors will hold Jadranko Prlic, Bruno Stojic, Slobodan Praljak, Milivoj Petkovic, Valentin Coric, and Berislav Pusic until the trial chamber rules on the motion. The tribunal suspended the release of two Serbian officials last week for the same reason. (Reuters, AFP - 04/08/04)

Cyprus, which joined the EU in 2004, is the only Southeast European (SEE) country among 44 world nations that does not have a serious corruption problem, Transparency International (TI) said on Monday (November 6th) as it released its annual survey. 
The Berlin-based watchdog's 2006 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) ranks 163 countries on a 0-to-10 scale, with 10 being the best possible score. It reflects the perceptions of business people and country analysts, in terms of the degree of corruption in the surveyed states. 
Scores below five indicate a "perceived serious corruption problem", according to TI. With a score of 5.6 -- dropping a tenth of a percentage point since last year -- Cyprus is 37th in the 2006 CPI. 
Among other countries in the region, EU member Greece ranks highest -- in 54th place, with a score of 4.4. However, it is one of the worst performers within the 25-nation bloc, together with Poland. The latter country is 61st with 3.7 points, well below the 6.74 average for the countries in the Union. 
Turkey is among 12 world nations that have improved notably since last year. Its score of 3.8 is 0.3 higher than in the 2005 CPI, placing it 60th among the 163 nations surveyed for this year's index. The country ranked 65th among 158 nations last year. 
Bulgaria -- which is due to join the Union on January 1st, together with Romania -- is four positions ahead of Poland with a score of 4.0. While showing a slight improvement from last year, Romania's score of 3.1 indicates that it is perceived as more corrupt than its southern neighbour. The country has moved one place up to stand 84th this year. However, it ranks lower than both Bulgaria and EU candidate Croatia, whose unchanged score of 3.4 places it 69th in the world. 
"This score must be interpreted as an alarm signal by officials in Bucharest in terms that more needs to be done to fight corruption," the Budapest Business Journal quoted Iulia Cospanaru, a TI consultant in Romania, as saying on Tuesday. "Romania has passed legislation to fight corruption, it's written out there, but the problem is that the perception of this change still doesn't exist at the level of the person at the counter." 
Serbia's score of 3.0, which is 0.1 points higher than the one it was given last year, has allowed it to move up seven positions to 90th. 
While they have been given worse rankings this year, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Macedonia's scores -- 2.9 and 2.7, respectively -- have not changed from last year. BiH has dropped from the 88th to the 93rd position and Macedonia has moved down two places to rank 105th. 
Albania appears to be the worst performer among the SEE countries, despite the slight improvement since last year. Its score of 2.6 points placed it 111th among the 163 nations. 
With the worst scores given to many of the world's poorest nations, TI sees a clear link between high levels of corruption and poverty. 
"Corruption is an extremely serious problem not just for the country but above all for the people who live there and whose daily lives are damaged and curtailed by the prevalence of corruption," TI head David Nussbaum said.

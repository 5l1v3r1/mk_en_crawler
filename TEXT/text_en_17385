PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- OSCE Chairman-in-Office, Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos, reaffirmed on Tuesday (February 27th) the organisation's long-term commitment in Kosovo, regardless of the province's future status. His talks with President Fatmir Sejdiu and representatives of different ethnic communities followed similar talks Monday with leaders in Belgrade. Moratinos urged all to refrain from violence and approach the ongoing status settlement process constructively.
In Belgrade, meanwhile, some an estimated 20,000 people gathered on Tuesday in front of the US embassy to protest UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's settlement proposal. The crowd, mostly Serbs from Kosovo, demanded that the province remain part of Serbia. Demonstrators also urged Russia and China to use their vetoes at the UN Security Council against any resolution that makes Kosovo independent.
Talks between Belgrade and Pristina delegations continued on Wednesday in Vienna, this time focusing on religious and cultural heritage in Kosovo. Tuesday's talks on decentralisation issues yielded no agreements. (Blic, Danas, Politika - 28/02/07; OSCE website, Beta, B92, Tanjug, RTS, AP, Reuters - 27/02/07)

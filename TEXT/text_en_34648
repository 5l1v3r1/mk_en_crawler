SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Visiting Skopje on Friday (22 August), Graham Watson, the leader of the Liberal Democrat caucus at the European Parliament, called for discontinuing the use of the name Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), which he described as outdated and "ridiculous". For historical reasons, Greece does not recognise its neighbour's constitutional name, Republic of Macedonia. As a result, the country is referred to internationally as FYROM. Bilateral name negotiations held under UN auspices have been unsuccessful so far. (MIA, A1 TV - 22/08/03)

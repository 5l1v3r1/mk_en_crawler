NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The National Council on Friday (January 15th) said President Demetris Christofias should continue reunification negotiations, despite the lack of results during a three-day round of intensive talks earlier in the week. 
The council, a consultative body made up of political party leaders and former presidents, also urged Christofias to withdraw proposals he had made on establishing a rotating state presidency and allowing up to 50,000 settlers from mainland Turkey to stay in Cyprus. Christofias has rejected the council's demands.
Talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots will continue in another three-day round that begins on January 25th. Meanwhile, Christofias will meet Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou in Athens on Monday to brief him on the recent developments in the process. (AP - 16/01/10; Xinhua, CNA - 15/01/10)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Conservative Party (PC) leader Dan Voiculescu announced on Thursday (November 29th) that he is resigning over the party's poor performance in Sunday's European Parliament elections. The PC attracted only 2.93% of the votes. Voiculescu said he will stay on until the party congress in mid January when a new leader is elected. He added that the PC has hired a political consultant to analyse mistakes and propose measures to strengthen the party ranks. (Nine O'clock - 30/11/07; Rompres - 29/11/07)

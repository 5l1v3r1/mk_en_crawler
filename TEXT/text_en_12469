SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A total of 33 parties and coalitions have registered to run in the 25 June parliamentary elections, the Central Electoral Commission announced late Monday (9 May) after the registration deadline passed. Parties and coalitions are to present their lists of nominees to regional election panels by 25 May.
Also Monday, Justice Minister Anton Stankov suggested that investigators who lose their jobs in the process of judicial reform be re-appointed to the system as prosecutors. Stankov sent his proposal to the Supreme Judicial Council, along with the new draft penal code earlier in the day. The restructuring is a condition for EU membership in 2007.

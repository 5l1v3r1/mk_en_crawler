ANKARA, Turkey -- The government and the UN World Food Programme (WFP) signed an agreement Thursday (10 July) on WFP's activities and official representation in Turkey. The UN programme closed its representation in Ankara in 1998, as Turkey was considered self-sufficient and not in need of international food aid. WFP decided to reopen its bureau to organise emergency aid flow to Iraq following the end of the war there. The programme has already purchased goods and services worth $95m from Turkey.

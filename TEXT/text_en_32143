ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government will reconsider provisions regarding double voting in the bill on minorities' rights within a week. Minorities with a less than 1.5 per cent population share would have the right to cast ballots both for general lists of parliamentary candidates and for their minority representatives, while those with more than 1.5 per cent would elect their parliament representatives under the more disadvantageous so-called non-fixed quota. The double voting right violates the fundamental human right for equality of all citizens, said Parliament Vice President Mate Arlovic, adding that a uniform model of election of minority parliamentarians must be found.
In other news, Gen Janko Bobetko's defence attorney said his client will be taken to hospital Thursday (14 November), following the conclusion Monday by doctors that his health has seriously deteriorated. There are unconfirmed reports that Bobetko agreed only after the government sent him a written guarantee that he would not be served with an indictment by the UN war crimes tribunal while hospitalised. The 83-year-old former Croatian Army Chief of Staff was charged by the tribunal in September with war crimes committed during the 1993 Medak Pocket operation, but refused to accept the indictment.

ANKARA, Turkey -- During a visit to central Turkey Sunday (17 April), Republican People's Party (CHP) leader Deniz Baykal accused the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) of corruption. Baykal's accusations followed the recent resignation of a CHP member of parliament, who then joined AKP. Baykal says it was in exchange for a public procurement contract.
In other news, French President Jacques Chirac said Saturday that there is no link between an upcoming referendum on the new EU constitution and Turkey's bid to join the Union. He warned voters against confusing the two issues. Polls have shown that the French might scuttle the constitution during a referendum late next month. (NTV - 18/04/05; AFP - 16/04/05)

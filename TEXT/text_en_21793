THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The trial of former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic enters its final stage at the UN war crimes tribunal Tuesday (August 19th), as prosecutors and the defence are to begin their closing arguments. Milutinovic and five other indictees face charges of committing war crimes in Kosovo in the first half of 1999. According to the indictment, Milutinovic and his co-defendants persecuted Albanians on a national, religious and racial basis. They also allegedly committed murder, mass deportation and other inhumane actions against civilians. (Tanjug, B92, Beta - 19/08/08)

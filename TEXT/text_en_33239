BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- On Wednesday (11 June), UNMIK head Michael Steiner strongly advocated the transfer of some powers from UNMIK to interim local institutions. He said that the transfer would have no effect on the province's level of security, an issue about which Kosovo Serbs and Belgrade authorities have expressed concern. Citing the security situation, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic demanded earlier this week that the transfer of powers stop immediately. Steiner says that would run counter to UN Security Council Resolution 1244, but added that powers related to police and military security would not be transferred. (B92 - 11/06/03)

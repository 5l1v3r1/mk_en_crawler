SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A Skopje court on Friday (22 April) acquitted four former Macedonian security officers charged in connection with the 2002 murders of seven illegal immigrants from South Asia. The judges cited insufficient evidence. Following almost a year in custody and a five-month trial, the four were released immediately after the court's decision. The main suspect in the case is former Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski. Prosecutors say he orchestrated the murders while portraying the seven as terrorists.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday (December 15th) that his country will continue its efforts to join the EU even though European leaders did not show their full support for Ankara's aspirations at their meeting in Brussels Friday. "I am not worried about our European process," Erdogan said. Turkey's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Friday that the lack of direct reference to Turkey's accession goal by the EU-27 does not change the fact that Ankara is leading negotiations for full membership. The ministry criticises the EU members for trying to undermine the political and legal positions of Turkey regarding the membership. 
Meanwhile, Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer said on Saturday in an interview with the Standard newspaper, that there are too many illusions about Turkey's EU perspectives. Austria would support a privileged partnership agreement with Ankara, rather than full membership, he said. (AFP, Standard, Kazinform, Turkish Daily News, Anadolu news agency - 15/12/07)

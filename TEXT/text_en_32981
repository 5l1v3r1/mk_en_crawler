ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic joined the debate on the timing of general elections Wednesday (25 June), and said elections should take place early next year. Authorities initially planned ballots for the fall of this year, but the government explained later that reforms linked to EU membership might delay the elections. Mesic predicts Croatia will be able to join the EU in 2007, in light of the government'scommitment to make the process a priority. (Vjesnik - 26/06/03; HINA - 25/06/03)

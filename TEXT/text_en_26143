BUCHAREST, Romania -- The cabinet asked for a vote of confidence Tuesday (September 15th) with regard to three pieces of legislation. They cover, respectively, a single wage system in the public sector, education reform and public administration reform. The vote of confidence is the most rapid parliamentary procedure available to pass legislative packages. The prime minister presents bills to parliament, and the opposition has three days to file a vote of no confidence. So far, it has not happened, as the opposition National Liberal Party needs the help of the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians to launch the procedure. 
Meanwhile, as many as 2,000 union members protested outside parliament Tuesday over the cabinet's decision to seek a vote of confidence instead of debating the bills publicly. Concerned that restructuring will lead to layoffs, unions representing public sector workers plan a general strike on October 5th.

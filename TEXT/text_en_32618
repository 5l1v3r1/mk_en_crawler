SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Council of Ministers decided Saturday (28 December) to proceed towards completion of the Bulgarian sector of the Trans-European North-South Motorway project following negotiations with Turkey. An agreement protocol on co-operation between Bulgaria and Turkey in energy and infrastructure, which was signed in 1998 and needs updating, stipulates that Turkish companies are responsible for building the Bulgarian section in return for Bulgaria supplying electricity to Turkey. The Bulgarian section of the motorway stretches from Kalotina, on the border with Yugoslavia, to Kapitan Andreevo, on the border with Turkey. (BTA, Dnevnik - 28/12/02)

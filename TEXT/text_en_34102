ATHENS, Greece -- The government condemned as provocative a statement by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the anniversary of Turkey's invasion of Northern Cyprus in 1974. "Calling the blood-steeped offensive a 'peacekeeping operation' is a provocation for all humanity, the international community and the United Nations," Greek government spokesman Christos Protopappas said Sunday (20 July). He reiterated Greece's position that the only way to resolve the decades-long dispute between the Greek and Turkish communities on the island was to implement the UN-proposed peace plan.

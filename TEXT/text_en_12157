TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Fatos Nano on Sunday (10 July) refused to concede defeat in Albania's general election, citing what he described as violations in 30 constituencies. His Socialist Party has filed complaints with the Central Electoral Commission, delaying the official certification of the election results. President Alfred Moisiu will have to wait until at least 27 July before he can hand former President Sali Berisha's Democrats a mandate to form a government.
In other news, Moisiu on Friday discussed security in the country with Army Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Pellumb Qazimi and the heads of other relevant institutions. This was in light of uncertainty in the wake of the 3 July elections and Thursday's bombings in London. (Reuters - 10/07/05; Albanian President Web site - 08/07/05)

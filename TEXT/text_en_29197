NICOSIA, Cyprus -- UN envoy Alexander Downer said on Tuesday (May 4th) that talks to reunify the divided island will resume in the last week of May. Downer made the announcement after a meeting with Cypriot President Demetris Christofias in Nicosia. That followed Monday's meeting between Downer and newly-elected Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu. Despite earlier hard-line statements, he promised to continue what his predecessor Mehmet Ali Talat had started. (AP, CNA - 04/05/10)

ATHENS, Greece -- International Olympic Committee Co-ordination Commission Chairman Denis Oswald reiterated on Friday (24 October) that "time is the most important factor" in preparations for the 2004 Summer Games, urging Greek authorities to speed up work on all related projects. He spoke at the conclusion of the 11th inspection in Greece, acknowledging that the local organising committee had made strong progress in the past two months.
In other news, NATO Secretary General Lord George Robertson told a Greek newspaper on Sunday that the Alliance would be providing AWACS radar surveillance aircraft to patrol Greek airspace during the Games. A similar measure was adopted for the last Winter Games in Salt Lake City.
Also Sunday, Greek Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos said an investigation has been launched into reports of a smuggling ring that has taken thousands of ancient artefacts to various Western countries. The move came after a London court impounded thousands of items collected by a British man. (Kathimerini - 27/10/03; AFP - 26/10/03; ANA - 24/10/03)

The funds for settlement of liabilities resulting on issued government bonds are provided mainly from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, and partly from the privatisation of the enterprises with socially (state) - owned capital. The Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, upon proposal by the Government, adopts Annual Programme for utilization of proceeds from the privatization of enterprises with socially (state) - owned capital. The 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004 Programmes envisaged utilization of part of planned privatization proceeds for repayment of debt deriving from “old foreign currency deposits” bonds. The allocated amounts for this purpose, per year, were: MKD 840.000.000 (2001); MKD 488.097.122,5 (2002) and MKD 827.000.000 (2003). 2004 Program envisaged privatisation proceeds in the amount of MKD 300 million. As of 30.06, a total of MKD 20 million were paid in the Budget on this basis. Table 4 presents the amortisation (repayment) schedule for internal debt from issued government bonds until final maturity.

With regard to the internal debt from issued treasury bills, as of 30.06.2004, treasury bills were issued in the total nominal amount of MKD 2.334.060.000. By June 2004, upon maturity, a total amount of MKD 534.470.000 was repaid, with MKD 523.832.246 as principal and MKD 10.637.754 as interest. As of 30.06.2004, the outstanding balance of debt from issued treasury bills was MKD 1.799.590.000, with MKD 1.761.380.779 as principal and MKD 38.209.221 as interest. The interest amount, as net Budget expenditure, is projected during its preparation. In 2004 Budget, amount of MKD 120 million was allocated as interest on treasury bills.  
The contingent internal debt on the basis of issued guarantees towards domestic creditors as of 30.06.2004 amounts D 70 million and it refers to only one guarantee issued to a domestic commercial bank in favour of tobacco company. Every year, an amount of funds deemed necessary for covering the risks of calling-up guarantees towards domestic creditors is also allocated in the Budget. Amount of D 130 million was allocated for this purpose in the 2004 Budget. EXTERNAL DEBT 

The total external debt of the Republic of Macedonia is consolidated debt of the public sector (central government, Funds, public enterprises and central bank) and of the private sector (banks and non-banking private sector) towards abroad. As of 30.06.2004, it amounts to US$ 1.801 million or 36,5% of the projected 2004 GDP (see table 1). The total external debt of the Republic of Macedonia comprises of liabilities of its residents upon concluded long-term and short-term credit arrangements with multilateral, bilateral and private creditors.

By creditors, most of the long-term debt of the Republic of Macedonia towards abroad consists of liabilities towards multilateral creditors (51,9% as of 30.06.2004) and towards bilateral creditors (13,7%), while liabilities towards private (commercial) creditors of 32,4% of total long-term external debt. By multilateral creditors, the liabilities towards the International Development Association - IDA, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development – IBRD, the European Investment Bank – EIB, the European Union, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development – EBRD and the International Monetary Fund – IMF prevail. The large share of multilateral creditors can be explained through an analysis of the public sector debt by purpose of borrowing. As of 30.06.2004, the public sector debt largely resulted from credits and loans used to support the balance of payments and the structural reforms – US$ 604,91 million or 41,4%; loans and credits used for infrastructure projects create a public sector debt in the amount of US$ 331,65 million or 22,7%; the share of loans and credits used for promotion of economic development is US$ 97,45 million or 6,67%; debt upon borrowings intended for public consumption amounts US$ 11,24 million or 0,77% of the public debt; the remaining debt arises from rescheduled liabilities of Republic of Macedonia towards Paris Club of Creditors (bilateral creditors) and London Club of Creditors (private or commercial creditors), in the amount of US$ 415,97 million or 28,47%. With regard to Paris Club of Creditors, Republic of Macedonia assumed debt in the total amount of US$ 396,88 million, with US$ 324,5 million (as of 02.12.1982) rescheduled in 1995. Thereby, the arrears incurred before this date, were rescheduled to 15,5 years, with four-year grace period. The debt incurred after 02.12.1982 was rescheduled with 6,5 years repayment period. The remaining debt in the amount of US$ 72,38 million was not covered by the rescheduling, i.e. it was agreed to be repaid under the existing conditions. In 1999, due to the influence of the Kosovo crisis on national economy, the Paris Club of Creditors accepted a moratorium of the liabilities that fell due within the period 31.03.1999 – 31.03. 2000.  In 1997, an agreement was reached with the London Club of Creditors for payment of assumed debt in the amount of US$ 228,73 million to be made during 15 years with 4-year grace period. For this purpose, Republic of Macedonia issued a C-bond, denominated in US$ and listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The nominal value of the principal is in the amount of US$ 228.727.000, issued with no interest coupon. The payments are made semi-annually. The instalments for repayment of the principal progressively increase. The percentage of repayment is External debt by creditors       IBRD     11%   IMF   3%    IDA      20%EIBEBRD EUOthers Bilateral creditors14%    London club 14%Other private creditors  19%precisely determined with the instalments repayment schedule, defined by a law. According to the plan, the repayment of the principal will be carried out in a period of 11 years i.e. in 22 semi-annual instalments, with following progressive repayment rate: 1-2 instalment 1,50%, 3-8 instalment 2%, 9-12 instalment 3%, 13-14 instalment 4,5%, 15-18 instalment 7%, 19-22 instalment 9%. The last instalment of the bond falls due on 02.07.2012. The difference between the interest rate calculated on the total debt (LIBOR, increased by 13/16 on an annual level) and the Interest rates in the grace period (3,5% for 1998 - 2000 and 3,5% for 2000 - 2002), was capitalised and the principal of the debt is increased by that amount. After capitalization of the interest in the period 1998-2000, the nominal value of the bonds reached amount of US$ 261,62 million, whereby initial nominal value of US$ 228,73 million (at moment of issuance) increased by US$ 32,89 million. The first repayment of principal was made in January 2002, ever since liabilities are serviced on regular basis.

The share of other currencies is minor. This situation determined increase of the external debt in 2002 and 2003, on the basis of positive exchange rate differences as result of inter-currency exchange rate variations of US$ in relation to value of other currencies in which debt is denominated. Box 1 
For 2003, under the IBRD methodology, following indicators of the level of indebtedness of the Republic of Macedonia were determined:   the total external debt in relation to the average GDP in the last three years is 45,8%, and under this criterion, Republic of Macedonia falls within the group of moderately indebted countries;    the total external debt in relation to the average annual amount of export of goods and services in the last three years is 122,18%, and under this criterion, Republic of Macedonia falls within the group of less indebted countries;    the total servicing of the debt in relation to the average annual export of goods and services in the last three years is 16,12%, and under this criterion, Republic of Macedonia falls within the group of less indebted countries; and   the total repayment of interest in relation to the average export of goods and services in the last three years is 3,55%, and under this criterion, Republic of Macedonia falls within the group of less indebted countries. In 2003, on the basis of the determined indicators, it could be concluded that the Republic of Macedonia joins the group of less indebted countries with medium income, with three out of four indicators classify it within this category. 

Servicing of the external debt 
The resources for servicing the liabilities upon external debt – the central government debt, are provided from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, largely via foreign credits and donations intended for macro-financial assistance. As for domestic sources, fiscal revenues in Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, as well as privatisation proceeds (allocated in the Annual Plan for this purpose) should be mentioned. Resources for repayment of liabilities are precisely stated on the expenditure side of the Budget.  In the next period, Government plans to raise necessary funds by issuing bonds with maturities longer than 2, but shorter than 10 years. These binds will, initially, be issued only on the domestic market (second half of 2005). After 2006, if proven necessary, the Government will begin preparations for issuance of long-term bonds on international market.

This practice is expected to continue in the future. The Government of Republic of Macedonia established a trend of regular and timely servicing of debt liabilities, both domestic and external. This trend will continue in the future, even more since this commitment is one of the most important criteria incorporated in the economic programs supported by arrangements with the International Monetary Fund. 
12. Price regime: How has the price regime been liberalised over time and in what sectors are prices still administered or regulated? Please indicate the broad categories of prices which are administered/regulated and the share of administered/regulated prices in total.  
The prices of goods and services in the economy of the Republic of Macedonia are created freely, according to the market conditions. Only in certain activities where no competitive market conditions exist and in order to prevent monopolistic behavior, prices are being kept under administrative control by applying the measure of determining the highest prices of certain products and services.  Pursuant to the Decision for determining the highest prices of certain products and services enacted by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia in 2004 (“Official Gazette of RM No. 65/2004), the following prices are administratively controlled: prices in the production of water for supply to the population and the economy, production and distribution of potable water, wastewater treatment and draining (except for collectors), sanitation maintenance in the city and residential areas (waste removal and deposition), funeral services and services for obligatory insurance of motor vehicles.   With the enactment of the Law of Energy (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 47/1997, 18/1999, 40/1999, 98/2000, 94/2002 and 38/2003) and Telecommunications Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 33/1996, 17/1998, 28/2000, 04/2002, 37/2004), and other regulations, as well as with the start of the work of the Energy Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Macedonia at the beginning of 2004, the prices of certain products and services in these activities are no longer under administrative control, but are subject to regulation by the Energy Regulatory Commission, i.e. the Telecommunication Authority. The Energy Regulatory Commission, pursuant to the Energy Law performs several tasks including the enactment of the Methodology for determining the price of certain energy types and the enactment of decisions for the price levels of certain energy types in accordance to the Methodology, while the Telecommunication Authority determines the public telecommunication services  which prices are regulated pursuant to the provisions of the Telecommunication Law.  The prices of products and services of certain activities in the filed of transport (postal services, railroad transport, airport services), as well as in the activity of growing and exploitation of forests are created by the Management Boards of those enterprises, where pursuant to Article 11 of the Public Enterprises Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 38/1996, 9/1997, 6/2002, 6/2003 and 40/2003) they are obliged to ask for a consent for the Prices Act from the Government.  With the enacted Law on Trade in 2004 (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 16/2004), as well as with the enactment of further legal and other regulations, conditions have been created and would continue to be created in the direction of further price liberalisation.  In the process of transition to a market economy, the total share of retail prices under administrative control has been gradually reduced, so that the share of prices with defined maximum levels was reduced from 20% in 1992 to about 11% on average in the period 2001-2003.  In 2004 with the start of the work of the Energy Regulatory Commission in the field of price regulation, and the transfer of the prices of certain energy types under the competencies of the Energy Regulatory Commission, the total percentage of prices under administrative control has been significantly reduced and is about 2%.  
13. Labour Market (see also chapter 13 – Social Policy and Employment): a) Unemployment: How has unemployment developed over time and sectors? What are the main causes of unemployment?  b) Employment: How is the division of employment between the public, the privatised and the private sector? What have been the main sectors of job creation? How do you assess the relationship between economic growth and employment? c) Describe the government policy concerning the labour market. What are the main steps taken/to be taken to improve the unemployment situation and/or the mismatch between labour supply and demand? 

)  
The process of economic transition in the Republic of Macedonia was carried out in especially unfavourable economic environment characterised by loss of the traditional markets, trade blockades and closed borders towards the neighbouring countries, as well as instability throughout the whole region. All this, supplemented with the necessary restructuring of the economy, resulted in decline in the number of employed and low capacity for absorption of the inflow of new workforce on the labour market. In addition to the effect of the significant decline in the economic activity and the very low level of investment, one must emphasize the fact that the high unemployment rate in the Republic of Macedonia dates even from the pre-transition period, when open unemployment also existed. Namely, the registered unemployment in the Republic of Macedonia has been rising since the early 1960s, stabilising at around 25% at the period of gaining independence and with a more significant intensification of unemployment rise in the mid-1990s.   Hence, one can conclude that the unemployment in the Republic of Macedonia is not due primarily and exclusively to the restructuring of the economy in the period of transition and the reduced economic activity, but, above all, it is a result of the long-term insufficient demand for labour force.   It is also important to mention that a part of the rise in the registered unemployment in the country is also due to the fact that the unemployed persons provide their health insurance via the public employment services. That led to the situation where numerous unemployed persons register themselves as unemployed in order to acquire the right to a health insurance, although they do not fulfil the criteria to be treated as unemployed, i.e. they do not actively seek jobs or are already employed in the informal sector. As of 1996, the State Statistics Office began conducting Labour Force Surveys (LFS), in order to provide additional data and information on the labour market and on the situation regarding employment and unemployment in the country. The 2003 data from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) showed an unemployment rate of 36,7%, indicating a significant increase in relation to previous years, when this figure was around 32%. In 2003, the Labour Force Survey showed that 30,000 persons lost their jobs in the previous year. Several reasons are clear, whereby the lay-offs due to restructuring are the main reasons for the rise in unemployment. There is no major difference between the unemployment rates among men and women, although the unemployment among women previously showed a declining trend. Unemployment is even higher among younger age groups and the less educated persons.  The labour force and unemployment data are given in Table 1.

Employment Bureau. In the period before April 2003, 70% of the registered unemployed persons were registered as unemployed longer than 2 years. Only a small portion of these unemployed persons was a result of the (mass) lay-offs or the structural reforms. If we consider the unemployed people registered only for the purpose of obtaining a health insurance, the share of this group was 19% in May 2003 (opposite to 16% in January 2000). There is a clear difference between the officially registered employment and the employment recorded in various labour force research efforts. Besides the administrative and methodological reasons, this major difference reflects the employment of workers not registered by their employers or workers in unregistered firms (informal sector). These differences are especially large in agriculture, trade, tourism and private services.  
b)  
According to the Labour Force Survey, in 2002, around 47,6% of the employed persons worked in the government sector, while 52,4% of the employed persons worked in the private sector (Table 2). In the period between 1998 and 2002, the employment in the public sector significantly decreased, while the employment in the private sector increased. Employment in the private sector comprised approximately half of the employed, one quarter of the employers and another quarter of the unpaid family workers.

Actually, the share of female workers in the private sector employment rises faster than the share of the male workers, implying that there is a higher probability for women to find a job in the private sector, such as the ones falling within younger age groups.  Employment is characterised by a high share of the processing industry (24,1% in 2003) and a relatively low share of services (44,16%). Significant trend in recent years is the decline of the share of agriculture in the total employment (22,0% in 2003).  Table 3. Employed per sector (2001-2003)

In early 1990s, the decline in the real GDP was greater than the decline in employment since enterprises avoided restructuring and workforce lay-offs. The GDP growth in the period between 1998 and 2000 is attributed primarily to the overall productivity factor, although it was under the negative influence of the insignificant reduction of the fixed assets. The biggest discrepancy was noted in 2001, when GDP significantly declined, while the employment increased due to additional engagement in the security forces of the Republic of Macedonia as a result of the internal crisis in the country.

Source: State Statistics Office c)  The Government policy in the area of labour market was defined in the 2004-2005 National Employment Action Plan (NEAP). It was prepared in accordance with the ten Employment Guidelines encompassed in the EU Employment Strategy and adjusted to the conditions, specificities and characteristics of the labour market in the Republic of Macedonia.  The NEAP defines the national strategies on employment increase and labour market flexibility, poverty reduction, vocational education, trainings, re-qualification and additional qualification, enhancement of measures for employment encouragement, as well as the provision of efficiency of active employment policies.  The social partners and other entities competent in the fields of employment and labour market were involved in the preparation of this document and its implementation. Active labour market policies promoted by the Government are focused, inter alia, on the following: support to the job provision (information, intermediation and counselling), organization of training 199819992000200120022003Real GDPEmploymentprograms (re-qualification and additional qualification) and creating conditions and support to the direct job creation. Active labour market policies fully adhere to the principle of gender equality. The measures contained in this document, together with the determined policy, activities, measures, as well as projects and programs contained in the macroeconomic policy, are aimed at the improvement of the situation with regard to unemployment and the matching of labour force supply and demand. As part of the policies designed for reduction of unemployment, certain national strategies were adopted, focusing on defined critical groups. One of these documents is the Strategy for Improvement of the Condition of the Roma in the Republic of Macedonia, harmonized with the Agenda 2000 of the European Union.

How many enterprises have been privatised/liquidated/sent into bankruptcy procedures? Please provide information on the size, employment and activity of these enterprises. What are the plans for the future? Have any enterprises been re-nationalised after their initial privatisation? What is the current status and portfolio of the Privatisation Agency? What are the prospects for further divestment and termination of activities of the Agency?  b) How did the authorities use the revenue of privatisation? How will the future funds resulting from privatisation be used? c) Has the corporate governance improved as a consequence of privatisation? 

)  The pluralism of ownership in the Republic of Macedonia started by the end of 1980s with the enactment of several laws in former Yugoslavia (now, out of force): the Law on Enterprises (“Official Gazette of SFRY”, No. 77/1888 and 61/1990), Law on Payment of Salaries in the Republic of Macedonia and Law on Transformation of Socially-Owned Capital (“Official Gazette of RM“ No. 38/1993 48/1993, 21/1998, 25/1999, 39/1999, 81/1999, 49/2000, 6/2002, 31/2003 and 38/2004). These laws enabled establishment of private companies, joint stock companies and limited liability companies, as well as commencement of privatisation process of socially-owned capital. The latter was enabled by issuing internal shares for the purpose of raising additional capital (internal shares had been later, under certain conditions, transformed in ordinary shares), by sale of company or part thereof, debt-to-equity conversion and joint ventures). In June 1993, the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia adopted the Law on Transformation of Socially Owned Enterprises (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 38/1993), which promoted a new privatisation concept. Key element in realisation of that concept was to provide continuity in transformation of socially-owned capital by converting internal shares into ordinary ones, upon control on financial statements carried by competent institution.  Basic objectives of the privatisation concept were:     Increasing the efficiency of the economy by providing dominant private ownership of the capital thus promoting a new form of corporate governance;   Stabilising economic trends in the country in the interest of economic development;   Attracting foreign capital in the Republic of Macedonia;    Creating conditions for improved implementation of other market-oriented reforms;   Supporting repayment of external and domestic debt of the state;   Supporting development of the capital market. The Law on Transformation of the Socially-owned Enterprises stipulates different models of transformation, depending on the enterprise size. Pursuant to the Law, at least two of the three conditions should be fulfilled in order for an enterprise to be classified in one of the three categories:    Small enterprise: under 50 employees, total annual turnover below 8.000 average monthly salaries and book value of total assets below 6.000 average monthly salaries;   Medium-size enterprise: between 50 and 250 employees, total annual turnover below 40.000 average monthly salaries and book value of total assets below 30.000 average monthly salaries;    Large enterprise: over 250 employees, total annual turnover above 40.000 average monthly salaries and book value of total assets value above 30.000 average monthly salaries.  1.  The following transformation models were defined for small enterprises:    Employee buy-out.    Sale of ideal stake of the enterprise. 2.  For medium-size enterprise:    Sale of ideal stake of the enterprise.   Buy-out of the enterprise.   Sale to persons taking over management of the enterprise.   Issuance of shares for raising additional capital.  Debt-to-equity conversion. 3.  For large enterprise:  Large enterprises apply the same models as medium-size, with only difference being that the first installment for sale to persons taking over its management is 10% (instead of 20% for medium-size) and for additional investment, 15% (instead of 30% for medium-size) of the appraised enterprise value.   The Law also defines the models that may be applied in all enterprises, regardless of their size:   Leasing with a right-to-purchase option;   Sale of all enterprise assets;   Enterprise transformation in bankruptcy procedure.  In addition to the given models, the Law also stipulates possibility for buying shares, i.e. stakes under favourable conditions, whereby maximum 30% of value of shares i.e. stakes issued by transforming enterprise, can be bought under these terms. Purchase under favourable conditions is provided for: (1) employees, employed at least two years before the adoption of the transformation decisions, (2) persons whose employment was terminated in the transforming enterprise and who worked there for two years continuously and (3) retired employees who worked in the transforming enterprise for two years continuously. The right to purchase under favourable conditions could be exercised as one-off deal and only in one company.  The rights of the employees in transforming enterprises covered: (1) initial discount of 30% + 1% for each year of service in the enterprise and (2) purchase of shares or stake with discount not exceeding DEM 25.000 (EUR 13.000). The majority of enterprises were privatised (transformed) with employee buy-out model, determined for small enterprises. This outcome derives from the fact that small enterprises were the most numerous entities in the economic structure of the country. Second most often applied model for medium-size and large enterprises, according to the number of privatised enterprises, is the model of sale to persons taking over management (leveraged buy-out). This model is dominant by number of employees and by appraised value of enterprises.  Remaining capitals, as well as capital not repaid in timely manner and in accordance with concluded contracts, are transferred to the portfolio of Privatisation Agency of the Republic of Macedonia in a form of shares or stocks. The same are later offered on the JSC Macedonian Stock Exchange (MSE).  In 1999,  direct sale privatisation method (via MSE) was introduced. Due to inherent lack of transparency of this method, its application was terminated the following year, 2000.  After the adoption of the Law on Modifications and Amendments of the Law on Transformation of Socially-Owned Enterprises in May 2003 (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 31/2003) the priority task of the Privatisation Agency of the Republic of Macedonia was to accelerate the privatisation process by selling stocks and shares via public stock exchange auction. This was carried out in accordance with procedures for trading with stocks and shares, adopted by JSC Macedonian Stock Exchange on the basis of previously obtained opinion from the Agency, whereby the minimal initial selling price was 10% of the nominal value of stocks/shares. The determined minimal initial price was not obligatory in cases when analysis of economic parameters of the company or when market conditions on organised securities market indicated potential higher or lower market price. At the same time, the sale of shares, i.e. stocks may also be carried out on the basis of previously announced public tender, for companies set by act of the Government, which are of special importance for the national economy and where opportunities and expressed interest by investors for expansion and reactivation of the business activities exists.  As of 30.06.2004, privatisation procedure was completed in 1.688 enterprises, and their appraised value amounted EUR 2,209 billion. The transformation procedure has not been completed only in 82 enterprises, subject to privatisation, due to the following: (1) initiated bankruptcy procedure, (2) implementation of transformation procedure in bankruptcy or (3) transformation documentation has been still processed.  Pursuant to the Law, the social and state owned capital that was not sold by the end of 2004 will be transferred to the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund.  As of 30.09.2004, according to State Statistics Office’s Register on Legal Entities (in all ownership sectors):   1.087 companies have been liquidated;   189 companies are in a bankruptcy procedure;    82 companies are in the process of liquidation.  An analysis of the sample of enterprises and their financial statements for the period 1996-2003 suggests that the number of employees (in the sample) has been reduced for more than 12%. Total revenues have been increased by 33% and the profit by 282%, while the total generated losses of the observed enterprises have been reduced by 92% in the observed period.  These results may derive from implemented restructuring in these enterprises, although the size of the analysed sample requires prudence when drawing conclusions.

Certain information may be obtained from the initial data for the years 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999. nalyses have been made n performances of enterprises with different ownership type: genuine private enterprises, privatised enterprises and other enterprises that have not been subject to privatisation process. Unfortunately, the analysis cannot be supplemented with latest data, since the published analysis of financial results in the national economy does not include (since recently) disaggregating of results by ownership sector.  The basic indicators are presented in Charts 1-3 below, illustrating productivity (total income per employee - Picture 1), cost-efficiency (coverage of total expenditures by income - Picture 2) and profitability (gross profit as compared to the companies’ equity). An initial tendency of improvement of these indicators for the overall economy can be noticed. Genuine private companies have the leading role, demonstrating, as expected, highest productivity and profitability. On the other hand, the transformed enterprises are the most unstable category and they would be in the focus of interest of analysts in future. The situation in the remaining group companies is not as good as compared to other two. Still, significant improvement of performances was noticeable in last two years within this group as well.

As of 31.12.2003, 793 agreements have been concluded of which due to delayed payment of matured instalments or cancellation to fulfil the obligations, 220 were terminated.  However, termination of agreements does not mean re-nationalisation i.e. re-acquiring of the capital by the state, since the Privatisation Agency of the Republic of Macedonia, pursuant to the Law, permanently offers these stocks and shares for sale. As of 31.12.2003, the Privatization Agency, through JSC Macedonian Stock Exchange and by concluding agreements for sale of stocks, already sold its shares and stocks in 155 companies out of aforementioned 220.  The portfolio of the residual shares of the Privatisation Agency of the Republic of Macedonia, as of 31.12.2004, included 86 enterprises with a total nominal capital value of EUR 53,7 million. Out of these enterprises, the Agency:    owns 100% of shares in two enterprises, with total nominal capital value of EUR 9,2 million    has majority capital, over 50% but less than 100%, in 17 enterprises, with total nominal capital value of EUR 33,5 million    has significant minority capital, with more than 20%, but less than 50%, in 17 enterprises with total nominal capital value of EUR 33,5 million    have stocks or shares, which account for less than 20%, in the remaining 50 enterprises with total nominal value of EUR 7,7 million.  A partial inconsistency has been registered between the records of the Agency and the position the companies have reported, through their shareholders’ books, to the Central Securities Depository, which, at the moment, hinders their prompt sale. Privatisation Agency of the Republic of Macedonia, the companies, the Central Securities Depository and the Securities Exchange Commission have been working on clarifying and unifying the records, thus enabling prompt sale of these stocks/shares.  As of 3.12.2004, the state-owned capital, expressed in shares acquired by different legal bases, in nominal terms, amounts EUR 929 million. Following table presents the number of companies in which the Government, its institutions and enterprises have ownership presented in stocks or shares.

The privatisation proceeds are used pursuant to Law on Transformation of Socially-wned Enterprises (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 38/1993, Article 93), with more detailed provisions stipulated in special annual programmes, adopted by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, upon proposal by the Government.  According to these programmes, the privatisation proceeds collected by the Agency have been transferred to a special account and are earmarked for:   repayment of domestic and external debts of the Republic of Macedonia, particularly debt deriving from “old foreign currency deposits” of the citizens;    ensuring the employees’ rights and creating possibilities for re-employment of workers laid off due to the ownership transformation;   indemnification of persons with ownership rights pursuant to denationalisation regulations, that could not be indemnified by shares, i.e. stocks;   payment of 8% retroactive pensions for the purpose of pension indexation and    development programmes and projects, with emphasis on public and utility infrastructure (water supply, education and health facilities, local road network etc.).   Future privatisation proceeds will be also aiming at supporting these activities, whereby the focus would be placed on development programmes and projects, which would lead to improvement of living conditions of citizens and to creation of conditions for economic growth.  
c)  Although most of the privatisation models have provided for public and open invitations for bids by domestic and foreign individuals and legal entities, in most cases, bids were submitted only from insiders – present employees and management of enterprises. Hence, the centralisation of the management rights in the hands of insiders is considered as one of the features of privatisation in the Republic of Macedonia.  Contrary to the fact that wide ownership structure does not lead to successful corporate governance, significant number of companies have lot of shareholders, each of them owning relatively small share of company’s capital. Most of these shareholders are also employees in the same company, thus having conflicting interests for the company – on one hand owners and, on other, as employees. The management, in conditions of poorly enforced policy of corporate governance, might be in position to impose its personal objectives above those of the company.  There are several independent researches about how the privatisation in the Republic of Macedonia improved the corporate governance, with some of the findings thereof presented:  1.  Enterprises privatised in 1996 and 1997 were more productive than those not privatised, where initial productivity of the companies privatised at a later stage was lower than of those earlier entering the process. After levelling statistical bias, the conclusion might be that there is no significant statistical proof that the privatisation has (so far) led to significant improvement of enterprises’ performances.  2.  Enterprises in the Republic of Macedonia experienced difficult environment, characterised by stabilisation measures of economic policy and unfavourable external surrounding during the most of 1990s. Productivity of production factors has been declining during the period, and the lack of corporate governance remains to be crucial issue in the analysed period.  3.  Enterprises purchased by outsiders show better performance than those owned by insiders and seem to be more inclined to implement the necessary restructuring.

Reforms in the field of air transport- A part of the existing Civil Aviation Authority would be transformed into a joint stock company owned by the state, responsible to control the air transport. It is envisaged to establish a company for air services that would operate in accordance to ICAO and EUROCONTROL.  
Infrastructure modernisation in the above-mentioned sectors  
. Air transport – The feasibility study for modernisation of the Airport Skopje (financed within the regional CARDS 2001), envisaged enlargement, reconstruction and improvement of menagement. According to the plan, the existing area of the terminal should be enlarged from the existing 5,000 mto more than 11,500 m, the number of windows should be doubled, and new luggage sorting devices should be installed, the existing arrival and departure waiting rooms should be reconstructed, the existing zones for customs and passport control should be extended and the existing parking capacities enlarged. The total funds necessary for the realisation of the aforementioned activities are in the amount of 21.23 million Euros. Regarding the management, the model of renting the facility under concession was accepted.  B. Road network - A Study for development of a mid-term strategy for road infrastructure is currently being prepared under the EBRD loan. The Study proceeds from the strategic orientation of the Republic of Macedonia to complete the construction of the two Pan-European transport corridors, passing through its territory. Within this framework, in accordance with the Recommendations of the High Group of the European Commission, the so called Guidelines for the Trans-European Transport Network (including a list of priority projects) are expected to be harmonized in line with the evolution of the relations between the Republic of Macedonia and EU.  The Government of the Republic of Macedonia, as a part of the Public Investments Programme, envisages the construction of (1) 75, Demir Kapija - Udovo Section; (2) 5 Bitola-Medzitlija, which is a part of the European Corridor ; (3) Tabanovce-Kumanovo, also a part of Corridor X; (4) Udovo-Smokvica; (5) construction of roads, each of them with two lanes for each direction for those sections of Corridor VIII whose construction has not started yet, as well as (6) ring road around Skopje Phase I and II.  C. Border Crossings. With interest of improvement of road infrastructure and connection to infrastructure of the neighbouring countries and the EU, the Public Investments Programme stipulates the modernisation of (1) the border crossing to Republic of Albania “Kafasan” - construction, (2) the border crossing to Republic of Greece “Star Dojran” - upgrading of functioning and construction of a new customs control terminal for vehicles, (3) the border crossing to Republic of Bulgaria “Novo Selo” - improving the working conditions, (4) the border crossing to Serbia and Montenegro (on the part of Kosovo) “Blace” - improving the electricity supply, (5) border crossing to Republic of Greece “Medzitlija” infrastructure construction.  D. Broadcasting. On 14.12.2004 the PE Macedonian Radio and Television put into use the first digital earth TV transmitter (DVB –T). The digitalisation process continues in 2005 (according to the plans, 3-5 new digital transmitters). In cooperation with the French corporation Teles and Deutche Welle, a digital radio transmitter on medium waves has been put in a test use.  
16. Protected sectors (utilities, transport, housing…): Which sectors are subject to specific protection (market entry, price setting...). Please describe recent developments in this respect, such as specific measures of liberalisation or deregulation. Which sectors will remain under special protection? Are there provisions of preferred treatment in particular as regards former socially owned enterprises? (see also chapter 6 – Competition) 
Securing the continuous performing of economic activity of public interest, as significant part the normal living, work of legal entities and state institutions, is the basic reason and justification for granting exclusive rights.  Based on the fact that the public enterprises are the only holders of certain activity of public interest on the territory of the whole country or the local self-government units, they are granted an exclusive right for performing these activities. Having in mind the necessity for complete harmonisation of the national legislation to the Acquis in this field (obligations of the SAA), a Law on Public Enterprises is currently in the process of preparation.  The subject and the scope of exclusive or special rights are regulated by special laws that also regulate the method and conditions for performing certain activities. The duration of these rights is usually unlimited in time. The only exception in relation to ownership status and limited duration of certain exclusive right is JSC Macedonian Telecommunications, where the dominant owner is a foreign company. In the case of this company, exclusive rights in the fixed telephony have been granted on the basis of a separate agreement that expired on 31.12.2004.  The above-mentioned special Laws, regulating certain sectors (activities), as a rule, also specify the entities that are being granted the exclusive right for performing these activities.  
The Telecommunication Law (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 33/1996, 17/1998, 4/2002 and 37/2004) regulates the conditions and the ways of performing the activities in the field of telecommunications, the construction, maintenance and use of telecommunication networks and assets, the relations between the providers and the users of telecommunication services, the competition in the telecommunication field, the provision of universal services, the granting of concessions and performing telecommunication services based on concessions, the management, use and control of the radiofrequency spectrum, the production, import, sale, use and maintenance of radio stations, terminal equipment and other issues related to telecommunications.    The public telecommunication services and the use of the radiofrequency spectrum are issues of public interest for the Republic of Macedonia.  The Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Telecommunication Authority are competent for regulating the issues in the telecommunication field determined by this Law.  
The Communal Activities Law (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 45/1997, 23/1999, 45/2002 and 16/2004) regulates the general conditions and the way of performing the communal activities, the defining, financing of communal activities and other relevant issues in this field. The performing of communal activities is a matter of public interest.  The communal activity may be performed by establishing a public enterprise for communal activity, by granting concession for performing communal activity in a manner determined by law and by issuing a licence for performing a communal activity.  Pursuant to the Law on Forests (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 47/1997, 7/2000 and 89/2004) the Government of the Republic of Macedonia has established a public enterprise for management of state owned forests for economic purposes. The Law regulates the following: growing, use and protection of forests as an activity of public interest. The Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia enacts a General Plan for Management of Forests for a period of 20 years, which covers the management of state as well as privately owned forests, regardless of their purpose of use.  
The Law on Establishing the Public Enterprise Macedonian Radio-Television (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 6/1998, 98/2000 and 78/2004) regulates the establishment, the activity and the organisation of the public enterprise Macedonian Radio-Television. The public enterprise performs an activity of public interest. It performs its activity under conditions and in a way determined by the Broadcasting Law, the Telecommunications Law, the Law on Public Enterprises and other laws. The activity of MRT, among the others, is as follows:       Creating and broadcasting radio and TV programmes within the guaranteed rights and freedoms of citizens with informative, educational, cultural, scientific, sports, music, entertainment and other content in Macedonian and the languages of the ethnicities living in the Republic of Macedonia and    Creating and broadcasting special programmes informing about and protecting the cultural and historic traditions and programs for maintenance and promotion of the relations with the expatriates and other citizens from the Republic of Macedonia that live in the neighbouring countries, Europe and other continents. Pursuant to the provisions of the Broadcasting Law, the Broadcasting Council supervises the work of the public enterprise.  
The Energy Law (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 47/1997, 40/1999, 98/2000 and 38/03) regulates the conditions and the way of performing activities in the field of energy, protection of the energy facilities, units and plants, protection of environment and nature from harmful influences caused by the work of the energy facilities, units and plants and supervision.  Activities in the energy field as defined by this Law are the following:   generation, transmission and distribution of electricity;    production and processing of coal;   production, processing and transport of oil and oil derivatives;   production, transport and distribution of natural gas;   production, transport and distribution of heat and geothermal energy    production of other energy types. The activities of generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, international transport of crude oil through pipelines, production, transport and distribution of natural gas and production, transfer and distribution of heat and geothermal energy, except for private purposes, are considered activities of public interest.  For performing these activities, a public enterprise could be established or appropriate licenses could be issued to other entities.  An Energy Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Macedonia has been established with the purpose of providing secure and safe energy supply to the consumers in the Republic of Macedonia, protection of the environment and the nature, introduction and protection of a competitive energy market based on the principles of objectivity, transparency and non-discrimination.  For performing the works in the field of water management, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia has established a Public Water Management Company.  The Law on Waters (“Official Gazette of  RM”, No. 4/1998, 18/1999, 19/2000 and 51/2003) regulates the conditions and ways of utilizing waters, their protection from adverse influences, their protection from exhaustion and pollution, management of waters, springs and the way of financing the water management activities, conditions and ways of performing water management activities, providing water for use by granting approvals (concessions), international waters and other issues important for providing a unique regime for waters in the Republic of Macedonia.   The water management activity of public interest in terms of this Law comprises of: construction, maintenance and utilisation of water management facilities and plants related to providing water for water supply, irrigation and land drainage; determining the protected zones; protection from adverse influences on waters; protection of the beds and coasts of the watercourses and lakes; protection from floods, protection from erosion and torrents; extraction of sand, gravel and stone for protection purposes and improving the waters regime; providing water reserves that provide unique regime of the river basin or part of a basin and preparation of project documentation and studies in relation the improvement of the water regime.   
The Law on Macedonian Railways (“Official Gazette of RM”, No.9/1998), regulates the railway transport, the construction, reconstruction, repair, maintenance and protection of the railroad infrastructure and the issues of safety and financing. These activities of public interest are performed by the public enterprise Macedonian Railways. The railway infrastructure may also be used by other legal entities under the conditions and in the way determined by this Law and international agreements.  
The Law on Postal Services (“Official Gazette of RM”, No.55/2002) regulates the conditions and the ways of performing postal services in the domestic and international postal traffic, the provision of access for all beneficiaries to a universal postal service on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia, the introduction of competition in performing postal services, the mutual relations between the recipients and the providers of postal services, the issuance of stamps and letters of value, as well as other issues related to the postal services. Pursuant to Article 9 of this Law, within the universal postal service, only the Basic Postal Operator (PE Makedonski Posti/Macedonian Post) performs reserved postal services that include receiving, sorting, transfer and delivery of postal delivery, including also the direct mail, both in domestic and international postal traffic provided that the weight of these packages is less than 350 grams.   Performing postal services and issuing stamps and letters of value are activities of public interest. The inspection supervision for provisions of this Law, the regulations enacted on the basis of this Law, the enforcement of concession agreements, as well the licences issued pursuant to this Law is conducted by the State Transport Inspectorate through inspectors for postal traffic.  
Existing state monopolies - Characteristic state monopolies are the following: PE Macedonian Railways, JSC Energy Company of Macedonia, PE Macedonian Forests, PE Water management, PE for Road Maintenance – “Makedonija Pat” and PE for Airport Services “Makedonija”. 
Reform projects – The processes which are underway include the preparation of a new Law on Public Enterprises, as well the transformation/restructuring of the existing monopolies, out of which, due to their importance, the following should be mentioned - JSC ESM (see 27H14_I and 28H14_II_B) and PE Macedonian Railways (see 29H9_II_B_1). The key objective of these processes is separation of the competitive parts from the so-called natural monopoly, thus contributing to increase in the efficiency in performing these activities.  The process of institutional restructuring of the water management sector began in 2004, as a result of the enhanced reform activities.  This sector was generating continuous losses caused by the long-term miss-management. This has been the reason for the liquidation of 8 water management companies from three regions (Tikves, Bregalnica and Polog) and new water management companies were created, but now with modified roles, in order to strengthen, above all, the responsibility of the farmers themselves organised in water communities in the process of management and maintenance of the irrigation systems. The activities in this field would continue in 2005 and would extend to the whole territory of the Republic of Macedonia, which involves the inclusion of the remaining twenty water management companies and their complete restructuring. The reforms in this field would be assisted by the Project for Irrigation Repair and Restructuring financed by a World Bank Loan and grant funds from the Royal Dutch Government.   Similar processes have also been planned for the local public enterprises (amendments of the regulation are underway), where those activities which are competitive by nature will be separated (communal sanitation, transport, management of open markets etc.) in order to expose them to competition and participation of the private sector.  
17. Enterprise restructuring: How many state-owned, or formerly state-owned, enterprises have been restructured so far? How many enterprises are currently being restructured or envisaged to be restructured? Please identify the remaining sectors and state-owned enterprises in particular need of restructuring. (see also chapter 15 – Industrial Policy) Please give information about annual aggregate profits/loss of state-owned enterprises from 1996 to 2003. 
The restructuring of state-owned enterprises was/is conducted by the Privatisation Agency of the Republic of Macedonia and the Ministry of Economy. The privatisation/restructuring of the largest number of enterprises has been done through the Privatisation Agency: Sector Number of privatized/restructured enterprises  Industry 495 Agriculture 429 Construction 123 Trade 354 Transport and communications 52 Finances and services 116 Handicrafts 55 Tourism 63 Total 1.678 Source: Ministry of Economy

At the beginning of the privatisation process in the Republic of Macedonia there was an intensive debate whether it was necessary to restructure enterprises and if yes, whether this should be done before or after their privatisation. At initial stage, it was considered better to speed up the privatisation and to sell the enterprises as they were, since restructuring was expensive and it was considered that new owner should be left to decide about the direction of restructuring. However, it was soon realized that some of the companies could not be privatised if they had not been previously restructured. This mainly referred to the big loss making enterprises. The idea was to make an effort in the pre-privatisation phase, in order to facilitate the post-privatisation adjustment. As a result of these considerations, the first restructuring programme and the first Restructuring Law of 1995 (no longer in force), were enacted. The World Bank intensively supported the Government in the implementation of the restructuring programmes.   The Law on Restructuring of the Loss Making Enterprises of 1995 referred to the 25 enterprises that generated the largest losses in the country. They produced 13% of the gross domestic product, but also accounted for 80% of the losses in the enterprise sector. They owed 60% of non-performing loans in the banking system and employed 55 thousand persons. Among those were the Electricity Power Company of Macedonia and the public enterprise Macedonian Railways.  Some of the basic provisions of the Restructuring Law covered the following:    isolation of these enterprises from the banking system,     conversion of their debts to the state and to the banks into capital,     reduction of their costs, mainly through the reduction of the number of employees who would get certain assistance from the state for severance payment,    stimulating their fast privatisation - completely or partially, and if some of those parts could not be privatised - then to liquidate them as soon as possible.  As a result of that activity, 160 smaller enterprises were established out of 25, most of which were privatised, about 10 of them were liquidated in the first 2-3 years of the implementation of the Law, and some that could not be then restructured and became subject to later programmes. In 2000, began the second wave of restructuring of so-called loss-making companies, which were included in a special Action Plan of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. This Plan was realised within the process of privatisation/sale or bankruptcy/liquidation - processes defined by the FESAL 2 Arrangement. On the basis of this Arrangement, the Government committed itself to sell/restructure the largest state owned loss-making companies by the end of 2003, at latest. Some of the enterprises were sold to strategic investors, and some were liquidated through bankruptcy procedures and their assets were sold or are still being sold by way of international tenders. This process is performed pursuant to the Bankruptcy Law (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 55/1997, 53/2000, 37/2002 and 17/2004), by enactment of decisions by the creditors board (most often the biggest creditor in these enterprises is the state). In the meantime, pursuant to the existing legislation, the Privatisation Agency of the Republic of Macedonia, cannot manage and decide for the capital of these enterprises in the course of the bankruptcy/liquidation procedure, although it owns the majority shares.   As an integral part of the obligations for the abovementioned Arrangement, the Government has selected 40 largest loss-making companies, which employed 10,4% of the total number of employees in the enterprise sector and generated total losses in amount of USD 95 million in 1999, i.e. about 4,5% of the GDP. In order to meet the FESAL conditions, i.e. to utilize three financial instalments by the Bank, the Government was obliged, by the end of 2003, to find a solution for 30 of the 40 nominated enterprises, in the industry sector, by privatising/selling or liquidating them.    In November 2000 the Government has met the conditions for withdrawal of the first instalment of the Arrangement by selling the enterprise FENI to a foreign investor. In the middle of 2003 the Republic of Macedonia withdrew the second instalment of FESAL 2 by selling other 5 loss-making companies (Jugohrom, Porcelanka, Zletovo Baterii, Goteks and Godel). By the end of 2003 the Government has found adequate solutions for the remaining 25 enterprises thus meeting the condition for the third instalment. The second instalment was fully released at the end of July 2003, and the third instalment was fully released on 06.01.2004.  The strategy applied in order to implement the restructuring of the loss-making companies covered the following activities:   Independent economic and financial analysis (cost-benefit analysis) for determining the most favourable option or whether to privatise or liquidate the company;   Detailed procedure for publishing international tenders, in line with the best international practices, with maximum transparency of the request, identification and qualification of a strategic investor;   Sale of the stocks/shares of the loss-making companies by an international tender and by a maximally transparent procedure;   Sale of the assets of the liquidated companies, on the basis of bankruptcy - without any conditioning of the buyer, except for the payment of the sale and purchase price according to the agreed terms;   Additional engagement of an external consultant that would assist the bankruptcy trustees of the enterprises, in order to ensure a transparent sale of their assets;   Constituting a Coordinative Body of state creditors for the purpose of having common and coordinated position at the bankruptcy hearings in court, and taking control over the bankruptcy procedure, based on the majority state claims in the loss-making companies, using the position of a dominant creditor with a decisive voting right in the Board of Creditors;   Direct and indirect Governmental support for the socially/politically sensitive enterprises;   Restructuring of the state receivables in the loss-making enterprises.  In the last several years, in addition to the process of restructuring of the loss-making companies, the process of restructuring of some other enterprises as a pre-privatisation activity was also initiated. In that sense, the restructuring of the agricultural enterprises acquires special attention. At the beginning of the privatisation, the agricultural enterprises were completely exempted from the process, in order to be treated by special law. In 1996, Law on Transformation of the Enterprises and Cooperatives with Social Capital that Manage Agriculture Land (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 38/1993, 48/1993, 21/1998, 25/1999, 39/1999, 81/1999, 49/2000, 6/2002, 31/2003 and 38/2004) was adopted. Complex agricultural companies, as well as enterprises that had wast portion land on their disposal, were due to restructure before privatisation, i.e. sold on pieces by separate activities they perform. The ratio behind this type of privatisation and restructuring was the need for increasing efficiency and competitiveness (due to better specialisation) by sale of units with simple activities. In addition, 15% of the land managed by the agricultural companies were dispossessed and offered for a free sale to private farmers.  The Government of the Republic of Macedonia has identified the need for restructuring of ESM, PE Macedonian Railways, PE Macedonian Post, PE Macedonian Radio and Television, Public Enteprise for Airport Services, PE for Management of Residential and Business Areas, PE Macedonian Forests and PE Water Management of Macedonia. The restructuring programmes for the largest number of these enterprises are in the process of preparation. The restructuring of ESM (see 30H14_II_B) and PE Macedonian Railways (see 31H09_II_B_1) is already underway.  The total (aggregate) annual profits and losses of the enterprises that are not privately owned, according to their annual statements, are given in the following table: Year Profit Loss 1996  2.259.607.449 14.527.521.028 1997  4.815.739.107 8.969.987.132 1998  3.968.896.837 8.751.633.187 1999  3.098.651.075 8.689.714.749 2000  2.767.082.641 6.906.673.034 2001  2.237.869.624 9.022.980.136 2002  2.785.617.923 9.016.574.827 2003  2.368.938.905 5.923.516.014 Source: Central Registry of the Republic of Macedonia  
18. Please describe the basic features of market entry in the corporate sector (business register, licensing procedures, number of separate administrative procedures, average amount of time for incorporation) and of market exit (bankruptcy procedures)? (see also chapter 15 – Industrial Policy and chapter 16 - SMEs) 
With the Company Law, (CL), enacted on 30.04.2004 (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 28/2004), (see 32H05_Annex_01), new approach in registration of companies has been introduced.

(Optional) Providing special licences (e.g. a licence for technical conditions, a sanitation licence as well as a licence for protection during work and alike) from the competent institutions.  Company Liquidation - Unless a bankruptcy procedure for the company is initiated, after enacting a decision for termination of the company a liquidation procedure is carried out.  Unless the provisions of this Law state something else or the objective of liquidation determines a different approach, until the completion of the liquidation, the provisions of this Law apply to the companies that have not been terminated.

(3) Conditions and procedure for granting rescue and restructuring aid are established by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia.  With the accession of the Republic of Macedonia to the WTO, on 04.04.2003, Macedonia has committed itself to remove, and as of the day of accession not to introduce any subsidies covered by the definition of prohibited subsidies within the meaning of Article 3 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and therefore Republic of Macedonia did not ask for a transition period for abolishment of those measures. Each future subsidies programme would be administered in accordance to the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and notified to the Subsidies and Countervailing Committee, pursuant to Article 35 of the Agreement, for the programmes that need to be notified. (Law on Ratification of the Protocol for Accession of the Republic of Macedonia to the World Trade Organisation (“Official Gazette of RM” No.7/2003). One of the basic objectives in the development documents of the Republic of Macedonia on mid- and long-term basis is the gradual reduction of the state intervention in the market and creating conditions for further improvement of functioning of the market economy. Here, it is anticipated that the role of the state is expressed in prescribing general rules for market behaviour and in the efficient control over the implementation of the prescribed rules of behaviour of the business and other entities.  This role of the state is realised by leading consistent macroeconomic policy and by corrections of the permanent market deviations in line with the measures and criteria applied in the developed market-oriented economies. For the realisation of these objectives it is anticipated that more emphasis is given to the economic (monetary, credit, fiscal, balance of payment and alike) measures of the macroeconomic and development policy, while the administrative measures (prohibitions, licences, quotas, stimulations and alike) should be reduced and brought to minimum frames accepted by the World Trade Organisation and practiced in the developed market economies.  
20. Please indicate what you consider the main priorities in the areas of macroeconomic policy, and structural/microeconomic reform? 

The economic reforms, implemented by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, are directed towards realization of the key macroeconomic objectives: 1.  Increasing the mid-term economic growth rate, mainly through intensification of the structural reforms; 2.  Reducing the rate of unemployment, and to that end, reducing poverty; and   3.  Improving the business climate and acceleration of integration of the Republic of Macedonia in the EU.      (1) The intensification of the economic growth and acceleration of process of EU integration are complementary to the commitments of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia to intensify the structural reforms as a part of the medium-term macroeconomic policy of the country.  The structural reforms are focused on the real sector, the business environment, the judiciary, the labour force market, the public sector, the water management, the pension system, the corporate governance, the transformation and restructuring of certain enterprises in state ownership and the banking sector. Real sector – During the past year, the intensification of the structural reforms resulted in successful completion of the process of privatisation of the loss-making companies where the state was a significant or predominant creditor, and which were covered by the FESAL 2 arrangement, practically meaning a completion of the privatization process. Hence, these enterprises are expected to restart their operations in 2005, thus entailing positive effects on the overall economy.  Reform in the business environment and improvement of the business climate in the country – improvement of the business climate is one of the basic priorities of the Government policy in 2005 and encompasses the following:   Judiciary system reforms – for more details, please see 34HI_D  Labour market reforms – for more detail, please see 35HChapter 13 - Social Policy and Employment  Pension system reforms – for more details, please see 36HII_VI_E_4  Improvement of the business regulation and corporate governance and financial sector management;   Reforms in the public sector and water management - for more details, please see 37HII_V_1538HII_V_16 and 39HII_V_17  Privatization of the state-owned construction land - in 2005, the privatisation processes in this area, i.e. the privatization and other forms of transformation of the state-owned construction land, will be intensified Development of the banking sector – A basic precondition for mobilisation and efficient allocation of the financial resources, for enhancing saving and investment, as well as for creating an optimal interest rate structure is definitely the sound and competitive banking system. Accordingly, modifications and amendments to the Banking Law are envisaged in 2005, that will be aimed at: a/ precise definition and additional regulation of the procedure and the measures towards the banks facing problems in their operations; b/ establishment of a legal basis for market risk regulation and management; c/ elimination of the bank restrictions for investments in financial institutions; d/ increase in the minimal amount of capital required for establishment of a bank to EUR 5 million; and e/ redefinition of the financial activities the banks may perform. In addition, the modifications and amendments to the Banking Law will contribute to the further regulating of the status of the current savings houses, which are to be transformed into savings banks. With respect to the remaining activities, in 2005, the necessity to adopt a regulation on non-banking institutions will be analysed, with a special emphasis on the services to be subject to this regulation, above all, factoring, crediting and cash cards.  With a background of intensifying economic activity, entailing up to 6-7% growth in industrial production, the real GDP growth is expected at 3,8%. According to the projections, these macroeconomic policies would lead to a sustainable economic growth, price stability expressed by a low average annual inflation of from 0,6% up to 1,5%, low deficit of the central government budget at a level of 1% of the GDP, reduction of the consolidated budget deficit, projected up to 2% and continuous reduction of the Balance of Payments (BOP) current account deficit to a level below 5,5%. (2) Within these frameworks, the employment policy, as one of the main pillars of the macroeconomic policy will be focused on establishing mechanisms needed to urgently put an end to the rise of unemployment and to restore the distorted functions of the labour market. The basic elements of the employment policy will be the active measures for promotion of investments and employment, labour market reforms and creation of a climate for greater flexibility and competitiveness. At the same time, activities regarding harmonisation and adjustment of the labour legislation with the EU legislation will continue, with the aim of implementing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement of the Republic of Macedonia, as a condition for accession into the EU. The tripartite dialogue between the representatives of the Trade Union, the Economic Chambers and the Government of the Republic of Macedonia will be a platform for revision and upgrading of the existing labour legislation. In addition to the social agreement concluded with the Association of the Trade Unions of the Republic of Macedonia, the Government will offer an appropriate agreement to the employers, without whose active participation, consent and support, the employment policy, especially the necessary greater flexibility of the labour market would be impossible to achieve. (3) Intensification of the structural and institutional reforms, as well as the creation of favourable business environment, will play a crucial role in the process of integration of Republic of Macedonia into the EU, by attracting more foreign direct investments and expansion of the private sector as a driving force of the development. These objectives will be achieved through various types of measures and specific policies.   Intensive and dynamic international cooperation as a core of the future export-oriented economic development concept - Republic of Macedonia will continue the harmonisation of the trade regulations with the ones of the EU, as well as with further foreign trade liberalisation under the auspices of the WTO. With the objective of successfully competing on the international market, the development concept of the Republic of Macedonia will be based on the improvement of the competitiveness of the business sector. Thus, the basic medium- and long-term objectives of the foreign trade policy of Republic of Macedonia are the following: increase of the share of export in the structure of GDP, improvement of the condition with the balance of payments, stimulation of the inflow of FDI, strengthening the regional economic cooperation, strengthening the existing and creating new competitive advantages based on technological modernization of the economy and on the improvement of the quality of education, governance and management skills.     Further price liberalisation, in parallel with the protection of competition - Fundamental objective of the price policy (price liberalisation) and the protection of competition is the creation of conditions for a proper and efficient allocation of resources. The Government committed itself to establishing transparent regulatory and institutional mechanisms that would enable open and fair competition, including the public service sector. To the end of efficient implementation of the market competition protection policy, the existence of an efficient legal system and appropriate institutional infrastructure is necessary. In this area, the harmonization of the national legislation with the one of the EU is underway.    Full operationalisation of the regulatory framework for supporting the market economy – The private sector in the Republic of Macedonia often faces a number of obstacles, mostly due to certain deficiencies in the legislative and regulatory framework. On the other hand, this requires improvements in the area of the accounting standards and their application, the definition of the tax base, the procedures for registration of enterprises, as well as the development of regulation for security of the claims.    Promotion of human capital – Human capital development in the Republic of Macedonia is focused on enhancing its quality and employment. Lack of management skills is also one of the main problems hindering the faster restructuring of the business sector. Regarding the policy of improvement of human resources and the labour market, among the priority objectives are: stimulation of the job creation, stimulation of the continuous investment in human capital via provision of appropriate network of public and private education, elimination of the remaining institutional inflexibility on the labour market and social protection, greater mobility of labour and reduction of informal sector employment.   Continuation of the business sector reforms (enterprise sector) – The policies in this area will be focused on the structural changes and improvement of the competitiveness of the enterprises and will be closely related to the policy of technological development, entrepreneurship promotion and establishment of new enterprises. The improvement of the investment climate will remain a fundamental objective of the Government, enterprises will also be stimulated to structurally adjust to the variable competitive conditions and to improve their market operations.   Public finance system reform – The reforms in this area refer, above all, to harmonization of the tax and customs regulations and procedures with the EU standards, fiscal decentralization, improvement of the financial sustainability through accountability and transparency as a basis of the budget and tax reforms, further improvement of the treasury system, public administration reform and improvement of the public procurement system.   Continuation of the financial sector reforms – focused on further strengthening of the financial system stability, strengthening of the competition in the sector and improvement of the regulation of and supervision over the financial institutions. At the same time, banking system reforms will be carried out via further strengthening of the banking system stability and security and adjustment towards the international Basel standards and EU directives.   Improvement of infrastructure and institutional arrangements for public utility services – The measures are focused mainly on establishing commercial orientation and management with public enterprises via commercialisation and appropriate price policy based on coverage of total costs, legislation amendments and establishment of independent regulatory bodies and systems for monitoring and evaluation of the effect on the final beneficiaries of the services rendered by the public sector, enhancing market competition and further price liberalisation and increase of domestic and foreign investments in transport, telecommunications and energy.   Stimulation and promotion of local economic development – The main orientation in this area is the achievement of sustainable development of municipalities (local self-government units). With regard to the territorial organisation and building local self-government, the territorial organization was redefined by creating smaller number of units, existing deficiencies in the functioning of municipalities were corrected and conditions were created for enhancing their capacity to create sustainable local economic development by using their own revenues. The new legal solutions establish municipalities that will be capable to perform their functions, to prepare and realize plans for local economic development and to act as partners in the European Structural Funds in the cross-border regional cooperation.   Environmental protection – The main objectives of Macedonia in the area of environmental protection encompass the following: achievement of ecologically sustainable economic development, greater competitiveness and integrative approach towards environmental issues, gradual harmonisation of the national legislation in this area with the EU environmental legislation and active participation in the international efforts for resolving global pollution and environmental degradation, protection of biodiversity and habitats, active involvement in the international systems for environmental protection and sustainable management of natural resources and their protection. 

In 2005, the Macroeconomic policy will continue to focus on:    Maintenance of macroeconomic stability    Stabilization of the budget deficit at a sustainable level (within the Maastricht criteria) and   Creation of favourable environment for interest rates reduction with the aim of stimulating the investment cycle To that end, careful coordination is envisaged of the monetary, fiscal and income policy, focused on achieving fiscal and external sustainability while maintaining low level of inflation. The monetary policy will continue to contribute towards the maintenance of macroeconomic stability by achieving the ultimate goal – price stability. From the aspect of exchange rate policy, in the orientation for integration into the European Union, Republic of Macedonia will follow the path of accepting the commitments for accession into the European Monetary Union. In the next period, the Republic of Macedonia will continue the liberalisation of capital flows in accordance with the time schedule envisaged in the SAA. The EU rules on capital flows will be gradually implemented and the full capital flow liberalisation should be expected by the moment of accession into the EU at the latest. The capital transaction liberalisation process in the Republic of Macedonia was completed when the new Law on Foreign Exchange Operations came into force (“Official Gazette of RM”, No.31/2001, 49/2001, 51/2003), when direct investments became fully liberalised, thus equalising the foreign investors with the domestic ones, i.e. granting them national treatment.  At the same time, full liberalisation was made to all commercial and financial credits (short-term, medium-term and long-term).  
21. How has the sectoral economic structure changed over time (in terms of value added to GDP and employment)? What sectors have been most dynamic in growth and/or job creation?  
The analysis of the sectoral structure of the economy of the Republic of Macedonia for the period between 1997 and 2002, in terms of the share of value added in the GDP and the number of employees, reveals the following dynamics:   During the observed period, according to the National Classification of Activities, the most dynamic development is noted in the Transport, Storage and Communication sector. This development shows an increase of the share from 6,1% in 1997 to 9,3% in 2001, and than decline in 2002 on 8,4%. From the point of view of the share of this sector in terms of the number of employees, during this period, the same tendency may be noted, i.e. an increase from 6,5% on 1997 to 7,3% in 2001, as well as a reduction of 6,7% in 2002;   An increase of the share in the number of employees according to the National Classification of Activities has been noted in the following sectors: Electricity, Gas and Water Supply from 3,1% in 1997 to 3,3% in 2002; Wholesale and Retail Trade, Repair of Motor Vehicles, Motorcycles and Personal and Household Goods from 12,9% in 1997 to 13,9% in 2002; Hotels and Restaurants from 2,6% to 3% in 2002; Financial Intermediation from 1, 1% in 1997 to 1, 4% in 2002; Real Estate, Renting and Business Activities from 2,2% in 1997 to 2,6% in 2002; and Public Administration and Defence, Compulsory Social Security from 6,6% in 1997 to 7,2% in 2002. Typical for these sectors, in the observed period, is that in spite of increasing share in total employees, a reduction in the share of value added in the GDP may be noted;     Although, during the observed period, the Processing Industry, according to National Classification of Activities, features the highest share of value added in the GDP, an annual reverse trend of that share from 18,9% in 1997 to 15,5% in 2002, can be noted. From the point of view of share in total employees, oscillations may be observed during the period from 1997 to 2002, i.e. an increasing trend in 2000, with continuous decrease beginning from 2001. 
22. How has the size of firms developed? Please describe the main impediments to growth and job creation for local companies. )? (see also chapter 16 - SMEs) 
As a result of the economic and ownership restructuring that was mostly implemented through the process of privatization of the companies and the opening of new ones, the Macedonian economy has undergone significant changes. Firstly, the number of companies has rapidly increased, most of which are newly opened small companies. As a result of this process, the small companies now have a dominant share in the structure of the companies. An additional indication of this trend is the continuous reduction in the average number of employees in the companies (this number has been reduced from an average of 215,8 employees per company in 1989, to 8,4 employees in 1997 and 6,8 in 2003).   The number of craftsmen, registered as natural persons was 7.500 persons in 2003, which denotes a high presence of small economic entities in the economic structure of the Republic of Macedonia.  The definition of an active company in the tables that follow is taken from the banking practice (dynamics of inflow/ outflow of funds from the bank account). 
Active companies Year Number of companies Number of employees 1989 2.003 432.400 1997 33.455 283.142 2003 39.199 262.728 Source: According to the data from the Payment Operations Bureau (1989 and 1997) and the Central Registry (2003)

The growth of new companies is not followed by appropriate increase in employment, which is due to the liquidation of numerous companies, especially non-privatsied and loss-making companies.   The main barriers for accelerated development of the new small private economic entities and for development of the entrepreneurship are located in several fields:    Absence of relatively easy access to capital for start-up companies and SME’s, especially due to the rigid banking criteria for granting funds, especially the high demand for collateral (1:2), and, certainly, high interest rates. There are insufficient credit-guarantee funds (only 2, financed by donors and with insufficient amount of funds) especially at the local level, as well as other supporting instruments (programs for establishment of new companies by young and well-educated people, potential women entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs in the rural areas etc.)   The insufficient institutional support in function of the assistance and support of entrepreneurs in all fields of business, providing advice, business information, continuous training, assistance in export, for promotion of quality, technological support etc.

The Government of the Republic of Macedonia adopts and implements a mid-term Public Investment Programme as a continuous planning instrument.  The Public Investment Programme includes investment projects according to the priority needs in the following areas:   Energy  Transport   Water Supply   Irrigation  Environment   Health and Education  The timeframe of the Programme is three years, where the first year is always the fiscal (current) year and the next two years include the assessed or planned needs for funding (expenditures). The Programme is revised every year, considering that the changes must be recorded with respect to the realised public investments as well as with respect to the newly planned activities. The current Public Investment Programme covers the period between 2004 and 2006.

The Programme presents the current situation as well as the planned future activities in transparent manner. 
24. Describe the initiatives taken to enhance the business environment and the results achieved so far. (see also chapter 16 - SMEs) 
In the past several years, many significant initiatives were realized aiming at improvement of the business climate for SMEs. Most of the laws were revised and adopted, by harmonizing the national with EU legislation. Thus, in 2004, a new Company Law was adopted (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 28/2004), regulating the performance of commercial activities by both individuals and legal entities. The Law envisages a framework that significantly increases the transparency in terms of publishing data and documents related to the operations and the financial conditions of the companies. The Law also envisages a higher level of protection of the minority shareholders, as well as a protection of the interests of the creditors and third parties. In addition, the new Law introduces, for the first time, a definition of the micro-enterprises, as a small-scope commercial activity.  In the course of 2004, a new Law on Trade was adopted (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 16/2004), regulating the domestic and foreign trade. The Law is in line with the provisions and requirements deriving from EU and WTO agreements and it introduces the legal basis for promotion and development of modern commercial activities. The Law defines the manners of trading and establishes clear and equal terms and conditions for performing trading activities. The Law enables decentralisation of the commercial activities and their supervision, thereby giving greater competences to the local authorities. In addition, the Law envisages liberalization in terms of issuance of licences for commencing commercial activity. The Law on Establishment of Entrepreneurship Agency was adopted in 2003 (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 60/2003), thereby determining the main task of newly established Agency, as realization of program of measures and activities for support of entrepreneurship and creation of competitiveness among small businesses in RM, as well as implementation of the European Charter for Small Enterprises. The Agency is responsible for coordination and development of a network of institutions for support of the development of the entrepreneurship and the small business, as well as for supporting the application of innovations and introduction of modern technologies in the small businesses. The Agency commenced operating in May 2004. The Law on Leasing, adopted in 2002 (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 4/2002) and its amendments adopted in 2003 (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 49/2003) contain numerous incentives for entrepreneurs and small and medium-size enterprises, and offer opportunities for acquiring and replenishment of production equipment under more flexible terms, without using their own funds and without any security (collateral) instruments. In 2004, the following laws were adopted: Law on Artisanship (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 62/2004), Law on Tourism (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 62/2004) and Law on Catering (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 62/2004), setting the bases, the terms and conditions and the manners of performing the activities related to artisanship, tourism and catering.     The Consumer Protection Law, adopted in 2004 (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 38/2004) envisages a greater consumer protection by imposing an obligation for the producers to provide clear and comprehensive data and information on the products and services, as well as instructions for their use. The Law contains provisions for enhanced supervision and monitoring of the producers’ compliance with the standards prescribed in the legal regulations, and thereby it also envisages strict provisions for initiating legal actions in cases of violation and disrespect of the consumers’ rights. In 2002, the following laws were adopted: Law on Standardization (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 54/2002), Law on Accreditation (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 54/2002), Law on Metrology (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 55/2002) and Law on Stipulating the Technical Requirements for Products and Conformity Assessment (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 54/2002). These laws play an important role for the enterprises and contribute to quality assurance and competitiveness of national products and services. In addition to the amendments and the adoption of legislation on business environment, two additional initiatives were also implemented in the past period. In order foster economic development in Republic of Macedonia, various measures have recently commenced, aiming at attracting foreign investors. Thereby, foreign citizens, intending to register a firm or to invest in Republic of Macedonia, are exempt from paying profit tax during the first three years, as well as from paying value added tax for the (physical) items they invest as initial capital.  These activities are also listed in the FIAS/World Bank Project Report, which also indicates the activities for improvement of the business climate, as well as the assessment of implementation of reforms. In 2003, FIAS prepared a Study of Administrative Barriers to Investments. Both the Government and the private sector accepted the findings and the recommendations in this report. The Report determines five priorities, considered by all institutions in parallel, aimed at creating more favourable investment climate. According to the Study, most urgent reforms are needed in the field of:   Registration of companies;   Labour legislation (working permits);  Access to land;   Construction permits;    Customs administration.  In that sense, in December 2002, the Government established a Steering Committee, as a main inter-ministerial body, including representatives from the private sector. In April 2003, the Ministry of Economy decided to merge the FIAS program with the Investment Compact Action Plan of the Stability Pact for SEE. In August 2003, the Government approved the Programme for Stimulating Investment in Republic of Macedonia, (see 42HII_Annex_05), prepared in cooperation with UNDP Country Office in Macedonia. The Programme for Stimulating Investment in Republic of Macedonia focuses on the afore-mentioned five most urgent priorities, but it has also identified other priorities requiring urgent realization, such as:   Reduction of the corruption, bribe and grey economy (State Anti-Corruption Commission, 2003);   Increase of both the transparency and the consistency of the public administration;   Improvement of the communication with the private sector;   Improvement of the judiciary system;   Improvement of the banking system;   Improvement of corporate governance;   Reduction of labour market rigidities;   Improvement of the Public Revenue Office;   Improvement of the inspection services;   Improvement of competition. A Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Interim team was also established within the Programme, in order to fill in the time gap until the establishment of the Foreign Investment Agency of Republic of Macedonia (FIARM). The Law on Establishment of Foreign Investment Agency, adopted in September 2004 (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 37/2004), regulates the establishment, the organizational structure and the operations of the Agency, the main objective of which is to ensure greater inflow of foreign direct investments, thus fostering economic development. The main competencies of the Agency are development, updating and implementation of investment promotion strategies for the purpose of attracting foreign direct investments, as well as ensuring high-quality professional services to investors in the process of pre-investment, investment and re-investment.  In that context, Euro Info Correspondent Centre commenced its operations in mid-2004. With respect to the initiatives in the area of export promotion, increasing attention is paid to the realization of the following objectives:    Promotion of Macedonian products in the country and abroad through marketing and promotional campaigns, participation at fairs, etc.;   Transfer of experience from other countries to the Republic of Macedonia (through business meetings, forums, etc.);   Opening of Macedonian Economic Offices in other countries, within the embassies, with the goal of promoting Macedonian products and attracting foreign direct investments;   Implementation of the initiative via MCA – Macedonian Competitiveness Activity. The Government supports the application of fiscal and the financial incentives when attracting FDIs.  Although the existing incentives are attractive, the Government resumes activities for improvement of economic environment and harmonising the business climate with modern economies’. All these activities should lead to a greater competitiveness of the Macedonian products outside the country, increased export, consistent application of the standards on quality, and reduction of unemployment and the grey economy.

b) The European Union, traditionally, is the most important foreign trade partner of Republic of Macedonia, with share in the total foreign trade in the period 1996 – 2003 ranged between 37,4% and 47,8%. Thereby, the share of the export to the EU countries ranged between 42,8% and 54,7%, and the import from EU was between 38,2% and 44,9%.  Analysed data point out to the fact that the share of EU in the total foreign trade of the Republic of Macedonia in the period 1996 - 2003 was stable. By EU member states, the most important trade partners of the Republic of Macedonia are: Germany, Greece, Italy, France, the Netherlands and Great Britain.   In the period 1999 - 2003, foreign trade realized between the Republic of Macedonia and the EU was as follows:

EU 17,2 25,4 30,3 18,5 20,7 Source: Ministry of Economy In the period 2000 - 2004, products most frequently traded between the Republic of Macedonia and the EU were the following: goods for production of textile products, textile products, Ferro-nickel, Ferro-silicon, non-alloyed zinc, hot-rolled and flat-rolled products made of iron or non-alloyed zinc, electrical conductors, welded pipes, raw and non-processed tobacco, wine, motor vehicles, oil and oil products, gas, etc. The following products are most important, i.e. most frequent in the import from the EU to the Republic of Macedonia: goods for production of textile products and footwear, motor vehicles, oil and oil products, oil liquid gases, transmitters with embedded receiver, etc. With respect to the export from Macedonia to the EU, traditionally, the most exported products are the following: textile products (46,4%), Ferro-nickel (3,7%), Ferro-silicon (1,9%), non-alloyed zinc (3,3%), hot-rolled and flat-rolled products made of iron or non-alloyed zinc (15,1%), electric conductors (2,03%), welded pipes (1,14%), raw tobacco (2,8%), wine (2,5%) and lamb (1,6%). The Republic of Macedonia and the EU concluded Interim Agreement on Trade and Trade-Related Matters in April 2001, applied as of 01.06.2001. The Interim Agreement is an integral part of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the European Union. Thus, the Interim Agreement enabled for the overall Macedonian export of industrial and agricultural products (excluding three: beef, fish and wine, within annual quotas) to be customs- and customs duties-exempt on the markets of the EU member states. Customs-free treatment of Macedonian products commenced on 01.06.2001, when the Interim Agreement entered into force. Import of industrial and agricultural products from the EU is regulated under special annexes and protocols, for which reduced customs rate compared to basic is applied, with transition period of 10 years. There is gradual reduction of the customs rate only for steel products during a transition period of 5 years. Such preferential treatment for import from EU imports started applying as of 01.06.2002 (six months later than for exports) and would be terminated by 31.12.2010. As of 01.01.2011, the overall industrial sector and over 75% of the agricultural sector products import from EU would be customs-free.   The Stabilisation and Association Agreement came into force on 01.04.2004. The increase of foreign trade with EU, expressed in percentage, with 2001 by 5,2% higher than 2000, 2002 by 2% higher than 2001 and 2003 by 0.7% higher than 2002, only confirms the fact that customs-free trading or trading under reduced customs rate is the basic condition for intensification of mutual cooperation. In that line, 2,7% increase in 2003 compared to 2001 (when Interim Agreement began implementing) speaks in favour of aforementioned conclusion. Having in mind the previous, a conclusion can be reached that trade of the Republic of Macedonia is mainly oriented towards the European market. The percentage of share of the trade of the Republic of Macedonia with the EU in the total foreign trade in 2000 was 39,9%, with 45,1% in 2001, 47,1% in 2002, 47,8% in 2003 and 38,4% in the first eight months of 2004.  Macedonian export in 2001, being the initial year of application of the Interim Agreement, slightly increased by 1,1%, while import from the EU dropped by 10,4% compared to 2000. In fact, Macedonian export significantly increased in the second half of 2001, i.e. after 01.06.2001, by 8% (US$ 294.883.000) compared to the first half of 2001 (US$ 271.610.000), when the export was carried out under the treatment of most-favoured nation. Compared to the second half of 2000 (US$ 281.978.000), Macedonian export increased by 4.6% only in the second half of 2001 (US$ 294.883.000). On the other hand, Macedonian export in the first half of 2001 (US$ 271.610.000), prior to the application of the Interim Agreement, declined by 4,3% compared to the first half of 2000 (US$ 283.670.000). Foreign trade in 2002 (US$ 1.465.117.000), when the EU countries started applying the preferential treatment when importing to the Republic of Macedonia, increased by 13,9% compared to 2001 (US$ 1.286.066.000), whereby the import from the EU only in 2002 (US$ 894.887.000) increased by 24,7% compared to 2001 (US$ 717.573.000). In 2003, there was a significant increase in the Macedonian export to and import from the EU by 19,5%, whereby the export increased by 30,7% compared to the one in 2002, and the import increased by 12,4% compared to the one in 2002.   Export of Macedonian products in the EU member states in 2003, compared to the export in 1994, increased twice (index 204), an indicator pointing out to the strategic orientation of the Macedonian exporters towards the EU market. What significantly influenced such export trend and the favourable climate for foreign trade with the EU is the concluded 1997 Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Macedonia, Transport Agreement and other Agreements in the field of textile, steel industry, and the Interim Agreement on Trade and Trade-Related Matters, i.e. the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. Major trading partners of the Republic of Macedonia from the EU member states in 2003/2002 were Germany with 41,7%, Greece with 26,9%, Italy with 14,35% and the Netherlands with 7,01%.

c)  
Relatively low growth of the export of goods in recent years is a result of the restructuring process of the national economy, followed by the decline in the economic activity (the production), as well as the inherited low labour productivity and obsolete technology, leading to high costs per unit of production output. By completing the economic reforms and promoting the economic sector where the country has comparative advantages, in a situation of existing legal mechanisms for foreign trade alleviation (free trade), in 2005 already, more significant positive movements in the export are expected. d) Data on this sub-item is presented in the following tables: d1) Export and import of comodities:147/201 Table

26. Please indicate the changes in labour productivity in economic sectors and provide indicators of international competitiveness (changes in relative unit labour costs, level and changes in average gross earnings, etc.).  
The productivity and the competitivness of the Macedonian economy are strongly influenced by external shocks. The inflexibility of the regulation in the field of labour force also influences the slow adjustment of the companies to the changes in the market conditions. The reduced market demand imediately results with reduced labour productivity and increased costs for the labour force per product unit, which has a strong negative influence on the competitivness and profitabiltiy of the Macedonian companies. This was especially obvious in 2001. However, in the past 6 years (1997-2002) a mild improvement of the competitivness has been noted. The best results were shown by the so called "non-tradable" sectors, i.e. market services. The processing industry, which is the biggest exporter, has an insiginficant competitiveness improval, mailny as a result of the closure or sale of the bigest loss-making companies in the six-year period.

27. What are in your view the particular challenges/priorities for economic policy faced by the Republic of Macedonia in the coming years and how do you intend to tackle them?  
In the past period, as a result of the succesful implementation of the Stabilisation Programme, Republic of Macedonia has achieved substantial results in the filed of macroeconomic balance and stability. After the high, three-digit inflation rates in the years after the independence, a drastic reduction has been made, and the inflation has been reduced and maintained at a one-digit level, i.e. at the level of the countries with developed market economy. The country’s’ gross domestic product, as one of the basic economic indicators, shows a small, but continuous growth (with the exception of 2001- the period of internal crisis), after which the economic flows were stabilised and dynamised. Simultaneously, the commitment of maintaining price stability determined firm dedication to implement disciplined fiscal policy, achieving positive results in practice (reduction of the budget deficit of 13,6% of GDP in 1993 to 1,1% in 2003). The results in the field of macroeconomic stability are even more significant having in mind that their realisation and maintainance happened under conditions of strong external shocks (trade blockade at the beginning of the 90-ties, the Kosovo crisis in 1999 and the distorted political and security situation in 2001).  In the forthcoming period, the determination for maintaining macroeconomic stability remains, this time with even stronger emphasis on the development component in direction of realising more dynamic growth of the Macedonian economy. In the next phase, which has already started, the state would complete the key structural and institutional reforms that would provide strengthening of the economic stability, improvement of the business climate, employment growth and sustainable economic development. The macroeconomic stability and equilibrium of the Macedonian economy, as one of the basic conditions for providing sustainable development on a permanent basis, is a key priority and strong determination of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia.  For that purpose, Republic of Macedonia has prepared a mid-term economic strategy directed towards the preparation of a consistent set of measures focused on maintaining the macroeconomic stability in the Republic of Macedonia, at the same time creating conditions for sustainable economic growth and increase in employment. The same measures have been included in the Economic and Social part of the National Strategy for European Integration of the Republic of Macedonia, based on four main and mutually dependent components, which are supplemented by a number of structural reforms for support.  The four components representing the base of the strategy are as follows:    maintaining the macroeconomic stability;   creating conditions for accelerating the economic growth and employment growth;   providing adequate, but targeted social protection with the purpose of reducing the social consequences of the transition; and    improving the implementation of the formally established regulatory and institutional framework, i.e. a reduction of the implementation gap.  Having in mind the given challenges, Republic of Macedonia in the future period would focus on consistent implementation of the following reform steps:  
Judiciary Reform – The Government has already initiated amendments in the process laws (in Assembly procedure) and amendments of the execution procedure as a response to the numerous cases in effect that are not processed in the courts. It is expected that these amendments would help in overcoming the problems related to the speed, promptness and inefficiency of the court procedure, which would strengthen the exercise of the rights (claims) of the citizens and the legal entities. With the new Law on Execution, complete transformation of the court decisions’ execution system would be done by separating the execution function from the courts.  
Public Administration Reform – See detail description in Chapter I – Political Criteria. 
Economic Reforms – The essence of the economic reforms implemented by the Republic of Macedonia is the principle of creating a market oriented economy by gradual reduction of the role of the state and inclusion of all economic participants in the creation of a stable economic environment. The process of approximation of the national legislation to the Acquis, as well as the implementation of the SAA were an obligation for introduction of the economic reforms in several areas. Among the recently enacted laws, we would point out the following:    The Company Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 28/2004)- which simplifies the procedure for entry of new companies on the market    The Law on Trade (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 16/2004), consistent legal frame that provides bigger transparency, security and discipline in the turnover of goods and the provision of services;     The Consumer Protection Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 38/2004) ;   Programme for  Support of the Entrepreneurship and the Creation of Competitiveness in the economy of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 12/2004);   The Law on Catering (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 62/2004), The Law on Tourusim (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 62/20004), Law on Crafts (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 62/2004). Republic of Macedonia will continue with the harmonisation of the trade regulations with the EU standards in accordance to the SAA (see below), as well as with the further liberalisation of the foreign trade under WTO asupices. The Republic of Macedonia has applied for membership in CEFTA-Central Europe Free Trade Association and would enhance its trade cooperation with the other partners (EFTA). The Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU would enable an increased flow of goods and services by reducing the tariffs and other trade barriers.  
Employment Policy – The National Action Plan for Employment of the Republic of Macedonia for the period 2004-2005 has been prepared in accordance to the employment directions of the EU Employment Strategy and has been adjusted to the conditions and the specific features of the labour market in the country. This Plan takes into consideration the wider social, economic and other factors that influence the employment sphere and define the shape of the national employment policy. The National Action Plan includes specific measures directed to increase employment and dealing with the disharmony of the labour force and the social exclusion, as well as the specific preconditions and the time table for implementation. The active policies of the labour market promoted by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia would, among else, concentrate on three types of measures:     Support in providing jobs (information, mediation and counseling);    Organising training programmes (qualification and pre-qualification), and    Creating conditions and support for direct creation of new jobs.  
National Programme for Restructuring of the Steel Industry of the Republic of Macedonia – Pursuant to Article 23 of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia of April 2001, i.e. Article 10 of the Interim Agreement on Trade and Trade Issues between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia, and on the basis of the provisions of Protocol 2 for Iron and Steel Products, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia has accepted the obligation for preparation of a National Programme for Restructuring the Industry for Steel Production. For the preparation of the National Programme, funds from CARDS 2001 Programme were used, as a support to a specific sector within the preparation of the National Plan for Economic Development.   
Small and Medium-Size Enterprises  – Respecting the provisions of the European Charter for Small Enterprises, the recommendations of the “Lisbon Strategy” and the findings of the “best practices” of certain examples in the EU member states, the key elements of this policy in Macedonia are as follows:   Building an institutional infrastructure for promotion of the entrepreneurship and competitiveness;    Establishing favorable economic environment in accordance with the achieved level of economic development;   Entrepreneurship promotion through non-financial forms of support;    Financial reforms for entrepreurship support (the implementation of this policy is entrusted to the newly established Agency for Promotion of Enterpreneurship of  the Republic of Macedonia).  In the same direction, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia has adopted a Programme of Measures and Activities for Entrepreneurship Support and Creating Competitiveness of the small and medium-sized businesses in the Republic of Macedonia. The Programme is valid for a period of four years and it realises the acceptance of the principles determined in the European Charter. An Agency for Promotion of Enterpreneurship of the Republic of Macedonia has been established and the realisation of projects determined in the Programme is underway, part of which is financed by the European Union.  By 2006, the mid-term activities and measures would be directed to:   Strengthening the capacity of institutions;     Designing Specific Programs for SMEs support and increasing the efficiency of the foreign and domestic funds;   Establishing a SMEs Observatory within the Agency for Promotion of Enterpreneurship of  the Republic of Macedonia .  The following measures and activities have been stipulated as mid-term priorities for improving the SMEs access to funds and non-financial services.   Establishment of a Guarantee Fund;   Establishment of an Association of Banks;   Establishment of a Credit Rating Agency (Credit Bureau);    Establishment of a Venture Capital Fund;    Providing long-term credit lines and establishment of technology parks. Priority objectives for Macedonia in the field of policy for promotion of the human resources and labour force market are as follows:    Stimulating the creation of new jobs;    Stimulating constant investment in human capital by providing adequate network for public and private education;    Removal of the remnant institutional inflexibility of the labour force market and the social protection;    Increase of the mobility of the labour force;    Reduction of the employment in the informal sector.  The reform policies directed towards the reduction of the interest rates, as well as the measures for stimulating the growth of the domestic savings compose the primary dimension of the investment stimulation efforts. An integral part of this policy is the promotion of the Republic of Macedonia as a favorable place for foreign direct investments. The basic activities of this policy are defined in the Programme for Stimulating Investments in the Republic of Macedonia.  
Fiscal Reforms - The reforms in the field of public consumption in future would be directed toward the creation of conditions for reduction and change of the structure of the overall budget consumption, promotion of the planning process and increasing the efficiency, transparency and accountability in using the public resources. Additionally, with respect to the public revenues, a Strategy for Development of the State Securities Market has been prepared. The basic objective of this Strategy is directed to the development of the primary and secondary securities’ market that would enable more efficient financing of the budget needs in the short term (free current financing of the public expenditures) and in the long term (providing long-term financial resources for support of the economic development).  
Fiscal Decentralisation - A special place is given to the realisation of the obligations from the Framework Agreement, which contains elements of the Agenda of the reform processes in the fiscal area. Within those frames the Government is dedicated to realise a more efficient local economic development through administrative and fiscal decentralisation, by which the local units would be provided with the necessary funds for realising their new functions and competencies.    IT Development - A general objective would be the preparation of the society in general for the digital era, as well as for attracting investments in this field. The IT sector in the Republic of Macedonia is one of the four industrial clusters that would obtain special support within the Macedonian Project for Increasing of Competitiveness. The IT Committee will prepare the National Strategy of the Republic of Macedonia for development of the information technology and harmonisation of the policy and the legislation in the IT field  in accordance to the EU. A project called “e-Government” is under preparation, directed to the implementation of the information technology in the work of the Government.  According to the projections, in the future period it is expected that the planned macroeconomic policies would contribute to the realisation of a sustainable development at the level of 4% to 5% annually, stable inflation of about 2,5% at annual level, low budget deficit of the central government at a level lower than 1% of the GDP and even lower level of deficit on the  current account of the balance of payment of 0,8% of GDP. The projected trends of the main macro-economic indicators should also contribute to a gradual reduction of the bank interest rates, which continue to be a burden for the business sector.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A new round of political negotiations on crucial police reforms ended in Sarajevo without progress on Wednesday (March 14th). Afterwards, Bosnian Serb and Bosniak leaders blamed each other for the stalemate. Principal Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian, who mediated the talks, said it had been BiH's last opportunity to fulfil one of the main conditions for sealing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU this year. 
In Strasbourg on Wednesday, the European Parliament (EP) adopted a report on BiH, drafted by the chairwoman of the EP delegation for Southeast Europe, Doris Pack. It urged the new BiH authorities to ensure immediate progress in implementing set reforms. (Dnevni avaz, Nezavisne novine - 15/03/07; RTRS, Fena - 14/03/07)

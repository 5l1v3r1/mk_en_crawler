TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha pledged on Sunday (October 26th) to guarantee judicial independence, which he says would remain the government's main principle. For the past few weeks, Berisha has been under domestic and international scrutiny for allegedly interfering with the work of prosecutors in a series of controversial cases. The fiercest criticism targeted the government's decision to probe the legality of an investigation of Bosnian businessman Damir Fazlic. He allegedly conducted illegal financial activity and had improper business relations with government officials, including Berisha. (Koha Jone, Panorama - 27/10/08; Vizion +, Alsat - 26/10/08)

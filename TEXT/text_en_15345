BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn signaled on Wednesday (26 April) that Bulgaria and Romania are on track to join the EU on 1 January 2007. Rehn said his goal was to see both countries complete their accession process by then. He praised Bucharest for its all-out campaign against corruption at senior levels of government. The commissioner was critical of Bulgaria's efforts, however, saying very few investigations have been launched against organised crime or corrupt officials. The European Commission is due to assess the two countries' progress in a special report next month. (BNR, Darik, Nine o'clock - 27/04/06; BBC - 26/04/06)

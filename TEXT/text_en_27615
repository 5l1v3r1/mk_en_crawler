ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Sunday (May 23rd) he supports a uranium swap proposal that Iran intends to submit to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Monday. Davutoglu met separately with Iranian counterpart Manouchehr Mottaki and with IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano on the sidelines of a UN conference in Istanbul. Iran signed the nuclear swap deal on May 17th after three days of mediation involving Turkey and Brazil. Under the deal, Iran will send 1,200kg of low-enriched uranium to Turkey, in exchange for 120kg of more highly-enriched uranium within a year. Turkey has been a long-time mediator between the West and Iran, insisting on diplomacy instead of sanctions. (Zaman - 24/05/10; Xinhua - 23/05/10)

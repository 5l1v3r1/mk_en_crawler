ZAGREB, Croatia -- Well over 20,000 people gathered in downtown Zagreb on Saturday (April 12th) to demand higher salaries in both the public and the private sectors. The demonstration was organised by five local trade unions. "Croatia is currently divided into two casts -- one of them very rich and privileged, and ours," the chairman of the Independent Croatian Unions, Kresimir Sever told the crowd. "We want a Croatia where everyone can live a dignified life." 
Speakers said that while the income of the average worker in Croatia is 26% of the EU average, prices in Croatia represent 70% of those in the EU. National radio reports estimated the crowd at 50, 000, significantly more rather than the 20,000 estimated by police. (AFP, HRT, Vecernji List, Jutarnji List, DPA, Javno.com - 12/04/08)

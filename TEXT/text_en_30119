ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou is criticising debt rating companies for their "unacceptable logic" amid repeated downgrades of the standings of Europe's weak economies over the past week. "Because of the crisis in the eurozone, we have a barrage from rating houses who downgrade countries or place them on negative watch," Papandreou told a cabinet meeting Monday (December 20th). "This is an unacceptable logic on their part," he added. In recent months, a series of leading rating agencies such as Moody's, Fitch and Standard and Poor's, have downgraded Greece's ratings, making it impossible to raise fresh money on the open market. Last week, Moody's warned it may further cut Athens' sovereign debt rating. (AFP, ANA-MPA - 21/12/10)

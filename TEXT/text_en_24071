BERLIN, Germany -- Turkey is not ready to make any concessions in its EU membership negotiations, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Tuesday (June 16th), after talks with his German counterpart Frank-Walter Steinmeier in Berlin. "Our goal is full membership. Turkey is not considering another alternative," he told a joint press conference after the meeting. The two ministers also discussed ways to strengthen bilateral ties and plans to establish a German-Turkish University in Istanbul. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy recently rejected the idea of full membership for Turkey and instead called for a "privileged partnership".

ATHENS, Greece -- The government signed an agreement with Russia on Wednesday (December 26th) to buy several multi-purpose amphibian B-200 aircraft. Details of the deal and its exact value are sketchy, though between seven and 14 planes are involved. The B-200 is the largest amphibian aircraft in the world. It is used to extinguish fires, provide aid in emergency situations, search for people missing at sea, and patrol territorial waters. (ITAR-TASS, Makfax, RIA Novosti - 26/12/07)

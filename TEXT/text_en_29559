BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian Radical Party (SRS) leader Vojislav Seselj, who is on trial at The Hague war crimes tribunal, plans to attend a status conference at the court Tuesday (November 2nd) after undergoing minor heart surgery. Zoran Krasic, his legal adviser, says the surgery took place on Thursday. Seselj is charged with war crimes committed against non-Serbs in Croatia, Vojvodina and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 1993. His trial began in November 2007.

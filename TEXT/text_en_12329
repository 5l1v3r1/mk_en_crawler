BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbia-Montenegro European Integration Council met on Friday (10 December) to discuss several issues; chief among them was co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. President Svetozar Marovic said the council concluded full co-operation must begin as soon as possible, to advance towards eventual EU accession. He added that if the country fails to meet its obligations, it would spell defeat for the European integration policy. Meanwhile, the head of the OSCE Mission to Serbia-Montenegro, Maurizio Massari, says the country is at a crossroads regarding its European future. He urged authorities to take quick and decisive steps towards full co-operation with The Hague. (Tanjug, B92 - 10/12/04)

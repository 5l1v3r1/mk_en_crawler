SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government on Wednesday (May 5th) approved a revised 2010 budget law that leaves the standard Value Added Tax (VAT) rate at its current level of 20%, rather than raising it. However, the cabinet expects additional revenues of up to 250m euros by the end of the year, from excise tax proceeds. In addition, the interior ministry, as well as the national security, customs and income agencies, are expected to boost efforts to improve tax collection. Finance Minister Simeon Dyankov says the revision will not change the country's structural deficit, which stands at 1.75% of GDP. (Standart, Darik, Mediapool - 05/05/10)

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Former Serbian state security chief Jovica Stanisic failed to attend the start of his trial at the UN war crimes tribunal Monday (March 17th) due to health issues. Stanisic, who suffers chronic digestive problems, is being examined by doctors at The Hague. The court postponed the beginning of the trial and will consult with prosecutors and the defence before deciding how to proceed, as Stanisic reportedly has refused to give up his right to attend the hearing. A close ally of the late Slobodan Milosevic, Stanisic and his former deputy, Frank Simatovic, are charged with murder, forced deportation and inhuman acts. They allegedly organised and ran secret militia units, notorious for their violent campaigns against non-Serb populations. (Beta, B92, RTRS, Fena - 17/03/08)

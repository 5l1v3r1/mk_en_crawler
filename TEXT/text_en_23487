SOFIA , Bulgaria -- Former Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku will remain in custody for 72 hours, Bulgarian authorities said on Wednesday (June 24th). The leader of the Social Democrat Party was detained Tuesday by Bulgarian police at a border crossing with Macedonia, based on an international arrest warrant issued by Serbia. Belgrade accuses him of involvement in crimes against Serb civilians during the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict. Prosecutors in Sofia did not rule out the possibility of Ceku's extradition to Serbia, following a request from Belgrade. (Zeri, Koha Ditore, Kosova Sot, Express - 25/06/09; B92 - 24/06/09)

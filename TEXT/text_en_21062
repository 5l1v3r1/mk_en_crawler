SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Leaders of the second largest Bosniak party, the Party of Democratic Action, and of the main Croatian party, the Croatian Democratic Union BiH, rejected the police-reform agreement signed last week by Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik and BiH Bosniak presidency member Haris Silajdzic. Sulejman Tihic and Dragan Covic met on Tuesday (October 2nd) to discuss the draft. They told reporters that neither the content of the document nor the way it was presented to the public and to other parliamentary parties was acceptable. The two politicians also reiterated their support for the proposal tabled by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak. 
In a speech to the Federation of BiH parliament Tuesday, Lajcak urged leaders to maintain the momentum on police reform, saying October 15th is the last deadline he can offer. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 03/10/07; RTRS, NTV Hayat, Fena - 02/10/07)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko extended on Monday (December 14th) the mandates of foreign judges and prosecutors at BiH's State Court, despite firm opposition from Bosnian Serbs. According to Inzko's decision, this judiciary will continue handling war crimes cases for three more years, until December 31st 2012. The international staff's mandate was set to expire at the end of this month. Inzko's decision is unpopular in Republika Srpska (RS). Prime Minister Milorad Dodik says his government will not accept it and will ask the RS parliament to hold a special session on the matter. Bosnian Serb authorities bristle whenever Inzko resorts to his Bonn powers.
Also on Monday, Inzko changed rules to allow the Mostar city council to elect a mayor via a simple majority, rather than a two-thirds majority. The inability to reach the higher threshold has kept the mayoral post vacant for more than 14 months. (Dnevni Avaz, Fena, Srna, Onasa, RTRS, Pincom.info, OHR - 14/12/09)

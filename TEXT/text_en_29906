PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The second round of talks between Pristina and Belgrade is taking place on Monday (March 28th) in Brussels. Discussions are expected to focus on energy issues and vehicle registration plates. The head of the Kosovo delegation, Edita Tahiri, said on Sunday that she is committed to finding solutions to those issues and denied there will be open political issues during the talks 
On a separate matter, the head of the Serbian delegation, Borislav Stefanovic, said that Serbia cannot give up originals of the Kosovo population registries, as this would imply giving up sovereignty over Kosovo. The registries were taken to Serbia after the war. (Zeri, Koha Ditore, Lajm - 28/03/11; KTV, TV21, RTK - 27/03/11)

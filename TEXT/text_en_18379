SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament voted on Wednesday (February 14th) to restrict the expatriate vote in the upcoming election for members of the European Parliament. The house voted to allow only people who have lived in Bulgaria or any other EU country for the last three months to participate in the election. This hurts the largely ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms, which relies heavily on the votes of Bulgarian Turks who left during the 1980s, while retaining their Bulgarian citizenships. Party members walked out during the vote and said they might challenge the law before the Constitutional Court. 
In other news Wednesday, more than 2,500 people gathered in front of the National Assembly in Sofia to protest a new tax on home-distilled brandy. It was imposed under EU rules. (Dnevnik, Sega, Monitor - 15/02/07; AP, AFP, BNR, BNT, bTV, Mediapool, Darik - 14/02/07)

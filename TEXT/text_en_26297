SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government confirmed on Friday (December 11th) its dedication to three big energy projects in co-operation with Russia -- the second nuclear plant at Belene, the Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline, and the South Stream natural gas pipeline. The announcement was made after a bilateral meeting on economic co-operation. The situation around the Burgas-Alexandroupolis project has been especially controversial recently, after the cabinet decided to conduct an environmental impact study in the region which will delay the project by up to 18 months. However, Economy and Energy Minister Traycho Traykov stressed that the projects will continue to receive the government's support only if their economic worth and environmental safety are proven.

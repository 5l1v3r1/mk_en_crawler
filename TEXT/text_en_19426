SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska's (RS) parliament adopted a measure Tuesday (October 30th) to revise the so-called Bonn powers of the international community's high representative, which allow him to enact laws, impose penalties and dismiss politicians. The proposal will be forwarded to the BiH parliament as well as to the Peace Implementation Council, whose steering board's session is under way in Sarajevo. 
The move was in response to a series of measures imposed recently by Miroslav Lajcak, the current high representative for BiH, aimed at speeding up the decision-making process in the central government and parliament. They remove the need for a quorum to vote, in light of routine walkouts aimed at blocking the adoption of various laws. Lajcak insist his moves are constitutional.
In other news, the US, Britain, France, Germany and Italy sent a diplomatic protest note to the Serbian government regarding recent comments about Lajcak and his measures. Last week, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica criticised the OHR's move, insisting that protecting the rights of Serbs in both BiH and Kosovo is a national priority.

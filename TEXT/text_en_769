Actor Richard Gere arrived on 9 September in Sarajevo prior to the start of shooting for a new movie on Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic. Upon arrival at Sarajevo Airport, Gere said his visit would be an opportunity to learn about Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). The 57-year-old actor will play a reporter who sets out on an unauthorised mission to capture Karadzic. Gere refused to disclose whether the film ends with Karadzic's capture. Most of the film will be shot in BiH, though a small part will be filmed in Croatia.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Justice Ministry spokeswoman Ubavka Matevska said Thursday (16 June) that UN war crimes chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte was told back in April that Macedonia is prepared to handle four cases stemming from the 2001 interethnic conflict. The comment was in response to one by del Ponte, who said she is under the impression Skopje doesn't want the cases. They involve the closure of Lipko dam, a mass grave in Neprosteno, assaults against construction workers and a case against leaders of the now disbanded National Liberation Army.

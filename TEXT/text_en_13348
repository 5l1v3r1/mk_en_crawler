THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal agreed on Thursday (22 September) to consolidate the cases of nine Bosnian Serbs into a single trial. Five of the defendants are charged with genocide, three with war crimes and one is still at large. Prosecutors asked for the consolidation to save time and spare witnesses from providing repeated testimony. All the charges stem from crimes committed against Muslims in Srebrenica and Zepa. The trial is not expected to start before 2006, as the tribunal must address a number of technical issues, one of which is to find a room big enough to accommodate so many defence teams.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Tests conducted by a British laboratory have established that three ducks found dead in Romania last week carried the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu virus, which has killed more than 60 people in Asia. The same strain was discovered in Turkey several days earlier. Romanian authorities say they have intensified steps aimed at halting the spread of the virus, including quarantines of the affected areas, culling of birds, a vaccination programme, and halting of hunting and fairs.
Turkish officials, meanwhile, reported that nine people placed under quarantine because of their exposure to infected birds showed no sign of infection and have now been allowed to go home. There have been no reports of humans getting the deadly disease in either Romania or Turkey.

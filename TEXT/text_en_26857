BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Constitutional Court has issued a ruling in a controversial case on amendments to election legislation. The decision forces parliament to make the necessary changes by 2012, in time for the next regular general elections, local media reported on Monday (February 8th). The current system suggests a quasi majority vote, which in effect is diluted by a nationwide electoral threshold of 5% along with a requirement to attract 50% of the vote in single-seat constituencies in a single round. Under the present system, seats left vacant are redistributed among parties above the threshold through a proportional distribution. This has led to extreme cases such as lawmakers being elected with only a few hundred votes and placing third or fourth in balloting. The Constitutional Court insists on removing two major provisions -- the 5% threshold and the redistribution of vacant seats through a proportional rule. President Traian Basescu of the Liberal Democratic Party strongly supports the changes. (Evenimentul Zilei, Ziare - 08/02/10)

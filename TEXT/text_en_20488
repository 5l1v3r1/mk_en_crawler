SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Deputy Foreign Minister Gergana Grancharova says Bulgaria will not prevent Montenegro from signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU on Monday (October 15th), now that a compromise has been reached over the spelling of "euro" in the document. Kalfin and EU representatives agreed to use the international banking abbreviation (EUR) in the Bulgarian version of the agreement instead of "euro". 
Bulgaria had initially insisted that "evro" appear in its copy, in a bid to standarise official use of the Cyrillic alphabet. (BNR, RTRS, SRNA, RTCG, Vijesti, B92 - 13/10/07; Tanjug, Makfax, A1 - 12/10/07)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia will abolish the current visa regime for Serbia when Belgrade returns the Croatian registers of births, marriages and deaths, said Croatian Justice Minister Ingrid Anticevic Marinovic on Monday (2 June) after a meeting with her Serbian counterpart, Vladan Batic, in Zagreb. The Croatian registers were seized during the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Batic said there should be no problem with returning the documentation to Croatia. Serbia-Montenegro's Council of Ministers removed visa requirements for EU member countries and neighbouring countries -- including Croatia -- and Belgrade expects corresponding action. During the visit, the two ministers reached an agreement on revising the interstate accords for legal assistance in civil and criminal issues. (HINA, RTS TV - 02/06/03)

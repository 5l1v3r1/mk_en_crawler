BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia on Wednesday (November 7th) -- completing the first step towards full membership in the EU. Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn travelled to Belgrade for the ceremony. He said the official signing would take place next year, if Serbia demonstrates full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. "This marks a real turning point for Serbia. Now Serbia has to go the last mile and achieve full co-operation," he said referring to a requirement that Belgrade hand over Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic and several other war crimes fugitives.
The NGO Human Rights Watch criticised the EU decision, saying the Union is "rewarding Serbia even as it harbours a general accused of genocide". (Blic, Danas - 07/11/07; Reuters, AP, AFP, BBC, DPA, UPI, Tanjug, Beta, RTS, B92, HRW press release - 06/11/07)

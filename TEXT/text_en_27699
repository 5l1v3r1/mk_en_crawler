 SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Agents investigating financial crimes, accompanied by police officers, inspected the financial records of six companies registered at the same address as the private A1 TV channel. Thursday (November 25th). The audit was conducted as part of a fraud investigation. A1 TV says the massive police presence outside the building prevented its journalists from entering and doing their jobs. A1 says the raid was politically motivated. Opposition parties have condemned the raid and the Broadcast agency is holding an emergency meeting on the incident. The interior ministry says it will launch an internal investigation to see whether police officers overstepped their authority. A1 reported on Friday that EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele and EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton have voiced concern over the incident, reiterating that freedom of expression is essential in a functioning democracy.

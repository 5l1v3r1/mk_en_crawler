BELGRADE, Serbia -- Florence Hartmann, former spokesperson of The Hague war crimes tribunal, said on Saturday (December 8th) that former Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic was in Belgrade for a medical operation in January 2004. The information was immediately delivered to EUFOR and a few hours later a helicopter flew over the region to warn Karadzic. She added that she does not think Karadzic and fellow war crimes indictee fugitive Ratko Mladic will ever be caught. (Blic, B92, Beta, Makfax - 08/12/07)

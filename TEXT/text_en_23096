BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic has received a new death threat over the arrest of war crimes fugitive Radovan Karadzic, local media reported on Saturday (August 2nd). A group calling itself True Serbs threatened the president in a letter to the Vienna office of the Frankfurt-based daily Vesti. The letter says Tadic is capturing "Serb icons" while The Hague tribunal is "freeing thieves and executioners", for which Tadic will be "blown to smithereens". Tadic has received several death threats since Karadzic's detention and extradition to The Hague tribunal last week. The arrest also has sparked a series of protests -- some involving clashes with police -- in Belgrade. (B92, AP, RTS, Tanjug, Makfax - 02/08/08)

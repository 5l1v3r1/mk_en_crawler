BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government approved a draft bill Wednesday (October 24th) that introduces a majority voting system in Romania. The measure will be submitted to lawmakers on Monday, in a bid to block President Traian Basescu from holding a referendum on the voting system and European Parliament elections on the same day. A presidential decree on the dual referendum was promulgated Wednesday as well. Basescu and Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu have quarrelled publicly over the need for the new election system, which Basescu says will make politicians more accountable to voters.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Vanyo Tanov, a former police general who used to head an anti-organised crime unit, was appointed on Thursday (August 6th) as director of the state customs agency. Tanov made headlines over an investigation into the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), aimed at shedding more light on the party's sources of funding. However, the investigation was stopped several times, eventually leading Tanov to resign. Detractors note that while he was head of the anti-organised crime unit, a number of high-profile murders took place that were never solved. (Dnevnik, Mediapool, Trud, Darik - 06/08/09)

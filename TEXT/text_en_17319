ISTANBUL, Turkey -- An eight-story building collapsed in Istanbul on Thursday (April 26th). Two people had to be pulled from the rubble by rescue workers. Authorities believe most residents fled their units when they heard the structure start to crack. Istanbul Province Mayor Kadir Topbas said the collapse was the result of "serious negligence" by a contractor hired to tear down a building next door. 
In other news, a 15-year-old illegal immigrant drowned and two people were missing after a boat carrying a number of Middle Easterners sank off the Greek island of Farmakonissi in the Aegean. Eight people managed to swim to the island and call for help. 
Also Thursday, Turkish police announced the capture of the man who allegedly attempted to gun down Erdogan Tezic, the head of Turkey's Higher Education Board. Nurullah Ilgun, 26, was arrested hours after the incident Wednesday. (Zaman, UPI - 27/04/07; NTV, Turkishpress.com, AP, Euronews, Reuters - 26/04/07)

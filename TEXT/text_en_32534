TIRANA, Albania -- The government has refused entry to a man suspected of running the Albanian National Army extremist group in Macedonia. Gafur Adili, 44, a Swiss resident born in Macedonia, was escorted out of the country by police. "Gafur Adili's refusal of entrance and stay in Albania is linked with activity that runs counter to Albania's policy ... against any activity aimed at provoking instability," Tirana police said in a statement Monday (10 March).

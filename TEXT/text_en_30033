ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Ivo Josipovic said on Thursday (February 24th) that The Hague war crimes tribunal is blocking the final stage of the country's EU accession process over mistakes his country made in the past. "Croatia is slowly becoming a hostage of its relations with The Hague tribunal," Josipovic told an international conference on the legacy of the tribunal in Zagreb. He said "it would be unfair to slow down the country's path towards the EU because of past errors which are now beyond being corrected," a reference to military documents from the 1992-1995 conflict that prosecutors have requested from Croatia.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov signed the amended electoral law Monday (11 April) after the ruling NMS-II introduced some changes to the initial draft in line with the president's remarks. Parvanov had earlier threatened to veto the bill, voicing disagreement with some of its provisions. According to the latest version passed by parliament, a participation deposit of 10,000 euros would be introduced for political parties. Other changes refer to actual ballots.

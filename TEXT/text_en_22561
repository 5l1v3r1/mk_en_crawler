BUCHAREST, Romania -- Defence Minister Teodor Melescanu announced on Thursday (August 7th) that Romania will start withdrawing its troops from Iraq in a year or two. He added Bucharest wants to begin negotiations on scaling down that military presence in Iraq as soon as possible. The one or two years would allow Iraqi forces to progressively assume tasks related to maintaining security. Romania has about 600 troops in Iraq, mostly in the south, operating under British command. (Evenimentul zilei, Adevarul - 08/08/08; Agerpres, Realitatea TV - 07/08/08)

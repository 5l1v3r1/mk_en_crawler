THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj asked The Hague war crimes tribunal Monday (March 7th) to acquit him, claiming prosecutors have failed to prove charges against him. He also insisted on compensation for the eight years spent in custody. Seselj is accused of war crimes committed against non-Serbs in Croatia, Vojvodina and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 1993. (RTRS, Fena, Beta, B92 - 07/03/11)

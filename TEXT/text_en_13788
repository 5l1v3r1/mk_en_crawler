STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament (EP) adopted a resolution Thursday (16 February), urging representatives of Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to reach an agreement on institutional and constitutional reforms. The EP members also called on the EU to more strongly support efforts to reach a consensus. They stressed the importance of developing a more efficient public administration and proper legal framework, and the necessity of implementing reforms in policing, defence, public broadcasting and intelligence.

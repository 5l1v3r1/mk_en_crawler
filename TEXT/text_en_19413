ATHENS, Greece -- The government reiterated on Tuesday (October 30th) its request for "co-ordinated and comprehensive" efforts by the EU to tackle illegal immigration. In a letter to European Parliament official Jean-Marie Cavada, Interior Minister Prokopis Pavlopoulos said that the fact Greece borders non-EU countries in an unstable region attracts waves of illegal immigrants trying to reach Western Europe. Taxpayers, he says, end up saddled with "huge expenditures, which, in reality, correspond to all European taxpayers". Separately Tuesday, Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said Greece cannot accept any more illegal immigrants. (ANA-MPA, Naftemporiki - 30/10/07)

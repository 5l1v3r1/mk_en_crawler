BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The first meeting between the delegations of Kosovo and Serbia in the framework of dialogue ended on Wednesday (March 9th) in Brussels. All three parties, the delegations as well as the EU in the capacity of facilitator, described the meeting as constructive and a good start. "Both parties reaffirmed their commitment to the dialogue and their willingness to continue with the process," the EU said in a statement at the close of the meeting. The two sides also talked about regional trade and freedom of movement of goods, including the CEFTA agreement, described as "the basis of the establishment of an open regional market, is key to the economic development in the region. The two parties reviewed positively their participation to CEFTA and confirmed that they will participate during the 2011 Chairmanship," the EU stated. 
Meanwhile in Pristina, International Civilian Office head Pieter Feith described the readiness of the two countries to engage in a dialogue and try to solve vital issues as one of the most positive steps since the February 20008 declaration of Kosovo's independence.

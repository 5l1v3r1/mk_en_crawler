OMISALJ, Croatia -- Pope John Paul II arrived in Croatia on Thursday (5 June) and called on the country's leaders to work harder to overcome the animosities of the past. "May those who exercise civil and religious authority never tire of trying to heal the wounds caused by a cruel war and of rectifying the consequences of a totalitarian system that for all too long attempted to impose an ideology opposed to man and his dignity," he said. The pontiff asserted his strong support for the country's aspirations to enter the EU. Croatian President Stipe Mesic said the visit of the Pope is historic, and maintained Croatia is advancing towards democratisation. The pontiff will visit five cities during his stay.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko hosted a reception in Mostar on Thursday (June 10th), to mark the closing of the Office of the High Representative's (OHR) branch there at the end of this month. In his speech, Inzko said that for the past 13 years, the OHR South Office has played a substantial role in the progress achieved in Mostar, including the return of displaced people and refugees, rebuilding the infrastructure and unifying the city administration. He stressed however that closing the branch does not mean the complete withdrawal of the international presence. (Fena, OHR - 10/06/10)

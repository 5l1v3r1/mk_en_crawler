BUCHAREST, Romania -- European Commission (EC) Vice-President and Commissioner for Justice Franco Frattini urged the Romanian Parliament Friday (March 16th) to adopt a bill that would establish a National Integrity Agency (ANI), in charge of monitoring politicians' wealth and assets. Frattini stressed that enforcing this law was one of the commitments Romania undertook in the EU accession process and moreover, establishing the ANI would benefit the public.

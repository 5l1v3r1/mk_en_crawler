ANKARA, Turkey -- The terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) on Monday (July 28th) denied any connection to Sunday's twin bombings in Istanbul that killed 17 people and injured more than 150. In a statement published on a website related to the PKK, one of its leaders, Zubeyir Aydar, condemned the attacks. "Such an attack is meant to be a provocation in a period when the Ergenekon and AKP cases are being heard. The PKK has no connection with the event," Aydar said. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan had alleged that Kurdish militants carried out the attacks to avenge Turkish military air raids on PKK positions.
Erdogan visited the site of the attacks Monday and urged people to unite against terrorism. President Abdullah Gul reaffirmed the country's determination to fight terrorism. "These incidents will strengthen our national solidarity," he said. (Sabah, Zaman, Daily Telegraph - 29/07/08, Hurriyet, Turkish Press - 28/07/08)

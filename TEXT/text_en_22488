BELGRADE, Serbia -- Leaders of the Serbian Socialist Party (SPS) officially cancelled their coalition agreement Sunday (July 13th) with the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) and the populist Serbian Democratic Party (DSS) regarding the Belgrade city council. Party negotiators had signed the accord immediately after the May 11th general elections, leading to tension in talks with the Democratic Party (DS) and its allies. At that time, G17 Plus, a close ally of the DS and a member of the ruling coalition and the cabinet, demanded that the SPS sever ties with the SRS and the DSS if it were to join the ruling coalition. After a session in Belgrade on Sunday, the SPS announced it decided to withdraw from the Belgrade coalition in order "not to jeopardise the country's government". SPS leader Ivica Dacic told journalists that the next few days will determine if it is still possible to form a city government. If not, new local elections might be required.

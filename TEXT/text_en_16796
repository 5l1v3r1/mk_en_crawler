BRUSSELS, Belgium -- An internal European Commission report says the pace of reforms in Turkey has slowed significantly in the past year, according to the Financial Times. In an article published Tuesday (6 June), it said the draft report finds that Turkey has made no further progress in ensuring freedom of religion, while people are still prosecuted for non-violent expressions of opinion, and reports of torture and mistreatment of prisoners persist. The draft also reportedly voices concern over the recent deterioration of the situation in southeast Turkey, where clashes with Kurdish rebels have intensified. The EU document was drafted for next week's official opening of Ankara's accession talks with the Union. 
Speaking after a cabinet meeting, Turkish government spokesman Cemil Cicek denied that Ankara is stalling on reforms or that the pace of accession negotiations with the EU has slowed. Such claims are based on incomplete information, he said. He added that enacting the required legislation takes time, and that parliament has been carrying out the process without delay.

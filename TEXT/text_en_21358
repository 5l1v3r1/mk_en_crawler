SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak has decided to return passports and identity cards belonging to members of former fugitive Radovan Karadzic's family, according to Lajcak's office Wednesday (July 30th). Officials confiscated the documents belonging to Karadzic's wife, daughter, son and son-in-law in January to prevent the family from helping Karadzic and other war crimes indictees hide from authorities. Following his extradition Wednesday to The Hague, his relatives can now visit him in the tribunal's detention centre in Scheveningen. (B92, Tanjug, Dnevni Avaz, ITAR-TASS - 30/07/08)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- European Commission (EC) spokesman Martin Selmayr said on Wednesday (August 13th) that Romania has not proved it is capable of tackling high-level corruption, including cases involving former and current cabinet ministers. Selmayr's statement came after lawmakers rejected an investigation Wednesday against former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase and former Transport Minister Miron Mitrea. They allegedly were complicit in a variety of offences, including graft. According to Selmayr, the EC's July report on the judiciary addressed this very situation -- parliament hindering the fight against corruption instead of sustaining it.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Two Bosnian Serbs received prison sentences Tuesday (March 24th) for crimes against humanity committed during the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH. Krsto Savic, former head of the Bosnian Serb police forces in the Trebine region, participated in the persecution of civilian Muslims and Croats between May and December 1992, the Bosnian war crimes court announced. These crimes -- including murder, deportations, imprisonment, torture and rape -- occurred in Gacko, Bileca, Kalinovik and Nevesinje, according to the court, which sentenced Savic to 20 years in prison. The court convicted one of his subordinates, Milko Mucibabic, of participating in the arrest of civilians during the same period. He received a sentence of five years and three months in prison.

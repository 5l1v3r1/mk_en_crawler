SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prosecutors have opened separate probes against 42 people, who allegedly have helped fugitives sought by the UN war crimes tribunal, the Nezavisne Novine reports on Tuesday (January 8th). According to the newspaper, one suspect is former deputy head of the Banja Luka Security Service Ljuban Ecim. Prosecutors think he is a primary organiser of the network supporting former Republika Srpska political leader Radovan Karadzic. Ecim, who is currently held in a Belgrade prison, was arrested in Serbia last month in an operation against a drug trafficking gang. (Nezavisne Novine, Focus - 08/01/08)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci appealed to Serbs living in Kosovo not to leave after independence from Serbia is declared. He pledged that the rights of all ethnic minorities would be guaranteed. Thaci, who visited a Serb family in Rubovc on Tuesday (February 5th), stressed that Serbs should remain because Kosovo will become a country for everybody, where revenge will not be allowed. He promised that his government would work hard to secure prosperity for all people.
Kosovo's future was also the focus of a meeting between Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa and his Greek counterpart, Costas Karamanlis, in Ljubljana on Tuesday. Karamanlis reiterated Greece's opposition to any hasty, unilateral moves regarding Kosovo's status and said his country would insist on the EU actively participating in the preservation of stability and security in the region.

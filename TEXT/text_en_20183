ATHENS, Greece -- One in four families say they were forced to pay illegal bribes last year, which would total an estimated 613m euros in bribes, the NGO Transparency International said during a conference in Athens on Monday (January 14th). A recent study suggests 26% of the 6,000 households polled in the survey said that last year they gave away "small envelopes", as the Greek call them, with 20% of that going to the public sector. Poll participants said political parties, tax authorities, media, justice, and health officials are the most corrupt.

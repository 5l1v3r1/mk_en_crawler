SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgarian police announced on Wednesday (6 August) that they have arrested five suspects as part of a major international operation over the weekend, which netted five tonnes of cocaine in Bolivia. US Ambassador to Sofia James Pardew praised Bulgaria's law enforcement services for the "key role" they played in the drug bust, described as one of the largest ever. Three tonnes of the cocaine had been intended for shipment to the Bulgarian port of Varna. Interior Ministry Chief Secretary Boyko Borisov told reporters that there would be more arrests.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Council of Ministers (CoM) decided on Thursday (25 May) to establish a state commission for investigating the truth about war victims in Sarajevo in the period 1992-1995. CoM Chairman Adnan Terzic had blocked the establishment of this commission for some two years, resulting in a boycott this week by lawmakers from Republika Srpska. They plan to continue their walkout until they see actual formation of the panel. High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling praised the CoM's decision and called on all members of parliament to proceed with their work. 
Separately Thursday, Schwarz-Schilling outlined three key issues that require urgent attention by Mostar's authorities, prior to the next meeting of the Peace Implementation Council Steering Board at the end of June. These are: progress in adopting the city budget, completing formation of the City Administration, and establishing a single public works company in Mostar.

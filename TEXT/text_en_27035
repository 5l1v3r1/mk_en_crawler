BELGRADE, Serbia -- Dick Marty, Council of Europe (CoE) special rapporteur, met with Justice Minister Snezana Malovic on Monday (August 3rd) regarding Serb allegations of organ trafficking years ago. Belgrade says that members of the now disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army kidnapped Serb civilians during the Kosovo conflict and took them to camps in northern Albania, where they removed their organs for sale on the black market. Malovic said her ministry will provide any help it can to resolve the case. Marty meets on Tuesday with Serbia's war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic, relatives of kidnapped and missing people from Kosovo and the chairman of the government committee for missing people, Veljko Odalovic. On Wednesday, he will travel to Albania for additional fact-finding. Kosovo government Spokesman Memli Krasniqi said on Monday Pristina authorities welcome "any investigation into war crimes committed in Kosovo". (RTS, B92, Tanjug, AP - 03/08/09)

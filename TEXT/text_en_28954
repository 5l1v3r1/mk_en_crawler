LUXEMBOURG, Luxembourg -- Pending European Parliament approval, Eurostat has decided to send a mission to Sofia, to review the quality of Bulgaria's statistics, EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Tuesday (June 8th) after a meeting of EU finance ministers in Luxembourg. The decision is in line with the new auditing powers given to Eurostat. Rehn says the European Commission has had concerns about the country's financial statistics for a while. For instance, Bulgaria's budget deficit for 2009 ballooned from the initial 1.9% of GDP to 3.7% of GDP after the discovery of contracts, signed by the previous administration. Later on, the figure was revised to 3.9% of GDP. Bulgarian authorities say Eurostat's decision is no surprise. (AFP, bTV, BNT, BBC - 08/06/10)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- As promised, the opposition Democratic Liberal Party (PDL) submitted a no-confidence motion against the government Wednesday (October 29th). The party filed it with the senate after Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu's cabinet postponed -- by six months -- a controversial 50% pay raise for teachers. The PDL says the move "ignores the rights of the country's citizens and is causing a large-scale social crisis". 
Also Wednesday, the country's main unions threatened to stage a series of strikes next month in state institutions, schools and hospitals unless the government raises public sector wages by 50%. Tariceanu said society should use dialogue, not strikes, to resolve salary disputes.

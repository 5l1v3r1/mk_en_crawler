SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The foreign ministry said on Tuesday (24 June) that a bilateral agreement with the United States on the International Criminal Court (ICC) issue is possible. Deputy Foreign Minister Lyubomir Ivanov said the common EU stance, signed by Bulgaria a few days ago, does not preclude a separate agreement with Washington. Radio Free Europe reports that four US congressmen have signed a proposal amending the law on military aid that would allow Bulgaria and other NATO candidates to receive US funding regardless of their position on the ICC.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- US Deputy Assistant Secretary Rosemary DiCarlo reiterated her country's support Tuesday (May 22nd) for Montenegro's EU integration efforts. She said that Montenegro, which marked the first anniversary of its independence this week, has made tremendous progress in the past 12 months. DiCarlo said the US wants to boost bilateral economic, trade and military co-operation with the country. 
Also Tuesday, Miroslav Lajcak, who served as special EU envoy for the Montenegrin independence referendum in 2006, said that the country has entered a phase of a normal political development. The most important issue right now, he said, is adopting a new constitution. (Mina, RTCG - 22/05/07)

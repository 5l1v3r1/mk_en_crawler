TIRANA, Albania -- Lawmakers will vote in two weeks on whether to lift the immunity of former Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu. The Republican Party member has been implicated in the deadly Gerdec ammunition depot blasts in mid-March. During a parliamentary session Thursday (June 5th), Mediu asked fellow lawmakers to vote on his immunity immediately. However, parliamentary leaders said doing so would violate procedures. In all, the March 15th explosions killed 26 and injured around 300. (Koha Ditore, Telegrafi - 06/06/08; TVSh, BalkanWeb, TopChannel - 05/06/08)

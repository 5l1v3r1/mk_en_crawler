BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Serbian Democratic Party (DSS) does not intend to make a coalition with "unreliable partners," DSS member and outgoing Education Minister Zoran Loncar told the Tanjug news agency on Friday (June 13th). "The SPS plays a double game ... and in the daytime openly negotiates with us, while at night [secretly] with the other side." According to him, the DSS will decide next week on the fate of coalition talks. (Tanjug - 13/06/08)

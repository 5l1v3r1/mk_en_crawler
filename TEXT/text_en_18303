ZAGREB, Croatia -- Zeljka Antunovic, acting leader of the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP), said on Tuesday (April 10th) that she would support the nomination of Ljubo Jurcic as SDP candidate for prime minister in the November parliamentary elections. Jurcic, an independent, is the author of the party's economic programme. Antunovic says his nomination may mobilise SDP and its supporters and help oust the Croatian Democratic Union from power. Earlier in the day, Jurcic announced that he had submitted an application for SDP membership. (Poslovni dnevnik - 11/04/07; HINA, HRT - 10/04/07)

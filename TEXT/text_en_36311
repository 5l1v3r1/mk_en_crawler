SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government has finished work on a draft national strategy for EU integration that will likely be adopted during the first session of the new government, Deputy Prime Minister Radmila Sekerinska said Wednesday (26 May). According to the minister, the document outlines priorities and would determine policy over the next two to 15 years, leading to a concrete timetable for implementation of EU-related commitments and reforms.
Also Wednesday, Macedonia's Parliament began debating amendments to the local elections law. The government wants to lower the minimum turnout limit from 50 per cent to 30 per cent, a move rejected by the main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE. (A1 TV, MIA, Makfax - 26/05/04)

ANKARA, Turkey -- On Tuesday (15 July), parliament approved the 6th EU reform package, vetoed earlier this month by President Ahmet Necdet Sezer. The two vetoed articles were approved without amendment. According to the Turkish Constitution, the president has the right to veto only once. Therefore, the EU reform package is not subject to further change. (Anadolu Agency, NTV - 15//07/03)

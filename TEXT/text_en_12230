TIRANA, Albania -- Former President Sali Berisha's Democrats may get an absolute majority, according to partial results from last Sunday's elections published by the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) in Sunday's (10 July) Shekulli newspaper. The results of the races in 98 of the 100 single-seat constituencies show the Democrats getting 55 seats, the Socialists 41, one seat going to an independent candidate, and one to former Prime Minister Ilir Meta's Party of Socialist Movement for Integration. Combined with votes from the proportional system for 40 other seats, Berisha and his allies are projected to get an absolute majority of over 71 seats in the next parliament. The CEC says it will investigate 230 complaints from parties and independent candidates before announcing final results.
On Friday meanwhile, the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and the European Commission issued a joint declaration urging all political parties to show self-restraint and await the final results. Prime Minister Fatos Nano vowed the administration would continue to work as normal to ensure a smooth transition of power. (Shekulli - 10/07/05; AP, Albanian News - 09/07/05; AFP - 08/07/05)

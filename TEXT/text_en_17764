BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu easily survived a referendum on impeachment Saturday (May 19th), with exit polls suggesting popular support of nearly 75%. Basescu joined hundreds of supporters in Bucharest's main square after the referendum to call for the resignation of Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu. He also promised to work to prevent oligarchs from running Romania any longer. Tariceanu said he would respect the results of the referendum and would co-operate with the president. Social Democratic Party leader, Mircea Geoana, said Basescu had "won a victory without glory", since only 46% of voters participated in the referendum. Parliament suspended Basescu last month, forcing the referendum, after accusing the president of abusing his constitutional powers.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Debate in parliament regarding new police reform measures is being delayed by a week. Scheduled to begin on Thursday (April 3rd), Milorad Zivkovic, speaker of the lower House of Representatives, said a week should be enough time for additional consultations, which will include the Office of the High Representative. Approving a police reform package is the main condition BiH must meet in order to seal its Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, likely later this month.

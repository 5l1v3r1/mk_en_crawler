BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Democratic Alliance of Hungarians (UDMR), a ruling coalition partner, officially agreed on Saturday (April 24th) to back the constitutional changes being initiated by President Traian Basescu. Thus far, only the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) had given unconditional support to the bill, while the UDMR has had serious misgivings about turning the bicameral parliament into a unicameral one, and reducing the number of lawmakers from 471 to 300. Basescu also insists on increasing the electoral threshold from 5% to 10%, which will make smaller parties able to win seats only in coalition with larger ones. The UDMR's support is far from enough, as a majority of two-thirds is required to amend the constitution. (Ziua de Cluj - 26/04/10; Gandul - 25/04/10; Ziare - 24/04/10)

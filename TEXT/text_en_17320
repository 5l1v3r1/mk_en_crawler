BELGRADE, Serbia -- The UN Security Council (UNSC) fact-finding mission held talks on Thursday (April 26th) with Serbian officials about the Kosovo status issue. Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica spelled out Belgrade's proposal for supervised autonomy within Serbia. Afterwards, the head of the UNSC mission, Belgian Ambassador to the UN Johan Verbeke, said that while the Serbian officials expressed readiness to resolve the Kosovo issue, both Kostunica and President Boris Tadic continued to rule out Kosovo's independence and the plan proposed by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari. 
Also Thursday, more than 10,000 Serb refugees gathered at the administrative border between central Serbia and Kosovo to show their desire to return to Kosovo. Verbeke said the Security Council mission would not visit the rally because of time constraints and logistical issues. The mission heads to Pristina on Friday, where it is scheduled to meet with Kosovo authorities, representatives of the international community and ethnic Serbs.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- In a special resolution issued Wednesday (15 June), the Serbia-Montenegro Council of Ministers condemned war crimes committed against Bosniak civilians in Srebrenica in July 1995. The statement extended condolences to the families of the victims, but said distinctions should be made between the actual criminals and the larger public in Serbia-Montenegro. Also Wednesday, the federal cabinet approved activities aimed at enhancing co-operation with the UN tribunal, including a draft law on freezing indictees' assets. It also decided to provide files on several indictees, including wartime Republika Srpska military commander Ratko Mladic, to UN tribunal prosecutors.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- US Air Force General Richard Myers, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, visited US troops in Kosovo on Wednesday (17 September) and said Washington is reassessing its involvement with an option "on the table" for a European force to take over peacekeeping operations in the Balkans. While acknowledging the US military is stretched thin, given other deployments, Myers ruled out a unilateral pullout from Kosovo or Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). The United States has about 4,000 troops in the Balkans: 1,500 in BiH and 2,500 in Kosovo. (Reuters - 17/09/03)

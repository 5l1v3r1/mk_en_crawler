TIRANA, Albania -- A top official of the opposition Socialist Party, Tirana Mayor Edi Rama, criticised on Friday (16 September) some decisions made by the new Democratic Party-led cabinet, saying that the new government started with gaffes. Rama, considered a top contender for leader of the SP, cited the decision to return control of the National Information Service to the interior ministry, warning it moves the country backwards. President Alfred Moisiu also disapproves of the decision. (Albanian News - 17/09/05)

TIRANA, Albania -- Council of Europe (CoE) Director for Justice and Home Affairs Ivan Bizjak says Albania must meet more requirements before it can be offered visa-free travel to EU member countries. In an interview with Deutsche Welle on Saturday (March 6th), Bizjak said "I am sure that both Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina know exactly what criteria they have to meet," adding that this stage is just the beginning of a long road to EU membership. Among areas where more work is necessary, Bizjak cited consolidating institutions, boosting the rule of law, fighting corruption and organised crime, respecting human rights and guaranteeing free competition.

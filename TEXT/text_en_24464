BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government presented on Tuesday (April 7th) a series of austerity measures aimed at slashing the country's budget deficit by 1 billion euros to meet IMF requirements. Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic said the government plans to downsize public administration by 10%, which means about 8,000 workers will lose their jobs. The government put a moratorium on hiring and introduced a salary freeze. The government measures also include additional taxes on state wages, gasoline and luxury goods such as yachts and expensive cars. Cvetkovic said 85% of the fiscal adjustments will come from cost-cutting and 15% from taxes, meaning it will have little effect on household income and will not undermine living standards.

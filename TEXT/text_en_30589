BUCHAREST, Romania -- The opposition alliance Social-Liberal Union backs Social Democratic Party leader Victor Ponta for prime minister, should a pending no-confidence motion pass, Crin Antonescu, leader of the other major opposition National Liberal Party said on Monday (March 14th). If Prime Minister Emil Boc ends up having to resign, the president has to propose the successor, after discussing possibilities with all lawmakers and establishing support from the majority of them. The no-confidence motion against the cabinet, filed by the opposition over the labour code changes, will be debated and subject to a vote Wednesday. It appears unlikely to pass, given the ruling coalition's parliamentary majority. (Gandul, Romania Libera, Evenimentul Zilei - 14/03/11)

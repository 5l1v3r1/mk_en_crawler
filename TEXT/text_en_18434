PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Members of the Kosovo and UNMIK police arrested two officials -- Prime Minister Agim Ceku's adviser for security and political issues Jahja Luka and the head of Kasabank, Milazim Abazi -- for suspected money laundering Monday (March 12th). They were picked up during a raid on the Pristina headquarters of the Alliance for the Future of Kosova, the party of former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, who is on trial at The Hague tribunal for war crimes. According to local media reports, Luka and Abazi -- both close associates of Haradinaj -- are suspected in connection with a defence fund established for him in March 2005.

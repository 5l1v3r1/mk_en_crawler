STRASBOURG, France -- Bulgaria will be able to join the EU in 2007 only if it stamps out the "climate of impunity" which encourages organised crime, EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini said Tuesday (24 January). He urged the government to produce tangible results by May, when the European Commission is due to assess Bulgaria's readiness for accession.
Also Tuesday, Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev said in an address to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe that restructuring the Bulgarian judiciary, fighting corruption and organised crime, improving the situation for minorities, and Roma integration were priority issues on the government's agenda.

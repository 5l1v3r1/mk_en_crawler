BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic called for restraint from all parties Saturday (11 September), after clashes earlier in the day in Novi Pazar, a town in the mainly Muslim-populated Sandzak region. Local police say clashes started after members of the Democratic Action Party, returning from a pre-election rally, opened fire on the premises of the Sandzak Democratic Party. Two passersby were wounded. The parties' local leaders denied responsibility, accusing each other of provoking the incident. Tadic condemned all violence ahead of the 19 September local elections.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal's Appeals Chamber reduced the prison sentence Tuesday (November 28th) of Bosnian Serb physician Blagoje Simic. He was convicted for crimes against non-Serb civilians in Bosanski Samac between April 1992 and December 1993. The appeals panel reduced his sentence from 17 to 15 years by overturning his conviction on one count, while maintaining others. He was first sentenced in 2003. 
Separately Tuesday, The Hague tribunal announced that the next hearing in the trial of Croatian reporter Domagoj Margetic would be held on Thursday. He is charged with contempt, for allegedly disclosing the identity of protected witnesses in the Tihomir Blaskic trial. (ICTY website, RTRS, PBS BiH, Reuters, AP - 28/11/06)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ordered Greek national air carriers Olympic Airlines and Olympic Airways to return 500m euros in aid provided by the state between 1990 and 2004. Thursday's (February 14th) ruling is based on the European Commission's September 2005 decision that financing provided to the companies amounted to "illegal and incompatible state aid". At the time, the EU's competition regulator ordered the firms to repay the hundreds of millions of euros, but Greece has failed to comply. Ailing Olympic Airlines has accumulated 2.4 billion euros in debt and the Greek government is actively seeking ways to save the company. (Sky, ANA-MPA, AFP, Thomson Financial - 14/02/08)

RUSE, Bulgaria -- Foreign Minister Solomon Passy and Romanian counterpart Mihai Razvan Ungureanu agreed on Monday (6 June) to further enhance trans-border co-operation. The diplomats, who met in the Danube town of Ruse, announced the cancellation of two out of the four types of taxes for transiting via the Ruse-Giurgiu border crossing. Passy and Ungureanu also adopted a joint declaration expressing the two EU candidate states' support for continuation of the EU Constitution Treaty ratification process. They voiced confidence that the results of the recent referenda in France and the Netherlands would not affect Bulgaria and Romania's planned entry in 2007.

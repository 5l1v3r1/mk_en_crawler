NEW YORK, United States -- UN spokeswoman Marie Okabe acknowledged on Friday (June 8th) that the world organisation has received legal papers in connection with a suit filed by relatives and victims of the Srebrenica massacre. However, she said, the UN is immune to litigation, under a 1946 act. The Srebrenica victims are suing the UN and the Netherlands on the grounds that Dutch UN peacekeepers failed to protect Muslims who sought refuge in a designated UN safe haven.
The UN remains committed to helping Bosnia and Herzegovina and the people of Srebrenica, Okabe said. She added that the UN has learned its lessons from the Srebrenica tragedy, and has adopted measures to prevent a repeat. (Reuters, AFP - 08/06/07)

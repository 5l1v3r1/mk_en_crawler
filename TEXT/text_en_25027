ATHENS, Greece -- A radical anarchist group claimed responsibility Monday (December 28th) for an explosion late Sunday near the buildings of the National Bank of Greece and a big private insurance company on a central boulevard in Athens. The group, calling itself the "Conspiracy Nuclei of Fire", said in a statement on the internet that the attack was to protest "the Christmas consumer mood" and displays of wealth. According to it, the explosive device used in the attack had an "improved construction" intended to cause serious damage. The group threatened to use even more powerful bombs in the future and expressed solidarity with anarchists serving prison time in Greece, Chile and Germany.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- One of the conditions Albania must fulfil to get a visa liberalisation agreement with the EU is to stop all illegal drug cultivation, European Commission Vice President Jacques Barrot said on Thursday (September 18th). Barrot made the statement at a press conference in Brussels, where he presented the EU's ongoing plan to combat drug trafficking throughout the Balkans, including in Albania. During his meeting with Albanian Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha earlier this week, Barrot says he told Basha "this is one of the issues on which we are very demanding. We want Albania to be very efficient in its fight against the production and fabrication of narcotics". (Top Channel, Klan, Alsat - 18/09/08)

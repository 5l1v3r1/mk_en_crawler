BUCHAREST, Romania -- The main opposition forces -- the National Liberal Party (PNL) and the Democratic Party -- signed a protocol for forming an alliance Sunday (28 September), following almost a year of negotiations. The coalition will be named For Justice and Truth, according to PNL leader Theodor Stolojan. The two parties are to run as equal partners in the 2004-2005 general elections after running independently in the local vote next spring. (Rompres, ACT Media - 29/09/03; Mediafax - 28/09/03)

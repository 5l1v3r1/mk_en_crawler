PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Admiral Mark Fitzgerald, NATO's Naples-based southern commander, urged the public to show restraint until the province's final status is resolved. At a news conference in Pristina on Thursday (December 13th), he stressed that during a recent visit to Belgrade, he was assured that Serbia would not resort to force over potential independence for Kosovo. Fitzgerald noted the 17,000 NATO troops deployed in the province would be ready to handle any security situation, including potential hot spots in the north, an apparent reference to areas populated largely by Serbs. 
In an interview published on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that Russia must accept that Serbia and Kosovo "are never going to be one again". She added "both Kosovo and Serbia need to get on with their futures, their separate but related futures." (Reuters, AFP, Focus, Telegrafi, RFE, RTK, Balkanweb, Reuters - 13/12/07)

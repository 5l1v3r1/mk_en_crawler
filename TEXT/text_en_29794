BUCHAREST, Romania -- European Parliament (EP) member Adrian Severin quit his Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSD) on Monday (March 28th) amid bribery accusations. The lawmaker, who has denied any wrongdoing, explained he did not want "futile disputes" over the allegations. Severin and two other EP members -- Slovenia's Zoran Thaler and Austria's Ernst Strasser -- were the targets of a recent expose by reporters from the British daily Sunday Times, who pretended to be lobbyists. The three allegedly agreed to accept thousands of euros in exchange for tabling various amendments to EU legislation. Thaler and Strasser have stepped down. The PSD has threatened to fire Severin if he fails to resign both from the party and his EP post. Severin has said he will quit the EP's Socialists group but will remain in the institution.

Beginning January 1st 2010, a parking ticket in Croatia will drop by ten times what it costs now. Croatian drivers are often scofflaws, neglecting to pay for additional parking time or even to pay at all, but they say the fines for violations are too high. In a ruling late last year, the Constitutional Court in Zagreb decided to put an end to the allegedly extortionate fines. 
Croatia was one of the first countries to enable drivers to pay parking fees through cell phones. This innovation facilitated the payment process, but many drivers forgot to renew their payments. They paid a high price -- a penalty of 20.4 euros, almost ten times the 2.2-euro rate for an hour of parking in central Zagreb. 
Enraged motorists took the matter to court. Judges ruled in their favour and gave parking companies 12 months to harmonise their policies with the Constitutional Court's ruling. 
Errant Zagreb motorists, after the ruling takes effect in 2010, will face a penalty of only 2.2 euros (equivalent to another hour of parking) for forgetting to pay their parking fees. The judicial intervention in a seemingly mundane economic matter that lacked constitutional relevance was unprecedented for the court. 
According to media polls, most were delighted with the decision, concurring that the judges did the right thing and the fines were too high. 
The affected firms, understandably, had less positive reactions. Mate Kraljevic, head of the firm Zagreb Parking, promised to abide by the ruling. However, he also expressed surprise, since authorities had not disputed this payment scale until the court ruled. Other firms expressed similar sentiments. 
Zagreb Parking, the biggest of the affected companies, collected more than 3.1m euros last year in penalties imposed on derelict drivers.

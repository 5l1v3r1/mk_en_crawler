ATHENS, Greece -- Over 10,000 people gathered in Thessaloniki on Saturday (September 5th) to rally against the government's economic and social policies. The protest coincided with Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis arriving in the city to open the traditional Thessaloniki International Trade Fair. Incidents marred the separate rallies in three parts of the city. Police had to use teargas to disperse a crowd of about 50 hooded men who hurled Molotov cocktails, bottles and rocks, destroying store fronts, traffic cameras, banks and ATM machines. Police also clashed with protestors outside the Turkish consulate. Local media reported about 25 arrests.
On Friday, about 700 police and guard officers held a peaceful protest in Thessaloniki, demanding higher salaries and better working conditions. A day earlier, Karamanlis scheduled snap elections for October 4th, explaining that he wants a fresh mandate to deal with the economic crisis. (AFP, AP, ERT, ANA-MPA - 05/09/09; AP - 04/09/09)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki met on Tuesday (January 23rd) with Croatian EU Integration Minister Kolidna Grabar-Kitarovic, who asked again for recognition of the Croatian minority in Macedonia. The request was first presented by Prime Minister Ivo Sanader a couple of months ago. Grabar-Kitarovic noted that the Macedonian minority in Croatia has a representative in parliament and receives regular financial support from the government. Milososki said the two countries would sign an accord soon on the status of respective minorities. She and Grabar-Kitarovic also agreed on the need to boost bilateral economic co-operation.

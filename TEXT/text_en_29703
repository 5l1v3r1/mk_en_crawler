BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Members of a working group tasked with evaluating the readiness of Bulgaria and Romania to join the Schengen border-free zone met in Brussels on Friday (January 28th). The experts approved the technical report on Bucharest's readiness, but postponed the one for Bulgaria, effectively shelving both countries' hopes to become part of the zone in March. 
According to the assessment, Bulgaria has failed to secure its border with Turkey and needs to demonstrate more progress in fighting corruption and organised crime. The two countries are to join Schengen together. (Darik, Actualno, bTV, Hotnews.ro, Press TV - 28/01/11)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte says Serbia-Montenegro has established good co-operation with The Hague tribunal, but is expected to show full co-operation. During a visit to Belgrade on Thursday (2 June), del Ponte reiterated that the priority remains the arrest and extradition of Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, two of the court's most-wanted indictees. Among other top officials, she met with Serbian-Montenegrin President Svetozar Marovic, who said the future of the state union would be determined by whether Mladic is extradited. 
In other news Thursday, the Serbian Parliament adopted a law amending the Serbia-Montenegro constitutional charter. It covers elections for the federal parliament, as well as the ones for the republics. The measure also confirms that any potential independence referendum should be held in accordance with internationally recognised democratic standards and with the co-operation of the EU. It moves next to the Montenegrin and federal parliaments for approval. (Politika, Danas - 03/06/05; RTS, BBC, Serbian government, Tanjug, Beta, B92 - 02/06/05)

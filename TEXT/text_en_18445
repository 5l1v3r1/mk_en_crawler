SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Decertified policemen held a rally in front of the Office of the High Representative's headquarters in Sarajevo on Sunday (December 10th), again seeking a revision of the certification procedure. The protests were organised by the local association of BiH police officers, who were denied certification by the former UN International Police Task Force (IPTF). The officers argue that their human rights had been violated in almost 200 cases during the IPTF certification process, from 1996 to 2002. They are demanding that the UN review the issue. BiH Minister of Human Rights Mirsad Kebo supports that request, as does High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling.

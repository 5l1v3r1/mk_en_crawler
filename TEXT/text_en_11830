BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The head of the European Commission (EC) delegation to BiH, Michael Humphreys, and Dutch Ambassador to BiH Robert Bosscher met on Thursday (17 March) in Banja Luka with Republika Srpska (RS) President Dragan Cavic and new RS Prime Minister Pero Bukejlovic. The meeting focused on reforms needed to meet EC Feasibility Study requirements, especially police reform and co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. The EU envoys stressed that only a state-level police force could effectively combat organised crime, and urged RS to proceed with the reform. Cavic agreed in principle but said RS would not agree to any changes to the entity-based constitutional structure of BiH. (FENA, PBS, RTRS - 17/03/05)

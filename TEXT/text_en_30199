TIRANA, Albania -- Visiting Kosovo President Behgjet Pacolli promoted the idea of a unified market with Albania during a two-day stay in Tirana. Pacolli insisted on Monday (March 21st) the two countries should strengthen co-operation in all fields, suggesting relations be based on the EU model. "We should ensure the free movement of people, goods and capital by removing customs tax, unifying documents for goods and implementing unified licences," Pacolli said. Albanian counterpart Bamir Topi supported strengthening and extending co-operation throughout the region. 
At a meeting with Prime Minister Sali Berisha, Pacolli discussed infrastructure projects that would help boost co-operation between Kosovo and Albania. Tirana Mayor Edi Rama presented Pacolli with the Key of Tirana award. (Shekulli, Top Channel, Balkan Web, NOA, Telegrafi - 21/03/11)

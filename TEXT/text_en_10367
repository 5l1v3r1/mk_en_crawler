SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Four candidates will run for leader of the ruling Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM) during Wednesday's (24 November) party congress. Of ten candidates nominated by the municipal organisations, four were shortlisted by the SDSM presidency. They are current deputy leaders Vlado Buckovski, Radmila Sekerinska, Jani Makraduli and Tito Petkovski. The winner will likely be offered the post of prime minister, which was left vacant by Hari Kostov's resignation last week. 
In other news, Macedonia's outgoing cabinet adopted a key strategy Monday for restructuring the judicial sector. It aims to improve efficiency and to bring the judiciary into line with EU standards. (A1 TV, Utrinski Vesnik - 23/11/04; A1 TV - 22/11/04)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Members of the previous cabinet led by the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), including former Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev, announced on Saturday (September 26th) they would ignore an amnesty they had given themselves towards the end of their mandate, which would have protected them from prosecution for the several minor crimes, as well as poor management of public funds. This refers mostly to money provided by the EU. Critics say the lawmakers were trying to avoid future prosecution. By giving up the amnesty, the lawmakers say they can prove their innocence, if prosecuted. (Trud, Novinar, Dnevnik, BNT - 27/09/09)

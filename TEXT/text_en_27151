STRASBOURG, France -- Turkey must do more to protect the rights of its ethnic minority groups, including Kurds, Council of Europe Commissioner for human rights Thomas Hammarberg said in a report Thursday (October 1st), adding that he is concerned about some current restrictions, including in education. By law, Turkey allows only schools for the Armenian, Greek and Jewish communities. "At least until early 2009, the language of a number of minority groups, such as the Kurds or the Roma, has been impossible to be learnt either in a public or a private school," the document said. Another problem Hammarberg cites involves freedom of speech, particularly the continued implementation of Article 301 of the Criminal Code, which punishes any offence against the Turkish republic, the government, the parliament or the judiciary.

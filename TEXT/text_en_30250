SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgarian businesses paid more bribes to administrators last year than in 2009, according to a study by a local think-tank, published on Monday (February 21st). The data collected by the Centre for the Study of Democracy showed that the economic crisis has increased the dependency of businessmen on public officials: about 16% of all businessmen admit they paid bribes for administrative services. High-level corruption, meanwhile, remained generally unchanged. Corruption levels involving non-economic services actually fell sharply, from 171,000 in 2009 to 85,000 in 2010.

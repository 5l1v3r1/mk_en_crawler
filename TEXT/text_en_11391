SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH chief prosecutor Marinko Jurcevic said Wednesday (26 January) that the prosecution's special council for war crimes is working on several cases and would probably issue the first official charges by mid-February. Jurcevic explained that the cases were taken over from cantonal courts.
Also Wednesday, the Republika Srpska expert panel for implementing the conclusions of the entity's Srebrenica Commission held its first meeting in Banja Luka. The panel is to present its findings to the Bosnian Serb government by the end of February. 
In other news, the BiH Parliament voted Wednesday to adopt a flat value-added tax of 17 per cent, ending months of political wrangling. Each of the entities previously had their own tax regulations. The new tax was introduced as a way of controlling the grey economy. (Nezavisne novine - 27/01/05; RTRS, RS government Web site, Pincom.info, Fena, AFP - 26/01/05)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Authorities announced on Tuesday (November 2nd) they have identified the suicide bomber in Sunday's attack in the heart of Istanbul that injured 32 people. "His name is Vedat Acar, born in 1986 from the Gurpinar District of Van," Istanbul governor spokesperson Nazir Senturk said. According to him, Acar joined the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in 2004. The PKK has denied any links with the attack, and instead, extended its unilateral cease-fire with Turkey until next summer's general elections.

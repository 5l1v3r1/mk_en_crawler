SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Principal Deputy High Representative to BiH Raffi Gregorian is urging authorities to investigate whether individuals suspected of involvement in the 1995 Srebrenica genocide are still employed as public officials, particularly as police officers in BiH. He made this call during a meeting with Srebrenica victims associations' members in Sarajevo late Wednesday (April 4th). 
On Thursday, the RS government adopted a special investment strategy for Srebrenica that earmarks over 8.1m euros for the reconstruction and upgrade of the energy and housing infrastructure, healthcare and other projects in the municipality. The RS government is trying to prevent efforts by Bosniaks to obtain special status for Srebrenica, outside RS jurisdiction. (Dnevni avaz, Nezavisne novine - 06/04/07; OHR Sources, RTRS - 05/04/07)

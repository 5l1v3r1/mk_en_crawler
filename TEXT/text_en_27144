WARSAW, Poland -- Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor and Slovenian counterpart Borut Pahor voiced optimism Tuesday (September 1st) that a solution to their countries' maritime border dispute can be reached soon. The two officials met in Gdansk, where they attended commemorations marking the beginning of World War II. Pahor said that a draft solution to the row can be expected within the next few weeks. Kosor said that 95% of the issues have been resolved and only details remain. When they last met in July, the two prime ministers agreed to find a solution to the long-standing dispute by year's end.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The transportation ministry will present to the government an urgent plan aimed at easing navigation on the Danube, according to a press release issued by the ministry Monday (25 August). The plan envisions additional funds for dredging and mud removal. Due to a severe drought and heat wave, the navigation channel in some parts of the Danube has dropped below 1.6 metres, almost completely blocking river traffic. (Mediafax - 25/08/03)

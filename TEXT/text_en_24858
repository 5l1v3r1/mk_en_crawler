ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament on Thursday (July 2nd) approved the surprise resignation of Ivo Sanader from his post as prime minister. This starts the clock on up to 30 days of consultations before President Stipe Mesic taps a successor. The frontrunner is Sanader's choice, Deputy Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor, of the senior ruling Croatian Democratic Union party.
Earlier, lawmakers adopted changes to a law that allows for an interim cabinet to function until the new prime minister is elected, a first for Croatia. Consultations with Mesic begin Friday. (HRT, HINA - 02/07/09)

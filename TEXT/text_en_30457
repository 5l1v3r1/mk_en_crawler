ATHENS, Greece -- The IMF said in a report Wednesday (March 16th) that Greece has made further progress in meeting targets set in its bailout plan, but stressed more reforms are necessary to achieve fiscal sustainability and economic recovery. In its third progress report since May of last year, when the country received a 110 billion-euro bailout loan, the IMF noted that Greece is to present a medium-term strategy plan by May.

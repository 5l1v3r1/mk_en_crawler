PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- UN police launched a major operation against illegal prostitution and smuggling in Kosovo over the weekend, a UN spokesman reported Monday (30 September). Andrea Angeli said ten bars were closed in Djakovica and seven ethnic Albanians arrested on suspicion of forcing foreign women into prostitution. Some 30 women were detained.
In the vicinity of Mitrovica, meanwhile, UN police uncovered 600 kg of marijuana with a street value estimated at two million euros. A 37-year-old ethnic Albanian was arrested for smuggling the drugs into the province. This was the largest drug seizure in Kosovo since the UN assumed control over the Serbian province in 1999.
In other news, a crowd of 40 Serbs attacked six off-duty UN police officers in Kosovska Mitrovica on Sunday. Two of the victims suffered head injuries. The Serbs were apparently angry over UN-organised joint patrols by international officers and Serb cadets in the ethnically divided city. (AP, Reuters, AFP - 30/09/02)

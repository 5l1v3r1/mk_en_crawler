LONDON, Great Britain -- Greek Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas met with British Foreign Secretary William Hague in London on Wednesday (February 16th) to discuss EU integration prospects, the Middle East peace process and the long-standing Cypriot issue. Droutsas arrived in London from Nicosia, where he'd urged Turkey to withdraw its troops from the northern part of the divided island. He also asked Ankara to help resolve the Cypriot issue, saying this would bolster Turkey's efforts to join the EU. Droutsas heads next to New York to meet with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

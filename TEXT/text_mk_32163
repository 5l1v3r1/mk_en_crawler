SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The international community's High Representative in BiH, Paddy Ashdown, expects the parties that won the recent elections to present concrete proposals on implementing six reforms he backs. His spokesman, Julian Braithwaite, said Thursday (10 October) that developing constructive proposals would indicate the parties' readiness to handle reforms. Earlier this week, Ashdown called for reforms in central institutions, the revenue system, the political system, the business environment, the criminal justice system and the public service sector.
In other news, the outgoing BiH government decided Thursday that the headquarters of a newly established institution - the Court of BiH - should be located in the "Ramiz Salcin" complex in Sarajevo. The decision follows a recommendation by Ashdown's office that the Court should become operational by year's end. (OHR Sources - 11/10/02; PBS BiH, RTRS, NTV Hayat - 10/10/02)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Democratic Union of Integration (DUI) said Saturday (November 11th) that it is prepared to meet with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski. According to Teuta Arifi, deputy chair of the main ethnic Albanian party, DUI head Ali Ahmeti is awaiting an invitation from Gruevski for talks aimed at resuming political dialogue. Ties have been strained since the prime minister refused to include DUI in his cabinet earlier this year. (A1 TV, Vecer - 11/11/06)

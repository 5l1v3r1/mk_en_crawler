SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic called for consultations Wednesday (16 February), aimed at filling the Serb ministers' seats in the central government. They were left vacant by the December resignations of Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic, Transport Minister Branko Dokic and Deputy Civil Affairs Minister Zoran Tesanovic. The three representatives of the Serb Party of Democratic Progress resigned following international sanctions imposed on Republika Srpska (RS). 
In Banja Luka, meanwhile, local media reported Wednesday that prosecutors are investigating allegations that vote buying at the RS Parliament might have secured Tuesday's approval of the new entity cabinet. There are reports that deputies were offered thousands of euros to vote in favour of Pero Bukejlovic's cabinet. The Office of the High Representative had welcomed the election of a new government, urging it to implement reforms and co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Liberal Democratic Party announced on Friday (October 19th) that it has drafted a no-confidence motion against the current government of the National Liberal Party. The three-pronged motion, citing corruption, incompetence and abuses in office, has been sent to the Democratic Party -- the other party involved in this action -- for signing. The no-confidence vote is expected to be launched after elections for European Parliament, sometime around November 25th.
Separately, Bulgaria's parliament is set to debate a vote of no confidence against the country's cabinet Monday, with a vote expected on Tuesday. The motion was submitted over the government's policy on education, in light of the ongoing teachers' strike. (Darik, Focus, BGNES - 22/10/07; Hotnews.ro - 19/10/07; Netinfo - 18/10/07)

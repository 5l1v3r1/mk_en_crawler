PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government says more countries will recognise Kosovo's independence in the future. During a cabinet meeting Thursday (December 17th), Prime Minister Hashim Thaci thanked the Republic of Malawi for becoming the 64th state to recognise Kosovo, describing it as "important". Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni said the arguments Kosovo recently presented at the International Court of Justice, where the legality of Kosovo's independence is being challenged by Serbia, were "multidimensional" and were supported via oral arguments by 16 other countries.

NOORDWIJK, Netherlands -- The EU is on track to take over the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) from NATO in December, Dutch Defence Minister Henk Kamp said Friday (17 September), following talks with his counterparts with the other EU member states. Kamp, whose country holds the Union's rotating presidency, told reporters that preparations were proceeding smoothly and that the EU did not anticipate any obstacles. The Union's defence ministers also agreed to set up at least nine "battle groups", capable of deploying quickly in war zones, as well as a new paramilitary force -- similar to the Italian carabinieri -- which could be used to enforce order in post-conflict zones.

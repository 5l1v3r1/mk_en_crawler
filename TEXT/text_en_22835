SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) â Authorities arrested Syrian national Imad al Husini, aka Abu Hamza, on Monday (October 6th) and took him to an immigration centre, the security ministry announced on Tuesday. Hamza, a former Mujahedeen leader who lives in Sarajevo, fought on the Muslim side during the 1992-1995 conflict and received BiH citizenship. However, BiH authorities revoked his passport after a review of Bosnian citizenship procedures in 2007 that showed he obtained the document illegally. (Beta, RTRS, FoNet, B92, AKI - 07/10/08)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Police arrested 28 suspected members of the al-Qaeda terror network during simultaneous raids Thursday (April 9th) in the central province of Eskisehir and brought them in for questioning. Last month, Turkish media reported police had received US intelligence suggesting al-Qaeda militants could be plotting attacks on foreign targets from Turkey. In January, police killed a suspected al-Qaeda militant and arrested three others in Istanbul after the group attempted to rob a post office.

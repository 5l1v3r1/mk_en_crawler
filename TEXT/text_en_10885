SKOPJE, Macedonia -- In an interview published in Monday's (4 October) edition of Utrinski Vesnik, US Ambassador to Skopje Lawrence Butler says Washington supports the efforts of the Macedonian government to implement the new decentralisation laws and complete the denationalisation process by January 2005. Butler reiterated his position that rejection of the laws during next month's referendum would represent a setback for the country. 
Meanwhile, Macedonian Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva kicked off a two-day official visit to the Czech Republic on Sunday. Talks will focus on bilateral political co-operation and economic issues. (Utrinski Vesnik - 04/10/04; Makfax - 03/10/04)

ANKARA, Turkey -- The Constitutional Court on Wednesday (July 7th) delivered its final verdict on a package of constitutional amendments, which is to be subject to a public referendum on September 12th. The court did not annul the whole package, but asked for a slight -- though critical -- revision of the two most important articles, according to Hasim Kilic, president of the Court. Judges annulled certain parts of the two articles, but rejected demands to scrap the whole package on technical grounds, as requested by the main opposition Republican Peoples' Party. The partially annulled articles pertain to the structure of the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK). They were controversial due to the changes envisioned in the member appointment processes. If passed, they would have given the country's president more authority to appoint members of the Constitutional Court, as well as the HSYK. Though revisions are required, the referendum will be held as planned. Both the government and the opposition expressed disappointment with the Court's decision. (BBC, AP, Hurriyet - 07/07/10)

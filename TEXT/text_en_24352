PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government will continue its European agenda and efforts to harmonise local legislation with that of the EU's, even though five of the 27 member states have not recognised Kosovo's independence, the Ministerial Council for European Integration said at its first meeting Tuesday (March 10th). "The government has classified the process of European integration as a strategic and national priority," Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said, urging ministers to work hard without knowing when or if Kosovo will become part of the EU. 
In other news Tuesday, US Vice-President Joseph Biden ruled out the possibility of reducing the presence of US troops in Kosovo despite pressing needs in Afghanistan. "I don't think that we have to withdraw or take a decision on Afghanistan based on the progress or absence in Kosovo," said Biden, adding there was still work to be done in Kosovo. Biden was in Brussels discussing NATO's plans ahead of the April summit.
In Pristina meanwhile, Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi said on Tuesday that Kosovo and Serbia could not build co-operative relations while politicians in Belgrade continued to boycott and reject anything related to Kosovo. After a meeting with French Ambassador to Kosovo Delphine Borione, Krasniqi said all UNMIK efforts to create bridges of co-operation between Serbia and Kosovo had been in vain.

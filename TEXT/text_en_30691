SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The ruling GERB party will nominate its candidate for this year's presidential election in August, GERB leader and Prime Minister Boyko Borisov announced on Sunday (May 8th). He will be nominated along with two other members, according to the head of GERB's presidential campaign, Deputy Prime Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov. Borisov, however, implied that he might not run for president, as he is already prime minister. Recent polls suggest that Borisov is one of only a couple of GERB politicians who have the support to win the election. Bulgaria is to hold it at the end of the year and GERB has suggested October 23rd as a possible date. (Trud, Focus, Standart, 24 Chasa - 08/05/11)

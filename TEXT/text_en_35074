SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Civil Affairs Minister Safet Halilovic and UNDP Resident Representative Jens Toyberg-Frandzen sealed an $11.8m integrated mine action programme in Sarajevo earlier this week, according to a UNDP press release. The project is seen as crucial to implementation of the BiH Council of Ministers' national mine-clearing strategy.
A two-day international investment conference began as scheduled Thursday in Mostar, though overshadowed by the airplane crash that killed Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski, one of the participants. Opening the event, BiH presidency Chairman Dragan Covic said his country intends to do its best to launch a new stage of development and post-war revival, which would encourage foreign investors to view BiH as a serious partner.

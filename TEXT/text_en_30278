NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus and Israel signed an agreement on their common sea border that will allow them to press ahead in their search for energy sources in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the Cypriot Foreign Ministry announced on Friday (December 17th). The demarcation is seen as an important step for the exploration of oil and gas. Cyprus has already ratified an offshore border deal with Egypt. A similar agreement with Lebanon is awaiting ratification by the parliament in Beirut. (Bloomberg, AFP - 17/12/10)

What is the legal status of religious and ethnic minorities living in the Republic of Macedonia? 
The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) regulates the rights of  the members of communities and religious groups on two levels: the first one is through the principle of equality of all citizens before the Constitution and the laws, and the other one is through the prohibition of all forms of discrimination. The first principle has been clearly defined in Article 9 of the Constitution. This level as a primary value and a basis of the democratic and liberal society secures the protection of individual rights of every citizen of the Republic of Macedonia. The second level represents a system of special rights of the members  belonging to  the ethnic communities and religious groups. It provides for protection of and guarantees to the right to cultural identity of all citizens of the Republic of Macedonia as well as the equality of distinctive cultural communities as groups. The second  level of constitutional guarantees, further on developed through the relevant legal norms, secures the rights of every citizen to self-identification and to self-definition in a cultural sense as well as the right to fair opportunities for promotion of the cultural diversity and distinctiveness of the various ethnic communities. This second group of norms has been defined in Article 48 of the Constitution. 
Legal status of religious groups 
According to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonian: The freedom of religious confession is guaranteed. The right to express ones faith freely and publicly, individually or with others, is guaranteed. The Macedonian Orthodox Church, as well as the Islamic Religious Community in Macedonia, the Catholic Church, the Evangelical Methodist Church, the Jewish Community and other Religious communities and groups are separate from the state and are equal before the law. The Macedonian Orthodox Church, as well as the Islamic Religious Community in Macedonia, the Catholic Church, the Evangelical Methodist Church, the Jewish Community and other Religious communities and groups are free to establish schools and other social and charitable institutions, under a procedure regulated by law. The position of the religious groups, their establishment, practices, religious instruction and their religious schools as a mode of  exercise of the rights to religion and to religious confession have been further regulated with the Law on Religious Communities and Groups (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 35/97). The religious communities or groups are free to exercise their religious ceremonies and customs (Article 2). They perform their activities in accordance with the Constitution, laws and other regulations (Article 3, paragraph 2). A foreign citizen may perform religious practices and customs upon a request of a religious community or group, upon prior consent by the competent body for religious issues (Article 5).  Religious communities and groups may establish religious schools in a procedure and under conditions determined by the aforementioned law. In addition, they may establish social and humanitarian institutions in a procedure and under conditions specified by law (Article 7).  Religious communities and groups as well as their organisational forms register at the Commission for Relations with Religious Communities and Groups (Article 11, paragraph 1).  The seat of religious communities and groups, which perform religious practices and customs within the territory of the Republic of Macedonia has to be in the Republic of Macedonia (Article 12, paragraph 4).  Within their operations pursuant to the aforementioned Law the religious communities and groups may use media and publish printed matters (Article 15, paragraph 1). They also may collect donations for religious and humanitarian aims. Such donations may be collected in the facilities where religious practices and customs take place (Article 16). Religious ceremonies and other religious practices may take place in churches, mosques and other temples, as well as in backyards belonging to these facilities. They may also take place in cemeteries and other facilities of the religious community or group (Article 18, paragraph 1). Religious ceremonies and practices carried out in private homes (family celebrations, marriage, baptism, circumcision, confession, blessings of properties, etc.) do not require special approvals (Article 20, paragraph 1).  Persons in hospitals, elderly homes and other such institutions may express their faith and may be visited by priests in order to  perform religious ceremonies and practices. This must be done in accordance with the household order of the institution that accommodates them (Article 20, paragraph 3).  Religious communities and groups, pursuant to the aforementioned Law, may possess and acquire real estate and other matters necessary for their activities (Article 22, paragraph 1).  Religious instruction may be given only in public facilities where religious ceremonies and practices take place (Article 21, paragraph 1).  For the purpose of educating clerics, religious communities and groups have a right to establish religious schools at all education levels, except in the primary education. They may also establish student dormitories for the persons attending these institutions (Article 25, paragraph 1).  
Legal status of the members of non-majority ethnic communities  
The legal framework of the ethnic communities’ position has been regulated  by the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia pursuant to which respective laws regulating and elaborating the rights of communities’ members have been adopted.  Article 7 of the Constitution regulates the use of languages of the members of non-majority communities:  “The official language on the whole territory of the Republic of Macedonia and in its international relations is the Macedonian language, written using its Cyrillic alphabet. Any other language spoken by at least 20 percent of the citizens is also an official language, written using its alphabet, as specified in this article. Official personal documents of citizens speaking an official language other than Macedonian shall be issued in the Macedonian language, as well as in that language in accordance with the law. Any citizen living in a unit of local self-government in which at least 20 percent of the citizens speak an official language other than Macedonian may use any of the official languages and their alphabets in communication with the local office of the central government. The local offices with competencies in these units of local self-government shall reply in the Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet, as well as in the official language and alphabet used by the citizen. Any citizen may use any official language and its alphabet to communicate with Ministries, which shall reply in the Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet, as well as in the official language and alphabet used by the citizen. In the bodies of the Republic of Macedonia, any official language other than Macedonian may be used in accordance with the law.” Furthermore, in the units of local self-government, the language and the alphabet used by at least 20 percent of the citizens of the municipality is also an official language in that municipality, in addition to the Macedonian language and the Cyrillic alphabet. The bodies of the units of local self-government decide on the use of the languages and alphabets spoken by less than 20% of the citizens in that unit of local self-government. Pursuant to this Law, provisions regarding the use of an official language other than Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet have been incorporated in laws regulating the issues of personal documents (such as identification card, passports, certificates), civil, criminal and administrative procedures, the publication of the laws in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia, as well as the laws regulating the employment in public institutions, enterprises and other legal entities rendering public services, state and municipal bodies and the City of Skopje. Rights of the members of communities are also guaranteed with Article 8, paragraph 1, subparagraph 2 of the Constitution, which refers to the principle of equitable representation of members of all communities regarding the employment in state administrative bodies and other public institutions on all levels. This principle has already been implemented in the Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00, 112/00, 34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04 and 69/04), the Law on Labour Relations (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 80/93, 3/94, 14/95, 53/97, 59/97, 21/98, 25/00, 34/00, 50,01, 25/03 40/03 and 80/03 consolidated text) and the Law on Public Enterprises (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 38/96, 9/97, 6/02 and 40/03).  The Framework Agreement determines the timetable and the forms for accelerated training and recruitment of members of the ethnic communities in the state administration. This process has been especially highlighted in the police and military. Some recruitment has already been completed while some are still under way. For more details see I_J_4 and I_J_7. In comparison with the situation of the previous years, the results are quite positive. In particular cases, there are dramatic improvements. However, the process is still under way. Additional improvements in distinct areas are necessary in the representation of the members of the Albanian and Roma ethnic communities.     Article 9 of the Constitution determines that citizens of the Republic of Macedonia are equal in their freedoms and rights, regardless of gender, race, colour of skin, ethnic or social origin, political and religious beliefs,  property and social status. It means that all citizens are equal before the Constitution and law.  The Members of communities are also entitled to the free expression, fostering and development of their identity and community attributes. They may also use the symbols of their communities. The state guarantees protection of the ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity of all communities (Article 48 of the Constitution). The members of communities have a right to found cultural, artistic and educational institutions, as well as scientific and other associations for the expression, fostering and development of their identity. As regards education, the members of the communities have the right to instruction in their language in primary and secondary education in a mode determined by law. In schools where education is carried out in another language, the Macedonian language is also studied (Article 48 of the Constitution).  Pursuant to this Article, separate laws on primary, secondary and higher education have been adopted. Primary and secondary education instruction in the Republic of Macedonia is carried out in the Macedonian, Albanian, Turkish and in the Serbian languages and there are optional classes for studying the Vlach and the Roma languages. State-funded higher education is available also in Albanian and certain curriculums in Turkish. For more details see the answer to question I_J_9 and I_J_16.  The Constitution guarantees the protection, promotion and enhancement of the historical and artistic heritage of Macedonia and all communities in Macedonia and the treasures of which it is composed, regardless of their legal status (Article 56, paragraph 2).  Pursuant to provisions in Articles 9, 48 and 56 of the Constitution, laws regulating the rights of members of communities in the area of culture and the protection of cultural heritage contain provisions that directly relate to the protection and promotion of culture and cultural heritage of the members of the communities in the Republic of Macedonia.  When adopting laws that directly affect culture, use of language, education, personal documentation, and use of symbols, the Assembly makes decisions by a majority vote of the Representatives attending, within which there must be a majority of the votes of the Representatives attending who belong to non-majority communities (Article 69). Article 69 also applies during the adoption of local self-government laws, as well as laws on local finances, local elections, municipal boundaries and the City of Skopje (Article 114, paragraph 5). This Constitutional provision (frequently referred to as Badinter rule) has also been implemented  through the Assembly’s Rules of Procedure. Any dispute regarding the application of this provision within the Assembly, shall be resolved by the Committee on Inter-Community Relations.   According to Article 77 of the Constitution, the Assembly elects the Ombudsman by a majority vote of the total number of Representatives, within which there must be a majority of the votes of the total number of Representatives belonging to the communities not in the majority in the Republic of Macedonia. The Ombudsman protects the constitutional and legal rights of the citizens when bodies of state administration and other bodies and organisations with public mandates violate them. This provision emphasises that the Ombudsman shall give particular attention to safeguarding the principles of non-discrimination and equitable representation of communities in public bodies at all levels and in other areas of public life (this principle has also been incorporated into the Law on the Ombudsman (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 60/03).  The Committee on Inter-Community Relations has been established with Article 78 of the Constitution. This Article also determines its composition and competence. The Committee consists of 19 members of whom 7 members each are from the ranks of the Macedonians and Albanians within the Assembly, and a member each from among the Turks, Vlachs, Roma, Serbs and Bosniaks. If any of the communities does not have representatives, the Ombudsman, after consultation with relevant representatives of those communities, shall propose the remaining members of the Committee. The Assembly appoints the members of the Committee. The Committee considers issues of inter-community relations in the Republic and makes appraisals and proposals for their solution. The Assembly is obliged to take into consideration the appraisals and proposals of the Committee and to make decisions regarding them. In the event of a dispute among members of the Assembly regarding the application of the voting procedure specified in Article 69(2), the Committee shall decide by a majority vote whether the procedure applies.  Article 86, paragraph 2 determines that in appointing the three members, the President shall ensure that the Security Council as a whole equitably reflects the composition of the citizenship body of the Republic of Macedonia.  The legal and constitutional guarantees of the rights of members of communities in the Republic of Macedonia have also been expressed in Article 104, paragraph 2 of the Constitution pursuant to which three of the members of the Judicial Council of the Republic shall be appointed by a majority vote of the total number of Representatives, within which there must be a majority of the votes of the total number of Representatives who belong to the communities not in the majority in the  Republic of Macedonia.  Same voting principle (Article 69 of the Constitution) applies during the appointment of three judges of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (Article 109, paragraph 2).  Article 131, paragraph 4 determines that a decision to amend the Preamble, the articles on local self-government, and any provision relating to the rights of members of communities, including in particular issues on the language use of members of communities; equitable representation of members of communities; equality of all citizens before the Constitution and laws in freedoms and rights; freedom of religious confession and conviction; fostering and enhancement of the identity of community members; protection, promotion and enhancement of the historical and artistic heritage of Macedonia and all communities; voting in the Assembly on legal acts addressing issues of community members not in the majority in the  Republic of Macedonia (language, education, personal documents, use of symbols); voting on the Ombudsman and his/her competences regarding the principle of non-discrimination and equitable representation of members of communities at all levels; the composition of the Committee on Inter-Community Relations and its competence; the appointment of three members of the Judicial Council of the Republic and the appointment of three judges of the Constitutional Court of Macedonia, as well as a decision to add any new provision relating to the subject-matter of such provisions and articles, shall require a two-thirds majority vote of the total number of Representatives, within which there must be a majority of the votes of the total number of Representatives who belong to the communities not in the majority in the  Republic of Macedonia.  In addition to the foregoing Constitutional provisions on the legal status of members of ethnic communities and religious groups, Articles 8 and 118 of the Constitution secure the full implementation of international instruments in this area, which are directly applicable in the national law. Given that Macedonia has signed and ratified all significant international universal and regional human and minority rights instruments  (except the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which is in procedure of ratification), it is safe to conclude that Macedonia belongs to the small group of states in Europe that provides the highest legal protection of the rights of the members of the ethnic communities and religious groups. 
3. How is the principle of non-discrimination and equal treatment of minorities ensured? Please provide details of both constitutional and legislative provisions. 
1. The strategic determination of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia is the full exercise of the constitutionally guaranteed rights of the members of communities. At the same time, the Republic of Macedonia is undoubtedly determined to consistently adhere to all principles, values and standards contained in the relevant documents in this field, and, in particular in: the Framework Convention on the Protection of National Minorities; the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (Protocol 12); the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights; the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious or Linguistic Minorities; the Helsinki Final Act of CSCE, the Copenhagen Final Act and the Charter of Paris; the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination; the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The principle of non-discrimination is incorporated in the legal order of the Republic of Macedonia. The equality of the members of the communities arises from Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, which establishes the principle of non-discrimination stipulating that: citizens of the Republic of Macedonia are equal in their freedoms and rights, regardless of sex, race, colour of skin, ethnic and social origin, political and religious beliefs, property and social status. All citizens are equal before the Constitution and law. In Article 50 paragraph 1, the Constitution provides for equal protection of all citizens stipulating that every citizen may invoke the protection of freedoms and rights determined by the Constitution before the regular courts and the Constitutional Court of Macedonia, through a procedure based upon the principles of priority and urgency. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 54 paragraph 4 of the Constitution, the restriction of freedoms and rights cannot discriminate on grounds of  gender, race, colour of skin, language, religion, national or social origin, property or social status. In accordance with Article 110 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, the Constitutional Court protects the freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen against discrimination on these grounds. The constitutional provisions for equality of all before law and for the equal right to protection of citizens’ rights are implemented in the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/03). In accordance with Article 7 of this Law, every citizen is entitled to equal access to the courts for the protection of their rights and legal interests.  The anti-discriminatory principle upon appointment of judges is contained in the Law on Courts, as well as in the amendments of this Law adopted in 2003, implementing the provisions of the Ohrid Framework Agreement. Article 40 of this Law stipulates that when selecting judges and lay judges there must not be discrimination on the grounds of sex, race, colour of skin, ethnic or social origin, political and religious beliefs, property or social status. The selection of judges and lay judges without violating the legally prescribed criteria will ensure equitable representation of the citizens who belong to all communities. A similar provision is also contained in the Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04), which specifies that when appointing public prosecutors and deputy public prosecutors, without violating the criteria established with this Law, the principle of equitable representation of citizens belonging to all communities in the Republic of Macedonia will be applied.  Pursuant to Article 4 of the Law on Execution of Sanctions (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 3/97, 23/99 and 74/04) the rules for executing sanctions are applied impartially. Namely, discrimination on the grounds of race, colour of skin, sex, language, religion, political and other beliefs, ethnic or social origin, family relations, property or social or another status of the person subject to the sanction, is forbidden. In addition, in accordance with Article 8 of the Law on Organisation and Operation of the Public Administrative Bodies (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 58/00 and 44/02), public administrative bodies are obliged to provide citizens with an efficient and legal exercise of their constitutional freedoms and rights.  2. In addition to these constitutional and legal provisions that guarantee the right to non-discrimination, the legislation of the Republic of Macedonia contains a legal framework for effective equality of the members of communities, based on the protection of their ethnic, cultural and religious identity. According to Article 48 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia:   Members of communities have the right freely to express, foster and develop their identity and community attributes, and to use their community symbols. The Republic guarantees the protection of the ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity of all communities. Members of communities have the right to establish institutions for culture, art, education, as well as science and other associations for the expression, fostering and development of their identity. Members of communities have the right to instruction in their language in primary and secondary education, as determined by law. In schools where education is carried out in another language, the Macedonian language is also studied. The constitutional provision of Article 48 is made operational through the provisions of the following  laws: a)  The Law on Culture (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 31/98, 49/03 and 66/03) regulates the establishment and operation of cultural institutions of members of communities as one of the forms of expressing and fostering the identity of community attributes In the Republic of Macedonia there is a long tradition of various cultural institutions of the communities. b)  Article 45 paragraph 2 of the Law on Broadcasting (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 20/97 and 70/03) provides for an obligation for the public broadcasting company that broadcasts programmes within  the territory of the Republic of Macedonia (Macedonian Radio-Television) to broadcast programmes in the languages of the communities in addition to broadcasting programmes in Macedonian.  Furthermore, Article 45 paragraph 3 of the Law on Broadcasting, regulates that public broadcasting companies operating locally in areas where the members of communities are a majority, i.e. live in significant numbers, must also broadcast programmes in the language of the respective community. Article 45 paragraph 4 of the Broadcasting Law also stipulates the right of commercial broadcasting organisations (trade broadcasting companies) to broadcast programmes in languages of the members of the communities in addition to the programmes broadcasted in Macedonian.c)  Article 4 paragraph 3 of the Law on Religious Communities and Religious Groups (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 35/97) indicates that a citizen cannot be deprived of their constitutional and legal rights due to religious beliefs, belonging to a religious community or religious group, carrying out or taking part in religious practices and other forms of expressing faith. d)  Article 8 of the Law on Primary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 44/95, 24/96, 34/96, 35/97, 82/99, 29/02, 52/02- consolidated text, 40/03, 42/03, 63/04 and 82/04) states that for the members of communities who have instruction in a language other than Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet, the pedagogic and education work is performed in the language and script of the respective community in the way determined with this law. The members of the communities that are taught in the language of a community must also study the Macedonian language. According to Article 82 of the same Law, for the students who are members of the communities that follow instructions in a language other than Macedonian, the pedagogy records are kept and issued in the Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet and in the language and alphabet of instruction;  The Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 44/95, 24/96, 34/96, 35/97, 82/99, 29/2002, 52/02- consolidated text, 40/03, 42/03, 67/04) stipulates in Article 3 that every citizen has a right to secondary education under equal conditions established with this Law;  According to Article 6 of the Law on Higher Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 64/00 and 49/03), citizens of the Republic of Macedonia have the right to education in the higher education institutions of the Republic of Macedonia under equal conditions. e)  The Ministry of the Interior, inter alia, is obliged to protect human and citizen’s freedoms and rights guaranteed by the Constitution and to prevent the spread of ethnic, racial or religious intolerance; f)  The Law on Associations of Citizens and Foundations (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 31/98) in Article 23 stipulates that the activities of a citizen association will be prohibited if they infringe upon the human rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution or if they encourage ethnic, racial or religious hatred and intolerance; g)  The Law on Telecommunications (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 33/96, 17/98, 22/98 – consolidated text, 28/00, 04/02 and 37/04) explicitly prohibits the transmission and delivery of messages encouraging ethnic, racial or religious hatred and intolerance. h)  In Accordance with Article 3 of the Law on Inheritance (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 47/96), the citizens, under equal conditions are equal in inheritance. 3.

Article 8 paragraph 2 of the Law stipulates that the laws are also published in another official language and alphabet used by at least 20% of the citizens belonging to the communities in the Republic of Macedonia. More on the exercise of the right to use the languages of the communities in I_J_9I_J_12I_J_13I_J_14I_J_15I_J_164. The acts of violating the prohibition of discrimination are incriminated as criminal offences contained in the Criminal Code of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 37/96, 80/99, 4/02, 43/03 and 19/04): Article 137 – Violation of citizen equality, Article 319 – Causing ethnic, racial and religious hatred, division and intolerance and Article 417 – Racial and other discrimination.

With regard to specific articles e.g. principles of the Framework Agreement and aiming at more efficient and accelerated implementation of the Framework Agreement, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia established special bodies for coordination and monitoring of the activities and the achieved specific objectives.  In relation to the point Non-Discrimination and Equitable Representation of Members of Non-Majority Communities the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, established bodies entrusted with coordination and monitoring of the improvement of equitable representation of members of under-represented non-majority communities in the public administration and public enterprises.

More about the coordination of the implementation of the Framework Agreement in the answer to the question I_C_15In the first period of the implementation of the Framework Agreement, the main focus was placed on improving the equitable representation in the police and the Army of the Republic of Macedonia. Those provisions of the Framework Agreement were fully implemented. For more detailed information on the representation of the ethnic communities in the security forces, see the answers to the questions I_F_3  and I_J_7.

In February 2003 the Government of the Republic of Macedonia adopted a Basis for Preparation of a Programme for Improvement of Equitable Representation of Communities in the Public Administration and in Public Enterprises. In April 2003 additional measures were adopted for the improvement of equitable representation of communities in the public administration and public enterprises concerning the strengthening of translation capacities, the opening of bilingual jobs, the analysis of the vacant jobs within the administration and the preparatory training programmes for work in the public administration, as well as public communication activities. As a part of the additional measures, a training programme for 600 candidates belonging to the communities for jobs in the state administrative bodies (PACE programme) was set up. The first group of candidates were employed in December 2004 and January 2005, and the second group will be fully employed by February 2005. The training of 100 translators/interpreters belonging to the non-majority communities in the Republic of Macedonia will begin on 1 March 2005. Upon completion of the training programme, carried out within the framework of a 2004 CARDS project, the chosen candidates will be employed in the state administrative bodies and courts and will be obliged to work in those bodies for at least two years following the completion of the training programme. Article 2 of the Law Amending the Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic Macedonia”, No. 40/03) establishes an obligation for adoption of Annual Plans for Equitable Representation of Communities. The annual plans elaborate the current situation in the bodies (number and percentage of the members of communities in the total number of employees, presented for both the employees with status of civil servants and other employees in the said bodies), the employment plans, professional development and training programmes, as well as an assessment of the fiscal implications concerning the aforementioned activities. This means that, in addition to the constitutional principle of equal access to jobs and the merit principle, the principle of equitable representation of citizens belonging to all communities, at all positions defined by the Law on Civil Servants, is applied in the recruitment of civil servants, without prejudice to the criteria of expertise and competence (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 59/00, 112/00, 34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04 and 69/04). The public announcements for employment of civil servants are published by the Civil Servant Agency (CSA) in at least two daily newspapers, one of which published in the language spoken by at least 20% of the citizens who speak an official language other than the Macedonian. For more details see I_C_6For the successful implementation of the principle of equitable representation, several laws have been amended, including the Law on Labour Relations (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 80/93, 03/94, 14/95, 53/97, 59/97, 21/98, 25/00, 34/00, 50/01, 25/03, 40/03 and 80/03 - consolidated text), the Law on Public Enterprises (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 40/03), the Law on Primary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 63/04), the Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 67/04), the Law on Pupils’ and Students’ Standards (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 40/03), the Law on the Public Attorney (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 60/03), the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 64/03), and the Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 69/04).

5. What measures have been taken to ensure proper budgetary allocations to meet equitable representation objectives? Please specify the budgets allocated for this purpose since 2001. 
The budgetary allocations to meet equitable representation objectives is provided entirely from the State Budget of the Republic of Macedonia in two ways, through: The funding allocated for the implementation of the Strategic Priorities of the Government and Within items for budget beneficiaries covering salaries and allowances of the employees. Appropriate allocations were made in 2002 and 2003 in the budgets of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, covering the costs resulting from obligations laid down by the Framework Agreement concerning equitable representation of communities in the security forces. For more details see I_J_7In the 2004 Budget, funds were allocated for the Strategic Priorities of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, covering the costs of the following: -  Employment of 600 civil servants trained within the framework of the PACE programme, a part of CARDS for 2002;  -  Employment of civil servants in various state administrative bodies at different levels (including managerial staff). The 2005 Budget envisages that state administrative bodies (except the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, for more details see I_J_7), are to cover the costs of the employment from their own budgets for the following: Translators/interpreters for state bodies and courts; Civil servants at different levels; and -  Salaries of those previously employed in order to meet the requirement of equitable representation (which are already included in their own budgets). All vacant positions created by retirement, resignation or dismissal will be adequately filled so that the principle of equitable representation is met. Gross salaries are paid from the State Budget of the Republic of Macedonia to employees having a status of civil servants as well as to employees in the public administration. The amounts paid for gross salaries by ethnic affiliation of employees are given in Table 1 (the data includes the employees in the Army of the Republic of Macedonia and Ministry of the Interior) In 2001 and 2002 the data on the number of employees and payment of salaries in the public administration have not been processed in the Ministry of Finance and hence data for these years is not available.

Note: Table 2 does not contain data on “number of new employees in 2002” and “payed gross salaries for 2002” structured by ethic affiliation, due to lack of such analytical data. The total figure is only the reported cost for the new recruitments in the Ministry of the Interior and the Army. The reduction of number of employees is presented with negative figure. However, these employees have been remunerated for a certain period of the fiscal year until the termination of their employment, which has been shown as a budgetary expense in the table. In order to achieve equitable representation of community members in the Ministry of Defence, salaries and allowances and the costs of training of the newly-employed persons have been planned and allocated in the State Budget.  The costs for training by year are given in Table 3: Table 3 (additional costs in the Ministry of Defence, apart from salaries which are given within the data in Table 1)

In the Ministry of the Interior, the basis for the improvement of equitable representation of members belonging to communities are the Constitutional Amandements, the existing legislation in the area of internal affairs: the Law on Internal Affairs (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 19/95, 55/97, 38/02, 33/03 and 19/04), the Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00, 112/00, 34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04 and 69/04) and the adequate provisions of the Framework Agreement. To achieve the full implementation of the provisions of the Ohrid Framework Agreement and to comply with the constitutional amendments and the constitutional principle of equitable representation of non-majority communities in state administrative bodies, the Ministry of the Interior has accelerated the process of employment of members belonging to non-majority communities in the Republic of Macedonia, principally through the use of public announcements for the admission of trainee police officers and for the admission of persons with the status of civil servants belonging to communities, as well as through the employment of persons for operational positions within the departments of the Ministry of the Interior. The admission process for trainee police officers has been supported and implemented with the assistance of the international community, particularly through the testing, selection and training of candidates at the Skopje Police Academy. The Ministry of the Interior has made modifications to its Rulebook on Systematisation of Posts, introducing bilingual positions.

A total of 574 persons will be transferred from the Ministry of Defence, of which 165 are members of the Albanian community. Given that at the moment there is no information what positions these persons will occupy at the Ministry of the Interior, it is impossible to show them in a table by rank and position. Together with the aforementioned new employment and transfers, in 2005 the Ministry of the Interior will have 13.120 employees, of which 1.908 will be members of the Albanian community, i.e. the Albanian community will be represented with 14,5%. A total of MKD 796.227.132 from the State Budget has been spent on the salaries, allowances, personal equipment and education of the newly employed in the police forces since 2001 to the present day for the employment of members of communities in accordance with the provisions of the Framework Agreement.

With regard to the Ministry of Defence, the basis for the development of plans and programmes to achieve equitable representation of members belonging to communities is the existing legislation in the area of defence (the Law on Defence (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 42/01 and 5/03), the Law on Military Service in the Army of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 2/02, 98/02, 25/03 and 71/03), the Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00,112/00, 34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04 and 69/04)), as well as the National Security and Defence Concept, the Strategic Defence Review of the Republic of Macedonia (First, Second and Third Stages), and the provisions  of the Framework Agreement. The programme for the implementation of the Strategic Defence Review of the Republic of Macedonia was endorsed by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (No. 23-3084/1 of 23 June 2003), while the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia adopted it through a Resolution for Development and Transformation on 26.05.2004 (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 34/04). The Strategic Defence Review represents the starting point in the development of the policy of equitable representation of members of non-majority communities in the Ministry of Defence and in the Army of the Republic of Macedonia. The Strategic Defence Review contains provisions concerning the equitable representation of members of these communities in the Ministry of Defence and in the Army of the Republic of Macedonia (ARM). The Second Stage of the Strategic Defence Review contains proposed plans for staffing and a plan for increasing the percentage of members of communities in the total staff levels of the Ministry and of the Army of the Republic of Macedonia in the period 2004-2013. The Third Stage of the Strategic Defence Review — the Programme for the Transformation of Defence and the ARM — contains similar provisions in the chapter entitled Staff, Situation and Projections. On 25.08.2004, in accordance with the Strategic Defence Review, the Minister of Defence adopted a Strategy on Human Resource Management in the Ministry of Defence as well as an Operational Plan and Methodology for the preparation of programmes concerning the implementation of the Strategy on Human Resource Management. The policy of equitable representation of non-majority communities is one of the twenty policies established by this Strategy. The objectives set forth by the policy of equitable representation of members belonging to communities are planned to be achieved in the period 2004-2007 for the staff having secondary education, and by the year 2013 for the staff having higher education. Within the framework of these activities and in accordance with the Law on Civil Servants, the following plans were developed: the Annual Plan on Equitable Representation of Communities in the Ministry of Defence for 2004 (passed on 31.03.2004), and the Annual Plan on Equitable Representation of Communities in the Ministry of Defence for 2005 (passed on 31.08.2004).

What measures have been taken in relation to the use of flags and community symbols? 
One of the accepted frameworks in the Ohrid Framework Agreement is the “expression of identity”, which envisions the use of symbols that mark the community’s identity. 
Pursuant to this principle and the Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia in 2001, Amendment VIII pertaining to Article 48 (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 91/01):   Members of communities have the right freely to express, foster and develop their identity and community attributes, and to use their community symbols; The Republic guarantees the protection of the ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity of all communities. In order to implement this constitutional provision on symbols marking the community’s identity, a Law on Use of Symbols of Members of Communities shall be prepared and is to be adopted in the first half of 2005. 
9. What proportion of university students belongs to national minorities? Do enrolment procedures at State universities include rules or programmes that encourage the enrolment of candidates belonging to non-majority communities, and how is this implemented? 
The ethnic breakdown of students in the Republic of Macedonia does not fully correspond with the ethnic structure of the population. Consequently, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia has been implementing policies in order to increase the percentage of students who are members of ethnic communities not in the majority population of Macedonia. As of 1994 the Government sets a separate (additional) quota for government funding of higher education of students belonging to non-majority communities depending on their proportion in the total population (for example if 1000 are to be enrolled under state funding, in addition to this 1000 student quota, 230 Albanians could additionally be enrolled under state funding, since at that time the percentage of Albanians was 22.6%). This instrument of affirmative action has to a certain extent improved the representation of students members of ethnic communities after 1994 (for instance the representation of members of the Albanian ethnic community has increased from 2,23% in 1992/93 to 5.7% in 2000/01). As this increase has not been sufficient the Government introduced additional measures. Thus in 1998 the Government defined a new category of students at state universities who individually pay the costs, which in turn provided for an additional increase of the total number of students, including those who do not belong to the majority population in the Republic of Macedonia. This intervention may, however, be noted only through an analysis of the absolute number of students and not through the analysis of a percentage breakdown of students by ethnic affiliation. In order to yet increase the representation of students of ethnic communities the first private university in Macedonia in 2001 was opened (the University of Southeast Europe in Tetovo) with a significant support by the international community. The languages used at the University are Albanian, Macedonian and English, and thus the total number of Albanians enrolled in higher education institutions in 2003/2004 has increased to 10,4% of the total number of students. The Law Amending the Law on Higher Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 49/03) has raised the principle of affirmative action on the level of legal obligation in the process of enrolment at state universities. The Law on the Establishment of State University in Tetovo was adopted (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 08/04), fulfils the obligation for state funding of higher education in the language spoken by at least 20% of the population in the Republic of Macedonia. The instruction at the Tetovo University (in Albanian) started in the 2004/05 academic year, following the accreditation of this higher education institution. The members of ethnic communities may also exercise their right to education in mother tongue at the state universities in Skopje and Bitola. These universities have Departments for Albanian language and literature and Turkish language and literature. The Pedagogical Faculty in Skopje and Štip that train teachers for primary and secondary education also offer studies in Albanian and Turkish language.  The Ministry of Education and Science adopted a decision on including the Vlach language and literature in the curricula of the Pedagogical Faculty in Štip in order to encourage the participation of members of communities who are less than 20% of the total population in Macedonia. Additionally, there is a project under way to include the Roma language in the curricula of one of the Faculties of Philology in Macedonia. The Academy of Theatrical Arts also comprises Departments for the Albanian and Turkish drama. After the establishment of the State University of Tetovo a total of 2350 students have been enrolled in  the two accredited academic years. In the academic 2004/05 the total number of Albanian students has increased to 15,5% of the total number of students at all universities, with a possibility of growth (taking into account the enrolment period in February 2005). The participation of the Albanian ethnic community in the total population is 25,17%.  Below is the table containing particular data on the foregoing.

Consequently, positive trends have been detected in all non-majority communities (excluding the Serb community). This positive trend especially pertains to the Albanian ethnic community.
10. Has the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities been ratified and how is it implemented? 
The Republic of Macedonia ratified the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (FCPNM) on 10.04.1997. It entered into force on 01.02.1998. The Initial Report on the Implementation of the Framework Convention was submitted in September 2003, which was followed by a visit of a Delegation of the FCPNM Advisory Committee in December 2003. The Committee drafted and adopted its Opinion in May 2004 and submitted it to the Government in June 2004. In the beginning of January 2005, the Government’s Commentary was submitted to the Advisory Committee. A debate and adoption of a resolution is expected in the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.  As regards the implementation of the FCPNM, one should take into consideration the fact that besides the obligations under the Convention, the basic framework for the minority policy in the Republic of Macedonia has been the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, which generally goes beyond the standards determined  by the Framework Convention for the Protection of the National Minorities.  Taking into account the Constitutional Amendments of 2001 (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 91/01), in 2003, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia submitted  a revised Declaration, under which: The term national minorities used in the Framework Convention and the provisions thereof, shall apply to the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia living within its borders who are part of the Albanian people, the Turkish people, the Vlach people, the Serbian people, the Roma people and the Bosniak people. The legislation of the Republic of Macedonia is compatible with the provisions of the Convention. 
The right to free expression of national identity, encompassed with Article 3 of the Convention, corresponds with Article 8 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), according to which a fundamental value of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia is the free expression of national identity. In 2002, this constitutional provision was implemented in the Law Amending the Law on the Census of the Population, Households and Dwellings in the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 43/02). Pursuant to Article 9 of the Law, for persons covered by the Census, data shall also be collected on their ethnic characteristics, i.e. their ethnic affiliation and religious confession. 
The right to equality before the law and equal treatment, guaranteed with Article 4 of the Convention has been included in Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia:  Citizens of the Republic of Macedonia are equal in their freedoms and rights, regardless of  gender, race, colour of skin, ethnic or social origin, political or religious conviction, property and social status. Citizens are equal before the Constitution and law. Every citizen may invoke the protection of freedoms and rights established by the Constitution before the regular courts and before the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia, through a procedure based upon the principles of priority and urgency. Judicial protection of the legality of individual acts of the state administration and of other institutions performing public mandates is guaranteed. A citizen has the right to be informed on human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as to actively contribute, individually or jointly with others, towards their promotion and protection (Article 50 of the Constitution). The constitutional provisions pertaining to the equality of all before the  The initial Declaration included in the ratification instrument deposited by the Republic of Macedonia on 10.04.1997 reads as follows: The term “national minorities’ used in the Framework Convention and the provisions of the same Convention shall be applied to the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia who live within its borders and who are part of the Albanian people, Turkish people, Vlach people, Serbian people, Roma people and Bosniak people. law and to the equal right to protection have been implemented in the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/03). 
The right of members of communities to maintain and develop their culture and to preserve the essential elements of their identity – their religion, language, traditions and cultural heritage - guaranteed in Article 5 of the Convention, has been incorporated in the legislation of the Republic of Macedonia. Namely, in accordance with Article 48 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, members of communities have a right freely to express, foster and develop their identity and community attributes, and to use their community symbols; The Republic guarantees the protection of the ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity of all communities. Members of communities have the right to establish institutions for culture, art, education as well as science and other associations for the expression, fostering and development of their identity. This constitutional provision has been implemented in the Law on Culture (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 31/98, 49/03 and 66/03), Law on Local Self-Government (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 5/02), Law on Copyright and Related Rights (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 47/96, 03/98, 98/02 and 04/05) and in all other relevant laws.  
The right to peaceful assembly, freedom of association, freedom of expression and freedom of thought, conscience and religion encompassed with Article 7 of the Convention has been implemented in the Constitution and the laws in the Republic of Macedonia. Namely, Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees the right of citizens to assemble peacefully and to express public protest without prior announcement or a special license. The exercise of this right may only be restricted during a state of emergency or war. The constitutional provision on the right to peaceful assembly has been regulated with the Law on Public Gatherings (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 55/95). The freedom of association has been guaranteed in Article 20 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. Citizens are guaranteed freedom of association to exercise and protect their political, economic, social, cultural and other rights and convictions. Citizens may freely establish associations of citizens and political parties, join them or resign from them. The programmes and activities of associations of citizens and political parties may not be directed at the violent destruction of the constitutional order of the Republic, or at encouragement or incitement to military aggression or ethnic, racial or religious hatred or intolerance. Military or paramilitary associations, which do not belong to the Armed Forces of the Republic of Macedonia, are prohibited. The constitutional provisions on the freedom of association have been applied in the Law on Political Parties (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 76/04) and in the Law on Associations of Citizens and Foundations (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 31/98). 
The right of every member of a community to manifest his or her religion or belief and to establish religious institutions, organisations and associations guaranteed in Article 8 of the Convention has been incorporated in the legislation. Namely, Article 19 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia guarantees the freedom of religious confession. The right to express one’s faith freely and publicly, individually or with others is guaranteed. The Macedonian Orthodox Church, as well as the Islamic Religious Community in Macedonia, the Catholic Church, the Evangelical Methodist Church, the Jewish Community and other Religious communities and groups are separate from the state and equal before the law. The Macedonian Orthodox Church, as well as the Islamic Religious Community in Macedonia, the Catholic Church, the Evangelical Methodist Church, the Jewish Community and other Religious communities and groups are free to establish schools and other social and charitable institutions, by way of a procedure regulated by law. Constitutional provisions guaranteeing the freedom of religious confession and the status of religious communities and groups have been applied in the Law on Religious Communities and Groups (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No 35/97) – for more details see I_J_2.  
The right to freedom of expression of every member of a community included in Article 9 of the Convention has been implemented in the national legislation. According to Article 16, the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia guarantees the freedom of speech, public address, public information and the establishment of institutions for public information. Furthermore, free access to information and the freedom of reception and transmission of information have been guaranteed. The Framework Agreement, in Annex C - Implementation and Confidence-Building Measures, item 6 - Culture, Education and Use of Languages, emphasises the need to increase the assistance for projects in the area of media in order to further strengthen radio, TV and print media, including Albanian language and multiethnic media, as well as to increase professional media training programmes for members of communities not in the majority in Macedonia. In that sense, provisions of the Broadcasting Law (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 20/97 and 70/03) set forth an obligation of the public broadcasting enterprise that broadcasts on the entire territory of the Republic of Macedonia – Macedonian Radio and Television, to  broadcast, apart from Macedonian language programmes, programmes in the languages of all communities. Hence, the Macedonian Radio and Television has fully allocated its Third Channel for the community languages programmes. Public enterprises broadcasting at the local level are obliged to broadcast programmes in the language of a community that constitutes a majority or a substantial number of the population in the respective area. In addition, Article 45, paragraph 4 of the Law on Broadcasting provides for the right of the commercial broadcasters (commercial broadcasting companies) to broadcast, apart from the Macedonian language programmes, programmes in the language of communities. 
The right of the members of communities to use their language, in private and in public, orally and in writing, in relations between these persons and the administrative authorities, as well as the right to be informed promptly, in a language which he/she understands, of the reasons for his/her arrests, guaranteed with Article 10 of the Convention, have been respectively implemented in Article 7 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia which governs the right to use of languages, the Law Amending the Law on General Administrative Procedure (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 44/02), the Law Amending the Law on Criminal Procedure  (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 44/02).  The right of member of a community to use his/her surname and name in his/her language and the right to display signs, inscriptions and other information of a private nature visible to the public, encompassed in Article 11 of the Convention, have been implemented in the legislation of the Republic of Macedonia. Namely, pursuant to Article 1 of the Law on Personal Name (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 08/95), the personal name is a citizen’s personal right. A citizen uses  his/her personal name as written in the Birth Register. Members of communities have the right to use their community’s language and alphabet when writing their personal name in the registers and IDs.  Pursuant to the Law Amending the Law on Travel Documents of the Citizens of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 20/03 and 46/04), for citizens who speak an official language other than Macedonian, upon their personal request, the form for the passport and emergency passport shall, as well, be printed in the official language and the alphabet that they use. In addition, for citizens who speak an official language other than Macedonian, upon their personal request, the data that are filled in the passport and the emergency passport may be written in the Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet and in the official language and alphabet used by the respective citizen. For citizens who speak a language other than the official, upon their personal request, the personal name data that are filled in the passport, may be written in the Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet and in the language and alphabet used by the respective citizen. The Law Amending the Law on Personal Identity Card (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 38/02 and 16/04) prescribes that for the citizens who speak an official language other than Macedonian, the form of the identity card shall be printed and the data therein shall be written in the official language and alphabet used by the respective citizen.  Pursuant to the Law Amending the Law on the Road Traffic Safety  (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 38/02 and 38/04), citizens who speak an official language other than the Macedonian, the form of the driving licence, licence for tractor driver and the driving certificate, shall be printed and the data therein shall be written, besides in Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet, in the official language and alphabet used by the respective citizen. Identical solution exists with regard to the printing of the form for traffic licence and the vehicle registration certificate, and the data filled therein. The Law Amending the Law on Personal Registers (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/02) prescribes that in the local self-government units in which at least 20% of the citizens speak an official language other than Macedonian, the form of the registers shall be printed and the data therein shall also be written in the official language and alphabet used by the respective citizen. The certificates being issued on the basis of the registers shall be written in Macedonian and in the official language and the alphabet used by the respective citizen. 
The obligation of the state to promote equal opportunities for access to education for members of communities included in Article 12 of the Convention, has been implemented pursuant to the Law on Protection of Children  (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 98/00, 17/03 and 65/04), Law on Primary Education  (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 44/95, 24/96, 34/96, 35/97, 82/99, 29/02, 52/02- consolidated text, 40/03, 42/03, 63/04 and 82/04), Law on Secondary Education  (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 44/95, 24/96, 34/96, 35/97, 82/99, 29/2002, 52/02- consolidated text, 40/03, 42/03 and 67/04) and Law on Higher Education  (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 64/00 and 49/03). 
The right of members of communities to set up private educational establishments guaranteed in Article 13 of the Convention has been implemented in the legislation of the Republic of Macedonia, with the exception of the primary education. Namely, pursuant to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (Article 45), citizens are entitled to establish private schools at all levels, with the exception of the primary education. Article 34 of the Law on Higher Education guarantees the right to establishment of higher education institutions.  

The right to learn one’s language, as well as the obligation of the state, within the framework of the education system and in areas inhabited by members of communities traditionally or in substantial numbers, to ensure teaching of or instruction in their languages, encompassed in Article 14 of the Convention, have been incorporated in the legislation of the Republic of Macedonia. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia provides full pre-school, primary and secondary education in community languages, in accordance with the conditions prescribed by law.  Article 95 of the Law on Higher Education guarantees the right to conduct the teaching at the state institutions of higher education, under respective curricula, in the language of a community other than the Macedonian. In doing so, state funding is provided for the higher education and for the language used by at least 20% of the population of the Republic of Macedonia.  As regards the teaching at private institutions of higher education, the same Article stipulates that it may be conducted in the languages of communities that are not in the majority in the Republic of Macedonia or in some internationally spoken languages. 
The right to effective participation of members of communities in cultural, social and economic life and in public affairs, in particular those affecting them, guaranteed in Article 15 of the Convention, has been implemented in the Constitution and the laws in the Republic of Macedonia. Namely, pursuant to Article 22 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, every citizen who has attained the age of 18 years acquires the right to vote. The right to vote is equal, universal and is exercised at free elections by secret ballot. Persons deprived of the civil capacity do not have the right to vote. The right to vote and its exercise have been applied in a number of laws, such as the Law on Election of Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 42/02, 50/02 and  46/04), Law on Election of the President of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 20/94, 48/99 and 11/04), Law on Local Elections  (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 45/04, 52/04 and 60/04), Law on Voters’ List  (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 42/02 and 35/04) and Law on Polling Stations (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 50/97). Article 14 of the Convention has also been implemented in a number of other laws, which include provisions on non-discrimination, like the Law on Courts, Law on Culture, Law on Civil Servants  (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00, 112/00, 34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04, 69/04) etc.  
The right to freedom of movement and to free choice of place of residence, guaranteed in Article 17 of the Convention, has been implemented in the Constitution and the corresponding laws  of the Republic of Macedonia. Namely, pursuant to Article 27 of the Constitution, every citizen of the Republic of Macedonia has the right to free movement within the territory of the Republic and freely to choose his/her place of residence; every citizen has the right to leave the territory of the Republic and to return to the Republic; the exercise of these rights may be restricted by law only in cases where it is necessary for the protection of the security of the Republic, criminal investigation or protection of public health. The constitutionally guaranteed right to free movement and the right to free choice of place of residence have been applied in the Law on Reporting Dwellings and Residence of Citizens (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia” Nos. 36/92, 12/93 and 43/00). 
11. Provide an overview (including statistics) of the situation of Roma, and the Government’s plans for their integration (adoption and implementation, including details on funding, with examples of concrete results). 
a) Current situation: The 1991 Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia equally treats the Roma with other communities. Namely, in accordance with Amendment IV to the Constitution, “The citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, the Macedonian people, as well as citizens living within its borders, who are part of the Albanian people, the Turkish people, the Vlach people, the Serb people, the Roma people, the Bosniak people... taking responsibility for the present and future of their fatherland... equal in rights and obligations towards the common good - the Republic of Macedonia... have decided to establish the Republic of Macedonia as an independent, sovereign state, with the intention of establishing and consolidating the rule of law, guaranteeing human rights and civil liberties, providing peaceful coexistence, social justice, economic well-being and prosperity in the life of the individual and the community...” The Republic of Macedonia is the first state in the world to mention the Roma in its Constitution and recognise them as a constituent people. The Roma have freely expressed their ethnic affiliation in all censuses conducted in the Republic of Macedonia after 1948 (the forms have contained sections on ethnic affiliation, including a section for the Roma). As of 1994, census forms have also been printed in the Roma language in addition to Macedonian. According to data from the last Census in 2002, there were 53.879 Roma living in the Republic of Macedonia, representing 2,66% of the total population. This was an increase in their number as compared to the 1994 Census, when the number of the Roma was 43.707, or 2,2% of the total population. A breakdown of the Roman population according to age and gender is given in the following table: Total population of Roma in the Republic of Macedonia by age (5-yearly increments) and by gender, 2002 Census

Several political parties of ethnic Roma have been founded during this period, including the Party for the Full Emancipation of the Roma (PFER), the United Party of the Roma (UPR), the Alliance of the Roma in Macedonia, the United Party of the Roma, and the Democratic Party of the Roma. The PFER and UPR later joined forces to form the United Party for Emancipation. Experience has shown that Roma parties often form coalitions with the major political parties. Since the first multiparty elections in the Republic of Macedonia, the Roma have been represented in the Assembly (two Representatives in 1990,  one Representative in 1994, 1998 and 2002 respectively). One of the members of the Committee on Inter-Ethnic Relations, which consists of 19 members, should be elected from the ranks of the Roma Representatives in the Assembly (If a community has no Representatives in the Assembly, following consultations with representatives of that community, the Ombudsman proposes the rest of the members of the Committee). One municipality In the Republic of Macedonia (Šuto Orizari, near Skopje) has a predominantly Roma population. The mayor is an ethnic Roma, as well as the majority of the councillors. There are between 30 and 40 Roma non-governmental organisations which are active in the  fields of human rights, culture, education, environmental issues and infrastructure projects. The right to  free expression of cultural identity is fully guaranteed and is also supported by public funds supporting publishing, public events etc. There are a number of Roma folk and drama groups, some of them having a long tradition. Even though the question of standardisation of the Roma language in Europe and the world is a complex one because of the existence of many dialects, the first grammar book of the Roma language was published in the Republic of Macedonia in 1980. This is considered the first attempt on an international level for the standardisation of the Roma language. A number of publications in the Roma language have beep printed ever since, including a textbook for supplementary courses in Roma.  Currently there is optional instruction in Roma language in a school in the municipality of Šuto Orizari. There are a number of periodicals printed in Roma, as well several television and radio stations. Within the programmes of the public broadcaster Macedonian Radio and Television, Macedonian Television broadcasts two thirty-minute programmes a week in Roma, and Macedonian Radio broadcasts a daily thirty-minute programme in the Roma language through Network 3. Radio Kumanovo has a Roma department, and there are also programmes in Roma broadcast by Radio Tetovo (thirty minutes a day).  In 2002, 4.032 hours of television programmes were broadcast in Roma (out of the total of 158.289 hours), as well as 1.385 hours of radio programmes (out of the total of 133.917 hours). Two private television stations broadcast programmes in both Roma and Macedonian — BTR and TV Šutel. The current social and economic situation of Roma, who are especially burdened by transition problems, places them in the category of the poorest citizens of the Republic of Macedonia. According to the data of the Employment Agency of the Republic of Macedonia, the total number of unemployed Roma on 31 August 2004 was 17.014 (4.3% of the total number of the unemployed), of which 7.114 were women. Below is the breakdown of their educational levels and gender.

Data from 2003 shows that about 12% of the total number of households in the Republic of Macedonia receiving public welfare benefits (64.500) belong to the Roma community (about 7.700 households).

Government plans for integration: In early 2004, in order to develop a consistent approach towards the improvement of the situation of the Roma community and their swifter integration into society, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia began preparing a National Strategy for Roma, whose draft was officially presented in mid-September 2004. The organisation of a round table discussion in mid-October 2004 marked the beginning of the public debate on the Draft Strategy for Roma. The basic aim of the public debate was to allow for greater participation, particularly on the part of the Roma community in the preparation of this document. The National Strategy for Roma in the Republic of Macedonia was adopted by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia on 31.01.2005 and its implementation can begin. The most important objective of the Strategy is to promote the strengthening of the position and integration of Roma within the main social and economic structures in the Republic of Macedonia by determining the best way to realise a meaningful multidimensional state policy, which is to serve as a pivotal cornerstone on which concrete projects dealing with more specific areas will be built. The Strategy should also respond to the genuine needs, problems and priorities of the Roma and to introduce a balanced and sustainable approach by combining the set objectives in harmony with the legally guaranteed human rights and state policy. The Strategy is a complex document, which couldn’t be prepared with the participation of a single Ministry or by the Government alone. It was imperative that representatives of the Roma community should take part in both its preparation and implementation so that a consensus and broad support can be achieved during its implementation on the ground. Only a multidimensional approach in the Strategy’s development and application can guarantee a successful implementation. The general aims of the National Strategy for Roma are as follows: A greater integration of Roma in the mainstream of Macedonian society; The reduction of poverty among Roma as the most marginalised group; The long-term development of every aspect of the Roma community; The full engagement of the Macedonian state in the preparation and implementation of the priorities set forth in the Strategy; and The establishment of the normative and institutional prerequisites for the reaching European Union standards. The preparation of this important document for Roma was supported by the Project on Ethnic Relations (PER) organisation. In addition to this, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia took an active part in the initiative known as the Decade of Roma Inclusion. At the initiative of the World Bank and the Open Society Institute, eight Prime Ministers from the governments in South-Eastern Europe were invited to Budapest in 2003 (30.06 -01.07) — those of Macedonia, Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. They expressed their commitment to participate in the initiative and to make an active contribution to a more rapid integration of Roma in their countries. The first conference of the Steering Committee was held in December 2003 in Budapest, where several important decisions were made:   A Steering Committee of the Decade was established where each state is represented by one member;   A Secretariat of the Decade was formed with its seat in Budapest;   Each state was obliged to establish a National Working Group, which would include Roma representatives for the preparation of National Action Plans of the Decade;   Four priority areas of the Decade were identified - education, employment, healthcare and housing - for which the National Working Groups would develop action plans, as well as three main themes which should permeate the priority areas: the reduction of poverty, women’s issues and non-discrimination. The Macedonian Prime Minister appointed a National Coordinator of the Decade of Roma Inclusion. A National Working Group was formed whose members include representatives of several ministries, state institutions, political representatives of the Roma and representatives of Roma NGOs, which developed four Draft Action Plans for the four priority areas of the Decade. These were distributed to several ministries, to political parties of the Roma and to virtually all Roma NGOs for comments and suggestions. A conference was organised in October 2004 which attracted a large number of representatives from political parties and NGOs of the Roma. The National Action Plans were finalised and adopted on 31.01.2005 by the Government. 
12. Provide a description of existing language legislation and language training programmes for minority languages. Is language legislation in line with the Council of Europe's recommendations? 
The Republic of Macedonia ratified the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (FCPNM) of the Council of Europe on 10.04.1997. The Convention came into force on 01.02.1998, after which the provisions of the Convention became a constituent part of national legislation. The Republic of Macedonia also signed the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (25.07.1996), which has still not been ratified. Article 12 of the FCPNM concerning the right to education in the languages of the minorities, adequate opportunities for teacher training and access to textbooks, the promotion of equal opportunities regarding access to education at all levels for persons belonging to national minorities, has been incorporated into the provisions of the laws on primary, secondary and higher education in the Republic of Macedonia. Article 3 and Article 8 of the Law on Primary Education  (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 44/95, 24/96, 34/96, 35/97, 82/99, 29/02, 52/02( consolidated text), 40/03, 42/03 and 63/04) guarantees equal rights in primary education to all children, Macedonians and those who are a part of the Albanian, Turkish, Roma, Vlach, Serb and Bosniak people, as well as to all others. For pupils who are part of the Albanian and Turkish communities, the education process in kindergarten groups (see Table 1) and primary schools (See Table 2) is performed in the pupil’s mother tongue using the corresponding alphabets. The pupils of Serbian, Turkish, Roma and Vlach ethnic affiliations, who receive instruction in Macedonian, can also learn their mother tongue. In secondary education, in accordance with Article 3 and 4 of the Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia””, Nos. 44/95, 24/96, 34/96, 35/97, 82/99, 29/02, 52/02 (consolidated text), 40/03, 42/03 and 67/04) the education process is performed in Macedonian, Albanian and Turkish. Pupils of ethnic Albanian affiliation in Macedonia can receive instruction in Albanian in six municipalities as well as in the city of Skopje: out of a total of 90 secondary schools, instruction takes place in Albanian in 26 and in Turkish in 7. In the school year 2002/2003, there were 94.868 pupils enrolled in secondary education, of which 76.459 (80,59%) received instruction in Macedonian, 17.624 (18,57%) in Albanian, and 785 (0,82%) in Turkish. This year (2004/05) the percentage of ethnic Albanians in the total number of students in secondary education reached 22,52%.  In the enrolment competitions for higher education, in accordance with Article 23 of the Law Amending the Law on Higher Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 49/03), an additional quota, set by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, is provided for communities benefiting from positive discrimination (for more details see I_J_9). Article 14 of the FCPNM (recognising that every person belonging to a national minority has the right to learn in his or her minority language) has been incorporated into the legislation mentioned above. The Republic of Macedonia provides for pre-school, primary and secondary education, as well as higher education in linguistics, pedagogy and dramatic arts in the languages of several minorities, or more specifically, primary education in Albanian, Turkish and Serbian and secondary and higher education in Albanian and Turkish. The academic year 2004/2005 saw the introduction of the optional study of the Vlach language in the Faculty of Pedagogy in Štip in order to train up teachers for optional instruction in Vlach. Additionally, there is a project under way to include the Roma language in the curricula of one of the Faculties of Philology in Macedonia.  Table 1

The use of the languages of communities living in the Republic of Macedonia covers every sphere of the society (state bodies, the administration, local self-government, judicial procedures, personal documents, the media, education, culture, etc.). Hence, specific aspects of the existing language legislation is to be found in the answers throughout the whole Chapter I, Political Criteria. 13. In practical terms, can a person communicate with a regional office of the central government, or a main office of the central government, in any official language? What arrangements have been taken to ensure translation and interpretation? 
Amendment V (Article 7) to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) specifies  the official languages in the Republic of Macedonia and their use. On the whole territory of the Republic of Macedonia and in its international relations the official language is the Macedonian language, written using its Cyrillic alphabet (Article 7, paragraph 1). Any other language, spoken by at least 20% of the citizens, is also an official language, written using its alphabet, as specified in Amendment V (Article 7, paragraph 2). Paragraph 4 of the aforementioned Amendment sets forth that any citizen living in a unit of local self-government in which at least 20% of the citizens speak an official language other than Macedonian, may use any of the official languages and their alphabets in communication with the local offices of the central government. The local offices with competence in these units of local-self government shall reply in Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet, as well as in the official language and alphabet used by the citizen. Any citizen may use any official language and its alphabet to communicate with the local offices of the central government, which shall reply in Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet, as well as in the official language and alphabet used by the citizen. Paragraph 5 of the Amendment stipulates that in the state administrative bodies in the Republic of Macedonia, any official language other than Macedonian may be used in accordance with the law. Paragraph 6 of the Amendment prescribes that in the units of the local self-government, the language and the alphabet used by at least 20% of the citizens is an official language in addition to the Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet. The bodies of the local self-government units decide on the use of the languages and alphabets used by less than 20 percent of the citizens in the respective unit of local self-government. Changes to the Law on General Administrative Procedure (“Official Gazette of  the SFRY”, No. 47/86 - consolidated text) introduced by the Law Amending the Law on General Administrative Procedure (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 44/02), were made with the purpose of bringing a number of its provisions in line with the Amendment V to the Constitution. Namely, Article 15 of this Law stipulates that official language in the administrative procedure is Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet (paragraph 1). In the administrative procedure conducted in the state administrative bodies, other state bodies, bodies of local-self government units, legal and other persons awarded public mandates under law another language spoken by at least 20% of the citizens and its alphabet shall be used in accordance with the Law (paragraph 2). Parties and other participants in the procedure who are not citizens of the Republic of Macedonia and who do not understand Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet are entitled to an interpreter (paragraph 3). Article 64 the aforementioned Law sets forth that submissions include requests, forms used for automatic data processing, proposals, declarations, applications, appeals, complaints and other statements by way of which individuals or legal persons, i.e. organisations communicate with state bodies. Paragraph 3 of the aforementioned Article sets forth that the right under Article 15, paragraph 2 may be enjoyed by any citizen living in a unit of local self-government in which at least 20% of the citizens speak an official language other than Macedonian, i.e. in communication with the local offices of Ministries, he/she may use any of the official languages and their alphabets. The local offices with competence in these units of local-self government shall reply in Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet, as well as in the official language and alphabet used by the citizen. Any citizen may use one of the official languages and its alphabet to communicate with Ministries, which shall reply in Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet, as well as in the official language and alphabet used by the citizen in question. Parties in the procedure who speak a language other than Macedonian which is also an official one, may file submissions in that language and its alphabet. The bodies conducting the procedure shall translate such submissions and act upon them. Bodies conducting the procedure, when deciding on administrative matters, reply in Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet as well as in the official language and the alphabet used by the respective party in the procedure. Taking this into consideration, Ministries, other state administration bodies and administrative organisations which decide for the rights and interests of citizens, as well as other participants in the administrative procedure, are obliged to implement the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, the Law on General Administrative Procedure and the Law on the Local Self-Government pertaining to the use of languages and alphabets in the communication of these bodies with persons belonging to the communities. In that respect, Ministries and other state administrative bodies and administrative organisations are obliged to undertake actions in their local offices, i.e. units for printing bi-lingual forms (summonses, receipt notifications, proposals, declarations, rulings and other writs) for citizens living in local self-government units (municipalities) in which at least 20% of the citizens speak an official language other than  Macedonian. Public enterprises, legal and other persons that have been delegated public mandates under law, shall also undertake measures and activities in their local offices, services etc., for printing bi-lingual forms (summonses, receipts and other writs) for citizens living in local self-government units (municipalities) in which at least 20% of the citizens speak an official language other than Macedonian. Hence, a procedure is underway on the announcement of tenders for printing bi-lingual forms of the local offices of Ministries and other state administrative bodies and administrative organisations for citizens living in local self-government units (municipalities) in which at least 20% of the citizens speak an official language other than Macedonian.  Following the changes in the procedural laws governing the right to use community languages in court and administrative procedures, in the course of February 2004, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, on proposal of the Ministry of Justice, adopted the Information and the Implementation Project on Employment of Translators and Typists in Courts and State Administrative Bodies. The documents envisage employment and appropriate training of translators and typists in the use of community languages. On the Session held on 06.01.2005, the Government adopted the Decision for training of translators/interpreters in languages of communities that are not in majority in the Republic of Macedonia. Translators/interpreters will be employed in the state administrative bodies and in the courts. Their training will be performed in accordance with a programme determined by the Civil Servants Agency, supported by the CARDS 2004 Programme. Selection of candidates for translators/interpreters will be performed by the Civil Servants Agency in accordance with the Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00, 112/00, 34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04 and 69/04). Following the training, candidates will sign contracts with the Civil Servants Agency, committing themselves to work in the state administrative bodies and courts for a period of two years from the day of the completion of the training. 
14. Is the right of translation of all proceedings and documents in criminal and civil judicial proceedings ensured in accordance with the relevant Council of Europe documents? If so, how is this done? 
The right to translation of all documents in penal and civil court procedures in the Republic of Macedonia are in compliance with relevant documents of the Council of Europe, but also with obligations arising from the Framework Agreement on the use of languages of ethnic communities in courts. This right is also in compliance with the principle of equitable representation of all communities into the judicial institutions, which has been continuously implemented.  Namely, pursuant to the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.15/97, 44/02 and 74/04), the person summoned, apprehended or deprived of freedom must immediately be informed in a language he/she understands on the reasons of summoning, apprehending or depriving him/her of freedom and on any indictments against him/her as well as on his/her rights. He/she may not be extorted a statement.  In the course of a criminal procedure, Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet are official as well as a language and alphabet used by at least 20% of the citizens (Article 6). The persons participating in the procedure, such as the defendant, the injured party, the plaintiff, witnesses and other persons, who speak an official language other than Macedonian, have a right to use their language and alphabet in the course of preliminary investigation proceedings and in the course of the main hearing, as well as in procedures concerning appeals. The Court shall provide oral interpretation as well as translations of documents and other written material. In addition the court shall provide translated written material of importance to the procedure or the defence. Other parties and witnesses in the court procedure have a right to free interpretation if they do not understand or speak the language in which the procedure is conducted. The person shall be given legal advice on his/her right to interpreting. The legal advice shall be noted in the minutes. The translation or interpretation is performed by a court-authorised interpreter (Article 7). Indictments, appeals and other submissions are submitted to the court in the language in which the procedure is conducted. Citizens who speak an official language other than Macedonian may submit their submissions in the language they speak and in its alphabet, or in the language in which the procedure is conducted. The court shall translate the submissions and present them to other parties in the procedure. The defendant that does not understand the language in which the procedure is conducted is given translations into the language he/she has used in the course of the procedure. Foreign citizens deprived of freedom or in detention may submit their submission in their language, and in other cases - under conditions of reciprocity (Article 8). The court sends summons, rulings and other written correspondence in the language in which the procedure is conducted. Citizens who speak an official language other than Macedonian shall receive summons, rulings and other written correspondence into their language. A defendant in detention, in prison or confined in a health institution under compulsory psychiatric treatment shall receive translations of submissions into the language he/she has used in the procedure. The defendant that does not understand the language in which the procedure is conducted is given translation of the verdict in the language he/she has used in the course of the procedure (Article 9). With regard to grounds for disputing the verdict, an essential violation of the criminal procedure provisions, among others, is when the court has violated the provisions on the use of language in the course of the procedure as prescribed by this Law (Article 355, paragraph 1, subparagraph 12). In accordance with the Law on Litigation Procedure (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 33/98 and 44/02), the litigation procedure is conducted in Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet. In the course of litigation procedure an official language and its alphabet used by at least 20% of the citizens is also official in the procedure, as prescribed by the Law. A member of a community who as a party or a participant in the procedure does not understand or speak the Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet has a right to an interpreter. The interpreting costs are covered by the court. The court shall give legal advice to the party or a participant in the procedure who uses another official language and its alphabet spoken by at least 20% of the citizens (and who as a party or participant in the procedure does not understand the Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet) that he/she has a right to use his/her language and the right to an interpreter. The Chamber President or a judge is obliged to note the court’s legal advice and the party’s statement or a statement of another participant in the procedure into the minutes (Article 6). The parties and other participants in the procedure that speak an official language other than Macedonian have a right to use their language in the course of court hearings or in his/her oral correspondence with the court. The parties and other participants in the procedure shall be provided oral interpreting into their language in the course of hearings, as well as oral and written translations of documents used as evidence in hearings. The translation or interpreting is performed by a court-authorised interpreter (Article 94-). Summons, rulings and other written correspondence are sent to parties and other participants in the procedure in Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet. Citizens who speak an official language other than Macedonian shall receive summons, rulings and other written correspondence into their language (Article 94-b). Parties and other participants in the procedure shall submit bills of indictment, appeals and other submissions to the court in Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet. Parties and other participants in the procedure who are citizens of the Republic of Macedonia and whose mother tongue is an official language other than Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet may submit bills of indictment, appeals and other submissions to the court in their mother tongue. The court translates these submissions into Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet and presents them to other parties in the procedure (Article 94-c). Parties and other participants in the procedure who are citizens of the Republic of Macedonia and speak a language other than Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet which is not an official language, enjoy a right to use their language in the course of hearings and in their oral communication with the court. The parties and other participants in the procedure shall be provided oral interpreting into their language in the course of hearings, as well as oral and written translations of documents used as evidence in hearings. Parties and other participants in the procedure who speak a language other than Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet, which is not an official language, shall be legally advised on their rights. They are entitled to an interpreter in order to follow the oral proceedings before the court in their mother tongue. They may relinquish the right to interpretation if they declare they speak the language in which the procedure is conducted. Such legal advice and statements of parties and participants shall be noted in the minutes (Article 94-d). The court shall cover the costs for providing interpreting to parties and participants in the procedure who are citizens of the Republic of Macedonia (Article 94-e). As regards the essential violation of the provisions on litigation procedure, it should be noted that such violation occurs when the court has violated the provisions concerning the use of language in the course of the procedure (Articles 6, 94-a, 94-b, 94-c, 94-d and 94-e). In addition, in April 2004, Rules of Procedure Amending the Court Rules of Procedure were adopted (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”,No. 27/04). In order to implement the provisions of the Amendment V to the Constitution (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) and the aforementioned legal changes in court procedures, they determine the pattern of the forms for correspondence with parties in the court proceedings. Moreover, the forms were translated and distributed among all judicial bodies in the Republic of Macedonia, in line with the amendments to the Procedural Laws and the Rules of Procedure Amending the Court Rules of Procedure. With a view to more transparent operation and awareness rising among citizens for the implementation of the Framework Agreement and Amendment V to the Constitution, forms for correspondence with parties in the court procedure were published in the Albanian language daily newspaper Flaka and the Macedonian language daily newspaper Utrinski vesnik.  
15. Can citizens who speak an official language other than the majority language receive official personal documents in that language? What arrangements have been made in this respect? 
The citizens of the Republic of Macedonia who speak an official language other than the language spoken by the majority population get official personal documents in the language and alphabet that they use. The legal basis for issuing personal documents to the citizens who speak an official language other than Macedonian is contained in the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) as the highest legal act of the state. According to paragraph 3 of Amendment V replacing Article 7 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia,  Official personal documents of citizens speaking an official language other than Macedonian shall be issued in the Macedonian language, as well as in that language in accordance with the law. Article 1 paragraph 5 of the Law Amending the Law on Personal Identity Card (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/02), amending Article 5 of the Law on Personal Identification Card (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 8/95) provides that for the citizens speaking an official language other than Macedonian the form of the personal identification card will be printed and the data therein will be entered, besides in Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet, in the official language and alphabet that the citizen is using. Article 1 of the Law Amending the Law on Travel Documents of the Citizens of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 20/03) amending Article 28 of the Law on Travel Documents of the Citizens of RM (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 67/92) provides that citizens speaking an official language other than Macedonian will, upon their personal request, have the form of their passport and emergency passport also printed in the official language and alphabet that the citizen uses. In addition, Article 13 of the Law Amending the Law on Travel Documents of Citizens of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 46/04) amending the Article 28 of the Law on Travel Documents of Citizens of the Republic of Macedonia  clarifies that citizens speaking an official language other than Macedonian will, upon their personal request, have the data entered in the passport and emergency passport besides in Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet also in the official language and alphabet that the citizen uses. The obligation to issue official documents in the field of traffic and transport in the language of citizens speaking an official language other than Macedonian, such as: driving license, vehicle certificate, tractor driving license, driving certificate and certificate of registration, emerges from the Law Amending the Law on Road Traffic Safety (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/02). In 2004 further amendments were enacted by the Law Amending the Law on Road Traffic Safety (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04), whereby in the field of categories and subcategories, the Macedonian driving license is entirely harmonised with the driving licenses issued in EU countries. The Rulebook on Amending the Rulebook on Forms for Travel Documents and Visas for Citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, on the Method of Photographing for Travel Documents and on Keeping Records, published on 21.10.2004 (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 73/04), provides for bilingual forms for travel documents and the emergency passports issued to citizens of the Republic of Macedonia. The adoption of a Rulebook on the Forms for a Vehicle Certificate, Driving License, Tractor Vehicle Certificate, Tractor Driving License, Certificate of Registration, Driving Certificate and Certificate of Temporary Vehicle Registration, is in procedure, whereby bilingual forms of the above documents will be prescribed.     
The Ministry of the Interior have started issuing personal identification cards in the Republic of Macedonia, in the language and alphabet of citizens speaking an official language other than Macedonian since 15.05.2003 and until 31.12.2004 a total of 174.352 personal identification cards have been issued, 138.758 of which in the Macedonian language and  alphabet, and 35.594 also in an official language and script other than Macedonian i.e. in Albanian. In addition, Ministry of the Interior have also started issuing travel documents in an official language and alphabet other than Macedonian since 06.12.2004 and until 31.12.2004 a total of 6.196 bilingual travel documents have been issued, upon personal request from citizens.  With the adoption of the secondary legislation act in the field of traffic, the legal framework will be completed and the citizens speaking an official language other than Macedonian will be issued a driving license, vehicle certificate, tractor driving license, driving certificate, tractor vehicle certificate and certificate of registration in their language. 
16. Have specific agreements been negotiated to ensure State funding for university level education in languages spoken by at least 20% of the population? 
In July 2003, the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia adopted the Law Amending the Law on Higher Education (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 49/03), introducing, inter alia, changes to Article 95 of the Law on Higher Education (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 64/00).  Paragraph 2 of this Article determines that persons belonging to communities, in order to express, foster and develop their identity and other attributes, are entitled to instruction at the state institutions of higher education, under specific curricula, in the language of community other than the Macedonian, in accordance with the provisions of this Law and the Statute of the respective institution of higher education. The same paragraph further prescribes that state funding shall be provided for higher education in the language spoken by at least 20% of the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia.  In addition, paragraph 3 of Article 95 of the Law on Higher Education stipulates that the instruction in the state pedagogical institutions of higher education providing training for educators in pre-school institutions, teachers in primary education and teachers of didactic subjects and subjects in methods of instruction in secondary education, may be conducted in languages of other communities that are not in the majority in the Republic of Macedonia, which entails an obligation for the state to fund these curricula. In order to ensure state funding for the higher education in the language spoken by at least 20% of the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, the Law on Establishing the State University in Tetovo (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 08/04) was adopted by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia in January 2004. The Law, as a founding act, establishes the State University in Tetovo, with the following four faculties and a polytechnic centre included in its structure: Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics; Faculty of Humanities and Arts; Faculty of Economy; Faculty of Law; and a Polytechnic Centre. Hence, only the University has a capacity of a legal entity, while the faculties and the polytechnic centre have a status of internal organisational units within the University. For the purpose of preparing the commencement of the operations of the State University in Tetovo, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia established a Committee which, in a period of seven months, completed the necessary preparations, in particular in terms of providing the necessary teaching and associate personnel. The Committee announced competitions and conducted a procedure of selection of teachers and associates in accordance with the Law on Higher Education. Once the Ministry of Education and Science conducted a direct inspection in order to check whether the conditions have been fulfilled for the beginning of the operation of the University, the Minister adopted an (interim) Decision for the start of the operation of the University. Subsequently, the University was enlisted in the Registry of the Institutions of Higher Education in the Republic of Macedonia; the bodies of the University were set up; and it was enlisted in the Court Registry. Thus, the State University in Tetovo acquired the capacity of a legal entity and started its operation as a legal institution of higher education as of 01.10.2004. Necessary funding for this institution of higher education, pursuant to the aforementioned Article 95, paragraph 2 of the Law on Higher Education, are provided from the State Budget and from other sources determined by law. The 2004 Budget of the Republic of Macedonia allocated 44.503.000 MKD for the operation of the State University in Tetovo, which started its operation in the academic 2004/2005. The 2005 Budget, for the same purpose allocates funds of 83.000.000 MKD. Furthermore, state funding of the higher education in the language spoken by at least 20% of the citizens is also provided for the Department of Albanian Language and Literature at the Faculty of Philology; for the Faculty of Pedagogy “St. Kliment Ohridski” in Skopje, where, in accordance with the already established right of persons belonging to communities in Article 95, paragraph 2 of the Law, studies are conducted for teachers in pre-school and primary education for the persons belonging to the Albanian and Turkish communities; as well as for specific study programmes for ethnic Albanian students at the Faculty of Drama Arts and Faculty of Physical Culture. 
17. Are there any professional restrictions for minorities (de iure or de facto)? 
a) De iure professional restrictions In the Republic of Macedonia de jure professional restrictions for members of non-majority communities do not exist. This would be contrary to the Law on Labour Relations (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 80/93, 03/94, 14/95, 53/97, 59/97, 21/98, 25/00, 34/00, 50/01, 25/03, 40/03 and 80/03 - consolidated text), which contains provisions prohibiting discrimination on grounds of various reasons, including the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of ethnic origin. Moreover, Article 9 of the Constitution (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) prohibits discrimination on any ground and guarantees that citizens of the Republic of Macedonia are equal in their freedoms and rights, regardless of gender, race, colour of skin, national and social origin, political and religious conviction, property and social status. b) De facto professional restrictions De facto, there is evident lesser representation of some ethnic communities in the public administration, army, police and the judiciary, as a consequence of which the principle of equitable representation has been incorporated as one of the key provisions in the Ohrid Framework Agreement. The reference “equitable representation” is not a synonym of proportional representation, i.e. it does not indicate that all communities must be represented in the public administration according to their proportion in the total population. The concept of equitable representation, which assumes the respect of the principle of competence and integrity, aims at the establishment of a professional, specialised and competent public administration. This concept will be different on the level of different bodies; however, it should adhere to the tendency of realisation of proportional representation. The principle of non-discrimination and equitable representation has been explicated in item 4 of the Framework Agreement, which requires that non-discrimination and equal treatment of all persons before the law must be fully respected. This principle is especially accentuated during the recruitments in the public administration and public enterprises, as well as regarding the access to public funding in the process of business development.  Laws regulating employments in public administration contain measures that secure the equitable representation of communities in all central and local bodies at all levels as well as employment therein. At the same time, principles of competence and integrity must be respected. The authorities are undertaking activities to correct the current imbalance in the composition of the public administration, especially through the employment of members of the communities who have not been sufficiently represented. Special attention has been paid to accomplish this representation in the police so that it would reflect the breakdown of the population of Macedonia. The equal representation of persons belonging to all communities into public bodies at all levels and in other  fields of public life has become one of the fundamental values of the Constitution with its VI Amendment (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 91/01). Hence, changes have been made in the following laws: the Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00, 112/00, 34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04 and 69/04), the Law on Labour Relations (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 80/93, 03/94, 14/95, 53/97, 59/97, 21/98, 25/00, 34/00, 50/01, 25/03, 40/03 and  80/03 – consolidated text), the Law on Public Enterprises (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 38/96, 9/97, 06/02 and 40/03), and the Law Amending the Law on Internal Affairs (“Official Gazette of  the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/02), as well as in the Rulebook on Criteria, Standards and Procedures for Employment and Selection of Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 59/01). The Ombudsman has an adequate role in the implementation of this principle in practice. He/she undertakes concrete activities for the protection from discrimination and for securing equitable representation of members of communities.  This policy has resulted in a visible increase of the members of communities in the public administration, army, police and judiciary. On this, for more details see I_J_4 and I_J_7
18. Is there a minority rights ombudsman or any other official body that protects the rights of minorities in your country? Please also indicate which Government department(s) is/are responsible for minority issues. 
The Republic of Macedonia has introduced the institution of an Ombudsman on 03.07.1997 when the first Ombudsman was appointed by the Assembly. The competencies of the Ombudsman are set out in the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03)  and the Law on the Ombudsman (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 60/03). According to Article 77 (Amendment XI) of the Constitution, the Ombudsman protects the constitutional and legal rights of citizens when these are violated by bodies of the state administration and by other bodies and organisations with public mandates. The Ombudsman shall give particular attention to safeguarding the principles of non-discrimination and equitable representation of communities in public bodies, bodies of the units of local self-government and public institutions and services. 
Therefore, in accordance with the Law on the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman protects the constitutional and legal rights of citizens and also implements actions and measures for the protection of the principles of non-discrimination and equitable representation of members belonging to communities in state administrative bodies and in the bodies of the units of local self-government as well as in public institutions and agencies. This general position concerning the protection of minority rights is elaborated in further provisions of the Law, which stipulate the following:   A request to the Ombudsman can be submitted by any person who believes that his or her constitutional or legal rights have been violated, or believes that a violation of the principles of non-discrimination and equitable representation of members belonging to communities in state administrative bodies and other bodies and organisations with public competencies has occurred (Article 13);   The  Ombudsman can give his/her opinion with regard to the protection of constitutional and legal rights and also to the protection of the principles of non-discrimination and equitable representation of members belonging to communities concerning a case which is in process, regardless of the type and stage of the process instituted before state administrative bodies and other bodies and organisations with public competences (Article 28);   It is within the competency of the Ombudsman to monitor situations with regard to the safeguarding of the respect for and the protection of constitutional and legal rights of citizens as well as the principles of non-discrimination and equitable representation of members belonging to communities. The Ombudsman may visit and carry out inspections on state administrative bodies and other bodies and organisations with public competencies (Article 29). The Law on the Ombudsman allows for the possibility of the establishment and organisation of departments that are to provide for a higher level of efficiency and success regarding the protection of the constitutional and legal rights of citizens in particular fields. In addition, Article 78 of the Constitution (Amendment XII) states that the Assembly establishes a Committee on Inter-Community Relations. The Committee consists of nineteen members, of whom seven members each appointed from  the ranks of the Macedonian and Albanian Representatives in the Assembly and one member each from among the Turks, Vlachs, Roma, Serbs and Bosniaks in the Assembly. If a community has no Representatives in the Assembly, following consultations with relevant representatives from that particular community, the Ombudsman proposes the remaining members of the Committee. The Assembly appoints the members of the Committee. Government departments responsible for minority issues The following special bodies have been established within the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and also within state administrative bodies for the promotion of the culture and education of members of communities in the Republic of Macedonia: 
1. Ministry of Culture, Office for Affirmation and Promotion of the Culture of Members of Communities in the Republic of Macedonia 
In accordance with Article 26, Paragraph 2, of the Law on the Organisation and Operation of State Administrative Bodies (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 58/00 and 44/02), in 2003 an Office for Affirmation and Promotion of the Culture of Members of Communities in the Republic of Macedonia, within the Ministry of Culture was established, without the status of a legal entity, which is headed by a director, and appointed and dismissed by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. In accordance with the Regulations of the Ministry of Culture, the Office for Affirmation and Promotion of the Culture of Members of Communities in the Republic of Macedonia performs activities regarding the affirmation, promotion and publication of the cultural creative work and the care, nurturing and presentation of the cultural heritage of the members of communities in the Republic of Macedonia, as well as analytical, administrative and technical activities with regard to the encouragement and promotion of the culture of these communities. This Office consists of two Sectors: Sector for Affirmation, Promotion and Publication of Cultural Creative Work and for the Care, Nurturing and Presentation of the Cultural Heritage of the Members of Communities in the Republic of Macedonia; and -  Sector for Encouragement and Promotion of Cooperation with Neighbouring and European Countries and for International Technical Assistance with the aim of fostering and promoting the cultural identity of the members of communities in the Republic of Macedonia. 
2. Ministry of Education and Science, Office for the Development and Promotion of Education in the Languages of Members of Communities 
In accordance with the Law on Organisation and Operation of State Administrative Bodies, an Office for Development and Promotion of Education in the Languages of Members of Communities was established within the Ministry of Education and Science. The Office is responsible for the implementation of tasks concerning the education of members of communities in accordance with the constitutional provisions and international conventions signed by the Republic of Macedonia, with the participation of all the bodies of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and other state bodies and institutions responsible for the education of members of communities. The Office aims to overcome language barriers and to promote inter-ethnic confidence, through building a democratic model and relations encouraging a more effective socialisation and inclusion of members of the various linguistic communities within the social fabric of the Republic of Macedonia. The Office places special emphasis on the prevention of discrimination in the field of education and in the entire educational process. In addition to these bodies, the Office of Human Rights, Legal Analysis and Comparative Law, which is active within the Ministry of Justice, and the Office for the Council of Europe and Human Rights, within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are contributing, at a more general level, to the provision, promotion and protection of human rights, which include minority rights. 
19. Are any "stateless" people living in the Republic of Macedonia as a result of the dissolution of the SFRY? 
Taking into account the former and the existing regulations defining the issue of citizenship, it could be concluded that there are no stateless persons in the Republic of Macedonia or de jure persons without citizenship as a result of the dissolution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). Some citizens who have not regulated their Macedonian citizenship and whose status has not been regulated in the process of succession (i.e. de facto they do not have a citizenship) are in the process of formalising their status given that all citizens who had lived in the territory of the former SFRY had had  de iure and de facto both a federal and a republic citizenship. Namely, pursuant to the legal regulations on the citizenship in the former SFRY and in the Republic of Macedonia as its constituent part, which had been valid during the existence of the former SFRY - Law on Citizenship of the FPRY (“Official Gazette of the FPRY”, No. 54/46); Law on Citizenship of the PRM (“Official Gazette of the PRM”, No. 16/50); Law on Yugoslav Citizenship “(Official Gazette of the SFRY”, No. 38/64); Law on Citizenship of the SRM (“Official Gazette of the SRM”, No. 09/65); Law on Citizenship of the SFRY (“Official Gazette of the SFRY”, No. 58/76) and the Law on Citizenship of the SRM (“Official Gazette of the SRM”, No. 19/77), a dual citizenship existed. In accordance with the aforementioned regulations, in addition to the federal citizenship, every citizen of the former SFRY had also had a Republic citizenship and vice versa. The Law had also prescribed that a citizen could only be entitled to one Republic citizenship. Acquisition of a citizenship of another Republic used to mark a loss of the right to citizenship of the previous Republic. The possession of a Republic citizenship had not been connected to the citizen’s residence, which meant that a citizen of any of the Republics of the former SFRY had been entitled to the option to live in one Republic and posses an identification card of another. However, a citizen of SFRY had been entitled to one Republic citizenship and one identification card. After the dissolution of the former SFRY, the Republic of Macedonia adopted the Law on Citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 67/92, 08/04 and 45/04-consolidated text) which entered into force on 11.11.1992.  This Law eliminated the duality of federal and republic citizenships and established a single citizenship for the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia. The principle of legal continuity of the citizenship status of the citizens of Macedonia has been fully incorporated into this Law. All citizens that have had the citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia pursuant to the previous regulations were not required to prove their citizenship status. The Citizenship Registry that had been updated by hand from 1947 until 1992 was used as a basis for the transfer of citizenship data into the Citizenship Registry of the Republic of Macedonia. The fact that registration of residence in one of the former Yugoslav republics had not been conditioned by the Republic’s citizenship and as a result of the intensive inter-republic migrations during the time of the SFRY, there were persons in the Republic of Macedonia who after its independence continued to reside without having a citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia (they have been and they still are citizens of one of the former Yugoslav republics). In order to enable these persons to acquire a citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia as easily as possible, so that they would be able to exercise their civil, social and other rights, the Law on Citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia of 1992 contained a transitional provision, pursuant to which the citizens of the former Yugoslav republics and the citizens of the former SFRY who had registered their residence in the territory of the Republic of Macedonia, were allowed to acquire Macedonian  citizenship, if within a year from the entry into force of the Law on Citizenship they applied for citizenship, they had permanent incomes, if they were adults and if prior to filing the request they had lived on the territory of Macedonia for at least 15 years. In order to fully adhere to the European Convention on Citizenship signed by the Republic of Macedonia on 06.11.1997 and ratified on 18.02.2002 and taking into account the experiences from the practical implementation of the Law on Citizenship,  on 22.01.2004, the Government passed the Law Amending the Law on Citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 08/04) which entered into force on 02.03.2004.  By passing the amendments to the Law, the Government has corrected the reservation to the European Convention on Citizenship (Chapter 3, Article 6, Paragraph 3), which referred to the length of stay as a valid condition to apply for citizenship on the basis of naturalisation. Pursuant to the Draft-Recommendations by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), as of 25.06.2004, the length of stay has been reduced to less than 10 years, i.e. in accordance with Article 3 of the latest amended Law, Article 7, paragraph 2 prescribes at least 8 years of duration of stay before applying for citizenship.  In addition, this Law also contains a new transitional provision relating to persons originating from the former SFRY who have continued to live in Macedonia after the date of state succession and had registered their residence in the Republic of Macedonia by 08.11.1991 and by the time of application had permanently lived therein. Namely, they may acquire Macedonian citizenship if within two years after the entry into force of this Law they apply for citizenship, unless they are subject to criminal procedures for crimes endangering the security and the defence of Macedonia. In addition, they must be 18 years of age and must speak Macedonian to the degree that they may easily communicate with their surrounding. Hence, persons who are citizens of the former SFRY who live in the Republic of Macedonia and who, due to various reasons, have not regulated their citizenship, may acquire the citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia.  In addition (and in accordance with the ECRI recommendations), the Republic of Macedonia in coordination with UNHCR, beginning from December 2004 started an information campaign  throughout the state with an objective to fully and thoroughly inform all relevant persons, including the Roma and Albanian population, on the opportunities given by the extended deadline for the regulation of their citizenship status in accordance with the law.   The whole network of Macedonian non-governmental organisations supported by UNHCR has joined the campaign. The campaign also envisages free legal aid and assistance to applicants provided by NGO legal teams. In addition, the campaign envisages information advertisements in several radio stations that cover the whole territory of Macedonia. TV advertisements are also planned in various languages.  It is of exceptional importance to note that all procedures before the Ministry of the Interior initiated pursuant to Articles 7 and 9 shall be subject to procedure in accordance with the provisions of the new Law (Article 14), which gives the citizenship applicants a privileged status and treatment.   The processed data on positively resolved applications for citizenship after the adoption of the new amendments (22.01.2004) indicate that the Ministry of the Interior has been acting efficiently and has granted 580 citizenships on the basis of the application of Article 14. There are another 800 applications that are currently being reviewed. During the same period, 41 persons have been declined their application due to the length and continuity of their residence in Macedonia, while only 8 persons have been declined due to the insufficient knowledge of Macedonian language.  In accordance with the existing legal regulations, those whose applications have been declined may appeal  before the Second-Instance Government Commission and then to the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia. At the same time, there have also been applications for discharge of Macedonian citizenship pursuant to the obligation of dismissal and reception that these citizens have, after acquiring citizenship in one of the EU countries according to their laws.

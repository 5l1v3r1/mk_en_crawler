THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal has indicted former Macedonian Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski for the killing of ten ethnic Albanian civilians in the village of Ljuboten during the 2001 conflict. According to the government in Skopje, a security officer identified as Johan Tarculovski has also been charged. He was arrested Monday (14 March). Boskovski fled in 2004, following revelations that he staged the murder of seven economic migrants in 2002, apparently in order to show the world that the government was fighting terrorism. He was arrested in Croatia. According to Vesna Skare-Ozbolt, Croatia's justice minister, Boskovski will be extradited to The Hague. He is the first Macedonian to be indicted for war crimes.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met on Monday (May 23rd) in Ankara with Libya's National Transitional Council (NTC) Chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil. Afterwards, Jalil voiced support for the Turkish roadmap for peace in his country, which urges forces aligned with leader Muammar Gaddafi to withdraw from besieged cities and proposes comprehensive democratic change. Davutoglu said that Turkey views the NTC as a "legitimate and respected" representative of the Libyan people. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged Gaddafi to step down right away, signalling a shift in Ankara's policy towards Tripoli. 
In other news Monday, on the eve of Erdogan's visit to Sirnak for a campaign rally, police found 36kg of explosives under a bridge along a highway leading to the town. Erdogan's motorcade is expected to cross the bridge Tuesday. (Zaman, Vatan, Radio Free Europe - 24/05/11; KUNA, Anadolu news agency, Hurriyet - 23/05/11)

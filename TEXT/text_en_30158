ANKARA, Turkey -- Following the weekend arrest of IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek said on Tuesday (May 17th) that having a Turk at the Fund's helm would be "very nice and natural". "Time came for a change. The centre of gravity in economy has shifted from the US and Europe towards the east. Developing countries take more share from the world economy today," Simsek told Kanal 24 television. "Turkey is the sixth biggest economy of Europe and the 16th biggest economy of the world. Our target is to become to be in the top ten list in the world in 2023 and to be among the first three in Europe," he added. (Turkish Weekly, Aksam, Zaman, Hurriyet - 17/05/11)

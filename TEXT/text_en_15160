BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn implied on Thursday (29 June) that the EU could suspend its recently started accession talks with Turkey if Ankara continues to close its harbours and airports to Greek Cypriot traffic. While saying he hoped this would not be the case, Rehn warned that the EU would not hesitate to act if Turkey fails to meet its commitments. In other news Thursday, Turkey's Parliament voted to adopt a new law against terrorism that boosts the number of crimes classified as terrorist acts. The EU and rights groups have complained about some of the provisions, which include making it a crime to espouse views shared by rebel groups or to publish statements by an illegal organisation. It also allows authorities to keep lawyers away from suspects during the first 24 hours of detention. (Zaman - 30/06/06; TurkishPress.com, Reuters - 29/06/06)

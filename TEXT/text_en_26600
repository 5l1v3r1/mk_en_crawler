BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU reiterated on Tuesday (December 8th) its appeal for political dialogue and compromise in Albania, in light of the opposition's continuing boycott of parliament. The main opposition Socialist Party (SP) is demanding an investigation into what it claims were manipulated returns in the June general elections. Wrapping up a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, Sweden's Carl Bildt, whose country currently holds the EU's rotating presidency, urged the ruling Democratic Party and SP to negotiate and agree to move ahead with EU-related reforms.

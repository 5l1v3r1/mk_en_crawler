SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH State Investigation and Protection Agency detained three Bosnian Serb war crimes suspects in the town of Vlasenica on Monday (January 28th). Veljko Basic, 82, Predrag Bastah, 55, and Goran Viskovic, 54, face charges of committing crimes against humanity in the Susica detention camp in Vlasenica. An estimated 8,000 Muslim and other non-Serb residents from the surrounding areas were held in the squalid camp between May and October 1992, and suffered physical or sexual abuse. The UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague earlier sentenced Susica wartime commander Dragan Nikolic to 20 years in prison. (Nezavisne Novine - 29/01/08; Fena, RTRS, B92, Reuters, DPA - 28/01/08)

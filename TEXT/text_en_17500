SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In a joint statement issued Friday (July 27th) the international organisations in BiH -- the Office of the High Representative (OHR), the Council of Europe (CoE), the European Commission (EC), the World Bank, the OSCE and the UN -- urged the state parliament to adopt the Higher Education Law and demonstrate their commitment to a better future for BiH. The law would "improve the quality of education that students receive, enable the mobility of students and facilitate the recognition of domestic higher education diplomas and degrees within the European Higher Education Area, increasing educational and employment opportunities for all graduates", the statement said. 
The group said that BiH is the only signatory of the Bologna Process without a state law on higher education -- a requirement in the European partnership process. (OHR website, RTRS, Fena - 27/07/07)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Police officers decided on Monday (August 17th) to go on strike every day for two hours to protest the amount of money allocated to their sector, which resulted in cutting benefits. Union leader Marian Gruia told national public radio that they may sue authorities to restore rights conferred by law. In a petition to the interior and administration ministry, police officers noted, for example, that up to 12,000 law enforcement personnel would no longer receive crucial rent subsidies. Hiring delays are occurring and bonuses have been cut by 20%.
Public administration workers also threatened on Monday to stage a strike in October unless the government agrees to negotiate. In a letter to Prime Minister Emil Boc, they demanded that jobs be retained in the local administration and current incomes be maintained. The IMF is requiring a series of measures to ease the recession, including reducing spending and public sector wages. (Gandul, Cronica Romania, Ziua - 18/08/09; Ziare.com - 17/08/09)

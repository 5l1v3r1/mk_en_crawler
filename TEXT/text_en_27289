ANKARA, Turkey -- Four children died on Sunday (November 1st) in floods caused by torrential rains that lashed much of the country for the past three days. A six-month old baby died in the town of Cinarcik in the northwest province of Jalova, falling from his father's arms as a wooden bridge collapsed. The infant's body was recovered 1km away. In a separate incident, two sisters, aged 11 and 13, drowned in the southern Mardin province. The fourth fatality also occurred in Mardin. (Milliyet - 02/10/09; MIA - 01/11/09)

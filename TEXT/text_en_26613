TIRANA, Albania -- Jozefina Topalli was re-elected on Tuesday (September 8th) as speaker of parliament, backed by 74 of the 75 lawmakers present. Members of the opposition Socialist Party were not there, as they are boycotting the work of the 140-seat parliament over alleged violations in the June 28th elections.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Addressing the nation Wednesday (28 July), Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said last week's deadly high-speed train wreck was not due to infrastructure problems. All work needed for the train to operate properly was completed before the service began in June, he said. As investigators continue their probe into the cause, a critically injured passenger has died, bringing the death toll to 38. In the wake of the derailment, the opposition Republican People's Party has filed an official request to convene a parliamentary session next week. The party wants to hold a confidence vote on Transport Minister Binali Yildirim of the ruling Justice and Development Party. (NTV, Anadolu Agency - 28/07/04)

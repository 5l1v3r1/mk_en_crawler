BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian Parliament's Committee for European Integration adopted a draft resolution Tuesday (13 July) on association with the EU. The document moves next to public discussion before being sent to the full parliament and federal parliament for approval. In essence, the resolution says authorities are committed to meeting all requirements necessary to speed up the EU integration process. Concerning the thorniest of issues, the resolution suggests three options for war-crimes co-operation: "full and unconditional co-operation", "full and mutual co-operation" and bringing to trial all war crimes indictees according to international agreements.

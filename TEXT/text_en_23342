PARIS, France -- Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said on Wednesday (December 24th) he is disappointed that Serbia has not made satisfactory progress on its path towards EU membership during France's EU presidency in this second half of 2008. "Serbia's place is in Europe, and we've repeatedly said that during our presidency. Serbia's accession into the EU is mostly in Serbia's hands. We are disappointed that no progress has been made during our presidency," Kouchner told Serb media. Asked whether recognition of Kosovo would be a condition for Serbia's EU membership, he said the conditions for EU entry are the same for all candidate countries.

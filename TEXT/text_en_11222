ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament passed the final amendments to the new penal code Friday (27 May). The changes seek to boost freedom of expression and to strengthen the rights of women and children. The centre-left opposition Republican Peoples' Party, which rejected the draft amendments, refused to participate in the voting. The new legislation moves next to President Ahmet Necdet Sezer for approval. The European Commission set 1 June as the deadline for introducing the new penal code. 
In other news Friday, the World Bank said it endorsed a $400m loan for the Istanbul Seismic Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness Project in Turkey. The financing would be used to transform Istanbul into a city able to withstand major earthquakes and other natural disasters. (Turks.US - 28/05/05; NTV, AP, World Bank Web site - 27/05/05)

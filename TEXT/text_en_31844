SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR confirms that preliminary analysis of documents seized last month during raids on Republika Srpska (RS) Army premises suggests activities in serious violation of the Dayton accord. At a news conference Tuesday (1 April), SFOR spokesman Dale MacEachern said the RS Army intelligence unit had illegally spied on SFOR, the Office of the High Representative, international and domestic organisations, as well as individuals in both BiH entities.
In other news Tuesday, the BiH Parliament's House of Peoples passed the law on protection of rights of national minorities, the measure passed by the House of Representatives last June. Adoption of the law is required for accession to the Council of Europe. (OHR Sources - 02/04/03; PBS BiH, RTRS, FENA, BBC - 01/04/03)

ATHENS, Greece -- A bomb exploded early Saturday (March 20th) in Athens outside the home of Anuar Ikmar, president of the Greek-Pakistani Association. The blast caused damages to the building and three nearby parked cars but no one was hurt. The police cordoned off the area after a warning phone call was received by a Greek TV station and a newspaper before the explosion. Later in the day, a second bomb exploded outside a police detention centre in Athens. There were damages but no injuries as a warning call was received before the blast. The two explosions came after a makeshift bomb went off outside offices of a far-right group in Athens on Friday. The blast caused damages but no injuries. No group has so far claimed responsibility for the attacks. (AFP, BBC, DPA, AP, Reuters - 20/03/10)

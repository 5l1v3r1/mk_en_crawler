ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic says he supports recent protests against steep electricity price hikes. Mesic said Monday (7 October) that the state electricity company should revise the bills for September, as many customers saw their bills more than double. He blamed a technical error and called on the state utility to issue reimbursements as quickly as possible. Saturday, residents of Pula and Rijeka staged protests over their bills. (07/10/02)

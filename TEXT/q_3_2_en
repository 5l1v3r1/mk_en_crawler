A. Competent authority/ies 
1. Please provide information regarding the: (The answer should be in two parts, to cover industry in general and each of the individual sectors listed in Chapter 15 of the questionnaire, section II) a) present status, including a description of the present type approval system for each sub-sector listed in Chapter 15.I, Section II of this questionnaire; b) forecast (date of adoption and implementation of the EU directives). 


)  The Government of the Republic of Macedonia has adopted National Programme for Approximation of Legislation (NPAL), incorporating the Action Plan for approximation of technical standardisation - technical regulations. The National Programme contains technical regulations from other relevant ministries competent for harmonising legislation, which are related to industry sectors within the scope of the industrial policy. In the following period, within the programming, it is expected that the Action Plan will be appended with other technical regulations that need to be transposed.  The same commitments for adjusting to EU standards have been undertaken with the Action Plan for European Partnership. In that respect, the following laws were adopted and enforced in 2002:   The Law on Standardisation (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 54/2002)   The Law on Accreditation (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 54/2002)   The Metrology Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 55/2002)   The Law on Prescribing Technical Requirements for Products and Conformity Assessment (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 55/02)  The above are entirely in line with European legislation. The 1995 Law on Standardisation (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 23/95) adopted the regulations, secondary legislation and standards from the former SFRY 11,610 JUS standards as Macedonian.  The majority of regulations and secondary legislation acts (rulebooks on quality, orders for mandatory attestation, rulebooks on technical standards, and etc.) have not been revoked and are still in application, i.e. are enforced by the competent ministries and bodies within the ministries. The majority of standards were mandatory.  With the new Law on Standardisation (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 54/02) all Macedonian standards are voluntary. In accordance with the Law on Prescribing Technical Requirements for Products and Conformity Assessment (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 55/02), technical requirements are within the competence of the relevant ministries. Macedonian standards are grouped in 18 branches, as follows:   Branch A: Elementary and general standards (6 primary groups) - a total of 101 standards   Branch B: Mining and processing minerals, oils and oil (10 primary groups) - a total of 1,138 standards   Branch C: Metallurgy and metal processing technology (13 primary groups) – a total of 1,079 standards   Branch D: Forestry, timber and wood industry and processing wood materials (11 primary groups) – a total of 559 standards   Branch E: Agriculture, food and tobacco industry (9 primary groups) – a total of 397 standards   Branch F: Textile and clothing industry (8 primary groups) – a total of 321 standards    Branch G: Leather, rubber and plastic materials industry (8 primary groups) – a total of 446 standards   Branch H: Chemical industry (14 primary groups) – a total of 1,724 standards   Branch I: Information technology and data processing (7 primary groups) – a total of 62 standards   Branch J: Energy (1 primary group) – a total of 2 standards   Branch K: Tools and accessories industry (16 primary groups) – a total of 842 standards   Branch L: Measuring and other accurate mechanical devices industry (10 primary groups) – a total of 100 standards   Branch M: Machine construction and metal industry (15 primary groups) – a total of 1,726 standards   Branch N: Electro-technology (15 primary groups) – a total of 1,784 standards   Branch P: Devices, plants and railroad vehicles (10 primary groups) – a total of 367 standards   Branch R: Ship building, devices and plants for river and sea traffic (1 primary group) – a total of 1 standard   Branch U: Civil engineering (12 primary groups) - a total of 533 standards   Branch Z: Standards not belonging to any special group (10 primary groups) – a total of 428 standards. Existing Macedonian standards are not harmonised with European ones, except for branch U: civil engineering, where five European standards in the field of thermal insulation have been adopted as Macedonian standards.

Bylaw on diagnostic medical devices where the Directive 98/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council will be harmonized. 
F. Civil engineering and construction products 
In this field there are 51 regulations (1 law, 4 orders, i.e. decrees and 46 rulebooks) valid, which are still not harmonised with EU standards. The Law on Construction with accompanying bylaws are in their final stage of preparation, and their adoption and implementation is expected in 2005; The preparation of Law on Building Materials and Bylaws will begin in 2005, and its adoption is expected in 2006.  These legal acts are complet4ely harmonized with Council Directive 89/106/EEC relating to construction products. 
G. Transport Equipment Industry 
In this field 22 regulations are applied, which are still not harmonised. The Republic of Macedonia has continuity in the homologation of road vehicles since 1962 on the basis of succession of SFRY by acceptance of the Geneva Convention of 1958 accepted by the Republic of Macedonia on 17 November 1991. (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 89/2000, 95/2000, 21/2002, 45/2002, 35/2004).  On the basis of the accepted Geneva Convention, several homologation orders have been published, as follows:   Order for compulsory attesting (homologation) of vehicles on wheels, equipment     and parts which can be built in and/or used for vehicles on wheels (“Official Gazette of RM” No.  89/2000; 95/2001; 21/2002; 45/2002; 35/2004).    Order for compulsory attesting (homologation) of the vehicles on wheels of the equipment and parts from motor vehicles (“Official Gazette of RM” No.  84/2001; 21/2002; 31/2002; 52/2002; 26/2004; 35/2004).  By adoption of the Amendments to the Law on Transport in Road Traffic Safety (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 14/98; 38/2004) and the Law on Prescribing Technical Requirements for Products and Conformity Assessment (“Official Gazette of RM”   No. 55/02) a legal base is created, through the adopted ECE homologation Rulebooks for vehicle categories L, M, N, O and the corresponding ECE Directives to implement the directives relating to the homologation of the vehicles as a whole. Automatism is also implemented in the procedure of adopting the ECE Rulebooks, and in the national legislation dynamics is introduced for certain Rulebooks through the ECE Rulebooks i.e. through EEC Directives to become completely harmonised in the implementation of the European Directives in this field.  
H. Foodstuffs 
In the preparation of the Law on Safety of Foodstuffs and Products and Materials in Contact with Foodstuffs (“Official Gazette of RM” 54/02), the Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council is taken as a basis. The law is normative-technically prepared to be internationally acceptable, having both horizontal and vertical regulation (Basic Law and a large number of Bylaws).   The analogy of this law is found in the structure of Codex Alimentarius and in the structure of the European Food Legislation.  National legislation in the Republic of Macedonia in the field of sanitary safety of food is still not in full compliance with international standards, however, the adoption of the Law on Safety of Foodstuffs and Products and Materials in Contact with Foodstuffs (“Official Gazette of RM” 54/02)stuffs and Food Contact Products and Materials is based on EU regulations: Directive 2000/13/EC, Regulation (EEC) 2008/92 of the Council, Directive 2001/18/EC, Directive 93/99/EEC of the Council, Regulation (EC) 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council.

B. Calibration, metrology, standards, testing, certification, conformity assessment, accreditation and market surveillance 

1. Please provide information on the relevant regimes for the products: (The answer should be in two parts, to cover industry in general and each of the individual sectors listed in Chapter 15 of the questionnaire, section II) a) short description and b) further evolution. 

)  The current metrological infrastructure is oriented towards legal metrology, i.e. verification of mass measurements has been inherited from the previous system and is entirely centralised In the Bureau of Metrology. Industrial metrology, where calibration is present up to a certain extent, is entirely decentralised and underdeveloped. Conformity assessment for the type of measurements is carried out administratively according to the existing rulebook, while market surveillance, in accordance with Article 39 of the Metrology Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 55/2002), has been left to market inspection, while the Bureau of Metrology takes part only by expert surveillance. The import of measuring instruments is regulated with item 2 of the Decision for classifying import and export goods (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 56/2004) according to the administrative procedure for obtaining a decision for entry into the Registry of the Bureau for Metrology pursuant to the Draft Rulebook on the form, contents and way in which the Bureau for Metrology (hereinafter: the Bureau) maintains the Registry for entry of labels and certificates for conformity of the types of measurements, labels and brands, i.e. certificates for verification of foreign measurements, as well as on the form and contents of the decision for entry in the Registry, i.e. the decision denying entry in the Registry. In addition to the imported ones, the Registry of the Metrology Bureau also records the decisions for conformity assessment of the measuring instruments manufactured in the country. Pending the adoption of this Rulebook, the Bureau for Metrology carries out the import of measuring instruments under the D2 regime of the quoted Decision in accordance with the existing Rulebook on issuing confirmation for meeting metrological and other requirements for measurements.   b) Future evolution The EU technical assistance with the CARDS/SMAQV’a project - Technical Assistance to the Institutes of Standardisation, Accreditation, Metrology and Quality Validation will provide the necessary standards to ensure monitoring and calibration for eight categories of measurements in 2005, as follows: mass, length, volume, pressure, electrical measures, time and frequency, thermometry, reference materials and control of packaged products. The arrangement of the laboratory premises for these standards is underway. The short-term national infrastructure development programme will establish national standards on mass, temperature and pressure by the end of 2006. This programme provides adoption of basic technical regulations on the implementation of the Metrology Law in 2005, which is in its draft version and has been developed in cooperation with international experts from the abovementioned CARDS/SMAQV’a project. Registration of the bodies for conformity assessment and adequate labelling of measurements is incorporated in this regulation and it will become mandatory following the signing of the document for the entry of Macedonia in EU. The Directive 90/384/EEC on non-automatic weighing instruments is in the procedure of transposition in the national legislation with the technical assistance form GTZ within the project-Transposition of New Approach Directives in the National Legislation. The transposition of this directive requires acceptance of the European standard EN 45501 on the part of ISRM. The directives on packaged products will also be transposed with German technical assistance by the end of 2005.   See also answer to question 01_II_B_1 of the same chapter. 
III. FOOD LEGISLATION 
A. Competent authority/ies 
1. Provide flowcharts/organigrammes outlining levels of competencies and showing management lines to describe the structure and organisation of the services in charge of food safety. The division of competencies and the links between the central, regional and local levels should appear clearly (degree of decentralisation/devolution of competence should be defined). Please describe the current status and the foreseen evolution with a precise timetable. 
With respect to foodstuffs, the competent authorities are the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy. The activities of these ministries are carried out through operative offices:   Expert offices taking part in planning and monitoring the situation in the field of foodstuff safety, as well as in developing regulations; Inspection services;   Authorised expert organisations for laboratory control;   Authorised expert organisations for education on minimum hygiene requirements. Within these ministries there are bodies supervising the application of national regulations regarding issues related to food in a broader context:   Ministry of Health – State Sanitary and Health Inspectorate (until 31.12.2004, and Food Directorate from 1.1.2005)   Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy – the Veterinary Directorate, the Plants Protection Administration and the State Agriculture Inspectorate. With the adoption of the Law on Safety of Foodstuffs and Products and Materials in Contact with Foodstuffs (“Official Gazette of RM” 54/02) a Food Directorate has been established as a body within the Ministry of Health, while the control of foodstuffs and food related materials is carried out by foodstuff inspectors. The State Sanitary and Health Inspectorate and the State Market Inspectorate continue to carry out inspection supervision operations for food products and consumer goods pending the commencement of inspection supervision by the Food Directorate (01.01.2005), in accordance with the Law on Safety of Foodstuffs and Products and Materials in Contact with Foodstuffs (“Official Gazette of RM” 54/02) Laboratory control is carried out in authorised institutions:   the State Healthcare Institute;   the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine;   the ten regional healthcare institutes. The organization chart of bodies competent for carrying out foodstuff safety control is given in Figure 1.

The Food Directorate, within the Ministry of Health, started to operate on 01.01.2005 in accordance with the Law on Safety of Foodstuffs and Products and Materials in Contact with Foodstuffs (“Official Gazette of RM” 54/02). With the adoption of this Law and the commencement of work of the Food Directorate the primary objective of the public healthcare policy in the field of foodstuff shall be achieved, upon which the four primary pillars of public healthcare are based: foodstuff safety, foodstuff adequacy, social justice and health ecology.  The adoption of regulations arising from the Law on Safety of Foodstuffs and Products and Materials in Contact with Foodstuffs (“Official Gazette of RM” 54/02) shall create conditions for establishing an integrated food control system in accordance with international standards and EU legislation in this field, thus transforming the traditional national system of foodstuff control into a modern system enabling prevention of food related diseases and injuries.  The competent institution for foodstuff safety and quality will be the Food Directorate, which, according to its organizational setup and statutory obligations, is provided to be competent for general requirements for foodstuff safety and special requirements for separate types of foodstuffs. Within the Directorate, inspection supervision is carried out through regional departments controlling food in specifically determined areas and through a single inspection supervision department competent for import and export foodstuff control. Official control will be carried out at all stages of the foodstuff chain by paperwork inspection, self-control inspection and taking samples. Foodstuff safety accountability is reduced to the food operator (producer). The timely and complete implementation of this system requires additional training for foodstuff inspectors, as well as for system operators of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and the HACCP procedures. The Food Directorate has been incorporated in the National Strategy for Integrated Border Management and in the Action Plan for Integrated Border Management in the Republic of Macedonia. The activities of the Food Directorate in integrated border management started on 01.01.2005. As regards food of animal origin, there is a detailed description in the answer to question 07_VII_A_ _1.

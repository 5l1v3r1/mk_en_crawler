ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Simitis received broad support for his accession plan for Cyprus, according to a poll published Sunday (15 December) in the Vima newspaper. The phone survey was conducted in Athens, Istanbul, the Greek and Turkish parts of Cyprus, and London. Support was above 50 per cent in all areas except London. Simitis wants the leaders of the Greek and Turkish communities on the divided island to reach an agreement by 28 February. If no compromise is found by then, the EU would accept only the Greek part of Cyprus, while the "Turkish Republic of North Cyprus" would have to wait. (Sunday Vima, Athens News Agency - 15/12/02)

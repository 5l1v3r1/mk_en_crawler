SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government plans to organise a special training course for ethnic Albanians interested in joining the country's public administration, cabinet spokesman Sasho Colakovski said Sunday (23 March). The year-long programme, part of government efforts to guarantee equal representation of all ethnic communities in state institutions, would be held at Tetovo University.
Meanwhile, Democratic Union for Integration spokeswoman Ermira Mehmeti, in an interview published in Monday's <I>Dnevnik</I> daily, said ethnic Albanians are satisfied by the latest agreement among the ruling coalition partners regarding bilingual passports and travel documents. Parliament approved a measure Friday tailoring the language on official documents to the individual holder.
<I>Dnevnik</I> also reports that Ljubco Georgievski, chairman of the main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE, may step down from the leadership post at the party congress in May. The newspaper says he will urge the so-called older echelon to follow his move and pave the way for younger colleagues. (Dnevnik, Utrinski Vesnik - 24/03/03; AP - 21/03/03)

TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI) launched new protests against chronic water and energy shortages Sunday (August 26th) in Lushnja. SMI leader Ilir Meta reiterated accusations against Prime Minister Sali Berisha, saying he has failed to make good on promises during his two years in office. Meta says prolonged power cuts are the biggest problem affecting society as a whole. He accused Berisha of using other issues to distract attention from that.

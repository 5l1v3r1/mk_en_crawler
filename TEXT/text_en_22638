SOFIA, Bulgaria -- About 2,000 workers from Bulgaria's largest steelmaker, Kremikovtzi, blocked downtown Sofia on Monday (November 10th), protesting late paychecks. The economy ministry had promised the government would assist the plant with the payments and workers would receive their August and September salaries by Friday. Economy and Energy Minister Petar Dimitrov blamed a ruling by a Sofia court, which found the appointment of the ministry's administrator at Kremikovtzi violated due process.

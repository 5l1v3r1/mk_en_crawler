ZAGREB, Croatia -- The ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), officially launched its election campaign Tuesday (September 11th) in the town of Slavonski Brod, ahead of the November 25th vote. Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, the party chairman, emphasised the accomplishments of the HDZ government during its first term, especially improved economic performance and privatisation procedures. 
Separately Tuesday, Zoran Milanovic, leader of the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP), ruled out any coalition with the HDZ. Polls suggest SDP is the current frontrunner. (Vjesnik, Vecernji List, Poslovni Dnevnik - 12/09/07; HRT, APA - 11/09/07)

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Miners from a bauxite mine near Niksic on Tuesday (January 5th) ended their eight-day strike after receiving written guarantees from Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic that their demands will be met. Strikers have insisted on payment of back wages, guarantees that their collective labour agreement will be respected, as well as guarantees that production at the mine would continue. Earlier in the day, Djukanovic urged the Central European Aluminium Company --which owns the mine -- to "assume responsibility for the situation." He told the Podgorica-based daily Pobjeda "It is unbelievable that the most important representatives of the majority owner, except for the executive director, did not think it was appropriate to stop their vacations while workers have been striking for days in the pits."

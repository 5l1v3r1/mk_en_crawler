SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Thousands of people in Tuzla welcomed Ilija Jurisic home as a hero Monday (October 11th) after an appeals court in Belgrade overturned his 12-year sentence for war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. The court ordered a retrial and released Jurisic from custody. In September 2009, the former Bosnian security officer was found guilty of ordering a May 1992 attack against a former Yugoslav National Army convoy withdrawing from Tuzla. At least 51 soldiers were killed and 50 were wounded in the attack, according to the indictment. Jurisic will have to appear for the new trial when summoned. Thanking well-wishers in his hometown of Tuzla, he said "I feel reborn." (Dnevni Avaz, Srna, Nezavisne Novine - 11/10/10)

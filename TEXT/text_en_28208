BELGRADE, Serbia -- Lists of people convicted, indicted or investigated in Serbia and Croatia for war crimes will be on display at the justice ministries of the two countries, as of Thursday (July 15th), Justice Minister Snezana Malovic announced. Until now, the files were accessible only at consular and diplomatic missions. Former fighters were reluctant to go and check their status, fearing arrest. Malovic said Belgrade and Zagreb have established a joint commission to deal with the issue, following an agreement between the two justice ministries on enhancing co-operation.

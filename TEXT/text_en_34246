BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU has offered to host talks this month between the Serbian government and Kosovo authorities. The offer followed a meeting Thursday (3 July) between EU security chief Javier Solana and Democratic Party of Kosovo leader Hashim Thaci. The EU insists that certain issues must be resolved before the province's final status can be discussed. (B92, Beta - 03/07/03)

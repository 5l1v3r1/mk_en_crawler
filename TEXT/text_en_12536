In other news, the head of the Serbian Council for Combating Corruption, Verica Barac, said Sunday there is no political will for preventing corruption in the country, as the basic legal framework in the field has not yet been established. Barac added that the local judiciary remains far from independent, competent or efficient. (Danas - 09/05/05; Tanjug, B92 - 08/05/05)

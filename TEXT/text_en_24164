BELGRADE, Serbia -- The country is mulling potential legal action against Ukraine over suspended gas deliveries from Russia, Srbijagas CEO Dusan Bajatovic said on Wednesday (January 14th). He insisted Ukraine is to blame for the situation in Serbia. The move came as European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso called on European gas companies to sue Russia and Ukraine over losses from the gas crisis. Serbia has agreed to receive emergency supplies from Germany and Hungary to help it cope with the shortage.
Meanwhile, Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev, along with Slovakian and Moldovan counterparts Robert Fico and Zinaida Greceanii, was in Moscow on Wednesday for an emergency meeting with President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin over the gas crisis. Stanishev said it is unacceptable for all of Europe to be hostage to the gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine. (ITAR-TASS, BNR, Bulgarian parliament web site, AFP - 14/01/09)

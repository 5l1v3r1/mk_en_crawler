BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The government of Republika Srpska said Thursday (28 October) that it has accepted an investigative commission's report on the Srebrenica massacre and has forwarded it to the entity's Constitutional Court. The document, which acknowledges that more than 7,000 Muslims were killed in the enclave when it was overrun by Serbs in July 1995, is the first Bosnian Serb admission of the scope of the atrocity. The government intends to publish parts of the report. But National Assembly Speaker Dusan Stojicic is insisting that the entire report be published in its entirety. 
In other news, Borislav Paravac, a Serb, took over BiH's rotating presidency on Thursday, pledging to work for the country's admission into NATO's Partnership for Peace programme. He said EU integration is his other chief objective. (AFP, Fena, PBS - 28/10/04)

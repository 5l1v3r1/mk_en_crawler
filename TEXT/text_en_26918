TIRANA, Albania -- US Ambassador John Withers praised the work of General Prosecutor Ina Rama on Monday (March 8th), saying she has defended both her integrity and the independence of the office in the face of political pressure. According to Withers, Rama has faced attacks from political groups, often published in the media, which criticised her for doing her job. She has frequently come under fire since her appointment in November 2007, attacked both by the government of Prime Minister Sali Berisha and the opposition, after launching high profile investigations against those in the highest echelons of power.

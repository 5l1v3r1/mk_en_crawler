SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Interior Ministry Chief Secretary Boyko Borissov called on Monday (22 August) for changes to the country's anti-terror legislation. He said Sofia should follow the example of London, enforcing changes that expand the legal grounds for rejecting entry to certain categories of foreigners and providing for expulsions as needed. He also wants to introduce video monitoring in crowded public areas. (Sega - 23/08/05)

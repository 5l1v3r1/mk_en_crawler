BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Carla del Ponte, the UN war crimes tribunal's chief prosecutor, said in a report to the UN Security Council that Serbia-Montenegro has effectively ended all war crimes co-operation, B92 reported on Tuesday (8 June). The message of the report is short and clear: the relationship between the local authorities and the tribunal is "non-existent". The UN Security Council will discuss the report on 29 June. Del Ponte insists that former Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic is hiding in Serbia, something local authorities deny. (B92, Tanjug - 08/06/04)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The extradition of former Serbian Army Chief Nebojsa Pavkovic remains a key obstacle on the road to EU integration, German Ambassador to Serbia-Montenegro Andreas Zobel said Thursday (14 April). He believes that a positive Feasibility Study decision would be adopted by the EU's Council of Ministers on 25 April if Pavkovic were on his way to The Hague. Although International Economic Relations Minister Milan Parivodic agreed with him, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said overall co-operation efforts must be considered, not just Pavkovic's case.
Also Thursday, former Bosnian Serb officer Vujadin Popovic surrendered to the UN war crimes tribunal to face genocide charges stemming from the Srebrenica massacre. Popovic was deputy security chief of the infamous Drina Corps. Prosecutors contend that he had command responsibility for Muslim detainees.
Also at The Hague, the tribunal has decided to grant provisional release pending trial to former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic, former Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff Dragoljub Ojdanic and former Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic. But the judges decided to suspend the ruling to give prosecutors time to appeal it. (B92, AP, AFP, DPA - 14/04/05)

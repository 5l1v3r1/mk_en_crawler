PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK denied Sunday (21 December) that it had received any indictments or extradition demands from the war crimes tribunal in The Hague. The statement was in response to a claim by Serbian Justice Minister Vladan Batic, who said a former leading member of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) should be extradited by the end of the year. Former KLA leader Ramush Haradinaj said he has no knowledge of any colleagues being extradited. (B92, BBC - 22/12/03)

TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha has given up on the idea of reburying Mother Teresa's remains in Tirana, where authorities say she spent time with her family before leaving for India in 1929. "My request was simply human," Berisha said on Monday (October 19th) while visiting a charity institution named after the nun. "A great symbol which brings two nations together cannot turn into an opposition between our two nations and countries," Berisha added, as he marked the sixth anniversary of her beatification by the Catholic Church. He made the initial request to India earlier this month, hoping to clear the way for bringing the Nobel Peace laureate's remains to Albania before the 100th anniversary of her birth, next August. Mother Teresa was born to an ethnic Albanian family in Macedonia. (Top Channel, Klan, Alsat, News 24 - 19/10/09)

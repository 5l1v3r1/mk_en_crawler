TIRANA, Albania -- The government adopted a draft law Wednesday (September 30th) on transportation for officials and civil servants that strips them of perks and privileges enjoyed for almost 20 years. The belt-tightening measure will set a reasonable standard for reimbursement, saving the country up to 20m euros annually. (BBC, Shekulli, Ora News, Alsat - 30/09/09)

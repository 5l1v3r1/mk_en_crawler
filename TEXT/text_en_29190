TIRANA, Albania -- Police in the eastern town of Korca have busted a criminal network that assisted locals in obtaining Greek visas for money. The Economic Crime Office on Monday (April 5th) arrested a representative of a Roma association in the town, while two other women are under investigation. The alleged scheme allegedly charged each person who wanted to get a Greek visa between 1,500 and 2,000 euros. Several weeks ago, police in Korca arrested a representative of the Greek organisation OMONIA for visa fraud. (Lajmifundit, Balkan Web, Ora News, Top News - 05/04/10)

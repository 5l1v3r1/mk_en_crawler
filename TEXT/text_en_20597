ANKARA, Turkey -- The energy ministry announced on Wednesday (January 9th) that Ankara has terminated natural gas supplies to Greece, due to reduced supplies of Iranian gas to Turkey. A representative of Greece's national gas grid management company DEPA said the flow from Turkey was stopped on Saturday. An official from the Iranian Oil Ministry said that the natural gas flow to Turkey will be gradually increased, though he did not provide any timeframe. Greece says it is negotiating with Turkey to resume supplies. DEPA said the shortfalls will be covered by other sources. Russia's Gazprom, one of Europe's main gas suppliers, says it is increasing natural gas deliveries to both Greece and Turkey.

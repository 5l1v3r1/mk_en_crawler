BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso told Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski on Wednesday (December 2nd) that Skopje should settle its long-standing name dispute with Greece and continue implementing EU-required reforms. According to Barroso, the EC recommendation for starting accession talks with Macedonia and the decision on visa liberalisation should be a stimulus for resolving the name row. Gruevski said his country remains committed to the EU agenda and will continue working to achieve membership. He added that Skopje will keep trying to resolve all open issues, including the name dispute. (MIA, Makfax, A1 - 02/12/09)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Despite reservations, President Ahmet Necdet Sezer signed constitutional amendments Tuesday (31 December) that would allow ruling party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan to become prime minister. Sezer had earlier vetoed the measures, arguing the legislation was devised purely to suit Erdogan's situation. Erdogan was banned from running for parliament following a 1999 conviction for inciting religious intolerance. After the constitutional amendments are confirmed, Erdogan might be able to run in next month's by-election in the province of Siirt, where recent election results were declared invalid due to irregularities. A victory would send him to parliament, enabling him to assume the post of prime minister. (Turkish Daily News, Milliyet - 02/01/03; Anadolu Agency, TRT - 31/12/02)

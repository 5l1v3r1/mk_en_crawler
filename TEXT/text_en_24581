NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cypriot President Demetris Christofias said on Friday (March 6th) that Turkey's influence over Turkish Cypriots was harming the ongoing direct talks to reunify the divided island. "I ... stress once again that if the EU and the international community don't convince Turkey that [Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali] Talat is the negotiator and must be completely free to negotiate, then things will be difficult," Christofias said at a news conference. "There will be a settlement if Turkey shows understanding and changes its stance."
Meanwhile, Talat signalled Saturday he may not run for a new mandate in 2010 if the two Cypriot communities do not reach a settlement by the end of 2009. "If there's no hope for a solution [by year-end], I will not have completed my mission," Talat said to the daily Sabah. He admitted the pace of the direct reunification talks was slow, blaming "serious differences" between the two sides on property disputes and exchanges of territory.

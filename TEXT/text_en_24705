PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The European Commission (EC) has decided that visa liberalisation should apply only to citizens with exact addresses within Serbian territory, and "not ... citizens living on Kosovo's territory", according to local media reports Monday (July 6th). The EC reportedly will include Serbia in the so-called White Schengen list, which means visa-free travel to EU member countries, this fall. Biometric passports issued by Serb authorities are not valid for citizens of Kosovo regardless of their ethnicity, local media added, citing Belgrade newspapers.

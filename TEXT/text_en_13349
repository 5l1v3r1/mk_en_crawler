SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Police officially assume control of Macedonia's border on Monday (29 August), when the army hands over responsibility for the last remaining section -- the western border with Albania. On Friday, President Branko Crvenkovski, and the army's head of general staff, General Miroslav Stojanovski, took a final tour of the western border. They were assured of excellent co-operation from Albania in preventing illegal border crossings. The transfer of responsibilities began in May 2004. 
In other news, Poland reportedly has become the latest country to formally recognise Macedonia's constitutional name "Republic of Macedonia", according to local media in Skopje Saturday. Due to the ongoing name dispute with Greece, Poland reportedly plans to use the name "Republic of Macedonia" in bilateral -- but not in international -- communications.

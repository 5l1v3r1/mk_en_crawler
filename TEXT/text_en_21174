THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal denied on Wednesday (October 31st) an appeal by former Bosnian Serb police officer Dragan Zelenovic. He claimed his 15 year sentence for repeatedly raping Muslim women in Foca, a town in Bosnia and Herzegovina, during the 1992-1995 conflict was too severe, in light of his guilty plea. He was sentenced in April. (Studio B, AP, RTRS, Reuters - 31/10/07)

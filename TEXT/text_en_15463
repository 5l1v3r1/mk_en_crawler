BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian authorities have charged eight former police officers with the murder of 48 Kosovo Albanians in 1999. The victims, almost all members of one family, were taken to a cafe in the town of Suva Reka and executed. The dead included 13 children and a pregnant woman. When the Yugoslav forces left Kosovo, authorities say the remains of the Suva Reka victims and hundreds of others were taken and reburied in a police compound near Belgrade to hide evidence of the atrocities. The eight suspects include former Suva Reka police chief Radoje Repanovic and the former deputy commander of the Serbian gendarmerie, Radoslav Mitrovic. Five of the indictees were on active service when they were arrested last October. 
In other news, Serbia-Montenegro Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic warned on Tuesday that pressure on Belgrade from the United States and the EU would increase significantly if Ratko Mladic were not arrested before the end of the month. Ljajic, who is in charge of co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, urged Serbian authorities to redouble their efforts to find the fugitive. (Reuters, BBC, UPI, RTS, B92 - 25/04/06)

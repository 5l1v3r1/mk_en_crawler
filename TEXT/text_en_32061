SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in Sarajevo, and Carla del Ponte, the chief UN prosecutor, agreed Tuesday (19 November) that BiH should develop the capacity to prosecute minor war crimes cases. They called on the international community to provide resources and assist local authorities in establishing a new court that would handle such cases. Ashdown said he would raise the issue at this week's meeting of the Peace Implementation Council in Brussels. The two also called on authorities in Republika Srpska to hand over suspected war criminals, including former Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic.

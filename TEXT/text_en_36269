BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Organisers of an annual sausage festival in the Serbian village of Turija cooked what they described as the world's longest sausage on Saturday (28 February). Twenty-eight pigs, 40kg of paprika, 50kg of salt, 2kg of pepper and 5kg of garlic were used to make the 2,020m-long sausage. However, the organisers were disappointed by the failure of representatives of the Guinness Book of World Records to turn up for the event. The group also came under fire from the local Eastern Orthodox Church, which has already started the 40-day Easter fast. (AFP - 28/02/04)

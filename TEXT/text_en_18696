BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Leading Bosnian Serb politicians signed a statement Wednesday (March 7th), rejecting any collective responsibility by Republika Srpska (RS) or the Serbian people for the 1995 Srebrenica genocide. Among those signing it were BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric, the Serb member and incumbent Chairman of the BiH Presidency Nebojsa Ramanovic, RS President Milan Jelic, RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik and RS Parliament Speaker Igor Radonjicic. They voiced concern over potential fallout from a verdict last week by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) -- recognising that genocide was committed in Srebrenica by Bosnian Serb forces but acquitting Serbia of direct responsibility for the massacre. 
Later on Wednesday, leaders of the two main Bosniak parties in BiH, the Party of Democratic Action's Sulejman Tihic and the Party for BiH's Haris Siljadzic, who is also the Bosniak member of the BiH Presidency, issued a declaration of their own. They said that negating genocide and the responsibility for committing it represents the last phase of genocide. They added that the ICJ verdict necessitates a revision of the BiH Constitution, including administrative-territorial divisions, as the current ones are the direct result of genocide.

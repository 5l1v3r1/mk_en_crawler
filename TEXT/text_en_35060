THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A UN tribunal spokesman said Saturday (28 February) that arrangements have been made to facilitate Slobodan Milosevic's work on his defence. The former Yugoslav president will get his own office equipped with phones, computers, filing cabinets and facilities for confidential interviews. A second room will be made available to Milosevic in the building of the court. The defendant has until 8 June to prepare his case. Zdenko Tomanovic, one of Milosevic's three legal advisers, said that his client plans to call important leaders and European security service members to take the stand.

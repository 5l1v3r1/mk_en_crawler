PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The interior ministry has declared as invalid Serbia's new car plates with abbreviations of cities in Kosovo. Outgoing Minister Bajram Rexhepi ordered authorities on Tuesday (January 11th) to confiscate the new registration plates, which Belgrade has been issuing for seven municipalities in Kosovo since January 1st. Kosovo Serbs are allowed to use the old version of plates that are valid until the government decides to set a deadline for re-registration. Belgrade officials criticised Rexhepi's decision, as Serbia does not recognise any statehood-promoting document produced by institutions in Pristina.

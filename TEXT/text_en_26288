SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said on Friday (February 12th) that the US will have preliminary talks with the Bulgarian government on the possibility of hosting elements of the US anti-missile defence shield. At a press conference, Borissov said the decision would be shared by the EC and the Bulgarian parliament. "I believe that we should demonstrate solidarity. When you are a member of NATO, you should work for collective security," Borissov said. The statement came after Romania's Supreme Defence Council approved the US plan last week. 
Reacting to Borissov's statement, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Sunday that he will ask Bulgaria for explanation of this "unwelcome surprise." "We have already questioned our US partners in Washington â€¦ as to the meaning of this, and why we have this Bulgarian surprise after the Romanian surprise," Lavrov was quoted as saying.

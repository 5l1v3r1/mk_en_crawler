KOZLODUY, Bulgaria -- A technical problem at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant's Unit 5 has been fixed and the 1,000Mgw reactor will not be suspended for repair works, company management said Saturday (November 11th). There had been plans to shut down the reactor on Friday due to leaks. Suspension of the fifth unit could have had an impact on Bulgaria's energy supply, since another unit at Kozloduy is undergoing a scheduled annual upgrade.

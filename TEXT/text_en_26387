BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Former Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic said on Thursday (November 12th) in Banja Luka that she has no intention of returning to politics in Republika Srpska (RS). Though she met with RS President Rajko Kuzmanovic, she insisted that her visit was private in nature, rather than a public appearance. She also praised the progress RS had made while she was in prison in Sweden. Plavsic was released from the facility late last month after serving two-thirds of her 11-year sentence. In 2003, the UN war crimes tribunal convicted her after she pleaded guilty to a single count of persecution, a crime against humanity, in connection with the ethnic cleansing campaign aimed at driving Croats and Muslims out of Serb-controlled areas of Bosnia.

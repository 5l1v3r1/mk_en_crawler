TIRANA, Albania -- Mayor Edi Rama flew to New York on Sunday (27 October) where he will accept the UN Prize for 2002. He is one of six winners singled out for their contributions to fighting poverty and protecting the environment. The ceremony will take place Wednesday at the UN under the auspices of Secretary General Kofi Annan. The 38-year-old Rama, one of the first leaders in Albania's democratic movement, played a key role in the collapse of the communist regime. (ATA - 27/10/02)

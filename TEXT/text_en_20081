BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Albania should move ahead with justice and political reforms to win NATO membership, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said on Friday (October 19th) after a meeting with Albanian President Bamir Topi. He said that despite Albania's hopes of being invited to the Alliance at its next summit in Bucharest in April 2008, it was still too early to say whether this would happen. Topi, for his part, reiterated that becoming part of the EU and NATO is a top priority of Albania. He vowed to boost reforms and focus on efforts to curb corruption and organised crime.

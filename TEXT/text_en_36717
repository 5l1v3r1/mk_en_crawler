TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament's economic and legal committees heatedly discussed the main ideas of the controversial property bill Monday (26 July), but failed to reach any consensus on the measure. Lawmakers approved it weeks ago, but only members of the ruling Socialist Party participated in the vote, as members of the major opposition Democratic Party had left the session. President Alfred Moisiu returned the measure to parliament in hopes the sides could find common ground and pass it. (Albanian Daily News - 27/07/04)

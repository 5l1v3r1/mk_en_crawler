ZAGREB, Croatia -- Luxembourg, current holder of the rotating EU presidency, said Tuesday (12 April) that the EU panel formed to assess Croatia's co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal would hold its first meeting on 26 April. Croatian and tribunal representatives, including chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte, will participate in the session. The EU decided to form a special task force to scrutinise the level of Croatia's co-operation last month, after the start of EU membership talks with Zagreb was delayed over lack of progress in that area.

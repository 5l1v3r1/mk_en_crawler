ATHENS, Greece -- Six farmers who tried to stop traffic across the Bulgarian-Greek border to protest austerity measures were arrested on Monday (February 7th). Despite police efforts to prevent the blockade of the Kulata-Promahon border checkpoint by about 150 tractors, some of the protestors made it through, blocking traffic. About 200 textile workers who lost their jobs protested at the same spot, snarling traffic. 
Meanwhile, about 7,000 doctors launched a four-day strike Monday against reforms in the healthcare sector, which are due to be voted on by parliament Wednesday. The reforms aim in part to open the healthcare sector to competition and modernise services. Dozens of doctors staged a sit-in protest outside the Health Ministry building in Athens.

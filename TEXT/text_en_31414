NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Hundreds of frustrated Greek Cypriots tried to break through a human chain of UN peacekeepers in Nicosia on Friday (25 April), in an effort to cross to the Turkish Cypriot north. At the city's Ledra palace, UN troops put up a barrier to keep order at the crossing point, where a six-mile traffic jam had formed overnight. Greek Cypriots, starting a four-day Orthodox Easter break, tried to swarm through the UN barrier but were penned in and blocked by troops. On Monday, restrictions on north-south crossings were lifted for the first time since the Mediterranean island was partitioned in 1974. Thursday, Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou welcomed the move, saying it was the result of the EU's decision to accept the Republic of Cyprus in its ranks as a full member.

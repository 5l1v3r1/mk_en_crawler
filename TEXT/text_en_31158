ANKARA, Turkey -- Police detained ten people Thursday (March 3rd) as part of the so-called Ergenekon investigation, into a suspected plot to topple the government. Most of those detained are journalists. Earlier in the day, police raided 16 homes in Ankara and Istanbul, including those of journalists, sparking immediate criticism by media organisations. Two weeks ago, authorities detained three other journalists from Oda TV as part of the same probe. (Hurriyet, Zaman, CNN Turk, Anadolu news agency - 03/03/11)

TIRANA, Albania -- Lawmakers from the main opposition Socialist Party (SP) and their supporters staged a rally Wednesday (April 21st) against the material that public operator TVSH is broadcasting. The protestors accused the government of using TVSH for "propaganda and agitation". SP lawmaker Besnik Baraj says "The public broadcaster has been turned into a private TV for [Prime Minister] Sali Berisha, while all citizens pay taxes for its existence."

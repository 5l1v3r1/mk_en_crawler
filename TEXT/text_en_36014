ZAGREB, Croatia -- Defence Minister Berislav Roncevic on Sunday (28 March) presented the next steps in army reforms. These involve the dissolution of corps and territorial commands to make the armed forces "modern, effective and mobile" and compliant with NATO standards. Roncevic said the previous reorganisation plan was not specific enough with regard to the levels of command. That was also the chief point of criticism by NATO experts during their recent visit to Zagreb. (HINA, Croatian Radio - 28/03/04)

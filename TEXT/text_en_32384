STRASBOURG, France -- The Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers decided to invite the new state of Serbia-Montenegro to join the European rights organisation as its 45th member Wednesday (26 March). "After so many years of waiting, human suffering and despair, the last remaining part of what was once known as Yugoslavia will take its place among Europe's democratic family of nations," said Peter Schieder, the president of the Council's Parliamentary Assembly. A post-accession co-operation programme and a monitoring procedure have been set up to assist Belgrade and Podgorica in meeting their obligations as members. Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic issued a statement saying the decision sends a signal that his country "belongs to Europe and fully deserves to be admitted to its institutions." The CoE had indicated it wanted to bolster the democracy-building process in the wake of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's assassination. Croatia issued a press release following the CoE's announcement, pledging support for the move. (AP, AFP, B92, Tanjug, FoNet, EC documents, BBC, HINA, HRT - 26/03/03)

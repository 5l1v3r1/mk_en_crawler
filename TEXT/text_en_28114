PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Institutions in Pristina called the alleged declaration of independence by Serb municipalities in northern Kosovo a provocation. Though the authors of the declaration are unknown, Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi blamed former Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and his Democratic Party of Serbia. "This is a threat and a provocation and they expected us to react in an immature way. But we have monitored the situation closely and together with the international community we were ready to respond to any situation," Rexhepi said on Wednesday (August 18th). EULEX, meanwhile, downplayed the issue, saying the mission remains focused on fighting organised crime and corruption. "EULEX has no comment to make about any alleged or proposed unilateral declarations of independence," EULEX spokesman Nicholas Hawton said. The International Civilian Office also refused to comment.

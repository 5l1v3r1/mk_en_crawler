BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission warned Romania on Wednesday (October 10th) that it must fix its system for handling subsidies to farmers within 30 days or face sanctions. The EU could cut 25% of these subsidies, or 100m euros, if the system is not fixed. Romanian Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu acknowledged significant delays in bringing the system in line with the EU standards but promised to meet the deadline. 
Also Wednesday, the European Commission announced that Bulgaria, which joined the EU with Romania at the beginning of the year, will receive the full 202m euros in EU farm aid it is entitled to in 2008.

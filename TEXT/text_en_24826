NEW YORK, United States -- Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and Justice Minister Ivan Simonovic met on Wednesday (June 3rd) in New York with Hague tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz, and court President Patrick Robinson. The tribunal presents its reports on war crimes co-operation to the UN Security Council on Thursday. Though no one commented after Wednesday's meeting, Sanader previously has voiced optimism regarding the report on Croatia. He has acknowledged however, there may be some criticism over Zagreb's inability to deliver so-called "artillery diaries" that The Hague has requested in the trial of Croatian generals Ante Gotovina, Mladen Markac and Ivan Cermak. The three are charged in connection with war crimes against Serbs committed during 1995's Operation Storm. Sanader has stressed that Croatia has delivered all documents it has found, but cannot deliver those that are missing or destroyed.

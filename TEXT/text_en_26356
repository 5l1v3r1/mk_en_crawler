TIRANA, Albania -- Thousands of opposition supporters took part in a rally in Tirana on Saturday (October 10th) against what they described as "manipulation" of the June 28th general elections on the part of the ruling Democratic Party of Prime Minister Sali Berisha. Edi Rama, leader of the biggest opposition Socialist Party (SP), urged them to put their signatures on a petition demanding an investigation into the electoral process. The SP won 65 seats in the 140-seated parliament. They have been boycotting parliament, claiming they will not return until an investigation is launched. (AP, Reuters - 10/10/09)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg's cabinet survived two no-confidence votes on Friday (29 November), launched by the opposition Union of Democratic Forces and the Bulgarian Socialist Party. It marked the first time the two archrivals voted together. They called the votes to protest the government's commitment to the EU to close the third and fourth reactors at the Kozloduy nuclear plant by 2006. The cabinet says that it would change its decision if a proposed EU inspection finds the facilities safe enough for longer operation. The National Assembly, on the other hand, has voted to keep the reactors running at least until Bulgaria is admitted into the EU. The two opposition parties accused the government of acting unconstitutionally and ignoring parliament's decision. (24 Chasa - 30/11/02; BNT, bTV, BNR, Mediapool - 29/11/02)

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- The government is not aware of any serious threat to the NATO summit in Istanbul later this month, Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler told reporters on Thursday (17 June). "We are taking and will continue to take every measure to ensure that the summit is safe," he said.
In other news, EU Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen told a group of Turkish politicians and businessmen that their country has made great progress in adopting legislation to strengthen democracy. He warned, however, that the absence of a common EU foreign policy could slow down Turkey's accession talks. EU leaders are to decide in December whether to launch negotiations with Ankara.

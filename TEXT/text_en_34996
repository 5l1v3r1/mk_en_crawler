BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Retired General Pavle Strugar said Tuesday (9 December) that he would return to the UN war crimes tribunal on Friday for the start of his trial. He explained the 10-day delay was for medical treatment he was receiving at a military hospital in Belgrade. The general first appeared before the UN tribunal in November 2001 to plead not guilty to charges related to the shelling of the Croatian town of Dubrovnik in 1991. He was granted provisional release and his trial was set to start on 10 December 2003. Strugar promised to return after Serbia-Montenegro officials warned that they would launch legal proceedings against him. (AFP, B92, BBC, Tanjug - 09/12/03)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Central Election Commission has registered 19 monitors of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) for the July 5th parliamentary elections, media reported on Sunday (June 28th). Earlier this month, PACE protested Bulgarian authorities' failure to issue an invitation for its participation as an international monitor, noting that under the existing rules, this is its inalienable right. PACE also warned that a state's lack of co-operation could result in sanctions. (Sofia news agency, BGNES, BNR - 28/06/09)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Parliament Rapporteur for Serbia Jelko Kacin said on Wednesday (March 17th) that it is up to Serbian authorities to decide whether to participate in an upcoming EU-Balkans summit in Slovenia. He added that EU President Herman Van Rompuy has said he will attend the meeting if Serbian President Boris Tadic does. Tadic has said he will go only if UNMIK represents Kosovo there, as otherwise, attending would imply recognition of Kosovo's independence. (Beta, RTS, Tanjug, FoNet - 17/03/10)

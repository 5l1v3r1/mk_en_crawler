ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian Football Association voted unanimously on Friday (14 July) to sack coach Zlatko Kranjcar over the national team's dismal performance in the 2006 World Cup. Kranjcar took over in 2004 and had an impressive run in the qualifiers, eliminating Bulgaria and ending at the top of the group with Sweden in second place. Kranjcar could not keep his promise to put Croatia in the second round with a second place in its group behind Brazil but before Australia and Japan. Croatia made an early exit from the tournament without a victory and with only two goals in three matches. (ESPN, AP, AFP - 15/07/06)

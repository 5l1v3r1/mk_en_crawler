SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government decided on Friday (October 13th) to provide guarantees to the UN war crimes tribunal for the provisional release of Johan Tarculovski. The aim is get him out of detention and back on Macedonian soil until his trial begins in 2008 at the earliest. He and former Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski are accused of committing atrocities against ethnic Albanian civilians during a police raid on the village of Ljuboten during the 2001 interethnic conflict. Two attempts to secure Boskovski's provisional release have failed. (Dnevnik, Vecer, Utrinski Vesnik - 14/10/06; A1 TV - 13/10/06)

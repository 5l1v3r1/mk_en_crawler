PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Kosovo Culture Minister Astrit Haracija will appear at The Hague war crimes tribunal in January, it was announced on Monday (December 24th). He is accused of intimidating a witness in the war crimes trial against former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj. The trial against Haradinaj, which started early this year, has been hampered by the refusal of witnesses to testify, out of fear of reprisals or intimidation. Investigating authorities at The Hague claim to have proof that Haracija has tried to make trial witnesses change their testimonies in favour of the former prime minister.

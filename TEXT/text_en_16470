LEIPZIG, Germany -- Serbia-Montenegro's opening 2006 World Cup match ended with a narrow 1-0 defeat by the Netherlands on Sunday (11 June). Arjen Robben scored the game's only goal in the 18th minute after he received a perfect pass from Robin van Persie in the centre of the field and then put the ball past goalie Dragoslav Jevric. Robben could have doubled the score just two minutes later with a deadly shot towards the Serbia-Montenegro goal, but the ball was masterfully deflected by Jevric. The Balkan team had its chances with Savo Milosevic coming close to the goal several times in the first half. 
Despite their familiar finesse in handling and passing the ball, the Serbia-Montenegro players never really found a way to dismantle the Dutch defence. The team upped the tempo in the second half but created few real opportunities. German referee Markus Merk awarded six corner kicks to Serbia Montenegro in 90 minutes but it was to no avail for the Balkan team. The loss puts Serbia-Montenegro in a precarious position in Group C, popularly known as "the Group of Death", as it will have to win its next two matches -- against Argentina and Ivory Coast -- to move to the next phase. On Saturday Argentina beat the highly rated African team 2-1.

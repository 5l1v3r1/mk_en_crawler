SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA) has implied it might withdraw parliamentary support for the Republika Srpska (RS) cabinet, led by Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, over his remarks regarding an independence referendum. On Friday (9 June), SDA vice chairman Adil Osmanovic said the SDA deputies at the RS Assembly might stop backing the government's programme and legislative initiatives after Dodik began talking about the division of BiH. 
In other news, BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic announced on Sunday that the government would name, this week, members of the commission established to investigate alleged war crimes in Sarajevo, including crimes against Serbs. Earlier foot-dragging by Terzic prompted RS representatives in parliament to boycott the legislature. (Nezavisne novine - 12/06/06; Dnevni avaz - 11/06/06; RTRS - 10/06/06; RTRS, Srna - 09/06/06)

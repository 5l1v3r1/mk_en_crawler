BUCHAREST, Romania -- UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Gabriela Knaul, urged Romanian authorities Tuesday (May 24th) to make sure key conditions are in place before they introduce four new criminal and civil laws this year. "A reform that truly aims to generate positive changes should foresee prior assessments, clear benchmarks and indicators of achievement and broad consultations with all parties involved," Knaul said, advising the government to postpone the plans by at least a year. She was speaking at the end of a six-day mission to Romania. Knaul says several key conditions should be in place before the laws could be enacted, including ensuring adequate financial and human resources for prosecution services and the courts.

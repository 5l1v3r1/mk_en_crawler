ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government decided on Tuesday (18 April) to dismiss the chairman of the Croatian Posts' management board, Milan Skoblar, appointing Andrej Sardelic as his replacement. According to local media reports, the move stemmed from delays in delivering pensions before the Easter holidays. The finance ministry issued a statement Tuesday, saying funds for pensions and other social benefits were made available for delivery by 13 April.

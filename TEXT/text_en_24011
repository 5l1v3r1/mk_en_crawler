THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Romania offered its opinion Thursday (April 16th) on the legality of Kosovo's unilaterally declared independence before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Romanian Ambassador to Serbia Ion Macovei said the document addresses all the UN resolutions regarding Kosovo. It reiterates that Romania does not recognise Kosovo's independence declaration, as it does not comply with relevant UN resolutions and international law.
Serbia and Kosovo are to present their arguments regarding the independence declaration's legality before the ICJ on Friday. The court's eventual ruling, though closely watched, will be non-binding.

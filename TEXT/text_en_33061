THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Slovenian President Milan Kucan appeared as a witness in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic on Wednesday (21 May) to give his insights into the start of the wars in the former Yugoslavia. Kucan was Slovenia's president and communist party leader in 1991, when his country became the first republic to break away from the old federation. He told the court that Milosevic, who was president of Serbia at the time, was determined not to allow Serbs to live outside of Serbian territory. Milosevic responded by claiming that Kucan had started the war by ordering his troops to attack a Yugoslav Army unit, a move that resulted in 64 deaths.
In other news, Bosnian Serb officer Dragan Obrenovic pleaded guilty Tuesday to crimes against humanity, in connection with the 1995 Srebenica massacre. In exchange, the prosecution dropped the more serious charges of complicity in the commission of genocide. Prosecutors will seek a sentence of 15 to 20 years. (Reuters, AFP - 21/05/03)

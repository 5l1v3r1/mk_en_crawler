BELGRADE, Serbia -- Fifteen people have been arrested in Serbia for defrauding a Novi Sad refinery of around 160,000 euros' worth of oil, police announced on Saturday (November 7th). The arrested, including guards and managers of gas filling stations, are suspected of having bought oil at prices that were lower than their actual cost. Commenting on the operation, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said it is a demonstration of the continuing fight against organised crime and corruption in the country. The arrested will be charged with corruption and counterfeiting documents. (AFP, Beta, RTS - 07/11/09)

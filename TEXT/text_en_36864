PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Kosovo's Parliament on Thursday (8 July) adopted controversial changes to the constitutional framework, which run counter to the UN Security Resolution on the province. Especially thorny is an amendment that would allow parliament to call a referendum on independence from Serbia-Montenegro. Immediately afterwards, UNMIK said no changes would be implemented without UN consent. Though the Kosovo deputies say they are only preparing the province for eventual final status, analysts say the constitutional changes further strain relations between UNMIK and local authorities.

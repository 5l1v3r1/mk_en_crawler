ANKARA, Turkey -- Constitutional reform came a step closer to reality Wednesday (May 12th) when President Abdullah Gul approved a package of amendments passed last week by parliament amid heated debate. Gul's approval appears in the official Gazette on Thursday, kicking off efforts by the ruling Justice and Development Party to hold a public referendum on the reforms in mid-July. But the main opposition Republican People's Party insists it will challenge the amendments before the Constitutional Court -- apply for annulment on procedural grounds -- and has ten days to do so.

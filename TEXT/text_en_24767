ATHENS, Greece -- A homemade device exploded outside the office of former Public Order Minister Sifis Valyrakis in the central Athens district of Kolonaki on Friday afternoon (July 3rd). The blast caused damage but no injuries, police said. The attack followed two other blasts Friday -- one in the Ambelokipi district, and another outside the Hellenic Migration Policy Institute. Later, police said the actual target of the Ambelokipi attack was a McDonald's restaurant, not an adjacent government tax office, as initially believed.
On Saturday, hooded attackers threw petrol bombs offices at the interior ministry in the Athens district of Neos Kosmos. This too caused damage but no injuries.
Meanwhile, a militant group calling itself "Zero Tolerance" is claiming responsibility for two arson attacks last month -- on the Athens office of parliament member Anastasios Neratzis, and on a police vehicle. In a letter to the news site Zougla, the group threatened new attacks on police and government targets. (Kathimerini, Ta Nea, Ethnos, ANA-MPA - 04/07/09; ANA-MPA, Zougla - 03/07/09)

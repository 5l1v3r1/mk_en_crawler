ZAGREB, Croatia -- The ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) suspended former Economy Minister Damir Polancec from all party duties Tuesday (March 30th) following his arrest in connection with a shadowy affair involving local food producer Podravka. The party also decided to launch a disciplinary procedure against him. Polancec was arrested earlier in the day as part of an investigation into financial wrongdoings in Podravka, where he worked before joining the government. 
In other news Tuesday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said in an interview with EurActiv that he will personally ensure that Croatia fully complies with the EU criteria before it joins the bloc, so that a monitoring mechanism similar to the one applied to Romania and Bulgaria in 2007 would be unnecessary. 
Also Tuesday, Croatia's chief EU negotiator, Vladimir Drobnjak announced that Zagreb has been invited to submit its negotiating position for the competition chapter. This confirms that the EC acknowledges the country has met all necessary benchmarks, including the one regarding the privatisation of shipyards. Croatia has yet to start accession negotiations on two other chapters. (HINA, Vjesnik, Jutarnji Kist, HRT, Index, Slobodna Dalmacija, Tanjug, EurActiv, Nova TV - 30/03/10)

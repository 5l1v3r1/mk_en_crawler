ANKARA, Turkey -- Less than a third of the public now believes Turkey must join the EU, a sharp decline from previous years. According to a poll published in Tuesday's (October 24th) Milliyet, 32.2% of Turks feel strongly that their country belongs in the EU, compared to 57.4% in 2005 and 67.5% in 2004. Some 25.6% of the respondents say Turkey should not join the EU, up from 10.3% a year ago. The country has been recently criticised by the EU for slow reforms and failing to implement its obligations under an extended 2005 customs union protocol that includes Cyprus. 
In other news, local media reported on Wednesday that 26 suspected aides of the terrorist organisation Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) were arrested in the southeast province of Siirt. Information that led to the arrests reportedly was supplied by a senior PKK member, who surrendered last week. (The Scotsman, EU Observer, Milliyet - 25/10/06; Milliyet, Zaman - 24/10/06)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A 90-strong Macedonian infantry unit left on Tuesday (13 June) for Afghanistan to serve in the International Security Assistance Force under British command. While Macedonia has maintained a small medical team there, this is the first military contingent deployed by Skopje, following a decision by parliament last month to boost the country's participation in the NATO-led peacekeeping operation in Afghanistan. At a formal send-off ceremony Tuesday, President Branko Crvenkovski said the deployment confirms the credibility of Macedonia as a stable partner of NATO. (A1 TV, Telma TV - 13/06/06)

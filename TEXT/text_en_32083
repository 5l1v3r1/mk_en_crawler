BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- The Serbian parliament is due to meet Friday (18 October) to debate changes to the election law. Natasa Micic, speaker of the house, told a local radio station that deputies are expected to remove the requirement for a 50 per cent voter turnout in the presidential elections. Vojislav Kostunica failed in his bid for the Serbian presidency last Sunday because only 45 per cent of the voters went to the polls. His camp immediately appealed the decision to annul the results, claiming that there were hundreds of thousands of non-existent voters on the lists. Electoral Commission president Radoslav Bacovic responded that the DSS had its own member in the commission who approved the lists before the elections.
The EU meanwhile urged policy makers in both Serbia and Montenegro to keep the failed election from affecting adoption of the constitutional charter of the joint state. Riding on this is admission to the Council of Europe. (AP, AFP, Blic, RFE/RL - 15/10/02)

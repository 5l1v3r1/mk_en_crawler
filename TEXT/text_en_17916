NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council meets behind closed doors Thursday (July 19th) for a last debate on a US-EU resolution on Kosovo. Russia has already rejected the draft, arguing that it is built on the premise that Kosovo would ultimately gain independence. US Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad said the sponsors of the resolution will decide after the debate whether to push for a vote. "If Russia prevents the Council from dealing with this issue â¦ the process then will move outside the Council," he said. "That would not be positive, in our judgment." 
The latest draft envisions 120 more days of negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina, mediated by the six-nation Contact Group, to determine whether Serbs and Kosovo Albanians can find common ground on the province's future. The Security Council would then reconsider the situation, depending on the outcome of the talks.
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice spoke by phone Wednesday with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov regarding the final status issue. Next week a delegation of Kosovo Albanians will meet with Rice in Washington. (B92, Beta, Blic, BBC News - 19/07/07; CBS, AP, VOA, Tanjug, RTS, AP, RTK, RFE, Balkanweb - 18/07/07)

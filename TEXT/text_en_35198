SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Sulejman Tihic, the Muslim member of BiH's tripartite presidency, criticised the government of Republika Srpska (RS) on Sunday (22 February) for arranging a delegation's trip to Moscow without consulting the central government in Sarajevo. Tihic says RS Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic violated the Dayton Peace Accords when he bypassed the foreign ministry and met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and others late last week.
In other news, Bosnian Serb police announced Sunday the arrest of three Serbs, suspected of robbing the homes of Muslim refugees returning to their homes in the Trebinje area. (AFP - 22/02/04)

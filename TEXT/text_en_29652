BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska's (RS) Constitutional Court is expected to rule on Monday (January 31st) on a complaint filed by the Bosniak caucus in the RS Upper House against the appointment of Aleksandar Dzombic as the entity's new prime minister. The Bosniaks insist they have been discriminated against since none of the key positions in the entity -- parliament president, prime minister, House of Peoples president, Constitutional and Higher Court presidents, and chief prosecutor -- has gone to a Bosniak. The RS parliament elected the entity's new government led by Dzombic in late December. The old government has continued to perform its functions, pending the Court's ruling.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Veterinary Services chief Sloboden Cokrevski says Macedonia is sending a poultry sample to Britain for testing. Speaking Tuesday (18 October), he said one of 40 birds tested in the village of Mogila showed flu-like symptoms. Authorities are restricting access to the village as a precaution and are culling birds there. Neighbouring Greece already has reported a case of avian flu.

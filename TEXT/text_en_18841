ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader are denying allegations that the state security service SOA tapped deputies' phones. They met on Monday (February 5th) with SOA chief Tomislav Karamarko, after several lawmakers, including Vesna Skare-Ozbolt, leader of the opposition Democratic Centre, claimed that their phone conversations might have been taped. According to Mesic and Sanader, Karamarko assured them that an investigation proved no illegal surveillance was conducted. Sanader acknowledged, however, that an official has been dismissed over the tapping of calls by NGOs. (Vjesnik, Vecernji list - 06/02/07; HINA, HRT - 05/02/07)

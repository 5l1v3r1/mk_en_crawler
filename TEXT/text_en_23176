PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Two powerful explosions rocked the northern town of Mitrovica early on Wednesday (October 1st). The blasts occurred not far from the courthouse. Sources close to the police say the blasts might be attributable to so-called "cannon blows" -- detonations caused by igniting a large quantity of gunpowder. (FoNet, B92, Beta, RTS - 01/10/08)

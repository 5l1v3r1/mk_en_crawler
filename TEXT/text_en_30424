VIENNA, Austria -- Former Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader could be extradited back home before the end of the year, Barbara Feichteniger, spokeswoman for Austrian prosecutors, announced on Thursday (December 16th). Sanader was detained in Vienna a week ago based on an international arrest warrant. He fled Croatia just hours before parliament voted to strip him of his immunity as a lawmaker. He is reportedly under investigation for possible criminal actions and abuse of power. According to Feichteniger, Sanader will soon decide whether he wants an expedited extradition, and will announce his decision at a December 27th detention hearing. Meanwhile, media in Croatia reports that Interpol has discovered two secret accounts with 1.3m euros Sanader kept in foreign banks. (APA, DPA, HRT, Jutarnji List, Beta, Tanjug, B92 - 16/12/10)

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Following a meeting Wednesday (January 13th) between Prime Minister Borut Pahor and Croatian counterpart Jadranka Kosor, officials announced that Slovenia will allow the opening of two of three problematic chapters in the EU accession talks with Croatia before the next intergovernmental conference opens on February 19th. It appears the chapters will be on environment and fisheries, while the opening of the third chapter -- on foreign security and defence policy -- will be postponed. Croatia has opened 28 chapters so far, and Kosor expects to complete the accession talks this year. (HINA, Vecernji List, Vjesnik, Poslovni, Nova TV, STA, AFP - 13/01/10)

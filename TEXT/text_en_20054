ANKARA, Turkey -- Supreme Court of Appeals Chief Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya has filed suit with the Constitutional Court, demanding the closure of the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) because of alleged links with the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). In the suit, filed Friday (November 16th), the prosecutor also requested banning 221 DTP members, including eight parliamentary deputies, from political activities. The party has 21 MPs in parliament. They are the first pro-Kurdish MPs to sit in parliament in more than a decade.
On Thursday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan rejected calls from the far right opposition Nationalist Movement Party for a vote on lifting the parliamentary immunity of DTP deputies. He said the party should be encouraged to work within the existing political system. (Sabah, Zaman, Radikal - 17/11/07; NTV, BBC, AP - 16/11/07)

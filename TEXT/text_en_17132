SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In a press interview published Sunday (2 April), EU enlargement commissioner Olli Rehn said he is optimistic about BiH's integration into the EU, but urged domestic authorities to make sure the requirements are met. Speaking to Dnevni avaz daily, Rehn said the main tasks include co-operation with the UN war tribunal, progress in the public broadcasting and police sector reforms, and constitutional changes meant to strengthen BiH institutions.
Separately, US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney urged BiH political parties Saturday to ensure the parliamentary adoption of the constitutional amendments. Swift passage is needed for the changes to go into effect in time for the next general elections, to be held in October. (Dnevni avaz, Nezavisne novine - 02/04/06; RTRS - 01/04/06)

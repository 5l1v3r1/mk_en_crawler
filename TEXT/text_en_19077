BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Some 100 Turkish and Kurdish immigrants clashed on Sunday (April 1st) in the Brussels neighbourhood of Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, near the main buildings housing EU institutions. The fight started after a fire at a Kurdish cafe the night before, which Kurds blamed on Turkish immigrants. Police used a water cannon Sunday to disperse the crowd, which in turn threw stones and bottles at police vehicles. No injuries were reported. (AP, bTV - 01/04/07)

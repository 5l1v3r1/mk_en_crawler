DIYARBAKIR, Turkey -- A number of people were injured when police intervened to disperse violent protests by Kurds in southeastern Turkey on Thursday (30 March). The violence started when a number of youths taking part in a large demonstration in Diyarbakir started to throw stones at shops and a police station and set two bank offices on fire. Local authorities said an eight-year-old boy died at hospital from injuries suffered during the rioting. 
The three days of clashes have resulted in four deaths and left more than 250 people injured. (Reuters, Focus - 31/03/06; AP, Anadolu Agency - 30/03/06; Reuters - 28/03/06)

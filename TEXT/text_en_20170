SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A mujahedeen fighter who served on the Bosniak side during the 1992-1995 conflict accused BiH on Wednesday (August 15th) of breaching European human rights conventions by depriving him of BiH citizenship. Imad al-Hussein, also known as Abu Hamza, was granted citizenship 12 years ago. However, authorities decided to revoke it earlier this year as part of a wider initiative against foreigners who, they say, were granted citizenship illegally.
Hussein, a native of Syria, told the daily Nezavisne novine that while he he did nothing illegal, all his appeals for permanent residence and asylum have been rejected on the grounds that his presence in BiH is a threat to national security. He said he plans to sue BiH at the European Court for Human Rights in Strasburg. (B92, Beta, Nezavisne novine - 15/08/07)

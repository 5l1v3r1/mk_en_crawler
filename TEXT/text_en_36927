TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu returned the bill on property restitution to parliament for revision Saturday (3 July). Deputies approved the bill in early June, only after members of the opposition had left the plenary session. The OSCE presence in Tirana praised Moisiu's move, saying it should lead to the re-establishment of political consensus.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Supreme Court of Appeals Chief Prosecutor Sabih Kanadoglu hinted Tuesday (7 January) that ruling party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan cannot run in the by-election set to take place in the province of Siirt. Kanadoglu suggested that any candidate who was barred from running in the original election on 3 November cannot run in the repeat vote. But the chairman of the High Electoral Board (YSK), Tufan Algan, downplayed Kanadoglu's statement, calling it a personal opinion which does not represent the view of any state institution. According to officials of Erdogan's Justice and Development Party, the YSK should have the final say on Erdogan's eligibility. A victory would likely propel him to the premiership.

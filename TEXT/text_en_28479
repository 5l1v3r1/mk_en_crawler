ZAGREB, Croatia -- Former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader has submitted a request for re-activation of his status as lawmaker, Parliament Speaker Luka Bebic confirmed on Thursday (October 14th). The parliamentary committee for mandates and immunity will discuss the issue next week. By law, Sanader's mandate is to be activated eight days after the request is filled. He won the seat in the 2007 election as a candidate of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), but put his mandate on hold after he was appointed prime minister. When he unexpectedly stepped down in July 2009, Sanader activated his parliamentary mandate but almost immediately suspended it again. With the seat comes parliamentary immunity. He testified earlier this week before a parliamentary panel investigating possible corruption stemming from the privatisation of oil and gas company INA, and how Hungary's MOL acquired additional management rights last year.

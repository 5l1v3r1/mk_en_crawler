PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The European Commission's (EC) progress report on Kosovo will conclude for the first time that Serbia is managing parallel institutions in the young country and that the government does not control its own territory, local media reported on Monday (October 12th). The document will be published on Wednesday in Brussels. It reportedly also notes stability in Kosovo, despite some incidents, including attacks on EULEX vehicles. It further reportedly urges Belgrade to encourage Kosovo Serbs to participate in next month's local elections. (Express, Koha Ditore, Kosova Sot - 12/10/09)

TIRANA, Albania -- Authorities have decided to remove concrete bunkers that were built during the Cold War to defend the country from an attack that never happened, Sotir Zarka, mayor of the coastal municipality of Seman, said on Friday (July 24th). The bunkers have caused five deaths, including two children, and a 25-year-old woman, who drowned last year in pools that formed around the moss-covered bunkers. "In this condition, they represent a big threat to tourists, and injuries are quite frequent," Zarka said. (Deutsche Welle - 25/07/09; RTS, BNR - 24/07/09)

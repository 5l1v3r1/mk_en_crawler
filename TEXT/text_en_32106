SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR uncovered seven combat helicopters, allegedly marked as helicopters for medical use, during an inspection of the Zaluzani military airport near Banja Luka, according to an SFOR statement issued Saturday (16 November). That means the Bosnian Serb entity's army has more combat helicopters than permitted by the General Framework Agreement and the OSCE Agreement. SFOR wants the army to explain how it will resolve the problem by Monday.
In other news, Senior Deputy High Representative Ambassador Gerhard Enver Schroembgens urged BiH authorities on Thursday to speed up budgeting for the alternative accommodation of people still occupying claimed property, in order to complete the refugee return process. The new Strategic Direction on Property Law Implementation, launched by the international community nearly a month ago, required BiH institutions at every level to calculate what proportion of their revenues would be spent on refugee returns next year.

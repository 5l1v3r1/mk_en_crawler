TIRANA, Albania -- Wrangling over a controversial media bill may again hamper work by parliament, with the main opposition Socialist Party (SP) threatening to freeze its relations with the ruling Democratic Party (DP) over the measure. On Monday (19 June) the parliamentary majority led by DP rejected a request by President Alfred Moisiu to revise a clause in the draft media law, which would ban owners of stakes in private media ventures from participating in privatisation tenders or public procurement tenders for state-run companies. Moisiu has said he is concerned it would violate the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of entrepreneurship, a view shared by SP. 
In other news Monday, Albanian border and criminal police launched an operation dubbed "Clean Sea", aimed at combating illegal trafficking. Over 100 police troops are participating in the action, which includes searches of motels, vehicles and boats in the districts of Durres and Kavaja.

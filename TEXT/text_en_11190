WASHINGTON, United States -- The US is prepared to consider relaxing the visa regime for Bulgarian citizens, the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry announced Saturday (26 March), following talks between Minister Solomon Passy and US Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice in Washington the previous day. Passy said Sofia was ready to fulfil US requirements that could lead to full liberalisation of the regime. During his talks with Rice, Passy also discussed issues related to Iraq as well as the case of five Bulgarian nurses sentenced to death in Libya.

ANKARA, Turkey --Turkey's health ministry announced on Saturday (October 24th) the country's first swine flu death. The victim was a 29-year-old man who was hospitalised after initially being diagnosed with pneumonia. Tests conducted after his death revealed he was infected with the A/H1N1 virus. Turkey registered 958 swine flu cases, forcing authorities earlier this month to close several schools in Ankara and Diyarbakir. (Hurriyet, AP, AFP - 24/10/09)

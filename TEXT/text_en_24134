BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The government plane carrying Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski to Paris had to return to Brussels on Thursday (May 14th) because of technical problems. Media reported that the aircraft's onboard computer system and radar equipment failed at an altitude of 6,000m. Gruevski instead went to France by train. His scheduled meeting with President Nicolas Sarkozy was postponed to Friday. (A1, Makfax, MIA, MRT, BTA - 14/05/09)

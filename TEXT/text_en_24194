SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Bosniak caucus in Republika Srpska's (RS) parliament threatened on Monday (July 13th) to boycott work until they are given more say in the legislature. As a minority, they are routinely over-ruled by other lawmakers. The last straw came last week, after the RS Constitutional Court moved to erase the prefix "Bosnian" from the names of two towns -- Bosanski Brod and Bosanska Kostunica. While RS President Rajko Kuzmanovic condemned the Bosniaks' move to block work in parliament, Vice President Adil Osmanovic, a Bosniak himself, supported the decision, saying Bosniaks had no other choice than to defend their constitutional rights. Lawmakers are due to debate key measures regarding the 2009 budget and to ratify a 1.2 billion-euro stand-by agreement with the IMF. (Avaz, Fena, Srna, Pincom.info, BHRT - 14/07/09)

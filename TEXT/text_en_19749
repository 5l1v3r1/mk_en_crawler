PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Police announced on Thursday (August 23rd) that a total of 92.6 kg of explosives, believed to be TNT, have been found in two villages near Pec, close to the border with Montenegro. A police spokesman said two Albanians, a father and a son, have been arrested. KFOR reportedly has sealed off the area and established checkpoints around the two villages -- Vitomirica and Novo Selo. "We don't know yet what the explosive was intended for, but it sure wasn't for fishing," a Pec police official said. (DPA, Fonet, RTS, Svoboda radio, B92 - 23/08/07)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- A court in Belgrade will discuss a plea bargain Monday (May 9th) between turbo-folk diva Svetlana Ceca Raznatovic and prosecutors. Under the deal, Ceca would plead guilty to embezzlement charges in exchange for several months in prison and a fine of 1.5m euros. The sentence would be spent in home detention rather than behind bars. Ceca was charged with misappropriating millions of euros while trading football players from the Obilic club she headed to foreign clubs. (Beta, B92, Tanjug - 08/05/11)

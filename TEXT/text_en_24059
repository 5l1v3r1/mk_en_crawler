TIRANA, Albania -- Police will respect the law and will not take sides during the June 28th general elections, chief police director Ahmet Prenci said on Wednesday (April 15th) after meeting with police chiefs from southern cities. "We have to monitor every police officer and in case of violations of the law, there will be disciplinary actions or even terminations," Prenci said.
In other news, Albanian and Dutch forces are working to clear the waters in the port of Vlora of old ammunition, local media reported on Wednesday. Tonnes of shells dating back to World War I are in the area, as well as shells from the 1997 disorder in Albania. This marks the first operation with a NATO partner since Albania joined the Alliance earlier this month.
Also on Wednesday, Chief Prosecutor Ina Rama said that investigations into last year's deadly Gerdec ammunition depot explosions are fair and free of political influence. On Tuesday, local media published reports linking Prime Minister Sali Berisha to the company that built the ammunition-dismantling centre in Gerdec. Explosions there in March 2008 killed 26 people and injured 300. (Shekulli, VoA, Balkan Web, Ora News, Top Channel, Klan, Alsat, Top Albania Radio - 15/04/09)

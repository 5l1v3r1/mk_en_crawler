ATHENS, Greece -- The ruling government managed to defeat on Wednesday (April 2nd) an attempt by the opposition to call a referendum on a controversial bill that would reform the pension system. The government says the reforms, which have sparked a wave of strikes nationwide, are designed to restructure the social security system, which experts have warned may collapse in 15 years if unchanged. Unions, however, fear the planned reforms will cut pension benefits and increase the retirement age. (Reuters, ANA-MPA, ERT, Naftemporiki - 02/04/08)

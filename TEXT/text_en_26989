BELGRADE, Serbia -- War crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic on Tuesday (August 4th) gave Council of Europe (CoE) special rapporteur Dick Marty what Belgrade regards as evidence that members of the now disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) kidnapped Serb civilians during the Kosovo conflict, took them to camps in northern Albania and removed their organs for sale on the black market. "We have presented Marty with analysis, investigation results, evidence, extensive material that backs our claims," said Bruno Vekaric, spokesman for Vukcevic's office. He added that Belgrade hopes the CoE will pass a resolution with recommendations on the case. Marty ended a two-day visit to Serbia on Tuesday before travelling to Albania for additional fact-finding. (Tanjug, RTS, B92, Beta, AP - 04/08/09)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The opposition People's Action Party (PAP) urged Prime Minister Adrian Nastase Sunday (9 November) to dismiss the head of his political cabinet, Remus Truica, for violating the anti-corruption law. According to the PAP, Truica failed to declare bank assets in Romania and abroad, as well as a 15 per cent stake held by his wife in a local company that supplied the government with IT services and hardware.
Meanwhile, Nastase's Social Democratic Party has requested the resignation of Bucharest's mayor, Traian Basescu, for failing to declare ownership of a villa in his property statement. (ACT Media - 10/11/03; Mediafax, Rompres, BBC - 07/11/03)

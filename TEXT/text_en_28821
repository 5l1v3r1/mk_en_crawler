 SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- European Parliament rapporteur on visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans Tanja Fajon said on Friday (April 9th) that she doubts that BiH will be included in the EU visa-free regime in July. In an interview with Sarajevo-based daily Nezavisne Novine, Fajon stressed that BiH should not be discouraged by a possible delay, and urged the country to focus on completing its remaining tasks. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, voiced hope earlier in the week that the bloc will include BiH in its visa-free regime in June.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- After almost a month of debate, parliament on Monday (October 30th) adopted a crucial police law. It regulates police operations, organisations, authorities, rights and obligations and provides for the establishment of new police structures and methods to combat crime. But the law fails to address the controversial issues of equal representation, internal control and the use of languages by police. These are to be covered in subsequent legislation. Police reform is key to Macedonia's EU membership bid. (Vecer - 31/10/06; MIA, Makfax, A1 TV, Telma TV - 30/10/06)

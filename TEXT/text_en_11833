ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament adopted a declaration Wednesday (19 January) vowing political co-operation related to EU accession. The document affirms that all institutions will join forces to ensure the success of the membership bid. Official talks with the Union are expected to start in March. 
Also Wednesday, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said the government would focus on the voting rights of those with dual citizenship, particularly Croats in neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). The move follows problems with voters' lists in BiH during the recent Croatian presidential election. (HINA, HRT, index.hr - 19/01/05)

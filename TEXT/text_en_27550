PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Six people were injured by an explosion in the Bostane village in the eastern municipality of Novo Brdo late Saturday (August 28th). Police say one of the injured is in serious condition, but is expected to survive. The incident is believed to have stemmed from a private feud, rather than being ethnicity-based. 
Earlier Saturday, attackers threw a hand grenade at a police station in the northern town of Zubin Potok. It damaged two police vehicles parked outside but caused no injuries. Police spokesman Besim Hoti said a vehicle belonging to a Serb police officer was also torched. (RTS, Tanjug, B92, DPA- 29/08/10; AP - 28/08/10)

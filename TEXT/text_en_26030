ZAGREB, Croatia -- A judge ruled on Monday (August 17th) that the suspected killers of Amar Mistric, 23, who was murdered in Sarajevo on Thursday, should remain in custody for 40 more days, pending extradition. Edin Vuk and Anel Herak were detained in Croatia on Sunday but are not fighting extradition to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mistric was killed after refusing to serve the men drinks. The murder prompted hundreds of citizens to block some of Sarajevo's main streets Friday and Saturday. (HRT, Fena, RTRS, Dnevni Avaz - 17/08/09)

TIRANA, Albania -- Tirana's district court confirmed on Tuesday (November 17th) its decision to keep oil mogul Rezart Taci in custody, denying him the opportunity to post bail. Taci is accused of beating publisher and political commentator Mero Baze at a Tirana bar earlier this month. Taci denies any involvement in the attack. He surrendered to police on November 6th, after a local court issued an arrest warrant. Baze published a series of reports that accused Taci of tax evasion. (VoA, Top News, Balkan Web - 17/11/09)

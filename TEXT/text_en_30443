TIRANA, Albania -- Police in Tirana reported two separate incidents Sunday (April 10th) during rallies in support of political parties ahead of the May 8th local elections. The first happened in the village of Kashar, just outside the capital, where supporters of the main opposition Socialist Party (SP) tried to attach posters to a private bar. The owners objected and a brawl began which sent three people to hospital. One person was arrested. 
In another incident in Bathore, two vehicles plastered with SP posters and flags were smashed. The SP is demanding police stop threats against its supporters. The campaign for the local elections, which kicked off officially on Friday, has been marred by incidents and fierce rivalry between party officials and supporters.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Momcilo Krajisnik will serve his 20-year sentence for crimes committed against non-Serb civilians during the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) in the United Kingdom, The Hague war crimes tribunal announced on Tuesday (September 8th). Krajisnik was transferred to Britain on Monday. In March, the tribunal's Appeals Chamber reduced his sentence from 27 to 20 years after cancelling the counts convicting him of the murder, extermination and persecution of non-Serbs during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. The new sentence takes into account the time Krajisnik has spent in custody since April 2000. 
In other news, Hague tribunal Judge O-Gon Kwon said on Tuesday that the trial of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic could begin on October 19th. Prosecutors will have one year to present their case, and Karadzic will have equal time for his defence. Kwon turned down Karadzic's request to delay the start of the trial by ten months.

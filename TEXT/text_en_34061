SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Economic development and creation of an investor-friendly environment are the top priorities of US involvement in BiH, outgoing US Embassy Charge d'Affaires Christopher Hoh said at a news conference Thursday (24 July). He added that creating new jobs required reforms, and that the rule of law would attract foreign capital. In addition, he called for "actions . against leaders of organised crime" and cited reform of the country's armed forces and acceleration of the refugee return process as further priorities. As of next week, Hoh returns to the United States and Tina Kajdanov takes the post. (OHR Sources - 25/07/03; Onasa - 24/07/03)

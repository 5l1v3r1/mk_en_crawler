SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Palestinian doctor Ashraf Ahmad Jum'a, convicted along with five Bulgarian nurses in a controversial HIV infection case in Libya, has been granted Bulgarian citizenship. Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin told journalists Tuesday (June 19th) that citizenship would allow Ashraf's extradition to Europe, if the case were resolved. On Wednesday, Libya's Supreme Court begins hearing the final appeal against the death sentences handed down against the six. (Focus, Darik - 19/06/07)

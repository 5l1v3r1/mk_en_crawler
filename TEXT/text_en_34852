BUCHAREST, Romania -- German Finance Minister Hans Eichel said his government backs Romania's EU accession efforts and would provide whatever support is needed. During Saturday's (2 August) visit to Bucharest, he acknowledged that Romania has achieved significant progress with respect to economic development over the past few years, but said further progress was needed to meet EU accession standards. Romania hopes to join the Union in January 2007. Eichel also vowed to try to persuade members of the German business community to boost investment in Romania. (Rompres - 02/08/03)

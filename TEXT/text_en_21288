SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik says within a month, BiH will fulfil the three main conditions required to close the Office of High Representative (OHR). He discussed the issue with Brcko Supervisor and Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian on Wednesday (May 28th). Dodik assured him that by the end of June, BiH would sign a pre-membership accord with the EU, draft a judicial reform strategy and likely establish a state-level Fiscal Council. The OHR was to close last summer, but the Peace Implementation Council decided to extend its mandate indefinitely, saying local politicians were not yet ready to govern.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The chief of the European Commission delegation to Croatia, Ambassador Jacques Wunenburger, doubts EU membership negotiations with the country will begin next month. During a news conference Wednesday (4 May), he reiterated that the arrest and extradition of fugitive General Ante Gotovina to The Hague tribunal is the main condition for starting the delayed negotiations. Wunenburger praised the Croatian government's action plan for apprehending Gotovina, but noted it would take time and was unlikely to produce results by the end of June. (HINA, HRT - 04/05/05)

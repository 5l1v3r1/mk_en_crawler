DUBROVNIK, Croatia - Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic requested on Friday (November 23rd) that the trial against Ilija Brcic be held in Montenegro. At a meeting with Croatian President Stjepan Mesic during a Regional Economic Forum in Dubrovnik, Vujanovic backed Brcic's right to defend himself. 
Brcic was arrested in early November at Rome airport, while travelling as part of a state delegation visiting NATO's command in Naples. He was convicted in absentia by Croatia for committing war crimes against civilians in the 1990s, but has refused to be deported, claiming he has never been informed of any trial against him in that country.

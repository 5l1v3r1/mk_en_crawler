SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Several domestic and international NGOs issued a joint call Tuesday (23 May), urging Macedonia's citizens to say "No" to armed violence, as part of the Global Week of Action Against Small Arms campaign. At a press conference, representatives of the UNDP, Caritas Macedonia and Civil announced poll results that suggest 15 per cent of the population possesses illegal weapons. They urged strengthening of border controls, strict implementation of weapons-related legislation and new action to encourage the voluntary handover of illegal weaponry.
Also Tuesday, Italy's new President, Giorgio Napolitano, reaffirmed his country's support for Macedonia's aspirations to join the EU and NATO, during a meeting with Macedonian counterpart Branko Crvenkovski in Rome. Crvenkovski was there to celebrate the Day of Saint Cyril and Methodius, fathers of the Slavonic alphabet. (Makfax - 24/05/06; A1 TV, Telma TV, MIA - 23/05/06)

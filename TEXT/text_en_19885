BELGRADE, Serbia -- The use of anti-NATO rhetoric is detrimental to Serbia's interests, Democratic Party (DS) whip Nada Kolundzija said on Saturday (August 18th), responding to recurring statements by ministers from Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia who say NATO plans to make its own state out of Kosovo. According to Kolundzija, such rhetoric is pushing Serbia into a row with the international community when the aim should be to win the support of influential states, not alienate them.

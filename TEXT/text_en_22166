BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police found weapons Tuesday (September 16th) on a road leading to the Palace of Justice in Belgrade, the daily route between jail and court for defendants suspected of murdering former Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. Assassins shot Djindjic on March 12th 2003 in downtown Belgrade. The main suspect in the case is Milorad Ulemek-Legija, considered one of Serbia's most dangerous criminals. Police found five hand grenades and one gun on the road connecting Belgrade and Nis. Special units rushed to the spot to determine whether the weapons have any connection to the suspects.

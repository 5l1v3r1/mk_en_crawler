SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Daniel Server, director of the Balkans initiative at the nonpartisan US Institute of Peace, said on Friday (March 13th) that unless BiH launches serious efforts to reform its constitution, the international community should consider drafting a new Dayton Accord. In an interview with Dnevni Avaz, Server said this is the only option, and he rejected calls for secession. He added that if the US and Europe want to attract BiH's attention, they should use the same method they did 14 years ago -- "take several BiH politicians and put them in some isolated place, which they should not leave until they draft a valid agreement." The US Institute of Peace, established and funded by Congress, engages directly in peace building efforts around the world.
In other news Friday, the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) confirmed that Austrian diplomat Valentin Inzko will take over as high representative in BiH on March 26th, immediately after its Steering Board meets that day. The EU member states approved Inzko's appointment to the position Wednesday. He will replace Miroslav Lajcak, who left the post in late January to become Slovakia's foreign minister.

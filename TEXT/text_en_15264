TIRANA, Albania -- Meeting on Tuesday (26 September), Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia and the US-based AMBO Corporation endorsed the text of a trilateral agreement on construction of the regional Bourgas-Vlore oil pipeline. The document, spelling out rules for exploitation, allocation of revenues and ecological standards, must be now approved by the legislatures of the three Balkan states. 
Discussions regarding the $1.2 billion project, seen as an alternative route to ship Caspian crude oil to Europe, started in 1994 but implementation has been delayed repeatedly due to uncertainties about demand. (Albanian News - 27/09/06; Mediapool, A1 TV - 26/09/06)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission is considering whether to open several new chapters in its negotiations with Turkey by the end of Germany's EU presidency in June, a spokeswoman announced on Friday (March 2nd). Talks could be launched on four areas, Krisztina Nagy told reporters in Brussels. Earlier on Friday, Turkish Economy Minister Ali Babacan, who is also the country's top negotiator with the EU, said the chapters would probably be on industrial and enterprise policy, culture and education. The EU froze talks on eight of the 35 chapters to protest Turkey's refusal to open its airspace and seaports to Cypriot traffic. Babacan yet reiterated that Turkey would not budge until the Union lifts the economic embargo imposed on the Turkish-occupied northern part of Cyprus.

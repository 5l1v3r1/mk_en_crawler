TIRANA, Albania -- Police on Wednesday (2 July) arrested Gafur Adili, 44, the suspected leader of the Albanian National Army, an organisation that has claimed responsibility for a series of violent acts in Kosovo and Macedonia over the past two years. The US government had placed Adili on a list of those who pose a threat to security in the Balkans. Macedonia praised the arrest as "an excellent contribution to the stabilisation of the situation in the region".

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said on Wednesday (May 20th) that both Macedonia and Greece are under growing pressure "from external factors" to resolve their longstanding name dispute. No deadlines have been set, but the international community wants to see the issue solved as quickly as possible, he noted. Macedonia is currently waiting for UN special envoy Matthew Nimetz's new proposals. Greek media reported Nimetz plans to visit both Athens and Skopje next month to discuss both governments' readiness to undertake a fresh initiative. The row has blocked Skopje's admission to NATO.

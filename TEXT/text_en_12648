BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Ethnic Albanian politicians agreed on Friday (4 March) to join the Co-ordination Bureau for Southern Serbia, a special body set up to oversee the Presevo area. Nebojsa Covic, the head of the bureau, several ethnic Albanian mayors and politicians, and Serbian officials signed an accord to work together to improve living standards in the region, which was the site of ethnic conflicts in 2000 and 2001. They are expected to tackle issues related to security, justice, education, economic development, infrastructure, healthcare and culture. OSCE Ambassador to Belgrade Maurizio Massari welcomed the move, stressing that a commitment by all parties would accelerate dialogue and lead to results.

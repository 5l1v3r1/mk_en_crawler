BUCHAREST, Romania -- Labour Minister Ioan Botis resigned on Wednesday (April 20th) due to suspected conflict of interest involving his wife working as an adviser for an EU-funded project. Nicolae Ivaschescu, the state secretary at the ministry, will assume Botis' duties temporarily, Prime Minister Emil Boc announced. Botis' wife was involved in a project run by the NGO EuroActiv, which is co-financed by EU structural funds through the Operational Programme for Human Resources Development and approved by the Labour Ministry. Initially, Botis said that since he was not involved in the EuroActiv organisation, he would step down only if the image of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party were affected. 
Romania's antifraud department started an investigation, amid concerns about breach of the national and community laws on conflict of interest, which might jeopardise EU funding. The National Agency for Integrity also launched an inquiry into the minister's assets, forcing Botis to resign. (Hotnews.ro, Cotidianul, Ziare, Evenimentul Zilei, Adevarul - 20/04/11)

TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama told a local TV station Monday (September 24th) that he supports the project to build a highway between Durres and Kukes. The initiative has become the focus of a massive corruption scandal, with about a dozen senior businessmen and officials, including Deputy Transport Minister Nikolin Jaka, arrested on suspicion of rigging construction tenders. 
"The road should be built at all costs," Rama said, explaining that his party disagrees with the way the government is managing the project. SP lawmakers stormed out of parliament last Thursday, protesting the government's explanations of circumstances surrounding the bidding process.

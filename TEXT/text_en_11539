ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament member Cemal Kaya resigned from both the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and parliament on Monday (18 April). Kaya has been subject to media scrutiny since he left his former party, the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), and joined AKP. Following his move, CHP leaders publicly accused the AKP of protecting corruption since Kaya was allegedly involved in a scandal related to state energy tenders. Prosecutors are expected to launch formal legal proceedings against him. (NTV - 19/04/05)

MOSCOW, Russia -- According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, the Security Council's fact-finding mission to Kosovo established that the province has failed to meet international standards and the provisions of Security Council Resolution 1244. In a statement released Sunday (April 29th), the ministry cited the alleged failures as a reason why the Ahtisaari plan should not be accepted. Moscow acknowledged, however, that certain progress has been made in the social and administrative sphere.
Meanwhile, in an interview published Sunday, Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku acknowledged that an independent Kosovo might not be recognised by some members of the international community, should the Ahtisaari plan fail to win UN Security Council approval. Such a development would be bad for Kosovo, Ceku said. Commenting on Serbia's stance, the prime minister decried "politicians who are using Kosovo as a propaganda tool". 
"On the other hand, you have moderate, young people who are tired of all these old stories about Kosovo. They want to look forward and join Europe," Ceku said. "Serbia is being blocked by its past." (Tanjug, RTS, AP, AFP, UPI - 29/04/07)

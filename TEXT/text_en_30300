TIRANA, Albania -- The government is signalling it may postpone the population census scheduled for April after a long debate on the quality and effect of the format. The Shqip daily reported on Sunday (February 20th), quoting government officials, that the census has been delayed with no new date set. Media reports suggest there are three reasons behind the decision: some fear that including ethnic and religious declaration as part of the registration may artificially increase the number of minorities. Others worry about holding the census while candidates campaign for the May 8th local elections. Still others, the Party for Justice, Integration and Unity, which defends the interests of Albanians expelled from Greece, wants to postpone the census until further preparations are made.

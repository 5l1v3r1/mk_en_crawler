SPLIT, Croatia -- The chief of the OSCE mission to Croatia, Ambassador Peter Semneby, said Monday (28 July) that the refugee return process and media freedom remain crucial issues for the country, both in terms of political stability and EU integration. After meeting with officials in the coastal town of Split, Semneby told reporters that the success of reforms required strong efforts and political engagement by authorities at all levels. Semneby also called on local authorities to take steps to allow refugees to either return to homes over which they had tenancy rights, or be provided with fair restitution. As for a proposed amendment that would make slander a criminal offence, Semneby reiterated the OSCE's opposition and said it had asked the government to withdraw the draft change.

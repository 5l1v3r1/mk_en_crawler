TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister Ilir Meta said Saturday (5 October) that Albania would favour a joint ethnic government in the Mitrovica area of Kosovo, noting that ethnic relations between Serbs and Albanians in Mitrovica remain a delicate issue. He said he supports UNMIK chief Michael Steiner's plan, specifically the issues related to participation of ethnic Serbs in local authorities.
In other news, Albania's new government continued its anti-corruption drive by arresting two senior interior ministry officials. Deputy Minister Bujar Himci and Veli Myftari, the head of a police department, were charged with improperly giving a contract to a German company to print the country's new passports. Prosecutors believe the deal cost taxpayers some $2m. (ATA, AFP - 05/10/02)

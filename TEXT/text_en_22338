BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Supreme Court on Wednesday (October 15th) sentenced two former high-ranking generals to 15 years in prison each for their role in killing demonstrators during the 1989 anti-communist revolution. The court upheld a 2007 ruling against retired generals Mihai Chitac and Victor Stanculescu, rejecting their appeals. Police arrested both Chitac and Stanculescu on Wednesday. The two, who are now in their 80s, require constant medical assistance and will serve their sentences at the Jilava prison hospital, police said. Chitac and Stanculescu received their first prison sentence in 1999 on aggravated murder charges for ordering troops to fire on demonstrators in the western city of Timisoara. They appealed that ruling several times, most recently last year. (Mediafax, Agerpres, Hotnews, Ziare, Realitatea TV, AFP - 15/10/08)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The UN Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina and top civilian officials responsible for implementing the Dayton peace accord are denouncing political interference in the work of local police. They sent a letter to the main parties and the interior ministries Tuesday (22 October), warning of conflicts with democratic principles. On Monday, High Representative Paddy Ashdown sacked the director of the Bosnian Federation's intelligence service (FOSS), Munir Alibabic, citing frequent leaks from FOSS used for political purposes.
In other news, four municipalities in BiH have completed the programme for solving property claims, paving the way for the return of refugees and displaced persons. Local authorities noted Tuesday that the four had recorded the highest number of property claims submitted to their offices. (OHR, OSCE - 22/10/02)

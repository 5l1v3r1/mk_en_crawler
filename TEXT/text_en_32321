SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Election Commission has completed preparations for Saturday's (5 October) general elections, says Commission Secretary Zoran Djokovic. He predicts preliminary results will be available the next day, with official results expected by 20 October. Djokovic added that over 400 foreign observers, mostly from the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, would monitor the election, the first that BiH officials have organised and conducted by themselves. Some 6,000 observers are expected from domestic NGOs. The UN Mission in BiH (UNMBIH) says it is in close contact with the two BiH entities' Interior Ministries regarding security for Saturday's vote.
In other news, UNMBIH announced Tuesday that it has started accrediting law enforcement agencies in the country. Ceremonies are scheduled Wednesday for the Republika Srpska Interior Ministry and the Interior Ministry of the Federation of BiH's Canton 1.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in BiH, issued a decree on Wednesday (28 January) that transforms the six separate municipalities in Mostar into a single assembly and administration. The number of elected politicians in the city would be reduced from 194 to 35. Ashdown explained that the move was directed at ensuring that "no one constituent people can rule Mostar on their own." He also expects the new measure to encourage Serb refugees to return to their homes. A Croat majority has dominated the city since the end of the 1992-1995 conflict. The EU had set the reunification of Mostar as a condition for the signing of an association agreement, the first step towards membership in the Union.

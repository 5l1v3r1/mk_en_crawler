ZAGREB, Croatia -- The ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) said on Thursday (January 3rd) that five more representatives of national minorities have agreed to support Prime Minister-designate Ivo Sanader's government. That means the HDZ can rely on the votes of seven of the eight ethnic minority representatives, as two minorities representative had already announced their support.
Also on Thursday, the main board of the Croatian Peasants Party approved -- almost unanimously -- their coalition agreement with the HDZ, removing one more obstacle to forming a new cabinet. The other likely coalition ally is the Croatian Social Liberal Party. A formal coalition agreement among all the parties is expected next week.

TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Socialist Party called on Thursday (October 1st) for a general protest on October 10th against the elections process. The Socialists are asking for thorough investigation into the June 28th vote, which they maintain was manipulated. SP leader Edi Rama says the government seems unwilling to investigate that possibility. The ruling coalition has only agreed to look into the elections code and make required changes. The SP has been boycotting work in parliament for weeks now over the matter. (Koha Jone, Shekulli, Telegrafi, Ora News, Alsat - 01/10/09)

Almost all of Greece's coastal and inland swimming areas that were monitored last year met the EU's highest quality standards, the European Commission (EC) said in an annual report published last week. 
According to the 36-page survey, only three of the 1,273 Greek seaside sites covered in the assessment did not comply with the 27-nation bloc's tough "guide values", and just one fell short of the minimum, or mandatory values. 
The country's four freshwater swimming areas that were also checked against a set of physical, chemical and microbiological parameters last year were found to be fully in compliance with the more stringent quality standards. On the basis of those findings, the EC concluded that, on average, 99.8% of the "bathing waters" in Greece met the guide values. 
But, it also noted that another 830 Greek swimming sites were not included in the report due to incomplete samplings, caused by delays in the commissioning of the monitoring programme. 
The EC's Quality of Bathing Water report -- which was released on June 10th -- was conducted during the 2009 season and covered a total of more than 20,000 seaside, lake and river sites in the EU member states. 
The survey showed that 96% of Europe's coastal waters and 90% of its inland swimming areas complied with the EU's minimum water quality standards last year. While both figures are slightly lower than those in 2008, they also show the significant improvement achieved since 1990, when 80% of Europe's seaside swimming areas and only 52% of the freshwater ones were within the norm. 
 "Over the last 30 years, EU and national legislation has significantly improved the quality of Europe's bathing waters but our work does not end here," EU Environment Commissioner Janez Potocnik said upon the release of the report. "Despite our decade-long track record of high quality, we need to keep up the effort constantly to both improve and maintain what we have achieved." 
Aside from Greece, other countries where at least 90% of all recreational surf met the EU stringent guide values in 2009 included Cyprus (99.1%), France (95.7%), Malta (93.1%), Bulgaria (90.3%) and Portugal (90%). 
 Bulgaria, whose Black Sea resorts attract thousands of local and foreign tourists every summer, has 89 coastal and four freshwater swimming areas. The country's compliance with the EU bathing water quality standards has been improving since it started reporting on it after joining the bloc in 2007. Last year, 98.9% of Bulgaria's Black Sea beaches met the mandatory values, up from 93.3% in 2008. 
"The rate of compliance [of coastal waters] with the guide values increased significantly from 78.7% to 91%," the EC said in a separate country report. 
Romania, one of the three EU members, along with Cyprus and Malta, that reported data for coastal areas only, appeared to be lagging behind its southern neighbour. While all of the country's 49 seaside sites surveyed met the minimum quality standards, only four, or 8.2% of all, complied with the guide values in 2009.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) nominated Parliament Speaker Bulent Arinc for a second term Tuesday (5 October). The opposition Republican People's Party said it would not run a candidate. As AKP controls a two-thirds majority in the legislature, Arinc -- who represents the conservative wing of AKP -- is virtually assured re-election. (NTV - 05/10/04)

TIRANA, Albania -- Members of parliament from the main opposition Socialist Party left the chamber Thursday (June 12th) accusing the majority of deliberately postponing the vote on five new members of the Supreme Court awaiting appointment by President Bamir Topi. The ruling Democratic Party has said it would like to review, for alleged procedural violations, Topi's decree on Supreme Court members. Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli stepped in and announced that the vote will occur on Monday after lawmakers decide whether to lift the immunity of former Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu. He has been implicated in the March 15th explosions at an ammunitions depot that killed 26 and wounded over 300. (BalkanWeb, VOA, BBC, Alsat - 12/06/08)

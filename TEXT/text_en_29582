BELGRADE, Serbia -- A farmers association launched protests Monday (May 30th) after the government decided to cut agricultural subsidies. Farmers from Vojvodina headed to Belgrade and blocked several roads near Pancevo, but were prevented by police from reaching the capital. The agricultural producers demand that the government maintain 2010 levels of subsidies, when they received 144 euros per hectare for up to 100 hectares of arable land. The cabinet decided to keep subsidies at 14,000 dinars but limited the amount of eligible land to only ten hectares, in a bid to trim public spending. (RTS, B92 - 30/05/11)

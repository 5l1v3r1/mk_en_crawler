ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic has denied media reports that the United States exerted any pressure on his country to sign a bilateral immunity accord that would exempt citizens from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. Talking to reporters after a meeting with US President George W. Bush in New York Wednesday (24 September), Mesic said he and Bush mainly discussed the situation in Iraq, but not the possible deployment of Croatian troops there.
In other news, two smaller parties in Croatia's ruling coalition -the Croatian Peasants' Party and the Croatian People's Party - said Wednesday that they had not yet received an official coalition invitation from the ruling Social Democratic Party (SDP) for the November general elections. The parties raised the possibility of running independently from the SDP. (MediaScan - 25/09/03; HRT1 TV, BBC, NINA - 24/09/03)

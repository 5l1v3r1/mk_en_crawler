ATHENS, Greece -- The country's main opposition party, PASOK, will elect a new leader on November 11th, following a disastrous showing in last week's parliamentary elections. The party won 102 seats, 15 less than in the 2004 election. PASOK leader George Papandreou's leadership was challenged immediately by former Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos, an MP from Thessaloniki. Papandreou refused to step down and announced that he would seek a second term in the party founded by his father.

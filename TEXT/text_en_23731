BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) agreed on Tuesday (April 21st) to propose that the European Council provide up to 5 billion euros in medium-term financial assistance to Romania, as part of a multilateral package totalling up to 20 billion euros. The assistance would help Romanian authorities implement a comprehensive economic programme, aimed at putting the economy on sound and sustainable footing, the EC said in a statement. The proposed financial assistance will be on the agenda of a meeting of EU finance ministers on May 5th. It is expected to come in conjunction with an IMF loan worth 12.95 billion euros. Additional multilateral support of 2 billion euros will come from the World Bank, while the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will grant 1 billion euros each.

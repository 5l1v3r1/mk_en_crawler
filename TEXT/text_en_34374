TIRANA, Albania -- Robert Barry, head of the OSCE observer team for the Albanian local elections, told reporters on Wednesday (22 October) that the OSCE found the delay in announcing official results ''disappointing''. He added that the integrity of the vote is now in doubt, attributing the delay to "a mixture of carelessness, incompetence and deliberate political obstructionism". The Central Electoral Commission says it stems from a dispute between representatives of the ruling Socialists and opposition Democrats in Tirana.
In other news Wednesday, Albania and the United States signed an agreement on destroying more than 350 tonnes of unnecessary Albanian munitions. The process will be completed over five months. (AFP, ATA, BBC - 22/10/03)

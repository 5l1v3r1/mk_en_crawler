SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Constitutional Court on Wednesday (11 December) annulled the former government's sale of the Okta refinery to Hellenic Petroleum. The Greek company bought a 54 per cent stake in Macedonia's only refinery in 1999 for $32m. Ljubco Georgievski's cabinet also allowed it to pay only 1 per cent customs duty on its oil imports, while other importers were required to pay 20 per cent. The court ruled that the Greek firm had thus been granted monopoly status. Under Macedonian law, the judges have no authority to look into the merits of business deals. In this case they voided a parliamentary ratification of the sale. Government spokesman Saso Colakovski estimates the losses at some $120m. (AP - 11/12/02)

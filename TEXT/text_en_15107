BUCHAREST, Romania -- Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said on Wednesday (31 August) that Romania has a substantial chance of joining the EU in January 2007 as scheduled, provided it resolves problems associated with corruption. Asselborn, whose country held the rotating EU presidency during the first half of this year, was speaking at the annual meeting of Romania's diplomatic corps in Bucharest. He added that the reform process must be accelerated, to ensure a positive progress report from the European Commission this autumn. (Nine o'clock - 01/09/05; Rompres - 31/08/05)

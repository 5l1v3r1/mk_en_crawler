BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of Serbia's national council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, said on Thursday (December 31st) that local authorities have an idea where fugitive Ratko Mladic may be but cannot speak about it. "If authorities continue to work like this, the arrest of Ratko Mladic is imminent," Ljajic said in an interview with the Belgrade daily Blic. Ljajic recently stepped down as head of an action team that is responsible for operations aimed to detain Mladic. He said he had been mistaken when he pledged that the former Bosnian Serb warlord would be apprehended by the end of 2009. (Blic, B92, RTS - 31/12/09)

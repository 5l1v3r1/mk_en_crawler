TIRANA, Albania -- Following an IMF mission's two-week visit to Tirana, mission head Julio Escolano said Wednesday (15 December) that the Fund supports the country's draft budget for 2005. For the first time, Albania will be able to cover current expenditures from its own resources, he said. Borrowed funds will be used to boost investments in the economy. Still, Escolano noted, there was a need to implement further measures to strengthen the rule of law and the judiciary. (Albanian Daily News - 16/12/04; ATA - 15/12/04)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A woman was killed Wednesday when her car was blown up by a remote-controlled device in downtown Sofia. The police said the incident, the second in which a GSM phone was used to trigger a highly sophisticated car bomb, was apparently a contract killing. Though the blast occurred in front of a school, no other casualties were reported. (24 Chasa, Dnevnik, Sega, Standart, Trud, Monitor - 10/10/02; AFP, AP, bTV, BNR, BNT, BTA - 09/10/02)

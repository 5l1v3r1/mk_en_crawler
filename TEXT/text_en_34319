BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- On Tuesday (28 October), the no-confidence vote against Serbian Parliament Speaker and Acting President Natasa Micic was put off until Thursday. Micic has acknowledged that early elections are needed in Serbia, due to lack of political consensus. However, she said calling elections now would impede work on other important initiatives.

TIRANA, Albania -- Newly appointed Foreign Minister Ilir Meta said on Thursday (September 3rd) that lobbying for international recognition of Kosovo will be a priority of the new government. He added that Albania and Kosovo will also work to intensify political, economic, trade and cultural ties during the four-year mandate. The leader of the Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI) also defended the alliance formed with the right-wing Democratic Party (DP), which won the June elections, arguing the SMI had not betrayed the electorate and the left, since his party could not reach an agreement with the main opposition Socialist Party (SP). 
Meanwhile, SP leader Edi Rama weighed in on Thursday about the DP-SMI coalition, calling it "an electoral masquerade which will cost Albania dearly". He announced a boycott of parliament's work because of what he described as government manipulations of the elections process.

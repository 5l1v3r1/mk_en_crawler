ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Osijek County Court issued a ruling Monday (April 30th) that continues the detention of Parliament member Branimir Glavas and six others charged in connection with the 1991 torture and murder of ten ethnic Serb civilians in the eastern Croatia region. The court officially confirmed the indictment filed against the seven earlier in April. Glavas was detained last year before staging a hunger strike that ultimately led to his release for health reasons. (Vecernji list - 01/05/07; HINA, HRT - 30/04/07)

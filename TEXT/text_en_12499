ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic denied on Wednesday (8 December) that he and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader had agreed, at their meeting last week, to replace counterintelligence agency (POA) chief Josko Podbevsek. He said the issue remains unresolved. The president had demanded Podbevsek's dismissal over a series of perceived POA blunders, but Sanader refused to comply. By law, the signatures of both officials are needed for certain replacements and appointments.
In other news, Sanader has invited the main opposition parliamentary parties to a special meeting Thursday. He wants to reconcile differences between the ruling party and the opposition in a bid to boost support for legislation related to the country's EU integration bid.

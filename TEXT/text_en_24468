SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Exclusive footage aired Wednesday evening (June 10th) on Federal Television of BiH (FTV) that shows former Bosnian Serb Army Commander Ratko Mladic hiding in plain sight in Serbia. The amateur video shows the war crimes fugitive at Serbian military facilities, as well as enjoying Belgrade restaurants and family celebrations, including his son's wedding, over the past ten years. Some even show Mladic in the company of other war crimes suspects, including Momcilo Perisic, Zdravko Tolimir and Manojlo Milovanovic. The most recent footage reportedly was shot at a ski resort late last year, when Belgrade still insisted it was unaware of his whereabouts. Rasim Ljajic, chairman of Serbia's national council for co-operation with The Hague tribunal, said it is "simply impossible" the video was from 2008. "There are probably older clips made before 2000 and shortly after 2000," he told Serbia's RTS TV.
BiH presidency member Zeljko Komsic urged Serbian authorities to stop saying they don't know where Mladic is, and to stop "pretending" they are searching for him. He has been on the run since 1995, shortly after UN prosecutors issued their initial indictment accusing him of involvement in a host of war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH.

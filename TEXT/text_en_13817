MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- UNESCO has added the old Ottoman Bridge in Mostar to its world heritage list. A ceremony attended by BiH's top leaders was held on Saturday (17 December) to mark the event. The bridge was destroyed during fighting in the area in 1993. It was rebuilt together with the buildings in the vicinity with help from the UN. UNESCO said the bridge is now "a symbol of reconciliation, international co-operation and of the coexistence of diverse cultural, ethnic and religious communities". (AP - 17/12/05)

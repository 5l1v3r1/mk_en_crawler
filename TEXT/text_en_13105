ANKARA, Turkey -- In a move that could further strain Turkey's relations with the EU, prosecutors have launched an investigation into remarks made by a member of the European Parliament. Joos Lagendijk, a Dutch Green deputy who heads the European Parliament's Committee for Turkey, is accused of suggesting to reporters that the Turkish military may have provoked clashes with Kurdish rebels in a bid to prove its importance. A group of nationalist lawyers want Lagendijk to be tried for offending the military, a criminal offence under Turkey's new Criminal Code. 
In other news, Cypriot Foreign Minister George Iacovou warned that Turkey would face problems with its EU membership bid if it continues to ban Cypriot vessels and aircraft form its territory. Ankara had promised to remove the ban when it opened accession talks with the EU this year. 
Also Tuesday, Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer wrapped up a two-day visit to Cairo by signing a bilateral Free Trade Agreement with Egypt. The deal, ten years in the making, is aimed at tripling the current $1 billion in trade volume. (NTV - 28/12/05; AP, Reuters, Turks.US, TurkishPress.com - 27/12/05)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Hundreds of Romanians gathered for ceremonies Tuesday (December 22nd) marking the 20th anniversary of the revolution that toppled dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Observances have been under way for the past week. President Traian Basescu urged a detailed investigation into what he called the bloodiest transition from communism to democracy in Eastern Europe. During a speech at Bucharest's Revolution Square, he described the 1,100 people killed during the 1989 violence as martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the sake of modern democratic institutions. Twenty years ago, a crowd gathered outside the grand presidential palace Ceausescu had built, demanding his ousting. He escaped by helicopter, but was caught a short time later in Targoviste. He and his wife were executed three days later. (AP, BTA - 22/12/09)

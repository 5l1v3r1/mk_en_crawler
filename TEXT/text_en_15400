TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli, of the ruling Democratic Party (DP), said on Saturday (24 June) that DP is ready to compromise regarding certain issues it is currently at odds over with the opposition, led by the Socialist Party. Continuing disputes have resulted in the opposition's frequent boycott of parliamentary sessions and, subsequently, delays in reforms, including crucial electoral reforms.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn says that as an EU member, Turkey could serve as a bridge between the Union and the Muslim world. In comments published by the Finnish press Saturday (5 August), Rehn said a modernised and democratic Turkey would be of strategic importance for the EU, particularly in light of the current Middle East crisis. He urged the country to continue implementing necessary reforms. 
In other news, Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer has asked the Constitutional Court to review the legality of two articles in the new anti-terror law. Sezer wants the texts -- dealing with media coverage of terrorism-related issues -- to be annulled amid concerns they limit free speech. 
On Tuesday meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah kicks off a three-day visit to Turkey, where he will meet with Sezer and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. This is the first such visit by a Saudi ruler in four decades. (AFP - 07/08/06; Reuters - 06/08/06; Reuters, Zaman, Cihan - 05/08/06; NTV - 04/08/06)

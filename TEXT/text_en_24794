BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu attended a ceremony Thursday (June 4th) marking the end of Romania's six-year mission in Iraq. Over the course of it, two soldiers were killed and 12 were injured. Romania deployed 366 troops to Iraq and remained there longer than most other countries in the US-led coalition.
Separately Thursday, Basescu said in a statement broadcast by national television that he has still not decided whether to seek another term. It's the third time he has publicly equivocated on the matter, despite the fact he's the clear front-runner.
In other news Thursday, Foreign Minister Cristian Diaconescu said Romania wants an important executive position in the next European Commission. On Sunday, Romanians elect members to represent them in the European Parliament. (Agerpress, AP, Gandul, Adevarul - 04/06/09)

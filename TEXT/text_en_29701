SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The opposition walked out of parliament Friday (January 28th) to protest the freezing of the private A1 television channel's bank accounts Thursday. Branko Crvenkovski, leader of the main opposition SDSM, led the move. He said the freeze â part of an ongoing probe into fraud and tax evasion -- was politically motivated and designed to silence A1, which frequently criticises the government.
Since Thursday, A1 has been broadcasting from the streets, with presenters standing outside the government building in Skopje to read their bulletins in freezing conditions. US Ambassador to Skopje Philip Reeker met with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski on Thursday to express his concern about the situation. (AP, MIA, BBC, AFP, Deutsche Welle, Makfax - 28/01/11)

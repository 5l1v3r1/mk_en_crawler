ATHENS, Greece -- The 17th meeting of the OSCE Ministerial Council wraps up in Athens on Wednesday (December 2nd). Greek President Karolos Papoulias opened the forum Tuesday stressing its importance and potential for strengthening peaceful co-operation and the mutual goals of member countries. Discussions are focusing on the future of European security. More than 40 foreign ministers are participating in the event, which is widely seen as a test of the OSCE's efficiency. Decision-making historically has been a slow process, as all 56 member states must agree unanimously on any course. Meeting in Corfu earlier this year, Greece, which holds the OSCE's rotating presidency, suggested a new security framework to establish co-operation with NATO, the EU and other organisations.

OHRID, Macedonia -- A three-day international conference on forced migrations in Southeast Europe wraps up Sunday (27 October). It brought together some 30 representatives of NGOs, academic institutions, and national agencies from Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Egypt, Greece, Macedonia, Slovenia, Turkey and Yugoslavia.
In other news, Macedonia faced new threats of violence after an anonymous letter was sent Friday to the head of a high school in Tetovo, urging revenge against ethnic Albanians. At issue, the 13 October drive-by shooting of 18-year-old Macedonian Vanco Josifovski in Tetovo. His murder has sparked a series of violent student protests, but school officials fear the letter came from extremist groups, not students.

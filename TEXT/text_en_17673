ANKARA, Turkey -- Industry and Trade Minister Ali Coskun met with Croatian Economy Minister Branko Vukelic in Ankara on Thursday (January 25th), and was offered the use of Croatia's northern Adriatic port of Rijeka for the export of Turkish goods to the EU. Vukelic is heading a business delegation visiting Turkey to boost bilateral co-operation. He says discussions with Coskun -- and later with leading members of the business community -- focused on opportunities for collaboration in energy, tourism, and transportation, as well as the shipbuilding and military sectors.

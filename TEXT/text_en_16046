BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian government adopted a new national strategy late last week to reform the judicial sector by 2012, Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic announced on Sunday (16 April). Speaking to national TV RTS, Stojkovic explained that the strategy was aimed at ensuring independent, transparent, responsible and efficient courts, as well as restoring public trust in the judiciary.
Commenting on the recent arrests of Belgrade commercial court president Goran Kljajevic and Judge Delinka Djurdjevic, Stojkovic denied that the government is trying to influence the court. He noted that the pair, along with seven other people, were detained on charges of organised crime, bribery and corruption. (Tanjug, RTS - 16/04/06)

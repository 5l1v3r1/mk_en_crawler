TIRANA, Albania -- In an interview with the BBC's Albanian service on Friday (2 April), European Commission President Romano Prodi urged Albania to accelerate reforms on its road to EU integration. Responding to a question about the EC report on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Albania, he acknowledged that the country had made progress in implementing the plan, but said more had to be done. Prodi criticised the internal tensions and lack of political stability in Albania, saying there was an urgent need for consensus between the main political players and more respect for law. He also said the country should deal with corruption more effectively, strengthen state institutions and make political life more transparent. (Albanian Daily News, BBC Albanian - 02/04/04)

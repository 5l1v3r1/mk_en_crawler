SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Opposition parties decided on Thursday (July 17th) to launch talks on an impeachment procedure against President Georgi Parvanov for his alleged links to businessman Lyudmil Stoykov. The latter appears in a report by the EU's Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) as a person involved in money-laundering schemes using funds from the EU's SAPARD programme. Stoykov was a sponsor of Parvanov's election campaign. Representatives of the opposition, including the Democrats for Strong Bulgaria, left a session of the National Security Consultative Council on Thursday after Parvanov refused to start the session by answering questions about the EU report. He had convened the meeting to discuss recent explosions at an army depot in Chelopechene. (BNR, Dnevnik, Netinfo, Darik - 17/07/08)

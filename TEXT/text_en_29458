BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Media in Pristina report that the EU continues to urge Kosovo and Serbia to start dialogue on practical issues. From Brussels, Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos said on Wednesday (June 30th) that Spain, as the outgoing EU presidency holder, has encouraged such talks. "Apart from Kosovo's recognition or non-recognition, Spain encouraged Serbs and Kosovars to work on practical issues in order to improve people's lives and this will be our constant engagement, despite legal and recognition issues," Moratinos said. The status issue, he added, is up to the parties to decide. (RTK, Arta TV, Klan Kosova - 30/06/10)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania is holding its first election for members of the European Parliament (EP) on Sunday (November 25). Experts predict President Traian Basescu's Democrats will get 40% of the votes, the ruling Liberal Party of Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu will win up to 13%, and the Social Democrats will get about 19.5%. Voters will choose 35 members of the EP who will be in office for 18 months, as EU-wide elections for the parliament will be held in June 2009. A referendum on the majority voting system in the country will also be held on Sunday.

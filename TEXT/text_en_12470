BUCHAREST, Romania -- Another wave of flooding struck southern and eastern Romania on Monday (9 May). Officials said at least 17 villages were left without electricity and two elderly people drowned. Dead animals and stagnant waters are considered a major health hazard both in the affected areas and in those hard hit by flooding last week. The World Bank announced on Monday it would provide $11m in assistance. (Rompres, Ziarul financiar - 10/05/05; BBC - 09/05/05)

TRIPOLI, Libya -- Bulgarian Interior Minister Rumen Petkov met with Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi in Tripoli on Wednesday (November 22nd). He also visited five Bulgarian nurses who have been detained for more than seven years for on charges â widely disputed outside Libya -- of deliberately infecting hundreds of children with HIV. Petkov brought medicine and books to the nurses and briefed them on Sofia's efforts to resolve the long-standing case. 
Due to procedural violations, verdicts in their first trial were thrown out. The verdicts in their second trial are expected on December 19th. A Palestinian doctor who treated the children is a co-defendant. (Sega - 23/11/06; Darik, BNR - 22/11/06)

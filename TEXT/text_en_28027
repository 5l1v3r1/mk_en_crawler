BELGRADE, Serbia -- A local court sentenced the assailants of prominent journalist Teofil Pancic to three months in jail Tuesday (September 21st). Milos Mladenovic and Danilo Zuza were found guilty of beating Pancic with metal bars aboard a public bus in July, leaving him with head and arm injuries. The court also ordered the two to stay away from Pancic. The public prosecutor's office says it will appeal the sentence because of its lenience. Pancic himself also voiced dissatisfaction with it.

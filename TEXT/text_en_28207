ATHENS, Greece -- Workers are staging another paralysing nationwide strike Thursday (July 14th) against reforms that will boost the retirement age and cut wages in the public sector. The action, organised by the ADEDY labour union, halted flights to and from Greece for several hours, as air traffic controllers joined the action, demanding back pay. Workers in ministries, local administration, state hospitals and emergency departments also walked off their jobs. Protestors will demonstrate outside the parliament building in Athens, as lawmakers vote on the reform package. A demonstration is also planned in Thessaloniki. (Nafhtemporiki, DPA, AFP - 15/07/10)

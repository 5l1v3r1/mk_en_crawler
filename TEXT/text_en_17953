SKOPJE, Macedonia -- EU and NATO officials called for the continuation and acceleration of political dialogue in Macedonia. According to media reports, the message was delivered to the main ethnic Albanian opposition Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), whose delegation held a series of talks at EU and NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday (May 16th). The party said that the Western representatives strongly urged DUI to halt its boycott of the Macedonian Parliament's work, and to return to the legislature for the sake of the country's Euro-Atlantic integration bid. 
In other news, US Ambassador to Skopje Gillian Milovanovic said that DUI and the ruling VMRO-DPMNE must work together to find solutions to disputable issues. Milovanovic also said that Macedonians must focus on efforts for accession to NATO, and not compare themselves to other aspirant countries like Croatia.

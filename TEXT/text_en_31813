SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO-led SFOR troops set up checkpoints around the Bosnian Serb town of Pale on Thursday (3 April), the second such operation in a week. Soldiers were seen at all roads leading into the city but did not stop and search cars, as they did last week. Pale was the stronghold of former Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic, who is wanted by the international war crimes tribunal. Last month, SFOR raided the Pale offices of two businessmen suspected of helping him avoid arrest.

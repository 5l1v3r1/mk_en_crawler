ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic ordered on Wednesday (March 4th) that three Croatian generals who are either on trial or serving sentences for war crimes should lose their medals. The order affects generals Mirko Norac, Tihomir Blaskic and Vladimir Zagorec, the last of whom just received a seven-year prison sentence for embezzling nearly 4m euros worth of diamonds and abuse of office. A procedure to take away eight of his 13 medals is already under way. The procedure to strip Norac's medals will begin soon. He is currently serving a prison sentence for war crimes in Gospic.

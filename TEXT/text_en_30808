WASHINGTON, United States -- Problems in the Balkans remain a source of concern and require the involvement of Western diplomats and security services, Director of the US National Intelligence James Clapper said in a report submitted to the House of Representatives on Thursday (February 10th). According to Clapper, unresolved problems in Kosovo, especially in the Serb-dominated north, remain a challenge for stability in Europe. He warned that nationalist rhetoric by Serbs in Republika Srpska will continue to "inflame passions" in the region. (Radio Free Europe, Kurir - 10/02/11)

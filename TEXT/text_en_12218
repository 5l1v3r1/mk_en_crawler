BUCHAREST, Romania -- In an interview published Friday (14 January), Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu said that his government would seek help from the West in tackling several high-profile corporate fraud cases. A decision has been made to invite a team of investigators from a European state to look into the allegations of financial misconduct. He is expected to approach the United Kingdom, France, or Germany. The announcement came on the heels of reports that police have launched a criminal investigation into abuse at the Rafo Onesti oil refinery, which owes about 450m euros to the state. Tariceanu also announced Thursday that the government would review contracts granted without competitive tenders to EADS and the construction companies Bechtel and Vinci. Corruption is one of the major issues the country must address in order to achieve EU membership, expected in 2007. 
Also on Thursday, Romanian media quoted the European Parliament's Rapporteur for Romania, Pierre Moscovici, as saying he is optimistic about the prospect of Romania signing an EU Accession Treaty in April or May. However, he also stressed that much work must be done in the years ahead, including fighting corruption. (FT.com - 14/01/05; AFP, Rompres - 13/01/05)

KUMANOVO, Macedonia -- The new Allied Operational Command of the Macedonian Army was promoted Wednesday (10 August) at a formal ceremony in the Boro Menkov military base in Kumanovo. Addressing participants, army chief General Miroslav Stojanovski stressed that establishment of the new command -- following the transformation of the previous command of the ground forces -- was a major step forward in defence reforms in line with the Strategic Defence Review and NATO standards. He also voiced expectations that most of the reform objectives would be met this year or next, bringing Macedonia closer to NATO membership.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Supreme Court decided on Tuesday (February 16th) that a third round of voting is necessary in the eastern Kosovo town of Gjilan to elect a new mayor. The court supported the recommendations of the Election Complaints and Appeals Commission, which is in charge of managing the election process. The commission found irregularities in the original vote. A mid-December run-off pitted Democratic Party candidate Qemajl Mustafa against Fatmir Rexhepi, of President Fatmir Sejdiu's Democratic League of Kosovo. Mustafa says Sejdiu tried to influence the outcome, which Sejdiu denies. The Central Elections Commission will schedule the third round, in light of the Supreme Court decision.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Interior Minister Dragan Jocic said Saturday (10 April) that he might reopen the investigation into last year's assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. Jocic explained he had received several letters from parties who claim they may have new information on the case. He rejected arguments that such a move would be an effort to delay the trial already under way, adding his only goal is to provide the whole truth. (B92 - 11/04/04)

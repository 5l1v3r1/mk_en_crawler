SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH)'s parliament approved the new entity government Thursday (March 17th), five months after elections. The cabinet consists of ministers of the two largest parties in the entity, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the Party of Democratic Action (SDA), as well as two smaller Croat parties -- Croatian Party of Rights (HSP) and the Prosperity Through Work party (NSRzB). Nermin Niksic of the SDP will serve as FBiH prime minister. 
The cabinet will have 16 members -- seven ministers from the SDP, five from the SDA and two each from the HSP and the NSRzB. The entity's parliament also approved the appointment of Zivko Budimir from the HSP as new FBiH president. The vice-presidents are Mirsad Kebo of the SDA and Svetozar Pudaric of the SDP. The two largest Croat parties -- HDZ BiH and HDZ 1990 -- refused to attend the constituent session of the House of Peoples, denouncing the new parliament and government as illegitimate.

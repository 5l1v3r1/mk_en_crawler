BUCHAREST, Romania -- Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights Alvaro Gil-Robles wrapped up four-day visit to Romania on Wednesday (9 October). He will use what he learned to prepare a report on human rights in the country. He noted considerable progress, but indicated room for improvement in police conduct, relations with the Roma minority, care of institutionalised children and judicial reform. In Bucharest, Gil-Robles met with Prime Minister Adrian Nastase, Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana and President Ion Iliescu.
Meanwhile, it appears that an EC report on the progress of candidate countries, due to be released Wednesday, will acknowledge efforts by the Romanian government to improve the situation of institutionalised children, a chief area of concern in previous EC reports. According to AFP, the report will set 2007 as a tentative date for Romania and Bulgaria's entry into the Union. (Rompres, Nine O'clock, AFP - 08/10/02)

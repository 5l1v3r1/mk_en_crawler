BUDAPEST, Hungary -- German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere reiterated on Thursday (January 20th) his country's stance that Bulgaria and Romania are not yet ready to join the Schengen Zone. Speaking at an informal meeting of the EU justice and home affairs ministers in Godollo, he praised the two countries' efforts in meeting the technical criteria but stressed further progress is needed in fighting corruption and in the judicial area. 
Separately, French Minister for European Affairs Laurent Wauquiez warned of the potential security risk to Europe posed by admitting Sofia and Bucharest prematurely. "If the database of information for the Schengen area were to end up in the hands of international criminals, it could do away with all of European internal security," he said on Thursday from Helsinki. Bulgaria and Romania were hoping to join Schengen this March, but the processes will likely be delayed by such objections. (AFP, DPA, Reuters, Voice of America - 20/01/11)

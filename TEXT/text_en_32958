ATHENS, Greece -- Greece and Cyprus officially agreed Monday (26 May) to seek the resumption of UN-administered talks for resolving the division of Cyprus. During a meeting in Athens, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis and Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos said they want "a European solution within the UN framework that is just, viable and functional". Both leaders agreed that recent measures announced by the Turkish Cypriot side would help achieve this goal.
Also on Monday, however, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas rejected the peace plan proposed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. It happened during a meeting with Annan's special envoy to Cyprus, Alvaro de Soto. (CNA, Anadolu Agency - 26/05/03)

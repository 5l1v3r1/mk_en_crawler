PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Resuming talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU and acceptance in NATO's Partnership for Peace programme by the end of this year are the main goals of Montenegro's new government, Prime Minister Zeljko Sturanovic said on Wednesday (November 15th). From that starting point, the country will then aim to speed up reforms to achieve full-fledged NATO and EU memberships, he added.
In other news Wednesday, representatives of the German and Montenegrin government signed a protocol on co-operation for 2006, providing for 63m euros in funding. The money would be used to finance structural reforms and develop the financial sector, as well as for infrastructure projects. (Pobjeda - 16/11/06; MINA - 15/11/06)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Traian Basescu, leader of the Romanian opposition coalition Justice and Truth and mayor of Bucharest, has been indicted in connection with the privatisation of 16 ships during the 1990s, a spokeswoman for the anti-corruption prosecutor's office said Tuesday (10 August). Basescu was minister of transport at the time the deal was struck. Prosecutors are accusing him and 80 others, including two former ministers, of defrauding the state of 275m euros. Basescu denied the charges, saying they were meant to discredit him in advance of the November general elections. He was re-elected mayor of Bucharest in June, defeating the government's candidate for the post, Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana. (AFP - 10/08/04)

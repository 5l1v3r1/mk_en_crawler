THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal announced on Monday (November 26th) that it has granted provisional release to Rasim Delic, the wartime chief of staff of the Bosnian Muslim army. The judges agreed that the retired general -- who turned himself in -- is co-operating with the tribunal and will be allowed to spend the holidays in Sarajevo. The Bosnian government has provided guarantees that Delic, 58, will return to the detention facility in The Hague on January 11th. He is on trial for failing to prevent atrocities committed by foreign Islamic fighters during the 1992-1995 conflict. (UPI, UN press release, Fena, B92- 26/11/07)

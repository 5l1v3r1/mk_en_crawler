BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) announced Friday (21 October) that it has recommended the start of talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). The decision now awaits endorsement by the 25 EU member states, most likely by mid-December. In an official statement, the EC said BiH has achieved the needed progress in fulfilling the 16 prerequisites set out in the Feasibility Study of November 2003. At the same time, the statement said, BiH is expected to continue improving its co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, adopt the law on public broadcasting and ensure the implementation of police reform. Lack of progress could lead to delays or suspension of the negotiations, the EC said.
The international community's top envoy in BiH, High Representative Paddy Ashdown, hailed the "landmark decision" by the EC. He was speaking at the end of a two-day, Swiss-sponsored conference in Geneva on the future of BiH. (Nezavisne novine - 22/10/05; EU Web site, Swissinfo, OHR Sources - 21/10/05)

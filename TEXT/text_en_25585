ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A court in Istanbul formally charged on Wednesday (February 24th) seven military officers allegedly involved in a plot dubbed Sledgehammer, aimed at toppling the government and destabilising the country. The seven are part of a larger group of 51, interrogated by prosecutors Tuesday after their arrests Monday. The plot, first reported by the Turkish newspaper Taraf, allegedly aimed to trigger chaos by placing bombs in mosques and museums. The army denies any such plan. In a short statement Tuesday, it said top generals and admirals have discussed "the serious situation". The EU, meanwhile, voiced "concern". Angela Filote, spokeswoman for EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele, said "the investigation must be exemplary and carried out in full respect of the principles and standards of a fair judicial process."

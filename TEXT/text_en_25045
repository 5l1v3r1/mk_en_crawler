BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prosecutors announced on Sunday (December 27th) that 30 weapons -- including machine guns -- stolen from a military warehouse in Bucharest about a year ago have been found. They were located after dozens of raids in Bucharest and in the regions of Ilfov and Giurgiu. About 20 people have been detained for questioning. The theft occurred last January. Eleven military officers in charge of warehouse security were arrested but later released. Several high-ranking army officials were fired after the theft, one of the most serious of its kind in Romania. (AFP, Mediafax - 27/12/09)

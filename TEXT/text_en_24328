SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- By an overwhelming margin, the parliament of Republika Srpska (RS) approved on Tuesday (March 10th) a proposal to declare Banja Luka, rather than Sarajevo, the capital of the Serb community in BiH. The amendment to RS's constitution won the support of 72 of the 83 members. To become effective, however, it needs confirmation by the House of Peoples, which includes representatives of the Croat and Muslim communities, who have veto power. Should they exercise it, the Constitutional Court would make the final decision. Muslim lawmakers in RS's parliament say they oppose this amendment. (AFP, RTRS, SRNA - 11/03/09)

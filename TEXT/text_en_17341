ANKARA, Turkey -- In a phone conversation Thursday (May 24th) with French President Nicholas Sarkozy, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan insisted that the two countries hold direct talks to settle differences over Turkey's EU integration prospects. "Let's not talk to each other through the media, but start working together in direct negotiations," Erdogan told Sarkozy, who reportedly seemed open to the idea. 
On Thursday meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Levent Bilman reiterated Turkey's desire to open more chapters in the accession negotiations by June. The process was frozen months ago when Turkey refused to open its ports and airports to EU member Cyprus. (Turkishpress.com, NTV - 24/05/07)

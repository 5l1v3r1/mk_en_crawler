BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said Monday (2 May) he hopes for speedy preparations leading to the start of negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. If all processes are completed as planned, the integration process could be shortened, Kostunica suggested. On 31 March, the Serbian government adopted an action plan for harmonising legislation with that of the EU, but noted that the burden of implementation lies with parliament.

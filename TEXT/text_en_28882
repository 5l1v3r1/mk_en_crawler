BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Thursday (September 9th) he is more hopeful regarding a settlement to the 19-year-old name dispute between Macedonia and Greece. "I am more confident than I was some years ago," Barroso said after meeting with Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov in Brussels, adding that a solution would boost Macedonia's EU prospects. "I call on all sides to remove this obstacle as quickly as possible -- this is the time to decide," Barroso said. Ivanov urged Greece to "act in a European manner", calling its stance "irrational". At the same time, he noted he feels "encouraged by what happened in recent months", including increased trade and tourism between the two neighbours. (DPA, Makfax, MIA - 09/09/10)

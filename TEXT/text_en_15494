SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The leader of the ethnic Albanian Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDP), Abduladi Vejseli, held separate talks Wednesday (23 August) with EU and US diplomats who reportedly urged his party not to boycott the new parliament. According to local media reports, EU envoy Erwan Fouere and US Ambassador Gillian Milovanovic contacted Vejseli after the PDP proposed last week that the Democratic Union for Integration-PDP coalition not participate in the legislature. The coalition is protesting the decision of government mandate holder VMRO-DPMNE to exclude them from the new cabinet. According to media reports, both the EU and the US representatives stressed that boycotting parliament would be the worst possible scenario. (Dnevnik - 24/08/06; A1 TV, Kanal 5 TV - 23/08/06)

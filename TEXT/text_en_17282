BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Dragan Jocic said fighting crime and implementing full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal are his top priorities, along with continuing reforms in the ministry, aimed at eliminating outside influences. Speaking at a gathering near Belgrade to mark the Day of Police on Sunday (May 27th), Jocic acknowledged that war crimes co-operation depends on information provided by the military and security services. 
He also commented on a controversial move by the Serb Radical Party (SRS) on Saturday, in support of war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic. SRS activists put up posters reading "Boulevard Ratko Mladic" on a Belgrade street named after assassinated reformist Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, as well as on B92 TV's building. Police did not intervene, according to Jocic, because the SRS broke no laws. (Danas - 28/05/07; Beta, Tanjug, RTS - 27/05/07)

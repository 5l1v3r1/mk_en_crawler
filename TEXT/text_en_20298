SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Healthcare employees staged nationwide protests on Thursday (December 13th) against low wages in the sector and the government's failure to provide quality health services to the public. Hundreds of nurses, midwives and laboratory assistants joined rallies organised by the Bulgarian Association of Healthcare Professionals. The association's head, Stanka Markova, warned that poor conditions in Bulgaria's healthcare sector have prompted more and more staff to seek work abroad. This mass exodus, she said, has led to hospital staff shortages since Bulgaria joined the EU in January. (Trud, 24 Chasa, Sega - 14/12/07; Mediapool, bTV, BNR, Reuters - 13/12/07)

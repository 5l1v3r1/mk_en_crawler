SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj, Deputy Defence Minister Igor Crnadak and Deputy Civil Affairs Minister Senad Sepic refused to resign on Friday (April 25th) despite a decision by the BiH Central Election Commission (CEC) to ban them from public office for four years. The CEC said the three officials had a conflict of interest since they, or their close relatives, had involvements in companies doing business with state institutions. Alkalaj told reporters he views the stance as politically motivated, as some political parties -- the Serb ones -- launched a campaign against him long ago. The CEC first expressed concern about the three during the candidate-vetting process earlier this year. (Nezavisne Novine, Dnevni Avaz - 26/04/08; Fena, RTRS - 25/04/08)

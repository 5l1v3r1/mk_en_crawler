PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A European Parliament (EP) Election Observation Delegation expressed doubts Monday (December 13th) about voting in a pair of Kosovo's 37 districts Sunday. "We are talking about two municipalities, Drenas/Glogovac and Skenderaj/Serbica," EP member Doris Pack said. Both are strongholds of incumbent Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo and in both places, turnout was twice that of the average turnout. 
Aside from those areas, the EP delegation said "a generally well organised Election Day with a good voter turnout is encouraging for the continuous democratic development of Kosovo." They also described the increased participation by Kosovo Serbs as a sign of further engagement with the country's institutions, but expressed disappointment that more did not vote in northern Kosovo. 
Separately, US Ambassador Christopher Dell helped monitor the election and says he witnessed irregularities during the count, including the number of ballots in the box exceeding the number of signatures in the voters' book. 
Local media reported a high number of complaints of irregularities. The Election Complaint and Appeals Panel received 171 complaints from political entities over various violations, such as stuffing ballot boxes, multiple voting and defective verification ultraviolet lamps.

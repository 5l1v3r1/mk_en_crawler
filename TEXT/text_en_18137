SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Libyan Supreme Judicial Council convenes on Monday (July 16th) evening to discuss the case of the six foreign medics -- five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor -- on death row, according to local officials cited by AFP. The medics are seeking pardons after Libya's Supreme Court upheld their death sentences last week. Sources say Monday's session was initially scheduled for 10 am, but was postponed to allow more time to seal an agreement with the families of the 438 Libyan children who were allegedly infected with HIV by the medics. The families will reportedly give up their right to demand execution, in exchange for compensation of $1m per child. 
A spokesman for the association of children's families told the Bulgarian radio station Darik that over 100 families have signed the deal, and indicated more time may be needed to complete the process. (BNR, BTA, Darik, Mediapool, AFP - 16/07/07)

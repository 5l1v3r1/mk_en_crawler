STRASBOURG, France -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele told the European Parliament on Tuesday (March 8th) that Montenegro has made substantial progress in meeting the criteria for EU membership. He added the EU's decision to grant the country candidate status was an acknowledgement of these achievements. Fuele noted, however, that Montenegro still has work to do in strengthening public administration, fighting corruption and organised crime, and boosting judicial independence.

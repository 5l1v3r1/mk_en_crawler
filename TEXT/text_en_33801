BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The trial against those charged in connection with the late Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's murder will begin on 22 December, according to the special court for organised crime. Djindjic was assassinated on 12 March. In all, 44 people have been charged, though many of them, including several suspected Zemun Clan members, are not in custody. Earlier this week, it was announced that mafia boss Ljubisa "Cume" Buha will likely testify in exchange for a reduced sentence.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The World Bank will not support Turkey's 2003 draft budget in its present form, according to the Bank's representative in Turkey, Ajay Chhibber. In an interview Monday (10 March) with Reuters, he said the budget encourages tax evasion through the introduction of a new tax amnesty mechanism. Chhibber also criticised the government for failing to earmark direct support for farmers.
In other developments Monday, the IMF announced that Riza Moghadam would replace its current desk chief in Turkey, Juha Kahkonen, in the next few months. Moghadam is currently an adviser to First Deputy Managing Director Anne Krueger. (Anadolu Agency, IMF - 10/03/03)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- As many as 23 NGOs brought about 500 people to downtown Bucharest on Sunday (February 3rd) to protest a decision by the Constitutional Court that has blocked the work of the National Council for the Study of Securitate Archives. The council has been prevented from conducting any research into the archives of the communist secret police and will not unveil the names of those who appear to have collaborated with the secret police. The protesters promised to hit the streets every day until the matter is resolved. Last week, the Constitutional Court agreed with former Conservative Party leader Dan Voiculescu, who says that three articles of a law on which the national panel is based are unconstitutional. As a result, the panel is expected to be dissolved as soon as the court decision is published in the official gazette. (Rompres, Mediafax, Hotnews.ro - 03/02/08)

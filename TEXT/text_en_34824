SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina -- BiH High Representative Paddy Ashdown said Monday (4 August) the decision of the BiH Federation government to dismiss all managers of state companies was not consistent with the Federal Law on Ministerial, Governmental and Other Appointments. BiH Federation Prime Minister Ahmed Hadzipasic asked Ashdown to take a stance on the ruling. The Office of the High Representative sent a response recommending a case-by-case approach, based on the principles of legality, merit, independent scrutiny and transparency. Ashdown has the final say on key legislative packages in the country, and his stance could block the implementation of the government decision. (Onasa, BBC - 04/08/03)

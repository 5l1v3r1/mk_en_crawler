BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO marked the accession of seven new members with a flag-raising ceremony on Friday (2 April) followed by a ceremonial meeting of foreign ministers of the expanded Alliance. The newly accepted countries are Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. At the ceremony, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer reiterated the organisation's commitment to fighting terrorism and to ensuring the security of member states. He added that the expansion of the Alliance confirmed "the attraction, the strength and enduring value of the transatlantic link". Following the meeting, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy, who is also OSCE chairman-in-office, called for an increase in the number of troops deployed alongside NATO borders to bolster anti-terrorist measures. He noted that most terrorist attacks are planned from outside NATO territory. (BTA, BNT, bTV, Nova TV, BNR, Rompres - 02/04/04)

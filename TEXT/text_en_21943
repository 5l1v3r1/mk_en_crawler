NEW YORK, United States -- Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic on Friday (August 15th) formally requested from the UN General Assembly an advisory ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the legality of Kosovo's unilaterally proclaimed independence. Jeremic asked for inclusion of the request on the General Assembly's agenda in September.
In other news, Serbian Minister for Kosovo and Metohija Goran Bogdanovic warned on Friday (August 15th) EULEX cannot deploy and operate in Kosovo without the prior approval of the UN Security Council. "According to UN Security Council Resolution 1244, only a UN decision can authorise such a move," Bogdanovic said. He added Serb policemen will return to the Kosovo Police Service (KPS) only if it is under UNMIK command. 
Furthermore, Serbian State Secretary for Kosovo and Metohija Oliver Ivanovic said on Friday his ministry will no longer create policy on Kosovo. The ministry will appoint Kosovo locals who are purportedly better able to address the specific problems of Kosovo Serbs.

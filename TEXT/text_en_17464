TRIPOLI, Libya -- The five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor, sentenced to death under a controversial HIV/AIDS infection re-trial in Libya, repeated on Sunday (February 25th) claims that they had been tortured into confessing, during a hearing in a new, separate trial. This one charges them with slandering Libyan police. "You tortured us and now you are prosecuting us", Palestinian indictee Ashraf Ahmad Juma told two of the plaintiffs, Libyan officers Jomaa al-Mishri and Abdel Hamid al-Shoul. The hearing resumes on March 11th. (Darik - 26/02/07; bTV, Nova TV, AFP - 25/02/07)

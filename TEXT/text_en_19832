SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prime Minister Nikola Spiric confirmed on Monday (August 20th) that the work of cabinet ministries and individual ministers will be discussed at an upcoming government meeting. Tuesday's Nezavisne Novine reports that following that analysis, possible cabinet changes will be considered. 
Spiric recently criticised Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj, insisting that he is biased and acting only on behalf of the Bosniak community. He has also scolded him for missing more than half of the Council of Ministers' sessions and described him as "a minister nobody needs". (Nezavisne novine - 21/08/07)

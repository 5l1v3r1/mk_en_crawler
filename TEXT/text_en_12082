DOBOJ, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Police reform is the last and most significant reform which BiH must implement in order to enhance its bid for EU membership, High Representative Paddy Ashdown said during a weekend visit to Doboj. The visit marked the start of a nationwide campaign focused on the need to create a single police structure, free of political pressure.
On Sunday (13 February), meanwhile, Republika Srpska (RS) President Dragan Cavic said that Prime Minister-designate Pero Bukejlovic has prepared his list of new cabinet members. Cavic indicated that most of the choices would be new to the public, with the exception of current Interior Minister Darko Matijasevic and Defence Minister Milovan Stankovic. The RS Assembly is expected to vote on the cabinet Tuesday.
In other news, BiH signed the International Convention on Cybercrime late last week, along with an additional protocol criminalising racist and xenophobic acts committed through computer systems. Signing the document is part of the country's obligations as a member of the Council of Europe.

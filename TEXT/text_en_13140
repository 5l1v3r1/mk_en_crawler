SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The ruling coalition partners -- the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), NMS-II and the ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) -- agreed Tuesday (30 August) on the distribution of district governors' seats. According to the deal, BSP would nominate the governors of 14 districts, NMS-II would get eight and MRF would get six. The issue has provoked controversy, since governors from MRF would be posted in some areas with predominantly Bulgarian local populations, such as Varna. (Sega, bTV - 31/08/05)

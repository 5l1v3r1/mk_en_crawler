SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The House of Representatives rejected on Thursday (18 May) a no-confidence motion directed at the Council of Ministers. During the eight-hour debate, parties from Republika Srpska criticised Prime Minister Adnan Terzic for the composition of his cabinet. Terzic argued that dumping the government less than five months before scheduled elections would send a very negative signal to the EU, as state institutions, not entities, lead negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.

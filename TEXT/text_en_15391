WASHINGTON, United States -- Romania plays key roles in the Black Sea area and the Balkans, President George W. Bush told his visiting Romanian counterpart, Traian Basescu, on Thursday (27 July). He described the country as a stabilising factor in a region of emerging democracies. For his part, Basescu said that Romania would continue to contribute to the peace and development of Southeast Europe. 
While Bush rejected the possibility of lifting the visa regime for Romanians, he promised to ease entry requirements for students and those seeking work in the United States, adding that a road map for the visa issue is being drafted. (Cotidianul, Ziua - 28/07/06; Rompres - 27/07/06)

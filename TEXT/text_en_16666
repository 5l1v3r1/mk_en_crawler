VIENNA, Austria -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte on Thursday (7 September) called for intensified international efforts to ensure that the remaining fugitives are brought to justice. In a speech to the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna, del Ponte said a major problem is the "impunity gap". Domestic laws in the various former Yugoslav countries remain non-compliant and prevent the extradition of nationals and the transfer of war crimes proceedings, particularly those involving mid-level commanders, she said. 
"All crimes must be punished, all criminals must face justice," del Ponte said. She also suggested that continuing pressure from the EU could force Serbia to arrest Ratko Mladic and other war crimes suspects. (Blic, Glas javnosti - 08/09/06; OSCE website, Tanjug, AP, UPI - 07/09/06)

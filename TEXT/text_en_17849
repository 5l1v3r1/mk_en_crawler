SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov collaborated with the former communist regime's state security service, particularly the foreign intelligence division, according to a statement Thursday (July 19th) from the commission investigating the matter. Parvanov, who operated under code name "Goce", was recruited by the State Security Agency in 1989 and went on to collaborate for almost four years. Parvanov has said he provided counsel regarding relations with Macedonia, but never knew he was working for the foreign intelligence service. The documents support that that position, as he was never paid as an active agent. (24 Chasa, Trud, Sega, Dnevnik - 20/07/07; Mediapool, bTV, BNR, Darik - 19/07/07)

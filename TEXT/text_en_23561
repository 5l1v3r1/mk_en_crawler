BELGRADE, Serbia -- Five protesters and three police officers suffered injuries in Belgrade street clashes Tuesday (March 24th) after a rally marking the tenth anniversary of NATO's air campaign against the former Yugoslavia. Police arrested 28 demonstrators. The rally in Republika Square drew several hundred young people. After leaving the square, demonstrators began to destroy shops and newsstands, damaging two McDonald's restaurants. 
In Kosovo, meanwhile, thousands of Serbs living in northern Mitrovica also marked the tenth anniversary of the NATO action. Marchers lit candles at a memorial near the main bridge over the Iber River. (Kohavision, RTV 21, RTK, Klan, Beta, FoNet, B92 - 24/03/09)

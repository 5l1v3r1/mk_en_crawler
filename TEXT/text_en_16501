SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Sofia Mayor Boyko Borisov sent a letter Tuesday (11 July) to the Sofia Municipal Election Commission, insisting he had suspended his participation in all trading companies before his appointment as a chief secretary of the interior ministry in 2001. The right-wing opposition Democrats for Strong Bulgaria asked the commission to sack Borisov last week, claiming he had remained on the boards of two companies, in violation of the law on local self-government.

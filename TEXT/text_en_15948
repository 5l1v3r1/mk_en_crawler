SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said on Wednesday (October 18th) that he has invited Erhard Busek, the special co-ordinator of the Stability Pact for Southeast Europe, to advise the government on EU accession issues. Following a meeting with Busek in Skopje, Gruevski said the Austrian official could significantly contribute to Macedonia's membership bid, given his experience and contacts. Busek, in turn, said he has accepted the invitation and believes that, after Bulgaria and Romania's EU accession and the launch of EU membership talks with Croatia, Macedonia would be the next regional success story.

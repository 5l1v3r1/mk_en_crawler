SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The new cabinet will be announced on 3 January during a special session of the BiH Parliament, according to Council of Ministers chairman Adnan Terzic. Saying he did not have the complete list of nominees, Terzic did confirm that Mladen Ivanic would be nominated as foreign minister by Republika Srpska officials, and that the incumbent President of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Safet Halilovic, was the likely choice for the civil affairs ministry. Barisa Colak, a Croat, is favoured for minister of security affairs, while Ljerka Maric, the finance minister of the Central Bosnia Canton, is expected to take over the BiH Ministry of Finance.

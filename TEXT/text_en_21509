BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Serbian Socialist Party (SPS) will form a government with the Democratic Party (DS)-led coalition, the SPS's main board decided on Monday (June 23rd). Acknowledging that the DS and the SPS have been fierce enemies since the beginning of the 1990s, SPS leader Ivica Dacic described the decision as a difficult one that party supporters might not understand. Local media reports suggest that President Boris Tadic, the DS leader, may name his prime minister Tuesday. The new cabinet reportedly will include four deputy prime ministers, instead of one.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj on Monday (July 7th) wrote to the top diplomats of all 27 EU member states asking each of them separately to approve the issuance of free visas for BiH citizens until the enforcement of the free-visa regime between the EU and BiH. The issuance of free visas would be key in strengthening EU integration support among BiH citizens, thereby creating positive energy and speeding up the reform process, Alkalaj said. 
In other news, officials in BiH announced on Monday that the remains of 307 Bosnian Muslim victims of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre will be reburied on Friday, when the country marks the 13th anniversary of the biggest war crime in Europe since the end of World War II. The funeral will occur on the spot where Bosnian Serb troops murdered some 8,000 men and boys in July 1995. (SRNA, RTRS, Dnevni Avaz, Fena, AFP - 07/07/08)

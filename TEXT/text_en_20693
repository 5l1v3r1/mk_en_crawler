BUCHAREST, Romania -- Technicians switched off a reactor at the Cernavoda Nuclear Plant on Wednesday (November 7th) when instruments indicated it had begun to produce radioactive material. A spokeswoman says there was no threat to people or the environment. Technicians working on the problem expect to turn the reactor on again within hours. Built about ten years ago, the reactor produces 12% of the country's electricity. Canadian and Italian companies built a second reactor at the same plant and commissioned it last May.

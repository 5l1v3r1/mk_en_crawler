BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU has decided to open talks on further chapters of the acquis with Croatia and Turkey, according to media reports citing EU diplomatic sources. The reports say the EU Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER), due to meet in Brussels Monday (June 25th), is likely to green light the opening of negotiations on six more chapters with Croatia and two with Turkey. The German presidency of the EU was hoping to open talks with Turkey in three areas, but French President Nicholas Sarkozy objected to the launching of negotiations on economic and monetary policy. 
Separately on Sunday, Turkey's chief EU negotiator Ali Babacan said Ankara is committed to conducting all reforms necessary for accession. He pledged more legislative reforms very soon. (Zaman - 25/06/07; Reuters, AFP, CNN Turk, RTE News - 24/06/07)

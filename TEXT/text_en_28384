ATHENS, Greece -- Parliament voted on Tuesday (November 16th) to indict three former ministers over a series of real estate deals between the state and a local monastery. Former Agricultural Development and Foods Minister Evangelos Basiakos, former Rural Development Minister Alexandros Kontos and former Finance Minister Petros Doukas -- all of whom served in the previous New Democracy-led conservative government -- will face charges of breach of faith, the lawmakers decided. A proposal by the ruling PASOK to press similar charges against two other former ministers -- Theodoros Roussopoulos and George Voulgarakis -- were rejected. All five have denied any wrongdoing and say PASOK's efforts are politically motivated. A court in Athens will discuss the case in January. The investigation into the so-called Vatopedi case revealed that the deals in question, in which the 1,000-year old monastery received prime state-owned real estate in exchange for far less valuable rural land, cost taxpayers about 100m euros.

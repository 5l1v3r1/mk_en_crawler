PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The editor of the newspaper Dan was murdered in the Montenegrin capital on Friday (28 May). Dusko Jovanovic was shot in the chest and head as he was leaving his office. No arrests have been made. Dan has been embroiled in controversy. The UN war crimes tribunal last year indicted Jovanvic for revealing the identity of a protected witness. The charges were dropped recently when he published an editorial expressing remorse for his action. Meanwhile, Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic has sued Dan and its editor for publishing stories linking him to human smuggling. Other ruling party officials have been involved in litigation against the newspaper. Djukanovic condemned the murder, calling it a "threat to security". His government offered a 1m euro reward for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrators. (B92 - 29/05/04; AP, AFP, Independent, B92, Mediapool - 28/05/04)

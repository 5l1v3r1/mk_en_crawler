ANKARA, Turkey -- Top officials denounced on Tuesday (December 12th) the EU's decision to partially suspend accession talks with Ankara. "This decision is unfair to Turkey," Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on national television. "Let us not forget that our friends in the EU also have promises they have not fulfilled," he said, referring to the EU's failure to lift economic sanctions against Turkish Cypriots. Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said the EU's decision lacked vision. Both however suggested that reform efforts would continue. At their meeting Monday, the EU foreign ministers decided to suspend negotiations on eight of the 35 negotiating chapters, because of Turkey's failure to open its ports and airfields to Cypriot traffic. 
In other news, Turkish police announced five arrests in connection with an explosion at an army building that killed eight people last week. Officials say a faulty boiler likely caused the blast. The suspects are technicians who maintained the building's heating system.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government plans to establish the municipality of North Mitrovica by the end of 2011. Creation of this municipality, dominated by Serbs who refuse to co-operate with Pristina institutions, is an objective of the government's plan for this year. It was adopted three days ago and envisions that the municipality be established no later than October and backed by a public awareness campaign. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Local Government Administration Slobodan Petrovic said on Saturday (March 19th) that along with the international community, the government is trying to provide better living conditions for those in the north and in Kosovo as a whole. Serbian authorities, meanwhile, view it as a provocation. (RTK, Koha, Zeri, Koha Ditore - 20/03/11)

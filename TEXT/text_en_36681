BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Adrian Nastase and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice President Wolfgang Roth agreed on Thursday (29 July) to draft a flood prevention plan. The EIB team will arrive shortly to assess the situation and help authorities prepare a viable project. During a visit to flooded counties in eastern Romania, Nastase said the government would provide building materials from the state reserve to those who need them. He also ordered all flood victims to be vaccinated, to prevent epidemics caused by contaminated well water. (Rompres, Nine O'Clock - 30/07/04)

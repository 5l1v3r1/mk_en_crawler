ANKARA, Turkey -- Police have arrested two more suspects in connection with last week's deadly bombing in Diyarbakir, officials reported on Wednesday (January 9th). A man was taken into custody late Tuesday on charges of helping the alleged perpetrator, a member of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Another suspect was arrested in a town near Van, nearly 400km northeast from Diyarbakir. Prosecutors described him as a PKK member with links to the attack. A total of nine suspects are now in police custody. The blast, near a private school, killed six people and wounded more than 100.
In other news, a Turkish court has ordered an alleged al-Qaeda operative and five others suspected of ties to the terrorist group held in police custody pending trial. They were among 38 people detained in a clampdown on militant groups at the weekend. 
Separately Wednesday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would not allow the thousand-year-old Turkish-Kurdish brotherhood to be hijacked by the PKK. (AP, Turkish Daily News, Zaman, Hurriyet, Star - 10/01/08; Reuters, AFP - 09/01/08)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Economy Minister Branko Vukelic easily survived a no confidence vote Thursday (February 22nd), initiated by the largest opposition party, the Social Democratic Party. It had argued that Vukelic should bear political responsibility for a scandal involving the shipbuilding company Brodosplit, whose managers have been charged with money laundering.
In other news Thursday, Romania's main opposition Social Democratic Party announced that it would request a no confidence vote against Education Minister Mihail Hardau next week, with votes against other cabinet ministers possible. A vote last week to dismiss Justice Minister Monica Macovei passed, but the Constitutional Court ruled the prime minister is under no obligation to fire her.

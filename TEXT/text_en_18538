RUDNICA, Serbia -- The Belgrade war crimes court's investigative judge, Milan Dilparic, announced Friday (June 8th) that no evidence of a mass grave was found during a three-day search at a quarry on the border between Serbia and Kosovo. The excavation was ordered following witness testimony that human remains were unloaded at the site from four trucks on a single day in June 1999. Officials had expected to recover between 350 and 500 bodies. 
Local media reported that other parts of the quarry might also be investigated at a later date. Representatives of UNMIK, the Red Cross and the International Commission for Missing Persons attended the excavation. (Reuters, AP, Tanjug, RTS - 08/06/07)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The wartime commander of the Bosnian Muslim army, General Rasim Delic, has died, local media reported on Friday (April 16th). His lawyer, Vasvija Vidovic, says he was in poor health and died of what appeared to be a heart attack. Delic, 61, was awaiting a ruling on an appeal of the three-year prison sentence handed down by The Hague war crimes tribunal in 2008. He was convicted of allowing his troops to rape, torture and murder dozens of Croats and Serbs in BiH between 1993 and 1995. (New York Times - 17/04/10; Dnevni Avaz, AP, RTRS - 16/04/10)

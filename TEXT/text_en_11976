TIRANA, Albania -- The foreign ministry issued a statement Thursday (16 December) condemning the hijacking of a bus in Athens by two Albanians. The statement said the criminal act had nothing to do with the attitude of Albanian citizens who are living and working in Greece, and expressed hope that the incident would not affect bilateral relations. The Greek government, in turn, called on its citizens not to retaliate against immigrants.
In other news, Albania and Slovakia signed a customs co-operation agreement Thursday. The goal is to facilitate control and movement of passengers and goods.

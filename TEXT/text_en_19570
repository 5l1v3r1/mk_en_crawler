BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government is prepared to offer Kosovo "95% independence", Belgrade's minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic said on Monday (September 24th). "The Serbian proposal is new and specific and offers a form of maximum autonomy not seen in the world today," he explained, adding that if the blueprint were adopted, Kosovo would maintain only "weak and minimal" links with Serbia. The plan is to be unveiled at Friday's face-to-face talks between top Serbian and Kosovo officials in New York. 
In an interview with Reuters published on Monday, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called on the EU to join the United States in backing independence for Kosovo. "It's the only solution that is potentially stabilising for the Balkans rather than destabilising for the Balkans," she said. She also said a chance still remains that the ongoing negotiations would end with a "friendly agreement", despite the sharply opposed stances of the two sides.

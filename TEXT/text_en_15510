NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The Republican Turkish Party (CTP), the ruling formation in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), sealed an agreement Saturday (23 September) with the newly-established Freedom and Reform Party (CTB) to form a new coalition government in Lefkosia. TRNC President Mehmet Ali Talat has tapped CTP chairman Ferdi Sabit Soyer as prime minister-designate. He is expected to propose cabinet members within days. Soyer headed the previous Turkish Cypriot government, which fell apart after the CTP broke with its former coalition partner, the Democratic Party. (Focus, Zaman - 23/09/06)

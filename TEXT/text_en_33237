BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government and the UN Development Programme announced on Monday (12 May) that they are starting a programme called "Beautiful Romania", intended to give a facelift to a number of cities. The EU and the Romanian government will put together a financial package of nearly $10m to revamp major buildings in ten towns. Seen as a measure to protect the country's cultural heritage, the programme is expected to employ hundreds of people. The UNDP organised a similar project to fix 25 buildings in the centre of Bucharest in 2001.

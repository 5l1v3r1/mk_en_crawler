ATHENS, Greece -- A three-day security exercise related to the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens ended Sunday (24 November). The event, dubbed Rainbow 2002, included more than 1,800 people, including police, fire brigades, the coast guard, secret services, paramedics and Olympic Airways employees. They responded to potential terrorist scenarios, including an airplane hijacking and time bomb planted in a nearby hotel. Public Order Minister Mihalis Chrysohoidis said he was satisfied with the outcome and that he expects no incidents during the games. Officers from Britain's Scotland Yard helped co-ordinate the exercise. (Athens News Agency - 24/11/02)

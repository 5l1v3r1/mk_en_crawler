SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A court in London postponed until April 13th extradition hearings involving former Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) presidency member Ejup Ganic, local media reported on Wednesday (March 24th). The court was supposed to discuss Serbia's extradition request on Thursday. Ganic was released on bail on March 11th pending the proceedings. He was arrested on March 1st at London's Heathrow Airport based on a warrant issued by Belgrade. Serbia wants Ganic in connection with a May 1992 attack in Sarajevo against a Yugoslav National Army convoy, which left more than 40 soldiers dead.

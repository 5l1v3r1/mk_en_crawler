WASHINGTON, United States -- State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said on Friday (April 11th) that since Kosovo is a sovereign country, none of its neighbours has the right to organise elections on its territory. Serbia announced plans recently to hold its May 11th elections on the territory of its former province, which declared independence unilaterally on February 17th. 
UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker weighed in as well on Friday, saying Belgrade may hold local elections in five Serb-dominated municipalities of Kosovo, but not on May 11th. The five municipalities are Leposavic, Zubin Potok, Stripce, Zvecan and Novo Brdo. Ruecker says these elections must be organised under UNMIK's exclusive jurisdiction to be considered legitimate.

BINGOL, Turkey -- Rescue workers in southeastern Turkey on Sunday (4 May) abandoned the search for survivors of Thursday's earthquake that killed at least 167 people, including 83 boys in a collapsed school dormitory.
Officials said the search at the school, in the remote village of Celtiksuyu, 15 km east of Bingol, had stopped because no signs of life had been found under the rubble since early Friday. In the wake of violent protests by residents, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised again to clamp down on what he described as "the avalanche of abuses" by corrupt building contractors. A weaker quake rattled southern Turkey on Saturday afternoon but did not cause any damage. (CNN, BBC, Anadolu, AFP - 04/05/03; Reuters, AP, AFP - 03/05/03)

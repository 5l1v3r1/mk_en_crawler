TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu said on Friday (October 6th) that the various political parties have time to reach an agreement on the date of the next municipal elections by November 15th. This is the deadline for the president to officially set the date. Moisiu reiterated that if the parties fail to achieve a consensus, he would not hesitate to set the date himself. The main opposition Socialist Party is threatening to boycott the elections process, if the ruling Democratic Party does not allow for traditionally harsh winter conditions in mountainous regions that could affect turnout.

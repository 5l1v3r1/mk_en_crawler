ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Sunday (20 April) that he believes a presidential or semi-presidential system, separating the legislature from the executive branch, would be most suitable for Turkey. He added that the ideal model is the US system, which he says would help the country overcome widespread corruption and nepotism. Although a broad consensus of all state institutions and political parties is needed to change the political system, Erdogan said, it would be a big leap forward for Turkey.

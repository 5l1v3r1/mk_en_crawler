PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Belgrade expressed strong dissatisfaction with UNMIK's refusal to hand over former guerrilla commander Shefqet Musliu to be prosecuted in Serbia. Nebojsa Covic, Belgrade's co-ordinator on Kosovo, walked out of a meeting Tuesday (13 May) with UNMIK head Michael Steiner after failing to receive assurances that Musliu would be transferred to Belgrade. Steiner maintains that Musliu is under the jurisdiction of Kosovo justice authorities. (B92, KosovaLive, Tanjug, Beta, BBC - 13/05/03)

VIENNA, Austria -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said on Friday (June 6th) that that he wants to end Croatiaâs "rejection" of nuclear energy. Sanader explained to Austrian state TV on the eve of a trip to Vienna that his government plans a debate on nuclear energy in light of tightening energy supplies. He said Zagreb's stance on nuclear power, which previously matched Austria's, will move closer to France's, namely, one of ardent support. Sanader also said the economy ministry is forming a nuclear energy strategy, which will be ready by this autumn. (Dnevnik - 07/06/08; Vecernji List, 24 Sata, Nacional, Hina, ORF - 06/06/08)

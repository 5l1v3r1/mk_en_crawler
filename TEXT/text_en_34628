ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan signalled on Tuesday (26 August) that his government would delay a decision on sending troops to Iraq until October. He denied media reports that parliament would be called into an extraordinary session in September. Faruk Celik, the floor leader of Erdogan's Justice and Development Party, confirmed that the issue would be debated during the assembly's regular session. The lawmakers will be in recess until 1 October. Under the Turkish Constitution, parliament makes all decisions regarding deployments abroad.
In other news Tuesday, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder vowed continued support for Turkey's EU membership bid. His comment came during a meeting with outgoing Turkish Ambassador to Germany Osman Koruturk, who was paying Schroeder a farewell visit. (Reuters, AFP, Anadolu Agency, TRT 2 - 26/08/03)

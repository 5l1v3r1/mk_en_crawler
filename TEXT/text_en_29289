WASHINGTON, United States -- A former member of the Bosnian Serb army has left the United States, stripped of citizenship by a federal court, because when he applied for it, he failed to disclose that he was in the Zvornik Brigade during the Bosnian conflict, the justice department announced on Thursday (June 3rd). Jadranko Gostic, 47, left the country on Tuesday, based on a court decision late last month. He was charged in December 2006 with unlawful procurement of citizenship and making false statements. Gostic arrived in the United States in 1999 and was granted lawful permanent residence status in 2002. In 2004, he was naturalised. At every stage of the court proceedings, he co-operated, prompting officials to drop criminal charges against him. (Glas Javnosti - 04/06/10; Department of Justice, AFP, AP - 03/06/10)

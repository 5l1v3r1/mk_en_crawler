SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The UN's special envoy in the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece, Matthew Nimetz, met for two hours Wednesday (March 5th) with leaders in Skopje about a proposal he presented two weeks ago. "We talked about many ideas and we discussed all options. The government here has serious remarks about the proposal made on February 19th. The other side also has serious problems with this proposal. The two countries have different views about history," Nimetz said after the closed-door meeting. He noted, however, that Skopje is willing to continue with negotiations. 
Nimetz later went to Athens to meet with Greece's representative in the name talks, Adamantios Vassilakis. Coinciding with his visit was a large protest in downtown Thessaloniki, the main city in Macedonia, Greece. At least 10,000 people protested use of the name Macedonia by the neighbouring country, viewing it as a potential territorial claim. (Vecer - 06/03/08; Focus, Naftemporiki, AFP - 05/03/08)

ZVORNIK, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Forensic experts have recovered the remains of 270 victims in five weeks of digging at BiH's largest known mass grave and expect to find more as they burrow deeper, officials said Thursday (28 August). The mass grave, with a surface area about the size of a tennis court, was opened last month on Crni Vrh hill, 80km northeast of Sarajevo. It is the 14th mass grave found in BiH this year. Clothing and documents found at the grave indicate the victims were mostly civilian Muslims killed by local Serb troops between April and June 1992 in and around the eastern town of Zvornik.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Interior Minister Rumen Petkov will hand over lists to Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev and Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev on Monday (29 May) with the names of 304 people who face charges of money laundering and drug trafficking. The goal is to speed up legal proceedings against people with multiple pending trials. At Saturday's meeting of the Supreme Council of Bulgarian Socialist Party, Petkov said his ministry would focus its efforts on investigating contract murders in the country. Bulgaria's judicial system, and its failure to cope with organised crime and money laundry, were criticised in the latest European Commission report. (Focus, Darik, BNT, bTV - 29/05/06)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The parliamentary committee on the constitution has agreed on almost all proposed amendments, the sole exception being the controversial issue of the expatriate vote, committee chairman Vladimir Seks said on Tuesday (May 18th). That one amendment has been the subject of lengthy negotiations between the ruling Croatian Democratic Union and the main opposition Social Democratic Party, whose approval is needed for the amendments to attain the required majority in parliament. Seks is optimistic an agreement on it could be reached this week. (HRT, HINA, dalje.com - 18/05/10)

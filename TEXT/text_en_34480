NEW YORK, United States -- Serbia-Montenegro has pledged to enhance co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, says Belgrade's Ambassador to the UN, Dejan Sahovic. At the UN General Assembly session Thursday (9 October), he said the government will continue to boost the process and has already made relevant legal changes, especially in terms of extraditing indictees. Sahovic praised the idea of completing all indictments by the end of next year, especially those involving former KLA members. (B92, Beta, Tanjug, Serbian Radio, BBC - 09/10/03)

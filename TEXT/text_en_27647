NEW YORK, United States -- President Abdullah Gul said on Friday (September 24th) that his country and Israel remain "friends" despite an Israeli raid on a Turkish-led aid flotilla to Gaza that left nine people dead in late May. "There are strong, centuries-old ties of friendships between our people, and Turkey was one of the first countries to recognise Israel in 1949," Gul said in his address to the 65th UN General Assembly late on Thursday (September 23rd). At the same time, he criticised Israel's raid as an "unacceptable act and clear violation of international law", and demanded an apology. (UN website, Bloomberg, Hurriyet - 24/09/10)

The issue was raised during a regional conference held in the Bulgarian city of Stara Zagora, which was also attended by Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov. The participants agreed on a number of priority projects aimed at enhancing economic development, cross-border collaboration and the establishment of a free trade zone in the region.

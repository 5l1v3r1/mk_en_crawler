STRASBOURG, France -- Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic went before the European Parliament on Tuesday (13 January), seeking continued EU support of his country's efforts at Euro-Atlantic integration. Marovic said he was hopeful the EU would soon decide whether to open negotiations on the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia-Montenegro. He said he is confident that democratic forces would prevail in Serbia despite the December election results.
In other news Tuesday, Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic told Radio Free Europe that the renewed church dispute between the Macedonian and the Serbian Orthodox Churches would not affect bilateral relations between the republics.

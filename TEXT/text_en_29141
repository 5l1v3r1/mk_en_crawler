PRISTINA, Kosovo -- NATO Commander of Allied Joint Force Command Naples, Admiral Mark Fitzgerald, praised EULEX's efforts to fight corruption and is offering help when needed in the future. "We support the rule of law and we are here to help [â¦]. Fighting corruption is important for every democratic society," Fitzgerald said after visiting NATO's offices in Pristina on Wednesday (May 5th). He voiced concern about recent incidents at the border with Macedonia, and about the appearance of shadowy armed groups in Macedonia. "These cases may destabilise both countries, and we are concerned," Fitzgerald said, welcoming the quick reactions of Macedonian and Kosovo authorities.
In other news Wednesday, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said that last week's EULEX raids at the Transport and Telecommunication Ministry were conducted without warning, and said the government has not been informed whether anything illegal turned up. In an interview with public broadcaster RTK, Thaci said he would not allow members of his cabinet to be discredited, adding that "no one should prejudge justice and exaggerate because of personal or political motives." EULEX says the searches stemmed from "several tenders" for road construction between 2007 and 2009. (Zeri, Koha Ditore, Express, Lajm - 06/05/10)

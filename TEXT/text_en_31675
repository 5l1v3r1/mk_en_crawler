ANKARA, Turkey -- The High Electoral Board (YSK) of Turkey announced Monday (13 January) it had postponed the by-election in the province of Siirt from 9 February to 9 March. The measure was applied according to amendments to election legislation, adopted recently by parliament. The new wording calls for elections 90 days after the original, rather than the old 60 days. November results were originally rejected by YSK due to voting irregularities. The by-election gives ruling party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan a chance to win a seat in parliament and later become prime minister.
In other news, the government unveiled an ambitious privatisation programme Monday, suggesting that proceeds would reach $4 billion in 2003. Over the last 17 years, the sale of state property totalled some $8 billion. (Milliyet - 14/01/03; Anadolu Agency, BBC, TRT, AFP - 13/01/03)

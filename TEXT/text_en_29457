TIRANA, Albania -- Members of parliament from the main opposition Socialist Party (SP) decided on Wednesday (June 30th) to "reconsider" their position and resume their boycott, in a bid to resolve the longstanding political stalemate. Group head Gramoz Ruci announced that SP members will not participate in the discussion of draft laws and will boycott votes because the government refuses to meet their demands to investigate the transparency of the June 2009 general elections. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Sali Berisha invited the opposition to participate in debates to reform elections laws. (VoA, Shekulli, Top Channel, Telegrafi - 30/06/10)

SAMSUN, Turkey -- The former leader of the banned pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP), Ahmet Turk, was attacked on Monday (April 12th) in the northern province of Samsun. Turk was reportedly punched in the face by an assailant as he was leaving a courthouse, suffering a broken nose and deep cuts in his forehead. Police have made two arrests in the incident. The Constitutional Court banned the DTP in December for having links to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party. (Vatan - 13/04/10; Xinhua, Anadolu news agency, Hurriyet - 12/04/10)

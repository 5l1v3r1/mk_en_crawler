DUBROVNIK, Croatia -- OSCE Chairman-in-Office Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos said on Saturday (July 7th) that the OSCE Mission in Croatia would likely close down by the end of this year, after 11 years of operation. His comment followed talks with Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and Foreign Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, held on the sidelines of a regional forum in Dubrovnik, late last week. Sanader pledged that Zagreb would continue to work for the protection of minorities and to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal, after the mission shuts down.

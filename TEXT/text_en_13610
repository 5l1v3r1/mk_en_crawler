SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH House of Representatives, the lower house of the state parliament, adopted amendments to the BiH election law Thursday (23 March). One of the most important changes is the introduction of passive voter registration, replacing a system in which citizens had to register themselves to become eligible to vote. Also, the deadline for announcing elections was moved to 4 May, creating more time for the adoption of amendments based on the recent agreement hammered out by the seven main political parties.
Also Thursday, the Republika Srpska Parliament adopted a declaration concerning the lawsuit BiH has filed against Serbia-Montenegro at the International Court of Justice. It calls for the suit to be withdrawn. (Nezavisne Novine, Dnevni Avaz - 24/03/06; PBS BiH, RTRS, Fena - 23/03/06)

ANKARA, Turkey -- A total of 33 military personnel, including three admirals, faced court on Tuesday (June 15th) for their alleged involvement in a plot to topple the government by fomenting public unrest. The suspects were arrested in November over a plan dubbed Operation Cage. The Taraf newspaper has reported the plot was two-pronged: it aimed to provoke a conflict with Greece in the Aegean Sea, while bombing some of Istanbul's most popular mosques. The goal was to create the impression the government could not guarantee national security and that the army should be engaged. The detentions occurred after a document turned up in the home of one officer, outlining the alleged conspiracy. (Milliyet - 16/06/10; AFP, BBC - 15/06/10)

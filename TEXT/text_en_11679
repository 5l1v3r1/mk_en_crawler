BUCHAREST, Romania -- The public generally disapproves of early elections, according to a poll by the Group of Social Studies 2000 agency, published in the local press Monday (18 July). According to the survey, 58 per cent of respondents are against early elections, while 42 per cent support the idea. Support for the currently ruling alliance between the National Liberal Party and the Democratic Party has declined, although it leads other parties and coalitions. Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu is expected to formally offer his resignation today, to protest the recent rejection of a key judicial reform law by the Constitutional Court. During a trip to Brussels Monday, Tariceanu is expected to reassure EU representatives that Romania will honour its commitments in the accession process, regardless of domestic politics.

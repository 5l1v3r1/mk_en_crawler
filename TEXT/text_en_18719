BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu urged the opposition Wednesday (February 7th) to delay any initiative to impeach President Traian Basescu until after the country elects its representatives to the European Parliament. Tariceanu stressed that the May 13th vote should be the top priority and that overlapping it with the impeachment debate would be detrimental. The local media suggests Tariceanu is trying to reconcile differences with Basescu, with whom he recently exchanged accusations of corruption.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska's Defence Ministry is expected to submit the results of a probe into recent incidents involving army recruits to NATO HQ in BiH by Wednesday (20 April), says NATO's top representative to BiH, US General Steven Schook. He spoke to reporters Monday after a meeting with High Representative Paddy Ashdown and BiH Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic. The international community wants to know who was responsible for the recruits' improper behaviour during their weekend oath-taking ceremony. Schook says the ceremony should be repeated because of violations of the BiH defence law. (Nezavisne novine - 19/04/05; PBS BiH, NTV Hayat, RTRS - 18/04/05)

ATHENS, Greece -- The government reported Wednesday (30 March) that budgets in the next two years would receive an extra 2.64 billion euros (or 1.6 per cent of GDP) from higher taxes and spending cuts. Greece moved Tuesday to raise the VAT from 18 per cent to 19 per cent. New higher taxes on cigarettes and alcohol are expected to bring in 455m euros.
Also Wednesday, the government drafted legislation to allow commercial use of facilities built for the 2004 Summer Olympics. Fani Pali Petralia, the deputy culture minister who led the government's Olympic preparations, told reporters that vacant venues would be leased to companies for office space, convention centres and other uses.

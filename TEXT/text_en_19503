TIRANA, Albania -- The government said on Tuesday (March 25th) that it will freeze non-essential public projects until all those affected by the deadly series of explosions at an army depot ten days ago are compensated. The costs are now estimated at 12m euros.
Meanwhile, prosecutors investigating whether foul play was involved questioned Army Chief of Staff General Luan Hoxha and his deputy, Lieutenant General Shpetim Spahiu on Monday. Prosecutors are trying to determine who chose a village, 15km outside Tirana, to serve as a depot for obsolete munitions earmarked for destruction. Former Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu has said he and the generals had approved the choice. (TopChannel, BalkanWeb, BalkanInsight - 25/03/08)

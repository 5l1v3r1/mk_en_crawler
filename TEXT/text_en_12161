ZAGREB, Croatia -- Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, whose country currently presides over the EU, believes that accession talks with Croatia could be launched soon. In an interview with the Austrian newspaper Kurier on Monday (11 April), Juncker implied that there is a good chance talks could start before Luxembourg's EU presidency expires in July. He noted, however, that the main condition is co-operation with The Hague tribunal, particularly the extradition of retired General Ante Gotovina.

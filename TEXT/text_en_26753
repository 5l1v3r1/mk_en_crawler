SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj rejects his Israeli counterpart's suggestion that BiH is a potential breeding ground for terrorists, local media reported on Thursday (January 7th). Avigdor Lieberman said on Tuesday he has information that the Balkans are "the next destination" for al-Qaeda and other Islamic extremist groups to establish operations, pointing to areas populated by Bosnians and Albanians. Alkalaj reportedly has told Lieberman by phone that such statements harm the country's reputation and stressed that BiH is committed to fighting terrorism. International organisations have confirmed there are no terrorist cells or training camps in the country. (AP, Dnevni Avaz, Fena, BHRT - 07/01/10)

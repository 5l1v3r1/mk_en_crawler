NIS, Serbia-Montenegro -- US Ambassador to Serbia-Montenegro Michael Polt said Tuesday (8 February) that the issues of the federal union's co-operation with The Hague tribunal and resolving Kosovo's status are not linked. He denied recent media allegations that Belgrade's failure to improve co-operation with the tribunal might jeopardise the Serbian position during future talks on Kosovo. Polt was in Nis attending a conference on southern Serbia.
In other news Tuesday, a bomb exploded under the car of moderate Kosovo Serb politician Oliver Ivanovic, damaging the vehicle but causing no injuries. Ivanovic was one of a few local leaders who defied calls by hardliners to boycott the recent elections in the province. (Danas - 09/02/05; Tanjug, FoNet, Beta, B92, Reuters - 08/02/05)

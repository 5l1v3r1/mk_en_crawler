The tribunal found defendants Vujadin Popovic and Ljubisa Beara guilty of genocide in the Bosnian enclave and sentenced them to life in prison. Another officer, Drago Nikolic, got a sentence of 35 years for aiding and abetting genocide. A fourth defendant, Ljubomir Borovcanin, was acquitted of genocide charges but was convicted of crimes against humanity and sentenced to 17 years in prison. Defendants Radivoje Miletic and Milan Gvero got 19 and five years, respectively, for crimes against humanity and war crimes.

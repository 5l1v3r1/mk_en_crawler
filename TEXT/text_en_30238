BUCHAREST, Romania -- The National Anti-corruption Department (DNA) launched an investigation Monday (February 21st) against dozens of police officers serving at the border with Moldova. "Up to 55 police officers at the Albita border checkpoint were brought to the prosecution today," anti-graft prosecution spokesperson Livia Saplacan announced on Monday. The move came after 59 officials at the border with Ukraine were arrested earlier this month, implicated in cigarette smuggling. Over 100 officers at the border with Serbia are also being investigated. Bucharest has filed corruption charges against former Customs chief Radu Marginean, who was sacked on February 10th.

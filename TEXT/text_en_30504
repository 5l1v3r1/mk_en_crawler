PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EU Managing Director for Europe and Central Asia Miroslav Lajcak will temporarily act as the bloc's special representative in Kosovo after the mandate of Pieter Feith expires at the end of this month, Pristina-based daily Koha Ditore reported on Saturday (April 9th). Citing sources in Brussels, the paper said Lajcak will be in the post until EU member states reach an agreement on the two positions -- the EU representative and the head of the International Civilian Office. Currently, Feith is both International Civilian Representative and EU special representative in Kosovo. (B92, Blic, Tanjug, Koha Ditore - 09/04/11)

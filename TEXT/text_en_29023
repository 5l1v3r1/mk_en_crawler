ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu called again on Tuesday (July 6th) for Israel to apologise for attacking a Turkish-led flotilla carrying aid to Gaza in end-May that left nine people dead. "Israel should either apologise and pay compensation unilaterally as a result of its own inquiryâ¦ or, if it does not want to do thatâ¦ it should wait for the results of [a probe by] an international commission," Davutoglu said. "If those two conditions do not materialise ... Turkey will not stay indifferent," he added in a televised interview on TGRT. Turkey has already closed its airspace to Israeli military flights. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman reiterated on Tuesday that his country has no intention of apologising. 
Turkish President Abdullah Gul also commented on bilateral ties with Israel, saying on Tuesday that the government coalition in Tel Aviv is preventing the country from repairing relations with Turkey. (Radikal, Sabah, Zaman - 07/07/10; Reuters, AFP - 06/07/10)

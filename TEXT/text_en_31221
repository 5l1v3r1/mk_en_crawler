BUCHAREST, Romania -- Crin Antonescu, the president of the opposition National Liberal Party (PNL), proposed on Sunday (January 2nd) a five-year alliance with the other major opposition party -- the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the junior coalition partner Democratic Alliance of Hungarians (UDMR). The alliance would decide on a sole presidential candidate between now and the 2014 elections. It would also initiate procedures to impeach President Traian Basescu this year, Antonescu said in a TV interview, as Basescu would likely oppose any new prime minister backed by their coalition. The alliance will both ensure a strong parliamentary majority and leave the current cabinet with very weak support, making it easy to bring down, he added. The PSD reacted positively to Antonescu's statement and said the party's leadership has a mandate to negotiate the proposal this month. (Adevarul, Cotidianul, Evenimentul Zilei - 02/01/11)

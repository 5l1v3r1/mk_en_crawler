NICOSIA, Cyprus -- After more than three hours of talks Wednesday (September 5th), the leaders of Cyprus' divided communities -- Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat -- left the meeting venue without comment. 
Michael Moeller, head of the UN peacekeeping mission in Cyprus, mediated the talks. He said the two leaders have in principle agreed to continue contacts under UN auspices, but that no specific date has been set. Later in the day, Papadopoulos and Talat blamed each other for the failure of the talks. (Phileleftheros, CNA, Anadolu Agency, Focus, Reuters, AFP - 05/09/07)

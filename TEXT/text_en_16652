BUCHAREST, Romania -- A collision between a bus and a minivan left 12 people dead in Romania on Thursday (7 September). Five others were injured, one critically. Investigators say the minivan was designed to carry up to eight passengers but its seats had been removed. There were 17 people -- including children -- sitting on the floor when it collided with a bus carrying 29 Moldavians on their way to Italy. None of them was injured. (UPI - 07/09/06)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The agriculture and food ministry announced on Monday (December 8th) that inspectors from the country's National Veterinary Service have found about 60 tonnes of Irish pork in Sofia and Plovdiv and are banning its sale, fearing it may contain high levels of dioxin. Ireland warned on Sunday against consuming its pork and pork-based products after testing turned up excessive levels of potentially dangerous dioxin in the meat.

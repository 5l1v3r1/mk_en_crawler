TIRANA, Albania -- Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI) leader Ilir Meta on Tuesday (June 29th) urged political leaders to start strengthening electoral legislation, to ensure small parties get more representation. "Discussions need to be wide and all inclusive," he said. Meta's SMI only managed to win a handful of seats in parliament in the June 2009 elections. They joined a coalition with the Democratic Party-led government of Prime Minister Sali Berisha. (Start, Alsat, Top Channel, Telegrafi - 29/06/10)

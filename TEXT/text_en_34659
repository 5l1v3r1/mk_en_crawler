BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Following a Serbian State Security Council meeting Friday (22 August), Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic said Serbia stands ready "to respond to any operation by extremists in south Serbia". Zivkovic said the secret services are already looking at ties between extremist groups in the region and organised crime. He said that a complete picture of the security situation would be available in about ten days. Ethnic Albanian political leaders responded that stepping up security is unnecessary and that such statements only increase tensions.
On Friday, an army patrol came under fire in south Serbia. The defence ministry described the attackers as "ethnic Albanian militants" who had posed as woodcutters in an attempt to spy on army positions. There were no reports of casualties in this latest in a series of attacks. (B92, Tanjug, Beta - 23/08/03; AFP - 22/08/03)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- US President George W. Bush reportedly is likely to visit Kosovo next month, making him the first head of state to pay an official visit since Kosovo declared independence from Serbia on February 17th. Local media reports on Monday (March 3rd) said Bush will travel to Kosovo after NATO's early-April summit in Bucharest, and before a planned visit to Zagreb. Croatia, Macedonia and Albania all hope to receive an invitation to join NATO at the summit. The US Office in Pristina refused to confirm reports of Bush's visit.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Ramush Haradinaj's candidacy for prime minister has been confirmed, a spokesman for his Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) announced Tuesday (23 November). Investigators from the UN war crimes tribunal recently questioned the politician about his role in alleged atrocities during the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict. In light of this, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana questioned the wisdom of the nomination in a statement Monday. AAK is seeking four additional cabinet posts, while President Ibrahim Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo would get six. The Vakat formation would get one ministry, while the two ministerial portfolios as well as two deputy minister seats would be offered to Kosovo Serb representatives. 
 In other news, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said in a report addressed to the UN Security Council that Kosovo has made "tangible and encouraging" progress in meeting a set of international standards. He warned, however, that it would be premature to consider the issue of final status before the benchmarks are met fully. (Reuters, AFP, KosovaLive, Beta, BBC - 23/11/04)

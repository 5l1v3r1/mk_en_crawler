BUCHAREST, Romania -- EU Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs Franco Frattini praised Romania on Monday (31 July) for progress made in EU accession-related reforms, but urged authorities to quickly address remaining shortcomings in key areas, including judicial sector restructuring and combating corruption. Frattini is making a two-day visit to Bucharest following his trip to Sofia. He said he hopes that efforts by local authorities, with assistance from the European Commission (EC), would lead to the timely entry of Romania and Bulgaria on 1 January. 
In Sofia earlier Monday, Frattini called on parliament to adopt key changes in the constitution -- guaranteeing judicial independence -- by mid-September, ahead of the release of the next EC monitoring report on Bulgaria's progress. (Rompres, Darik - 31/07/06)

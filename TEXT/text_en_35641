PARIS, France -- Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte visited Paris Wednesday (7 April) to meet with Defence Minister Michele Alliot-Marie and senior judiciary officials. "My fear is, as you know, that the SFOR and NATO forces will leave the Balkans, and I would like to know who will have the task of looking for the 21 people for whom there are arrest warrants, among them Karadzic and Mladic," she said. Del Ponte wants them arrested by year's end.
At The Hague, senior Scottish judge Lord Bonomy has been appointed to the panel of three judges hearing the trial of Slobodan Milosevic. He replaces Richard May, who will leave the tribunal because of illness on 31 May. (AFP, BBC - 07/04/04)

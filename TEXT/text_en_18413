BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU foreign ministers reaffirmed the "clear European perspective" of the Western Balkan countries, but called for further reform efforts to meet set criteria, during a meeting in Brussels on Monday (December 11th). The EU Council reviewed the progress of states engaged in Stabilisation and Association Process negotiations: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Montenegro and Serbia, including Kosovo. Generally, all were acknowledged to have made progress, but were urged to step up measures against corruption and organised crime, and restructure and strengthen judicial institutions. 
Albania's political parties were urged to participate in a constructive and efficient political dialogue, while BiH parties were urged to hammer out police reform and meet obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal. Montenegro was urged to focus more on boosting the domestic administrative capacities, while Serbia was urged to enhancing the civilian supervision of the security sector. Negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia were kept on hold for now.
In regards to Kosovo, the EU Council called for further implementation of the crucial standards. (Danas, Nezavisne novine, Pobjeda - 12/12/06; EU website, Tanjug, Reuters - 11/12/06)

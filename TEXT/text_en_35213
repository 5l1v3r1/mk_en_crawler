LISBON, Portugal -- Croatia ended its run in the 2004 European Championship with a 2-4 loss to England on Monday (21 June). The loss was accompanied by news that the European soccer governing body UEFA is investigating Croatia for racist behaviour by some of its fans during last week's game against France. A spokesman said fans made offensive noises to black French players and waved at least two racist banners. The probe could result in a stiff fine.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said on Sunday (September 21st) that for the time being, "there is nothing new" on Macedonia's possible recognition of Kosovo. His comment was in response to recent reports suggesting recognition is forthcoming. "The government is carefully watching the process and we are acting in accordance with our state interests. We maintain contacts with all our partners in NATO and the EU and, if there is anything new, we will announce it, but for the time being we have nothing new," Gruevski said. Recently, senior government representatives from the Democratic Union for Integration have indicated Skopje will soon recognise the independence of the former Serbian province.

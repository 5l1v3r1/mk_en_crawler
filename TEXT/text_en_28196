TIRANA, Albania -- The leader of the opposition Socialist Party (SP), Edi Rama, has asked the US and EU ambassadors to help resolve Albania's political crisis. In a letter sent on Thursday (November 18th), Rama explained that the opposition's new position -- aimed at compromise -- is to look into the June 2009 elections materials, by giving a full mandate to an investigating commission within parliament. Prime Minister Sali Berisha, however, has rejected this offer as unacceptable, saying it would amount to an "unrestricted investigation" by the panel. If the opposition gets permission to look into the electoral materials, it will be ready to work on electoral reforms ahead of the May 2011 local elections, Rama said in his letter.

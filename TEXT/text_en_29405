PRISTINA, Kosovo -- An explosion killed one man and injured 11 others during a Serb protest in Mitrovica on Friday (July 2nd). Police say a hand grenade was hurled at protestors who were rallying against the opening of an office of ethnic Albanian authorities in the Serb-dominated town. About 1,000 people had gathered for the protest, the crowd growing quickly as Serb parallel structures sounded "emergency" sirens. Police say gun shots were also heard. KFOR troops and police officers have been deployed at the bridge dividing the town. Serbian President Boris Tadic described the incident as a "provocation" against peace and the Serb community. The dead man is identified as Mesud Dzekovic, a doctor. Latest reports indicate the crowd has been dispersed and that police and EULEX have launched an investigation.

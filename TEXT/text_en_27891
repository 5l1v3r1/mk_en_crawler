SKOPJE, Macedonia -- About 100 people gathered in downtown Skopje on Wednesday (May 19th) to protest The Hague's decision to uphold the 12-year sentence given former Macedonian security official Johan Tarculovski. He was convicted of a police attack on the Albanian-dominated village of Ljuboten, near Skopje, during the 2001 conflict between Macedonia's security forces and Albanian guerrillas. On Wednesday, judges rejected Tarculovski's appeal, lodged in August 2008. (A1, Makfax - 19/05/10)

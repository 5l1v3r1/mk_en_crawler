SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country's political leaders must overcome fears and find common ground to wrap up an agreement on police reform, High Representative and EU Special Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling said on Thursday (March 15th). He spoke at the launch of a public information campaign aimed at boosting trust between the public and police, sponsored by the EU Police Mission. Schwarz-Schilling used the occasion to praise the work of BiH policemen, stressing that they have proven they can work together though their political leaders cannot. 
In other news Thursday, parties in Republika Srpska's (RS) Parliament backed a declaration on RS's European future, as spelled out in the Dayton Peace Accord and the constitution.

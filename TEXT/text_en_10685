TIRANA, Albania -- The EU's 2004 report on Albania urges the country to continue judicial reforms, according to the EU Information Centre in Tirana. While acknowledging progress has been achieved in certain fields, the report says much remains to be done, noting that authorities have only partially implemented the recommendations of the 2003 EU report.
Also Wednesday, European Commission Ambassador to Tirana Lutz Salzman handed the government recommendations and proposals for integrated border management in the Western Balkans. Salzman said the document should serve as a point of reference for countries in the region when drafting border security policy. (ATA - 10/11/04)

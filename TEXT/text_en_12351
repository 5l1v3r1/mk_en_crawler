ZAGREB, Croatia -- One of the top fugitives wanted by the UN war crimes tribunal, retired Croatian General Ante Gotovina, reportedly is attempting to negotiate his surrender. Local press said Wednesday (12 January) that Gotovina's lawyer, Luka Misetic, sent a letter to Luxembourg's foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, whose country now holds the rotating EU presidency. Misetic wrote that his client is ready to hand himself over to the UN tribunal, but is asking to be tried before a Croatian court. His extradition to The Hague is a condition for launching EU membership talks with Croatia. (Vecernji list, Vjesnik - 12/01/05)

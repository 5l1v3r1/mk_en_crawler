TIRANA, Albania -- The second meeting of the EU-Albania Stabilisation and Association Parliamentary Committee was held in Tirana on Thursday (November 4th) to discuss latest developments in the country. The chairman of the EP Delegation for Relations with Southeast European countries, Eduard Kukan, said Albania's political crisis has been dragging on for too long and that the EP does not know how to resolve it. Kukan reiterated that functioning institutions is a condition for EU accession, and said the issue will be addressed in the upcoming European Commission progress report on Albania. Integrations Minister Majlinda Bregu described the report as a political guide for the government. Progress and reforms have been mired down by a political impasse since the June 2009 elections.

TIRANA, Albania -- The main opposition Socialist Party (SP) on Tuesday (March 6th) rejected Bamir Topi, the nominee for president proposed by the ruling Democratic Party (DP). On Monday, the DP said Topi was backed by the right-wing ruling coalition and should be backed by the opposition. But SP official Ben Blushi responded that the president should be elected via a consensus, that is, nominated or supported by the opposition. By law, parliament elects the president with a two-thirds majority of the 140 deputies. The DP-led coalition alone does not have the necessary 84 votes. The five-year mandate of incumbent Alfred Moisiu, who was elected by consensus, expires in June. (Albanian News - 07/03/07; Makfax - 06/03/07)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Central Election Bureau on Tuesday (30 November) rejected a request by the major opposition alliance National Liberal Party (PNL)- Democratic Party (PD) to repeat Sunday's elections due to alleged fraud. Earlier on Tuesday, PNL-PD presidential candidate Traian Basescu demanded nullification of the results, claiming that fraud accounted for approximately 500,000 votes. 
With 98.65 per cent of the votes counted, the ruling Social Democratic Party's (PSD) coalition with the Humanist Party (PUR) leads by six percentage points over the PNL-PD alliance in the parliamentary elections. PSD-PUR's candidate Adrian Nastase won 40.97 per cent of the votes for president, while Basescu won 33.86 per cent. A runoff will be held on 12 December.

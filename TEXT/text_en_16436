ANKARA, Turkey -- Tens of thousands of people gathered in Ankara on Saturday (11 November) for the funeral of former Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, using the occasion to rally in support of secularism in Turkey. "Turkey is secular and will remain secular" and "Cankaya [the presidential palace] is secular and will remain secular!" the crowd chanted. They were responding to speculation that incumbent Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan might run for president. 
Erdogan, who also attended the funeral, told his Justice and Development Party later in the day that he was committed to supporting Turkey's secular system. The party, which was holding its second congress, unanimously re-elected Erdogan as its leader. (Milliyet, Radikal - 12/11/06; Zaman, Reuters - 11/11/06)

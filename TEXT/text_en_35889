ATHENS, Greece -- Denis Oswald, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) member who oversees preparations for the 2004 Summer Games, arrives in Athens on Wednesday (21 January) to check on the pace of construction at several sites. The inspection precedes an IOC meeting in Athens next month. Tilemahos Hitiris, the government's Olympic spokesman, told reporters that the 7 March elections would not disrupt preparations for the Games.

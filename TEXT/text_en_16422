PODGORICA, Montenegro -- President Filip Vujanovic named Justice Minister Zeljko Sturanovic as prime minister-designate on Wednesday (October 11th), and gave him the mandate to form a new government. Sturanovic would succeed fellow Democratic Party of Socialists member Milo Djukanovic, who announced his resignation shortly after the September 10th parliamentary elections. By law, Sturanovic now has 60 days to form a cabinet. No problems are anticipated, as the DPS-led coalition enjoys an absolute majority in parliament. (Vijesti, Pobjeda - 12/10/06; Mina - 11/10/06)

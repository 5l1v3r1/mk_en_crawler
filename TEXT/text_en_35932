TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament discussed Thursday (15 January) the circumstances that led to last week's tragedy in the Ionian Sea, in which at least 20 illegal emigrants lost their lives on their way to Italy. The deputies agreed on the need for reforms, especially in the most impoverished northern regions, home to most of the victims. During the debate, the opposition leveled accusations against the government, while the ruling party accused the opposition of trying to benefit from the tragedy. (ATA - 15/01/04)

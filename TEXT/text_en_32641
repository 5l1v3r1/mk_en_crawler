SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Meeting Thursday (26 December) at the request of President Boris Trajkovski, politicians discussed measures to further implement the Ohrid peace accord of August 2001. A spokesman for Trajkovski said they hammered out a provisional agreement to adopt 90 new laws, granting more power to local governments and ensuring better representation of ethnic minorities in government administration. VMRO-DPMNE, the former ruling party, boycotted the meeting, calling it a "circus". US Ambassador Lawrence Butler and EU Special Envoy Alexis Brouhns attended.
At a separate meeting Thursday, Macedonian government officials and NATO and OSCE diplomats condemned a bombing in front of a Kumanovo school the day before. Police have established that only the accidental delay of a school bell prevented students from leaving the building two minutes earlier when the blast occurred.

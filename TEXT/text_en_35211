MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In a report published Saturday (21 February), EU security chief Javier Solana said the entry of BiH into the EU and NATO would be questionable without arrests of key war crimes suspects. Solana told local daily <i>Nezavisne Novine</i> that progress in institutional reforms would be another important criterion for the country's Euro-Atlantic integration. He also urged the authorities in Republika Srpkska to implement the plan for setting up a state information and protection agency. (Nezavisne Novine, HINA, BBC - 21/02/04)

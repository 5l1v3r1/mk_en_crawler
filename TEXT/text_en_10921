SKOPJE, Macedonia -- During a visit to Skopje Friday (1 October), European Commission (EC) President Romano Prodi handed over to Macedonia's Prime Minister Hari Kostov an EC questionnaire which must be completed before accession negotiations can be opened. The Macedonian government is to submit answers to the document's 3,000 questions to Brussels by the end of January 2005. During his meeting with Kostov, Prodi said the successful outcome of dialogue between Macedonia and the EU would depend on implementation of judicial reforms, all democracy-related reforms and the Ohrid Agreement. 
 The EC president also met with Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski and delivered a speech before the national parliament. He told lawmakers that Macedonia was expected to show that different ethnic communities can co-exist together, and warned that any interference with the reform process could create serious problems. Prodi's visit came a few weeks before a November referendum on the country's new decentralisation laws. 
In other news, US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Marc Grossman announced that the United States will provide $9.5m for support and realisation of Macedonia's decentralisation programme. Following talks Friday with Crvenkovski and Kostov, Grossman characterised the upcoming referendum as a choice between the past and the future.

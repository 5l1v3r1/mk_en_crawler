ISTANBUL, Turkey -- In Istanbul on Friday (8 April), President Ahmet Necdet Sezer reaffirmed the importance Turkey attaches to bilateral ties with the United States and co-operation within NATO. Sezer also described the joint fight against terrorism as a global priority. The statement came prior to Sezer's visit to Syria later this week and amid media reports that Washington is concerned about Ankara's improving relations with Damascus at a time when Syria is under increasing international pressure to end its military presence in Lebanon.

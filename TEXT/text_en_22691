SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A new party called United Agrarians began operations on Saturday (November 8th) in Sofia. Its founders are a group of former members of the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union (BZNS) who left that party to protest its alliance with two other political formations, the LIDER party of the businessman Hristo Kovachki and the nationalist Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation (VMRO), earlier this month. Anastasia Moser became chairwoman of the new party Saturday. (BTA, novinite.com, BNR, BNT, Darik - 08/11/08)

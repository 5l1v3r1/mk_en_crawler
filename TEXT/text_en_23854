TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi on Sunday (April 19th) again urged all citizens to participate in the June 28th general elections, given the importance of these elections to potential EU membership. Officials in Brussels have stressed that Tirana must hold free and democratic elections before it can apply for EU candidate status. During a visit to Korca, where he attended Easter celebrations, Topi said Albanians play a big role in the process. Political parties have already started campaigning and presenting their programmes, more than a month before the official start of the campaign season.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Constitutional Court decided on Thursday (February 7th) that the president has the right to refuse a ministerial nomination, which means Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu must come up with another choice for justice minister. President Traian Basescu says current nominee Norica Nicolai has a poor public image, particularly given such a key post in the eyes of the EU. Tariceanu took the matter to the Constitutional Court to decide. (Realitatea Romaneasca, Nine O'clock - 08/02/08; Rompres, Mediafax, Focus - 07/02/08)

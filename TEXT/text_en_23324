SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko met with members of a US congressional delegation on Sunday (June 28th) to discuss the political situation in BiH. He called for a broader commitment by the international community to pressure authorities into meeting their obligations related to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and to intensify dialogue with NATO.
The US delegation also met with Bosniak BiH presidency member Haris Silajdzic, who urged the Office of the High Representative to remain open as long as necessary and called for increased US commitment to BiH. Presidency Chairman Nebojsa Radmanovic was not at the meeting, but spokesman Miroslav Vujicic said Radmanovic believes the OHR should be transformed into an EU Special Representative Office and that BiH politicians should assume responsibility for leading the country. US Senator Benjamin Cardin stressed that if BiH wants to achieve its goals -- NATO and EU membership -- it must implement constitutional reforms. 
Also Sunday, Dragan Covic of the Croat Democratic Union of BiH cancelled a meeting in Mostar of the eight largest parties in BiH, due to scheduling conflicts among some of the participants. They were to discuss ways to accelerate the implementation of EU-required reforms, as well as the current economic situation. (Fena, BHRT, RTRS, Onasa, Dnevni Avaz, Srna - 28/06/09)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Issues related to the progress of renovation of churches and cultural monuments in Kosovo devastated during the March 2004 riots were the focus of talks Friday (23 September) between Serbia's Culture Minister Dragan Kojadinovic and his Kosovo counterpart, Astrit Haracija. The two met during Haracija's historic visit to Belgrade, the first by a Kosovo government member to the Serbian capital. According to a statement from the Serbian Culture Ministry, Haracija said the Kosovo interim institutions envisage spending an additional 1.5m euros for repair projects next year, on top of the 4.2m euros that have already been allocated. The two officials also agreed to name co-ordinators for culture and to form task forces which will work on problems related to the return of documents and artefacts. Kojadinovic also accepted an invitation from his counterpart to hold their next meeting in Pristina. (Danas - 24/09/05; RTS - 23/09/05)

TIRANA, Albania -- The public administration racked up losses of 11m euros to the state budget last year, Supreme State Audit head Robert Ceku said on Thursday (October 1st). Most of the damage came from the tax and customs sector, but there were also irregularities in public procurement and other institutions. Ceku asked parliament's economy committee to find a way to make those responsible compensate the state. (Gazeta Shqiptare, Shqip - 02/10/09; Shekulli, Top Channel, Alsat, TVSH - 01/10/09)

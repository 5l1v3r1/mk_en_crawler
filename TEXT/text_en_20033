SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The family of Stojan Zupljanin, one of four high-profile war crimes indictees still at large, is calling on him to surrender to the UN tribunal in The Hague. In a letter to the BiH media Tuesday (March 18th), Zupljanin's wife and sons asked him to turn himself in and free his family from "their own prison", a reference to frequent raids and interrogations conducted by local police and international troops. This is the family's second public appeal since December. Zupljanin, a former head of the Republika Srpska's police, is charged with participating in the ethnic cleansing of Muslim and Croats during the 1992-1995 conflict.
In other news Tuesday, The Hague tribunal announced it is postponing by two weeks the start of the trial against former Serbian security chief Jovica Stanisic and his deputy, Franko Simatovic. The trial was to begin earlier this week, but Stanisic says he is battling intestinal ailments and depression. 
Separately Tuesday, the war crimes chamber of the BiH Court indicted Miodrag Nikacevic, a former Bosnian Serb soldier, for the 1992 rape and illegal detention of Muslims in the eastern town of Foca. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 19/03/08; RTRS, Fena, Tanjug, DPA, Reuters - 18/03/08)

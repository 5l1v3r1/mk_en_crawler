ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the coalition of the Croatian Peasant Party and Social Liberal Party (HSS-HSLS) began discussing whether they could potentially form the new government Monday (December 3rd), following elections last month in which no party won an outright majority. These policy talks will cover ten separate areas, and there are already indications the parties are open to compromise to complete discussions as soon as possible. The left-wing opposition Social Democrats are also scrambling to find a partner with enough seats to form the new government, and may hold talks of their own with the HSS-HSLS.

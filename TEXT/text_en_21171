ANKARA, Turkey -- Military officials said on Saturday (December 1st) that an operation against a base belonging to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in northern Iraq had inflicted heavy casualties on the guerrillas. About 100 Turkish special operations troops reportedly attacked the base when commanders received intelligence that up to 60 PKK fighters had moved there. The army issued a statement saying military action will target only the PKK, not civilians in the northern parts of Iraq. The PKK immediately denied that there had been a Turkish incursion, as did Iraqi Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani.

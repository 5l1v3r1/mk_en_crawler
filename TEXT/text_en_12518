SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government appears set to survive a no-confidence vote following an agreement between the ruling coalition and the New Time party. The Simeon II National Movement (NMS-II) and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms agreed to make New Time, a new party composed of former NMS members, a member of the coalition. It was not immediately clear whether the three parties would run together in the 25 June elections. The no-confidence vote is scheduled for Friday.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal turned down on Thursday (June 10th) Dragan Zelenovic's request for early release. Detained in 2005, the former Bosnian Serb officer was sentenced in 2007 to 15 years in prison for crimes against humanity committed in Foca in 1992, specifically the torture and rape of Bosniak women. Zelenovic is serving his term in Belgium. Authorities there informed tribunal President Patrick Robinson that according to local law, Zelenovic could apply for early release, now that he has served one third of his sentence, as he was given credit for two years he spent in custody before his trial. Robinson, however, said Zelenovic must serve a minimum of two thirds. (Dnevni Avaz, Fena, Radio Free Europe, Onasa - 10/06/10)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Ombudsman Sasa Jankovic on Wednesday (September 23rd) asked the Constitutional Court to assess a controversial new law regulating the activity of media outlets in the country. The bill, passed by parliament on August 31st, tightens libel penalties and envisions draconian fines -- even confiscation of advertising revenue -- for media companies that violate it. Media organisations have widely criticised the measure as unconstitutional. A team of experts set up by Jankovic raised some of the same concerns. (B92, Tanjug - 23/09/09)

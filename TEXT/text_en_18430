SKOPJE, Macedonia -- UN mediator Matthew Nimetz met with Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski, Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki on Saturday (January 13th) about the latest dust-up in the long-running name dispute with neighbouring Greece. Nimetz said he had "no new proposal" to make after the talks. The latest salvo was Macedonia's decision to rename Petrovec airport in Skopje after "Alexander the Great", a move which sparked strong criticism in Greece. Following talks Friday with Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis, Nimitz said Athens was frustrated by the Macedonian side's decision to rename the airport, despite a bilateral agreement to restrain from controversial moves.

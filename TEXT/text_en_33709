ANKARA, Turkey -- US and Turkish officials launched military-technical talks Thursday (4 September) on sending peacekeeping troops to Iraq. Washington has requested that Ankara contribute peacekeepers, but no decision is expected until parliament returns from its summer recess later this month.
In other news, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul returned Wednesday from Vienna, where he was attending an international conference on the nuclear test ban treaty. Gul said Ankara strongly supports the treaty and attaches great importance to the prevention of weapons proliferation. (Radikal - 04/09/03; Anadolu Agency, NTV - 03/09/03)

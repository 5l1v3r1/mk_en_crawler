PRISTINA, Kosovo -- British Ambassador to Pristina Andy Sparks has reiterated the international community's support for Kosovo's statehood and refusal to compromise on status and territory. "There are certain limits on how far one can discuss compromise, because our firm position is that Kosovo is independent and sovereign," Sparks told Belgrade-based FoNet agency on Sunday (September 5th). Sparks, who was recently appointed as EULEX's deputy head of mission, noted that more than 80% of EU member states have already recognised Kosovo's independence. He acknowledged, however, that Belgrade strongly opposes sovereignty. "Nobody is asking for Serbia to recognise Kosovo now," he said. (Kohavision, Klan Kosova, TV 21, FoNet - 05/09/10)

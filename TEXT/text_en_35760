BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Harri Holkeri met with Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica on Friday (2 April) to discuss security-bolstering measures for Serbs in Kosovo. Holkeri said UN police and KFOR troops have strengthened patrols in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities. The NATO-led peacekeepers are also guarding abandoned villages to prevent looting. The top UN official assured Kostunica that those responsible for two days of violence last month would be brought to justice. (UPI - 02/04/04)

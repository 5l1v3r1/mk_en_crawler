BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government is searching for war crimes suspect Ratko Mladic, President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic assured UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz during a meeting in Belgrade on Tuesday (November 18th). Brammertz was in Serbia to prepare his regular semi-annual report to the UN Security Council. The EU will also use it to determine whether to approve ratification of the pre-membership agreement with Serbia by the EU member states. Rasim Ljajic, head of the national council for ties with The Hague tribunal, said that since Mladic remains at large, he does not expect Brammertz's report to be positive. Mladic's arrest "won't happen today or tomorrow", Ljajic said.
In other news, Beta is reporting that parliament will consider a no-confidence motion against the government Thursday. The opposition Serbian Democratic Party, New Serbia and Serbian Radical Party filed the motion over what they perceive as the cabinet's negotiations with the EU on the EULEX mission in Kosovo. Critics say the talks are a first step towards Serbia recognising Kosovo's independence. (Blic - 19/11/08; B92, Beta - 18/11/08)

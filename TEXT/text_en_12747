SOFIA, Bulgaria -- In a rare move Thursday (3 February) Bulgaria's left-wing and right-wing opposition parties launched a joint effort to bring down the government of Prime Minister Saxe-Coburg-Gotha following its failed attempt to sell three cigarette factories to British American Tobacco (BAT). The Socialists and four right-wing parties filed a motion for a no-confidence vote in parliament, with debate expected next week. The failed sale of the factories, now run by the state-owned holding company Bulgartabac, strained relations inside the ruling coalition and was seen as a discouraging signal to potential investors. Economy Minister Lidia Shuleva, widely blamed for BAT's decision to withdraw its bid, may resign and several other cabinet ministers may be fired, according to media reports Friday.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg fired two deputy defence ministers, Mehmed Djafer and Georgi Paskov, on Monday (27 January). According to Defence Minister Nikolai Svinarov, the two deputies assumed political responsibility for the arms trading scandal involving the state-owned company Terem last November. Several of Terem's top executives have been arrested for violating Bulgaria's export control regulations. Saxe-Coburg says no further shuffles in the Council of Ministers are planned in the near future.
Also Monday, Interior Minister Georgi Petkanov met with his French counterpart Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris, signing an agreement on bilateral co-operation to fight organised crime, illegal immigration and trafficking, especially of human beings.

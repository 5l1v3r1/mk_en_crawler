PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Voters headed to the polls Sunday (November 15th) in the first elections since the country announced its independence from Serbia in February last year. The election is for mayors and municipal advisers in 36 municipalities, including the capital, Pristina. On Friday, President Fatmir Sejdiu urged all eligible voters to participate. "We should prove to the world that Kosovo is a stable country that produces peace and stability in the region," Sejdiu said. One key question is how many Serbs will participate, following calls for a boycott from Belgrade and the influential Serb Orthodox church. Around 120,000 Serbs live in Kosovo, about 40,000 of them concentrated in the north near the border with Serbia. They have rejected Kosovo's independence and have maintained strong ties with authorities in Belgrade, which gives them financial and political support. According to the Central Election Commission, 22 of the 74 political parties, coalitions and individual candidates running on Sunday are Serb. At least 80,000 Serbs living in enclaves in central Kosovo are expected to cast ballots, despite calls for a boycott. (AFP, Xinhua, AP, B92 - 15/11/09)

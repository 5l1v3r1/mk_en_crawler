SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The European Commission (EC) will be sending a team of experts to Moscow to address concerns raised recently over the quality of meat produced by Bulgaria and Romania, which will be sold as an EU export after the two countries join the Union in January. Phillip Tod, a spokesman for EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou, told the Bulgarian state news agency BTA on Friday (November 24th) that there are no grounds for Russia to impose a ban on meat imports from the EU. On Sunday, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin described Moscow's concerns over the quality of Bulgarian meat as completely ungrounded.

WASHINGTON, United States -- The latest annual US State Department report on global terrorism, released on Thursday (April 30th), discusses several Balkan countries. It cites border security and organized crime in Albania, a weak state and political interference in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and lack of training and resources in Croatia, while lauding improvements in all three countries. The report notes national anti-terrorism strategies in Bulgaria, Montenegro and Romania, and lauds efforts in Cyprus and Greece. 
In Kosovo, it says, the government and UNMIK have monitored extremist activities, but open borders remain a problem due to the ongoing disagreement with Serbia over Kosovo's independence. The election of a new government in Serbia has led to significant improvements in the fight against terrorism, it says. Finally, it takes note of the continued threat posed by PKK terrorists in Turkey. (US Department of State website, VoA, Shekulli, Top News - 30/04/09)

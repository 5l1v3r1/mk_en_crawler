SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Leaders of the six largest political parties in the ruling coalition adopted an action plan Thursday (November 22nd) to implement the agreement reached in Mostar last month, aimed at unblocking police reform. They also agreed to hold an emergency session of the two chambers of parliament on Tuesday, to discuss changes in parliamentary statutes and to adopt clear rules for voting by lawmakers. Finally, they pledged to step up political dialogue, with another meeting to be held in Banja Luka next month. High Representative Miroslav Lajcak welcomed the moves, and said his office and legal teams from Republika Srpska are close to an agreement on changes he imposed regarding quorum rules.
RS representatives, however, still insist that there will be no formal agreement on police reform, a key condition for signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, until their objections to Lajcak's changes are addressed.

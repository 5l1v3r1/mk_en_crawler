BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic on Wednesday (April 15th) warned against holding early elections in times of economic crisis. He was responding to calls from Democratic Party of Serbia leader Vojislav Kostunica, who says the government is incapable of coping with the crisis. In an interview with RTS, Tadic said the current situation is a good incentive to cut spending, create a more efficient state administration structure and encourage more responsible behaviour by all state officials. 
Meanwhile, a new poll Tuesday by Agencije MF suggests that Tadic's Democratic Party continues to be the most popular in the country, with 17.43% support. The Serbian Radical Party is second with 16.5%, and SRS defectors who formed the Serbian Progressive Party are third with 14%. The smaller ruling coalition ally, G17 Plus, has seen its support tumble from 7.5% to 2.5%. (RTS, Tanjug, Blic, FoNet - 15/04/09; Fonet, Press Online, Beta, Danas - 14/04/09)

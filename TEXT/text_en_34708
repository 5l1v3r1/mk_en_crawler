ZAGREB, Croatia -- The wrecks of a German tank, two jeeps and a truck dating back to World War II emerged from the Danube on Monday (18 August) as the level of the river receded to record levels. The wrecks are located at the site of a 1943 battle near Osijek. Police sealed off the area amid concerns there might be unexploded ordinance where a pontoon bridge once stood. Other war wreckage has been reported in different parts of the Danube, following the worst drought in 50 years. (AFP - 18/08/03)

ANKARA, Turkey -- The Supreme Court of Appeals on Thursday (June 17th) ruled against bringing President Abdullah Gul to trial over a fraud case involving missing party funds. The case dates back to the late 1990s, when the Welfare Party, a predecessor of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), reportedly embezzled millions of euros in state funds. Later, Gul and other members left the Welfare Party to establish the AKP, and in 2007, Gul won the presidency. In May 2009, a court in Sincan, near Ankara, ruled that Gul should stand trial, overriding an earlier decision by the Ankara public prosecutor's office that dismissed proceedings. On Thursday, however, the Constitutional Court overturned that lower court ruling. (Anadolu news agency, AFP, Hurriyet - 17/06/10)

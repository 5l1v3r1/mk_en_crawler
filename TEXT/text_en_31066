ANKARA, Turkey -- Passengers on an airplane bound from Oslo to Istanbul late Wednesday (January 5th) managed to overpower a man who claimed he had a bomb and tried to hijack the flight. Witnesses on the Turkish Airlines flight said the man wore a ski-mask and tried to force his way into the cockpit, reportedly demanding that the plane return to Oslo. Instead, it landed safely in Istanbul where the man, identified as Cuma Yasar, 40, was arrested. Nobody was injured and the bomb turned out to be a fake. According to local media, Yasar is a Turkish citizen from a Kurdish village in the southeast Anatolia province. Police say he is mentally ill.

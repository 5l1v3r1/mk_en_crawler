STRASBOURG, France -- A new report published by the Council of Europe (CoE) on Wednesday (10 August) urges the launch of strong and independent anti-corruption institutions in Western Balkan countries. The report, based on the results of a recent regional conference held in Skopje, covers Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro, including Kosovo. According to the document, over the past years the Western Balkan countries have made progress in combating corruption by adopting and realising comprehensive strategies as well as initiating legal changes in accordance with international and EU standards. At the same time, the report warns, a number of problems hinder anti-corruption efforts. These include lack of political will, insufficient personnel, delays in implementing reforms and the vaguely defined mandates of anticorruption agencies. (CoE Web site - 10/08/05)

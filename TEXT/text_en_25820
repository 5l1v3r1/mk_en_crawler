BERLIN, Germany -- European Commission (EC) Vice President Guenter Verheugen said in an interview with German radio station Deutschlandfunk on Sunday (October 18th) that the EU needs Turkey more than Ankara needs Brussels. "Turkey has immense strategic importance. I highlight the security of the entire region," Verheugen said. "The EU should consider what would happen if Turkey preferred to pursue another road, other than gaining a seat among Western states." He said Turkey could facilitate relations between western democracies and the Muslim world. Verheugen stressed however that Turkey must still fulfil certain membership requirements.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government is asking neighbouring Greece and Turkey for natural gas supplies to help it cope with the energy crisis triggered by Russia's decision to halt all gas deliveries via Ukraine, Economy and Energy Minister Petar Dimitrov said on Thursday (January 15th). "We are discussing an option to open a transit gas pipeline [with Greece], and we expect to secure about 2 million cubic metres per day," Dimitrov told a news conference. The countries will negotiate the price later. Turkey also has concrete proposals for connecting the Turkish and Bulgarian gas lines, Dimitrov added. Bulgaria has seen no gas deliveries since January 6th. The country relies heavily on Russian gas and lacks access to alternative pipeline routes.

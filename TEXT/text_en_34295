ATHENS, Greece -- Parliament decided on Thursday (30 October) to lift the immunity of two members of the ruling PASOK and three members of the main opposition party, New Democracy. That clears the way for prosecution of non-politically motivated charges against them. Parliament Speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis described the decision as a huge step forward.
In other news Thursday, Prime Minister Costas Simitis reiterated that stimulating employment is the government's chief priority. He said the goal is to cut unemployment to around 6 per cent by 2008. Greece holds elections this spring. (ANA, MPA - 30/10/03)

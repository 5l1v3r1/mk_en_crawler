TOKYO, Japan -- Turkey and Japan signed a memorandum of understanding Friday (December 24th) to co-operate in building Turkey's second nuclear plant, this one situated in the Black Sea region of Sinop. Turkey will seek to achieve a deal with the Japanese partners on construction of the nuclear plant within three months in order to compensate for the delay in the project after failed talks with South Korea. Turkey has already reached an agreement with Russia to build another $20 billion plant in the southern town of Mersin. (Zaman - 25/12/10; AFP, Reuters - 24/12/10)

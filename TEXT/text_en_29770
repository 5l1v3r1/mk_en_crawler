BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) decided on Thursday (January 27th) to sue Greece at the European Court of Justice for polluting Lake Koroneia, an internationally recognised wetland in northeastern Greece. It is part of Europe's Natura 2000 network of protected natural areas, and as such, is protected under EU law. It has been subjected to pollutant discharge and illegal water abstraction for irrigation, which has rendered fishing and swimming impossible and has endangered both flora and fauna in the area, the Commission said. In 2004, after thousands of birds were found dead around the lake, the EU agreed to provide co-financing to help Greece rehabilitate and protect the wetlands. The EU asked Greece in return to undertake specific measures to stop illegal water extraction and stop pollution, which Greece failed to implement. (DPA, Xinhua - 27/01/11)

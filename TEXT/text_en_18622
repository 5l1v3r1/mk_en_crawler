BELGRADE, Serbia -- Outgoing UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan is planning to tell the UN Security Council that any delay in determining the future of Kosovo could have a destabilising effect and raise tensions there. Annan will present a report to the Council on UNMIK operations next week. 
Meanwhile, Kosovo police confirmed on Thursday (December 8th) that a group of men armed with machine guns set up an illegal checkpoint on a road near the village of Grcin in southwestern Kosovo. A police spokesman, Avni Gjevlukaj, said people were seeing the checkpoint but no one was stopped. UNMIK has so far declined to comment on the reports.

STRASBOURG, France -- The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) urged in a resolution Tuesday (5 October) the completion of crucial constitutional reforms in Serbia-Montenegro. This was PACE's first assessment of Serbia-Montenegro since the country joined the Council of the Europe last year. The resolution said the loose union is on track with formal post-accession obligations but that much remains to be done in terms of democratisation and constitutional freedoms. The resolution called for more efforts by both republics to finalise reform of the main law. 
Also Tuesday, the United States signed an agreement with Serbia, offering $12.8m in technical assistance to support judicial reform over the next three years. The funding would support the operation of courts established several months ago. 
In other news, EU External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten and EU security chief Javier Solana met with top officials in Belgrade Tuesday. They discussed a proposed "twin-track" approach, aimed at speeding up Serbia-Montenegro's EU integration. (PACE Web site, B92, Tanjug, B92 - 05/10/04)

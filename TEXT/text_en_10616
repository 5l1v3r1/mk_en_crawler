BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic called Saturday (13 November) for the arrest of war crimes indictees on the republic's territory, warning that continued failure to do so is hampering Serbia's European integration and economic development. Similar remarks were made Saturday by Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic, who said Serbia was currently facing "closed doors" everywhere because of its insistence not to bring war criminals to justice. 
In other news, US Ambassador to Belgrade Michael Polt said Friday that preservation of the federal union was the most realistic option for Serbia-Montenegro, especially in light of its bid for membership in the Partnership for Peace programme. He also called on Montenegrin representatives to return to the federal council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. (UPI, AFP, RFE - 13/11/04; Beta, B92, Tanjug, Mina - 12/11/04)

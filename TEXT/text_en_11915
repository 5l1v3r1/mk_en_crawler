BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- All those responsible, especially politicians from Republika Srpska (RS), must work to find an acceptable solution to the issue of BiH police reforms, RS President Dragan Cavic said in an interview in Thursday's (14 July) Dnevni Avaz. Cavic stressed that the opportunity to start negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement in November must not be missed since it is unclear when it might come again.

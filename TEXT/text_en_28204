THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Serge Brammertz, chief prosecutor of the UN war crimes tribunal, said on Thursday (November 18th) that Serbia holds the key to locating and apprehending war crimes fugitives Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic. Speaking to Serbian reporters in The Hague, Brammertz said Mladic is either hiding very skilfully, or the search for him is not good enough. He added that if he's hiding, his network of supporters is linked to the military structures. The UN Security Council plans to discuss Brammertz's regular report on Serbia's co-operation on December 6th. He sent it to the UN Secretariat on Wednesday.

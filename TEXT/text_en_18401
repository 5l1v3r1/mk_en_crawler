ZAGREB, Croatia -- One of the key witnesses in the probe against Parliament member Branimir Glavas, suspected of war crimes committed against ethnic Serb civilians in Osijek in 1991, has died, according to local media reports. Former Osijek army volunteer Vjenceslav Bill passed away on Monday (April 9th) following a long illness. Years ago, even before prosecutors began investigating alleged crimes committed against civilians in Osijek in 1991 by Glavas, Bill openly accused him of command responsibility for events there.

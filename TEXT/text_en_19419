SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Constitutional Court President Mahmut Jusufi and Judge Bajram Polozani resigned on Tuesday (October 30th) over a recent ruling by the court, banning the display of the Albanian flag outside public buildings in areas dominated by ethnic Albanians. "I cannot sign such a decision," Jusufi said, in a written statement alleging the decision was politically motivated. 
In 2005, parliament voted to allow ethnic minorities to display flags of their choice alongside Macedonia's official flag, in areas where at least half of the population consisted of minorities. In many Albanian-dominated areas, however, only the Albanian flag was displayed. Local media interpreted Tuesday's ruling to mean that the Albanian flag will no longer be allowed to be flown permanently alongside Macedonia's official flag. Though the Constitutional Court tried to clarify its ruling, it provoked outrage among Albanian parties in parliament. (Vecer - 31/10/07; Makfax, A1, AP, MIA, BIRN, MRT, Telma TV - 30/10/07)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- US Pristina Office chief Tina Kaidanow reiterated on Monday (October 29th) US support for the efforts of the international troika on the Kosovo issue and said she expects the status of the province to be finalised shortly. Kaidanow said that the US's stance, presented by several senior officials including President George W. Bush, supports international efforts aimed at finding a compromise solution to the issue. Kaidanow declined to comment on a report Monday in the Kosovo daily Express, which suggested Washington is considering a new approach that could freeze the status issue until 2020.

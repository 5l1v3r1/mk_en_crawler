YEREVAN, Armenia -- Prime Minister Andranik Markaryan said Wednesday (17 March) that Armenia opposes Turkey's presidency of the OSCE, scheduled for 2007. He conveyed the message during a meeting with current OSCE Chairman-in-Office Solomon Passy, who is also Bulgaria's foreign minister. Markaryan said his country would reconsider its opposition only if Turkey establishes full diplomatic relations with Armenia and opens its borders. (Anadolu Agency, Arminfo - 17/03/04)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica on Sunday (5 September) urged war crimes suspects to surrender to the UN tribunal. He repeated earlier statements favouring voluntary surrender over arrests and extraditions. The call appeared to be addressed to four retired police and army generals who have been indicted but are refusing to travel to The Hague. Serbia has been under increasing pressure from the West to hand over indictees.
In other news, the trial of 13 men accused of murdering Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic is due to resume Monday. The proceedings have been clouded by threats against judges. The cars of several prosecutors have been vandalised. (AP - 06/09/04; New Zealand Herald, AFP, Dnevnik, B92, AP - 05/09/04)

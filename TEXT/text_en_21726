BELGRADE, Serbia -- The city council in Belgrade elected Democratic Party (DS) candidate Dragan Dilas as mayor Tuesday (August 19th). Under the new local self-government law, the councillors, rather than voters, filled the position. Dilas received the votes of 58 of 110 councillors; his supporters came from the For a European Belgrade coalition, led by the DS; its state government partner, the Serbian Socialist Party--Party of United Pensioners of Serbia; and the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The three parties signed a local coalition deal to govern Belgrade on Monday. Many analysts now believe that it is only a matter of time before the LDP joins the state government.

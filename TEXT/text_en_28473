PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Parliament on Thursday (October 14th) adopted a strategy for privatisation of the Post and Telecommunication of Kosovo (PTK). Opposition parties and the junior coalition partner, The Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) had argued on behalf of postponing the whole process, saying institutions are facing other difficulties, including early elections. "This process should be well-analysed, transparent and it should be postponed," LDK caucus leader Ismet Beqiri said. However, the ruling Democratic Party managed to secure the votes necessary to reject the opposition's motion and put the strategy to a vote. With only 50 lawmakers present, it was 47-2, with one abstention. Opposition lawmakers vowed to take the issue to the Constitutional Court. The PTK privatisation strategy foresees 75% of shares going to the new owner. The Finance and Economy Ministry expects the sale to generate 300m to 600m euros.

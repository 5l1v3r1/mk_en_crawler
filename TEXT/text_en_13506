ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer has vetoed the government's recent decision to appoint Adnan Buyukdeniz as the central bank's governor. In a statement Saturday (25 March), Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said the president informed the cabinet the previous day of his decision, saying the candidacy was inappropriate. Media reports say the veto likely reflects Sezer's uneasiness with the ruling Justice and Development Party and his desire to limit the number of Islamist-oriented officials in high office. The previous central bank governor, Sureyya Serdengecti, retired last week. (TurkishPress.com, Reuters - 25/03/06)

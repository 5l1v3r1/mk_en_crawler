BADEN, Austria -- Talks between the leaders of Serbia and Kosovo appeared in a complete deadlock on Tuesday (November 27th), with Serbia threatening tough sanctions against the province if it declares independence. The ethnic Albanian delegation to the negotiations again rejected Belgrade's proposal for far-reaching autonomy, saying independence is the only option. International media reports, meanwhile, quoted unnamed Serbian officials as saying Belgrade could impose a complete blockade of Kosovo and cut off its electricity supply. Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu was undaunted, saying independence could come "at a time not too long from now". The final round of the negotiations ends late Wednesday.

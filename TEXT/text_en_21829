PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A UN Security Council session on reconfiguring the international presence in Kosovo is expected on Wednesday (November 26th), Serbian state television reported on Saturday, citing diplomatic sources. Kosovo Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni travelled to New York on Sunday to present Pristina's objections to a six-point plan prepared by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on the reconfiguration of UNMIK. The Security Council session on Kosovo has already seen several postponements.
In other news, a judge in Pristina decided on Saturday to detain three German citizens suspected in the November 14th blast near the International Civilian Office in Pristina for another month. Local media described the trio as active officers in Germany's Federal Intelligence Service, an allegation on which Berlin refused to comment. If convicted of terrorism charges, they face up to 20 years in prison. Prosecutor Feti Tunuzliu said on Saturday the Germans intended to "hamper and hinder" EU efforts to deploy its mission in Kosovo.

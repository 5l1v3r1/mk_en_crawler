SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The first group of 30 Bulgarian soldiers left for Kuwait on Saturday (26 July) to join the 9,200-strong multinational force under Polish command in Iraq. The servicemen will set up a camp in Kuwait, where the remaining 470 Bulgarian troops will spend time getting acclimated. The Bulgarian battalion is expected to provide logistical support and do guard duty in southern Iraq starting in September. Bulgaria is taking part in ten international missions, including Afghanistan. A team of experts went there Saturday to serve as instructors on the use of Russian-made military equipment.
In other news, the Croatian news agency HINA reports that authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) are considering the possibility of sending a military unit in support of peacekeeping operations in Iraq. The unit reportedly would be composed of around 80 troops specialising in transport operations. It would include Croats, Serbs and Muslims.
Also Friday, BiH Federation Defence Minister Miroslav Nikolic confirmed that financial problems have led to electricity and water supply cuts in many parts of the army, but insisted performance has not been affected. (AFP, BTA, bTV - 26/07/03; HINA, FENA, BBC - 25/07/03)

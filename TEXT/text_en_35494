SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament on Thursday (10 June) adopted an amendment to Macedonia's laws on family, incorporating the main stipulations of the European Convention on the Exercise of Children's Rights and the European Convention on the Adoption of Children. It also tightens measures against domestic violence and improves social protections for abused children. The amended law aims to harmonise domestic law with that of the EU. (A1 TV - 10/06/04)

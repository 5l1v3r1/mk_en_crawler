ATHENS, Greece -- Clashes broke out on Monday (December 29th) during a demonstration in Athens against Israel's military operation in Gaza, media reported. Police fired tear gas to keep protesters away from the Israeli embassy. More than 3,000 protesters waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israeli and anti-US slogans took part in the rally, organised by the Communist Party of Greece and Arab groups.
In other news Monday, Turkey announced it will no longer mediate between Israel and Syria, saying the Israeli attacks on Gaza have made peace "impossible". "Israel cannot speak of peace with Syria while engaging in war with Gaza," Foreign Minister Ali Babacan told reporters after a meeting with visiting Egyptian counterpart Ahmed Abul Gheit. Both ministers urged Israel to stop its offensive on the Gaza Strip.
The offensive prompted Murat Mercan, head of the foreign affairs committee in Turkey's parliament and a member of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), to resign Monday as a member of the Turkish-Israeli Inter-Parliamentary Friendship Group. Two other AKP deputies resigned from the group later in the day.
Meanwhile, Cyprus boosted security measures at embassies of Middle East countries because of the escalation of violence in Gaza. "We are ready to deal with any situation," Justice and Public Order Minister Loucas Louca said.

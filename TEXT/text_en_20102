ZAGREB, Croatia -- Rapid accession to the EU and NATO, reforms and the fight against corruption are the most important tasks facing Croatia, President Stipe Mesic said on Tuesday (January 15th) at his traditional Christmas and New Year's reception for members of the diplomatic corps. The president noted, however, that despite progress, Croatia still has much to achieve. His remarks coincided with the 16th anniversary of Croatia's international recognition as an independent country. On January 15th 1992, Croatia was recognised by 12 members of the European Community.

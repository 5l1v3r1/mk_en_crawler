SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EUFOR has decided to close the Bosnian Serb army's main underground facility, the nuclear-proof bunker at Veliki Zep, because it was visited by fugitive general Ratko Mladic during the past six months. EUFOR commander British General David Leakey, who took journalists to the site on Thursday (23 December), said his troops would monitor the bunker until it is decommissioned. The facility was dug deep into a mountain in the 1950s and renovated in the 1970s. It could accommodate up to 200 people for 15 days and was meant as a wartime command centre for the former Yugoslav Army. 
In other news, NATO troops announced Friday that they have arrested Dusan Bata Tesic on suspicion of aiding war crimes indictees. Tesic was a member of the Republika Srpska special police unit during the war. (AFP, BBC, HINA, Tanjug - 24/12/04; AP, AFP, BBC, SRNA - 23/12/04)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown will meet with newly-appointed BiH Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic on Wednesday (17 March). Two other nominees to the post were rejected for past activities.
On Tuesday, BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic rejected a proposal by the Council of Europe to establish a fund to pay out the savings of Bosnian and Croatian nationals who had deposited money in a Slovenian bank before the 1991-1995 conflict. BiH says it wants a group of experts to look into the matter. (OHR Sources, Oslobodjenje - 17/03/04; PBS BiH, AFP - 16/03/04)

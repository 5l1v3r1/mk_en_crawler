BELGRADE, Serbia -- Hague tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz met with President Boris Tadic and other Serbian officials on Thursday (September 11th) to discuss war crimes co-operation and the search for remaining fugitives. During talks with Brammertz, Tadic said Serbia's new government has demonstrated its commitment to co-operation and is well aware of its obligations to find and extradite the remaining indictees, Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic. On Wednesday, Brammertz had what he described as "very good and productive" conversations with the head of Serbia's national council for ties with the UN war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, and with war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic. Ljajic also discussed issues related to the transfer of documents from Serbia to The Hague, as well as witness protection. The government hopes for a positive report from Brammertz later this month, as full co-operation with The Hague tribunal is a key condition for continuing the country's European integration process.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government on Thursday (13 January) praised a parliamentary initiative calling for the government and lawmakers to issue a joint declaration on EU integration co-operation. Accession talks are to begin on 17 March. Prime Minister Ivo Sanader stressed that, given its importance, the document should be adopted by consensus among all parliamentary parties.
In other news, Parliament Speaker Vladimir Seks said in an interview published Friday in the Vjesnik daily that election laws should be amended before the local elections in May. Registration problems are a particular area of concern: during the recent presidential election, voter turnout exceeded the population in the municipalities of Knin and Dvor.

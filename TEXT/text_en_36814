BUCHAREST, Romania -- The ruling Social Democrat Party (PSD) has decided to postpone its planned reorganisation until February, according to Prime Minister Adrian Nastase, who is also PSD leader. The restructuring had been planned for next month. Nastase said Thursday (15 July) that the decision to postpone was unexpected but wise, allowing the party to concentrate on preparations for the upcoming elections, rather than waste time on internal wrangling over top positions.

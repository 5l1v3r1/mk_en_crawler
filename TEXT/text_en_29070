PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX has intensified an investigation into possible abuse of state funds in the ministry of education, science and technology. EULEX prosecutors have quietly visited the ministry for the past month over a suspected misuse of resources, local media reported on Monday (June 7th). Sources say some of Minister Enver Hoxhaj's most loyal advisers have resigned due to this investigation. Officials from the ministry neither denied nor confirmed the reports. The EU Rule of Law Mission has stepped up field work to gather evidence in government offices in order to fulfil its mandate to fight organised crime and corruption. In late April, EULEX raided the offices and the private property of Transport Minister Fatmir Limaj, who is suspected of abuse in relation to road construction contracts. 
A European diplomat accredited in Pristina, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed on Sunday that a long process of political consultations has led to a formula by which EULEX can start arresting officials this week. (Zeri, Kohavision, RTK, Telegrafi - 07/06/10)

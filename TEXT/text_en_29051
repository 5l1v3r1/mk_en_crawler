BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of Serbia's council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, criticised the tribunal's chief prosecutor, Serge Brammertz, on Thursday (October 7th) for exerting pressure on the country to arrest war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic. On Wednesday, Brammertz told the Dutch parliament that "conditioning and pressure" remain key to Mladic's arrest. Ljajic described Brammertz's comments as "undeserved political pressure" that is hampering Belgrade's EU bid. At the same time, he insisted that "our interest to see Mladic in The Hague is much bigger than [that] of the tribunal and the Dutch parliament." (AP, B92 - 07/10/10)

More than 63,000 people have been entirely isolated due to the unprecedented snowfall in Buzau and Vrancea counties in southeastern Romania. Most of the villages are buried under 5m-high snowdrifts after days of blizzards. Villagers must dig tunnels to leave their homes and feed their livestock. 
More than 80 county roads and five major railways are still blocked, according to the interior ministry. About 200 trains have been cancelled, according to the National Highways and Roads Company. 
Vrancea County Prefect Marian Oprisan declared a state of emergency, allowing local authorities to pull bigger resources to help citizens. 
The government began a nationwide campaign to collect food and other necessities for stranded residents. Military, firemen, gendarmes and, in some areas even convicts, are involved in emergency work. 
Prime Minister Mihai Razvan Ungureanu is visiting the isolated areas to supervise the situation on the ground, while President Traian Basescu is working to assure the country that there are enough energy supplies to prevent shortages. 
The storm has caused problems throughout the region. In Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), the military mobilised hundreds of soldiers to help its citizens cope with record snowfalls that have left many without electricity. The BiH Armed Forces have contributed 1,700 soldiers to fight the record storm. Officials in BiH, Serbia, Croatia and Montenegro are discussing co-ordinating relief efforts.

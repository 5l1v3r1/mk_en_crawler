SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The OSCE believes that BiH must downsize the number of soldiers in its armed forces by half, OSCE spokesperson Urdur Gunnarsdottir said Thursday (29 May). BiH can no longer afford to pay for large-scale armed forces, she added, since all budget funds earmarked for the military have been spent.According to an OSCE assessment, the country can afford to maintain a maximum of 9,500 soldiers. Currently the number of troops in the Federation of BiH is 12,000, while the force in Republika Srpska numbers 6,600. (OHR Sources - 30/05/03; PBS BiH - 29/05/03)

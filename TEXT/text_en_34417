TIRANA, Albania -- After several days of protests by local journalists, Prime Minister Fatos Nano on Friday (17 October) fired Interior Minister Luan Rama, who had physically assaulted the editor-in-chief of a local TV channel at a party. The assault was apparently in response to a report critical of the minister. Nano told reporters that he would nominate Construction Minister Fatmir Xhafa to take over the post. The ruling Socialist Party has also picked former Parliament Speaker Namik Dokle to replace Ilir Meta, who resigned as foreign minister in July. Parliament must approve the nominations.

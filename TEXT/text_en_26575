BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik told the Belgrade-based daily Vecernje Novosti on Sunday (January 10th) that he will organise a referendum in the entity during the first half of this year. He explained that the government would ask RS citizens two questions: "Do you support the Dayton Agreement, and do you oppose the High Representative [Valentin Inzko] imposing decisions?" Dodik stressed that the RS cabinet has started work on new legislation regarding referendums and will submit it to parliament later this month. He acknowledged that holding such a referendum could be the first step towards a much more important referendum on RS's status in BiH. (Vecernje Novosti, RTS, RTRS, Fena - 10/01/10)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President-elect Gjorge Ivanov said on Wednesday (April 15th) that Macedonia will hold a referendum on any name proposed to end the longstanding dispute with Greece. He was responding to Greek Ambassador to the United States Alexandros Mallias, who said on Monday that Athens believes the proposed name "Northern Republic of Macedonia" is completely acceptable. Ivanov says this is not a new proposal by UN mediator Matthew Nimetz but has been on the negotiating table for 15 years. "This is a geographical term... We have always been ready to make a compromise, but it should not hurt our state interests. This compromise and the proposal eventually will have to be approved by the citizens," Ivanov said. He assumes the presidency on May 12th. 
Meanwhile, Greek government spokesman Giorgos Koumoutsakos criticised Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki for warning Macedonian citizens not to travel to Greece. Speaking Wednesday, he accused Skopje of blocking bilateral relations and described Macedonian reports of recent incidents and disorder in Greece as total disinformation. "There is no such thing," Koumoutsakos told the private Macedonian TV channel A1. (Dnevnik, Utrinski Vesnik, Vecer - 16/04/09; MIA, A1 - 15/04/09)

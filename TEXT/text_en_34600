SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A spokesman for the office of Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in BiH, said on Thursday (28 August) that the country was heading for insolvency. "BiH began the year by spending almost four times as much as it earned," Kevin Sullivan said in comments regarding the first-quarter deficit of 910m euros. He warned that the country would go broke if economic reforms are not implemented soon, citing in particular efforts to speed up privatisation, reduce bureaucracy and fight corruption. BiH has received 5 billion euros since 1995 but has failed to make significant progress in revamping its economy and attracting foreign investment. An unemployment rate of more than 40 per cent and a foreign debt of more than 2 billion euros remain key challenges. (AFP, SRNA, BBC - 28/08/03)

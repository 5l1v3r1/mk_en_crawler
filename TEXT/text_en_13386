BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia will continue to co-operate with the UN war crime tribunal in The Hague until all obligations are met, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said Wednesday (21 September). But, he noted, the arrest and extradition of indictee Ratko Mladic is not a prerequisite for starting negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU. It would, however, affect the eventual signing of an SAA, he said.
The importance of war crimes co-operation was also stressed by Serbian President Boris Tadic, who said in an interview with CNN that Mladic is a big problem for Serbia, and his arrest is in the national interest. He underlined that the Serbian cabinet is not aware of Mladic's whereabouts, but is doing everything to locate him. Tadic delivered the same message in New York, during a meeting with EU security chief Javier Solana. (Politika - 22/09/05; B92, RTS, Tanjug, Beta - 21/09/05)

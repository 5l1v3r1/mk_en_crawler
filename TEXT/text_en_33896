SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Federation government adopted a bill to amend the entity's constitution on Tuesday (11 November). The government sent the draft to parliament, requesting quick approval. The process of constitutional amendments is moving parallel to similar procedures in the other BiH entity -- Republika Srpska. The changes support ongoing defence reforms aimed at eventual membership in the Partnership for Peace programme. (BHTV 1, BBC - 11/11/03)

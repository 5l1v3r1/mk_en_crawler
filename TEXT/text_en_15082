BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu took his opposition to a law on privileges for parliament members to the Constitutional Court on Tuesday (28 February). He is asking the court to review the law, which he says gives deputies better retirement benefits than the average citizen. In January, Basescu vetoed the law and returned it to parliament for revision. But in February the legislature approved it again without major changes. (Nine o'clock - 01/03/06)

TIRANA, Albania -- The foreign ministry issued a statement Thursday (August 28th) criticising Russia over its decision to recognise South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent countries. The statement also downplayed any parallels to Kosovo. It described Moscow's move as "unjustified, unacceptable and a violation of the international law and the UN resolutions".
In New York on Thursday, UN spokesperson Michele Montas said South Ossetia and Abkhazia are entirely different from Kosovo. "I think the two cases should not be compared, since they have different backgrounds," Montas said. (VOA, BBC, Alsat, BalkanWeb - 28/08/08)

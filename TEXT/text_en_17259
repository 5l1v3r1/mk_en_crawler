BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Serbian Supreme Court announced on Monday (December 25th) that it has upheld a 20-year prison sentence for Sasa Cvjetan, a former member of the Serbian police unit known as the Scorpions. He was convicted of war crimes committed during the 1999 Kosovo conflict. The Belgrade Municipal Court first sentenced him in February, after finding him guilty of the murders of 14 ethnic Albanian civilians, including women and children, in Podujevo on March 22nd, 1999. The Supreme Court rejected as ungrounded Cvjetan's appeal that the sentence was the result of international pressure. (Danas - 26/12/06; RTS, Tanjug - 25/12/06)

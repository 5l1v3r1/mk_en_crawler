ZAGREB, Croatia -- The governments of Croatia and Italy issued separate statements on Saturday (28 May) denying a report that fugitive war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina was detained in southern Italy early last week. Slovenia's POP TV carried the story alleging that the retired general had been arrested by special police near the southern Italian town of Castello di Cisterna. Following Zagreb's request for verification of the information, the Italian Foreign Ministry said the list of persons apprehended in Italy in the past few days did not include Gotovina. Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte is to visit Zagreb this week to discuss the ex-general, whose arrest is crucial to the launch of EU accession talks. 
In other news, Croatian President Stipe Mesic met with Hungarian counterpart Ferenc Madl in Zagreb on Friday. Madl voiced Hungary's full support for Croatia's accession bid. They also discussed a joint effort to host the 2012 European Soccer Championships. (Vecernji list, HRT - 29/05/05; HINA - 28/05/05; HRT, HINA - 27/05/05)

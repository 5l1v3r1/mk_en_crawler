PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A court in Pristina ordered on Friday (October 23rd) the release of 21 members of the Self-Determination (Vetevendosje) movement after almost two months in detention. The group was arrested because it damaged 28 EULEX vehicles amid protests in late August. All accused rejected the charges against them for damaging property. In previous demonstrations, Self-Determination activists also damaged UNMIK vehicles. (Radio 21, Makfax, RTS - 23/10/09)

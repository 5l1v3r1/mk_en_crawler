ZAGREB, Croatia -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte said Tuesday (21 October) that the indictment against fugitive Croatian General Ante Gotovina should be amended and broadened. She told the Croatian news agency HINA that the need for amending the indictment emerged after it was determined that two of the alleged war crimes victims were in fact alive. Their names would be removed from the current indictment but replaced with new ones whose identities were subsequently established. Gotovina disappeared after The Hague court tribunal officially indicted him in June 2001. (MediaScan - 22/10/03; HINA, BBC - 21/10/03)

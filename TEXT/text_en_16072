WASHINGTON, United States -- Kosovo opposition leader Hashim Thaci, who is also a member of Pristina's negotiation team in the UN-mediated status talks, has been holding talks in Washington this week. He told Kosovo's Radio Television 21 on Thursday (November 16th) that he had met with US Undersecretary for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns, Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo, and others. Thaci says he was assured that the decision on the province's final status would not face further delays. In turn, he reiterated Pristina's demand for independence from Serbia.

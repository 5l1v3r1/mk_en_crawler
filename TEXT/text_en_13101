SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The head of the army's general staff, General Nikola Kolev, warned on Sunday (30 October) that the situation facing the army might turn critical next year due to budget restrictions. Speaking on national radio, Kolev said if funding for the military falls below the limit of 2.6 per cent of GDP, implementation of the army's obligations towards NATO might be in jeopardy.

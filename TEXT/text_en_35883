BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Democratic Party of the late Zoran Djindjic said Wednesday (21 January) that it is not prepared to support a cabinet formed by three other reformist parties. Boris Tadic, a senior Democratic Party official, told reporters that his party wants to participate in a new government together with Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), G-17 Plus, and the Serbian Renewal Movement-New Serbia. Together, these four parties would have 146 seats in the 250-seat Serbian parliament. But DSS official Dragan Marsicanin called the move "irresponsible", arguing that it would lead to new elections. The EU announced Wednesday that it would postpone political dialogue with Belgrade, as no new government has been formed. Talks were to start next week in Brussels.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The EU and Montenegro signed a bilateral agreement Tuesday (April 15th) that will allow Montenegro to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO), making the EU the first WTO member to conclude these bilateral negotiations. Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn described it as "more good news, showing the progress Montenegro is making on its EU road". 
Deputy Prime Minister Gordana Djurovic signed the agreement, saying Podgorica plans to step up efforts to complete bilateral talks with other members in hopes of joining the WTO before the end of the year. (RTCG, Reuters, AP, AFP - 15/04/08)

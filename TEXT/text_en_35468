THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte expressed confidence that former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic would be arrested by the end of the month. "We have good reasons to believe that Radovan Karadzic will be extradited by 29 June," said the prosecutor, without elaborating. Karadzic and his military commander, Ratko Mladic, have been on the run since 1996. Republika Srpska, where Karadzic is believed to be hiding, faces mounting international pressure due to poor war crimes co-operation. The same is true of Serbia-Montenegro. According to the tribunal, Mladic is in Serbia, and del Ponte is threatening to lodge a complaint with the UN Security Council against Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica for failure to co-operate.

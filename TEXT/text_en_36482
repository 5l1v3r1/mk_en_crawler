VIENNA, Austria -- OSCE's chairman-in-office, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy, has called for transforming the 54-member international organisation in order to meet changed political realities. According to a OSCE press release published Monday (9 August), Passy called for better thematic and geographical balance within OSCE, saying that existing efforts in that direction had already resulted in improved ability to oppose terrorism and strengthen border security. Passy also urged a more active role within OSCE for the Commonwealth of Independent States. (OSCE Web site, Info Radio - 09/08/04)

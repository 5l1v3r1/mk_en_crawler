PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The EULEX judicial and police mission will not be included under the UN's umbrella, rather, will be exclusively under the EU's mandate, says mission chief Yves de Kermabon. During a visit to Klina on Sunday (May 18th), where he attended the launch of the Road Show campaign with the motto "Come to Europe", de Kermabon acknowledged issues have arisen. "The delays have political reasons, but there are also technical obstacles." Serbia opposes the arrival of the EULEX without authorisation by the UN Security Council. De Kermabon says the mission already has a 250-member staff on the ground and has the full support of the EU's 27 member states. (Koha Ditore, Express, Zeri - 19/05/08)

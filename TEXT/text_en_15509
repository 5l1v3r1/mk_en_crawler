LONDON, United Kingdom -- A prestigious British think tank said on Tuesday (25 April) that the British economy would benefit from the influx of guest workers from Bulgaria and Romania when the two countries join the EU. According to the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), some 56,000 workers will seek jobs in the United Kingdom -- 15,000 from Bulgaria and 41,000 from Romania. The estimate was based on figures collected after May 2004 when ten East European nations joined the EU. Britain was one of the few European countries to open up its labour market to those from the newly admitted states. "Romanian and Bulgarian accession should be seen as an opportunity not a threat," said IPPR associate director Danny Sriskandarajah. (Reuters - 25/04/06)

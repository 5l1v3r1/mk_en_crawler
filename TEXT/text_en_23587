TIRANA, Albania -- The EU is postponing its evaluation of Albania's application for candidate status due to the prolonged election process in the country, local media reported on Monday (July 27th). Voters went to the polls a month ago, but the final results are still pending, due to challenges raised by opposition parties. EU foreign ministers have promised to consider Albania's application after the election process is complete. "We continue to welcome the European perspective of the Western Balkans," said Swedish EU Affairs Minister Cecilia Malmstrom, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha urged the opposition on Monday to recognise the results tabulated by the Central Election Commission. All parties have until the end of this week to register final appeals before the results are declared official. (Shekulli, BBC, Top News, Ora News, Telegrafi - 27/07/09)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Economy Minister Adrian Videanu announced on Friday (February 19th) that Russian gas giant Gazprom has officially invited Romania to join the South Stream gas pipeline project. "We will analyse this initiative with interest," Videanu said, adding that Romania is open to any initiative that would contribute to the energy security of both Romania and the EU. At the same time, he said that Nabucco, a 3,300km pipeline designed to carry Caspian gas to Europe via Turkey and the Balkans in order to limit the EU's dependence on Russian gas, remains a priority for Romania. He added that the Russians have assured him that South Stream poses no competition to Nabucco. (Mediafax, Dow Jones - 19/02/10)

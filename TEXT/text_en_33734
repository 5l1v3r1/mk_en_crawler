LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel said on Monday (1 September) that his country would reconsider its support for Croatia's accession to the EU if Zagreb goes ahead with plans to proclaim an exclusive economic zone in the Adriatic. The move would leave Slovenia without direct access to international shipping waters. The Croatian Parliament rejected a 2001 agreement between the two countries on this issue. Croatian Foreign Minister Tonino Picula told the media on Sunday that the agreement is now dead and that Slovenia must accept this fact. The row deepened further on Sunday when Slovenia recalled its ambassador to Zagreb, Peter Bekes. Croatian media reports that delegations will meet on 16 September to discuss the issue.

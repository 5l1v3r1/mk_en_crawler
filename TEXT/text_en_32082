SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR announced Monday (18 November) that its troops detained a Muslim man for spying on the peacekeepers' installations. Officials say Sabahudin Fijuljanin has been the focus of an investigation since 26 October and has admitted to conducting surveillance on a US base several times. A search of his home allegedly uncovered an anti-tank weapon. He will be held in custody for the duration of the investigation. Fijuljanin was found to be in possession of several passports. He came from the Yugoslav province of Sanzak, but moved to BiH and married. (AP - 18/11/02)

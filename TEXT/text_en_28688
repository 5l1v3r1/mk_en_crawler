BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Parliament (EP) Rapporteur for Macedonia Zoran Thaler and nine other members of the EP are urging the EU to start accession talks with Macedonia without delay, Macedonian media reported on Sunday (June 13th). In a letter to the European Council, EU foreign ministers and EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, they warned that postponing a decision on Skopje's EU bid could threaten stability in the Balkans and could undermine the bloc's credibility. They voiced confidence that starting talks with Macedonia will boost investor confidence both there and in the region. (A1, Makfax, MIA, Alsat M - 13/06/10)

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- UN prosecutors moved Wednesday (25 February) to rest their case against former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, two days ahead of schedule. A spokeswoman for the prosecution said the decision was made to avoid further delays in a trial that has already lasted more than two years. Prosecutors had two more trial sessions to wrap up their case. Milosevic has been ill for the past two weeks, causing the cancellation of at least six hearings. He will now get three months to prepare his defence. (Reuters, AFP, AP - 25/02/04)

ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou failed to convince the leaders of the opposition Friday (May 27th) to support his government's austerity measures necessary to help the country overcome its financial crisis. Brussels has urged consensus among all political forces on the mid-term budget programme, which envisions cutting public costs by 14 billion euros and increasing tax revenues by 9 billion euros by 2015. It also includes a privatisation plan expected to bring revenues of around 50 billion euros. Friday's meeting was called by President Karolos Papoulias in an effort to find consensus, but the four-hour discussions ended without any result. The conservative New Democracy party has rejected the measures. After the talks, the EU warned Athens that "it is running out of time" to adopt the new austerity programme.

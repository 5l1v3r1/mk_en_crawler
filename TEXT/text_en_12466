SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Following earlier approval by the BiH Parliament's House of Representatives, the House of Peoples endorsed on Monday (9 May) the appointment of Ivo Miro Jovic as the new Croat member of the BiH presidency. Jovic was nominated by the Croatian Democratic Union after High Representative Paddy Ashdown sacked Dragan Cavic, who faces an embezzlement trial.
In other news Monday, Republika Srpska Interior Minister Darko Matijasevic said the constitutions of BiH and the two entities -- RS and the Federation of BiH -- pose no obstacle to security reform in the country. Matijasevic spoke to reporters after the commission for mapping new police regions in BiH held its first session in Sarajevo. Police restructuring is crucial to a positive EU feasibility study for BiH. (PBS BiH, NTV Hayat, RTRS - 09/05/05)

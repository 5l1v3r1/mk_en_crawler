SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The European Commission (EC) is losing patience waiting for BiH to adopt a required law on the public broadcasting service, European Commission (EC) director for Western Balkans Reinhardt Priebe warned on Thursday (26 January). Following the inaugural meeting of the Reform Process Monitoring group, which will track the implementation of reforms and co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, Priebe said the EC wants to avoid having to suspend negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement due to a lack of progress in reforms.
Separately Thursday, the BiH Council of Ministers decided that the permanent location of the State Investigation and Protection Agency would be in the municipality of Lukavica in eastern Sarajevo. Last week, High Representative Paddy Ashdown warned the agency's efficiency might be jeopardised unless the site was chosen quickly.

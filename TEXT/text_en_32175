ZAGREB, Croatia -- Public protests have prompted the government to delay plans to raise electricity prices for households by 9 per cent as of the beginning of October. Customers say they are already contending with hikes, after a new pricing scheme was introduced last month. Labour unions welcomed the delay, as they oppose any increase in prices. Kresimir Sever, president of the Independent Croatian Unions, is urging the cabinet to scrap the new pricing system altogether. But the cabinet is under strong pressure from international financial institutions, including the IMF, to raise prices to eliminate state intervention in the energy sector and gradually liberalise it.

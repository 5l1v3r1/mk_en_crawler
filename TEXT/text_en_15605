ANKARA, Turkey -- Prosecutors have opened an investigation into allegations that a Turkish soccer club rigged a game to avoid relegations. Selami Hatipoglu, the chief prosecutor of Denizli, said on Saturday (22 July) that he was checking into findings by the Hurriyet newspaper that Denizlispor paid 100,000 euros each to three Malatyaspor players to sabotage their team's efforts. Malatyaspor lost its last match of the season, thus allowing Denizlispor to remain in Turkey's premier league. Sports Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin said these and other allegations have prompted him to seek the setting up of sports tribunals like the ones in Italy. (AP - 21/07/06)

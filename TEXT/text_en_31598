ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government plans to file an application to start EU accession talks on 25 February, according to the <I>Vjesnik</I> daily. The report Friday (17 January) cited diplomatic sources who maintain that the date is 99 per cent certain. The government also reportedly hopes to speed up the accession process during Greece's presidency of the EU, which ends in June. The report said full Union membership would occur in 2008 at the earliest, adding that government plans to catch up with Bulgaria and Romania's entries in 2007 are unrealistic.

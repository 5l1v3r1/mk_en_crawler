ISTANBUL, Turkey -- An earthquake rocked northeastern Turkey early Friday (2 July), killing 18 people and injuring 50. Local authorities say 20 people are in serious condition. Rescuers did not expect the death toll to rise, as most people were at their vacation homes when the quake struck near the Iranian border. It measured 5.2 on the Richter scale.
Meanwhile, at least five people -- most of them passersby -- were killed in Van province when a bomb went off in an apparent attempt to kill the local governor. Hikmet Tan was travelling to his office when the attack took place. He was not injured. Kurdish Workers Party militants are suspected of mounting the attack.
In other news, Hansjorg Kretschmer, the European Commission representative in Turkey, said in an interview that he expects the EC to issue a positive report on Ankara's reforms. Leaders of the EU countries will take this report into account later this year when they decide whether Turkey should be allowed to start accession talks in early 2005. Kretschmer encouraged Ankara to do more to implement reforms in the coming months, saying, "We will probably in October still have a situation where the glass is not entirely full, but of course it's far from empty."

ATHENS, Greece -- In a statement released on Monday (7 February), the IMF has urged Greece to rebalance its public finances and to rapidly cut public spending. The IMF board said it doubts that Greece would fulfil its plans for budget deficit cuts because they are based on overly optimistic economic growth forecasts. The government plans to bring the deficit down to 2.8 per cent from its current level of around 5.3 per cent of GDP.
Meanwhile, the European Commission is suing Greece over its failure to protect a rare species of turtle on the Ionian island of Zakynthos. According to the EU, tourists are destroying the turtles' eggs on the beaches or are forcing the animals to lay them in the sea where they cannot hatch. (ANA - 08/02/05; AFX, AFP, UPI - 07/02/05)

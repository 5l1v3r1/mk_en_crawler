TIRANA, Albania -- An OSCE expert team led by the former chairman of the ODIHR mission to Albania, Nikolai Vulchanov, is visiting Tirana to become familiar with the election reform process and with preparations for parliamentary elections scheduled for later this year. The OSCE team met at the weekend with representatives of the major parties in parliament and discussed the new electoral code, said Jemin Gjana of the main opposition Democratic Party (DP). Gjana conceded, however, that the DP and the ruling Socialist Party remain unable to reach a compromise on the new map of election zones. (Albanian News - 01/02/05)

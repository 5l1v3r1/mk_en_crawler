TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi urged authorities on Thursday (August 27th) to work harder to strengthen the rule of law in the country. "Albania has made political progress. We are a NATO member and soon we will be a member of the EU, but there is a lot to be done to strengthen the rule of law in service to the citizens," Topi said in Shkodra, where he was invited to dinner by the Imam to mark the month of Ramadan. He praised work by the police, but said more attention should be paid to the poor. (Top Channel, Balkan Web, News 24 - 27/08/09)

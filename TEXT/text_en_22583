ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey needs revisions to its constitution and parliament, Parliament Speaker Koksal Toptan told a press conference on Saturday (June 7th). "The Constitutional Court has exceeded its power by cancelling an amendment, proposed by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), which was approved by the parliament in February," Toptan said referring to the courtâs upholding of the headscarf ban on Thursday. He suggested a bicameral parliament, which existed from 1961 to 1982, to reduce the burden on the Constitutional Court. 
Meanwhile, Deniz Baykal, leader of the main opposition People's Republican Party (CHP), said that a constitutional change would be the worst possible thing Turkey could do at the moment. (Hurriyet, Radikal - 08/06/08; AFP, AP - 07/06/08)

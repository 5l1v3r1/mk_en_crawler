THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Hearings in former Bosnian Serb senior official Momcilo Krajisnik's appeal of his 27-year prison sentence begin on Monday (November 3rd) at The Hague war-crime tribunal. Krajisnik received the sentence in September 2006 for his alleged involvement in an "ethnic cleansing" campaign that killed an estimated 100,000 Bosnian Muslims and Croats and banished 2.2 million from their homes in Bosnia during the 1992-1995 conflict. According to Krajisnik's lawyers, former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who himself faces war-crime charges, will testify in the proceedings Wednesday. The defence claims that at the time in question, Krajisnik worked under Karadzic's orders as his "very own private prime minister". Krajisnik "would like Mr Karadzic to testify that ... Mr Krajisnik's role was a political one, as a spokesperson and a negotiator, with no role in directing the military," the defence said. (AFP, Netpress - 03/11/08)

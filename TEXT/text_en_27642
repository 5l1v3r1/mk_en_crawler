NEW YORK, United States -- Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov told the UN General Assembly on Friday (September 24th) that he hopes his country will soon be able to reach an agreement in its long-standing name dispute with Greece. "I hope that, as two neighbouring countries that have lived and will live with one another, we will be able to find a mutually acceptable solution," Ivanov told participants in the 65th session of the assembly. He also reiterated Skopje's readiness to start EU and NATO accession talks. 
"My country is still waiting in front of the doors of these two organisations due to the acts of our southern neighbour, which are contrary to the obligations undertaken by the 1995 Interim Agreement," Ivanov said. (UN News Centre, MIA, Makfax - 24/09/10)

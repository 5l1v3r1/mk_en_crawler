BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The advocate general of the European Court of Justice announced Tuesday (10 May) that in his opinion the name of feta cheese is a typical Greek name and deserves legal protection. Germany and Denmark are suing the EU over the right to use the name of the popular white cheese, arguing that the name is associated with a process rather than with Greece as a country of origin. The dispute over feta has been raging for nearly 16 years. The full court will announced its ruling on the case within several months. 
In other news, anarchists went on a rampage in Athens on Wednesday before seeking shelter in a university campus. They trapped a few dozen people inside the campus for six hours before police allowed them to leave without making any arrests. Two people were injured. According to Greek law, police can only enter schools with permission. (AP, ANA, CNN - 11/05/05; AP, Reuters - 10/05/05)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in BiH, told Bosnian Serb authorities on Wednesday (15 October) that they have six months to reveal the whole truth about the Srebrenica massacre. He objected to two reports issued earlier this year that downplayed the gravity of Europe's worst atrocity since the end of World War II. Ashdown instructed the Bosnian Serb president to form a special commission to determine the fate of more than 3,000 Muslims who went missing in Srebrenica in 1995. The bodies of more than 5,000 victims have already been recovered from mass graves. (Reuters, AP, AFP - 15/10/03)

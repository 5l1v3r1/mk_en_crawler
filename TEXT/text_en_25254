PRISTINA, Kosovo -- About 30 citizens of Roma origin were repatriated to Kosovo on Monday (September 28th) according to an agreement struck between the government and EU member states. Interior Ministry officials say the first planeload from Germany has arrived at the Pristina Airport. The repatriated were of different ethnicity, but most of them are members of the Roma minority, who had failed to obtain residency in Germany. About 5,000 Romas will be repatriated to Kosovo by the end of the year, with 12,000 expected in two years. (Klan Kosova, RFE, Shekulli, VoA - 28/09/09)

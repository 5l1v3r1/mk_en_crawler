SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Authorities announced on Wednesday (3 September) that they are lifting the siege of two villages north of the capital. Vaksince and Lojane were sealed off while the army and police combed the area looking for a group of Albanian National Army fighters and their commander, Avdil Jakupi. Many residents who had left the village earlier in the week are now returning to their homes. Western officials sided with the Macedonian government in its efforts to uproot the extremist group. Parliament Speaker Nikola Popovski plans to convene a special session on the security situation next week, at the request of the country's main opposition party, VMRO-DPMNE.

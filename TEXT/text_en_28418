ATHENS, Greece -- The finance ministry announced on Wednesday (May 12th) that Greece received 5.5 billion euros from the IMF as part of the international aid to help the country overcome its financial crisis. The money will be used to repay part of the country's huge debt. 
In other news, Greece's two main labour unions issued a joint statement Wednesday announcing plans for a general strike on May 20th, to protest sweeping austerity measures. It will affect air, sea and rail service, hospitals, schools and other public services. The unions insist the burden of the austerity measures falls squarely on the shoulders of the poor.

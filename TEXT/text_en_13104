SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Environment and Urban Planning Minister Zoran Sapuric says the government estimates 1.5 billion euros in investments are needed to meet EU environment standards. In an interview with the Macedonian Information Agency on Tuesday (27 December), Sapuric said that earning EU candidate status means Macedonia must step up efforts in this area, with the hardest work expected in 2008, ahead of deadlines in 2009.

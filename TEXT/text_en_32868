ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian Mine Action Centre (HCR) reported Sunday (1 December) that 43 square kilometres were cleared of mines in the first 10 months of this year. That is more than three times the area compared to last year. Despite donations from abroad and transfers from the state budget, HCR worries about funding. At the current pace, it projects the process will be completed in 2010. (HINA - 01/12/02)

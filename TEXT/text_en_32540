ANKARA, Turkey -- The US financial aid package for Turkey will include $6 billion in grants -- $2 billion for military purposes -- according to Economy Minister Ali Babacan, who spoke Sunday (9 March) on NTV. The figures have been mentioned before, but this marked the first time they were officially announced. Babacan added that Turkey would be free to decide to exchange a portion of the grants for credit, with a below-market interest rate. The military aid portion of the grants would be kept in US accounts to cover expenses associated with the purchase of military equipment. (NTV, Anadolu Agency - 09/03/03)

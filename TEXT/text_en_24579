PRISTINA, Kosovo -- More than a thousand officials of the new EU-led mission in Kosovo, EULEX, took over responsibilities from UNMIK early on Tuesday (December 9th). Spokesman Victor Reuter says about 1,400 members of the mission are spreading throughout the province, and in a few months, when the mission becomes fully operational, it will include 1,900 international and 1,100 local staff. About 100 members of EULEX will deploy immediately in the Serb-dominated north. EU foreign ministers expressed support for the mission during a meeting Monday in Brussels.
Separately, in an interview with Koha Ditore on Tuesday, Frank Wisner, former US mediator in talks on the Kosovo status issue between Belgrade and Pristina, said he is happy with developments since Kosovo's declaration of independence in February. He welcomed the government's largely positive approach towards deploying EULEX, adding the mission will preserve Kosovo's unity. (Koha Ditore, Express, Telegrafi, Lajm, B92, AFP - 09/12/08)

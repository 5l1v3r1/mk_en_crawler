BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The spokesperson for the European Commission told reporters Monday (30 May) that the integration of Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Turkey would proceed as planned, despite the French veto of the new European constitution. Francoise Le Bail said the decision regarding these countries has been made by EU leaders and the accessions would be subject solely to their ability to meet the required criteria. Many international media reports, however, have suggested the possibility of a slowdown in the accession process, as the EU becomes more preoccupied with its future. In Croatia, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said he was not discouraged by Sunday's referendum in France, as he did not expect it to affect his country's membership bid.

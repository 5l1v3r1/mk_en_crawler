ZAGREB, Croatia -- A UN official expressed concern on Thursday (June 12th) over the slowness of the procedure for returning Serb refuges to Croatia. Erika Elizabeth Feller, assistant UN high commissioner for refugees, complained to Croatian President Stjepan Mesic, "No solution has been found for some 80,000 refugees as yet." Mesic confirmed his commitment to the Sarajevo declaration of January 2005, aimed to resolve the Serb refugee problem in BiH, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro.

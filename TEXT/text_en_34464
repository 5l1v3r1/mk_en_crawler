BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Parliament Speaker and interim President Natasa Micic said Sunday (12 October) that if she does not survive Tuesday's no-confidence vote, a constitutional crisis might emerge. If she steps down before a new speaker is elected, the deputy parliament speaker would fill her post. By law, however, a deputy parliament speaker cannot also act as an interim president, a position Micic has held for months. "This would pose a big problem for the functioning of parliament, since there won't be anyone to confirm, in other words to sign, the laws that parliament adopts," she said.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish police on Saturday (January 10th) arrested two more army colonels and two lieutenants as part of a crackdown on the shadowy group Ergenekon, which was allegedly plotting a coup d'etat. On Wednesday, police detained 40 people in a large anti-Ergenekon operation. Investigators also discovered a cache of grenades and ammunition linked to the Ergenekon group outside Ankara, local media reported Saturday. A total of 86 alleged Ergenekon members are currently on trial.
In other news, a Turkish prosecutor on Friday began investigating an internet petition to apologise for the killing of 1.5m Armenian civilians by Ottoman Turks in 1915-1917, which Armenia calls genocide. The probe followed a complaint filed by several Ankara residents against the petition organisers and signatories. The prosecutor is probing whether the petitioners violated Article 301, which criminalises "insulting the Turkish nation".

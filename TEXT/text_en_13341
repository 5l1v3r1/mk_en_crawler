TIRANA, Albania -- The head of the OSCE Presence in Albania, Czech Ambassador Pavel Vacek, says the current electoral process -- although better than previous ones -- fell short of expectations. Speaking to the Tirana daily Gazeta Shqiptare on Friday (26 August), Vacek noted partisanship prevailed over impartiality among some in the regional election commissions, and there were attempts to artificially delay completion of the election procedures through protracted complaints and appeals. On the positive side, he noted the active participation of voters in the 3 July elections, many domestic observers monitored the vote, and most institutions engaged in the electoral process -- including the police -- did their jobs well.

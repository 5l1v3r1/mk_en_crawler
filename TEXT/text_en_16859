SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgarian Energy Minister Rumen Ovcharov and Greek Development Minister Dimitris Sioufas met in Sofia on Friday (November 3rd) to discuss the Bourgas-Alexandroupolis regional pipeline project. They agreed that their countries should soon submit proposals for an accord with Russia, enabling trilateral talks on the project to be finished by year's end. The ministers' meeting came after Moscow again delayed its proposal for the draft accord. The Bourgas-Alexandroupolis pipeline would provide Bulgaria and Greece with Russian crude oil through the Black Sea, and eventually allow further exports to Southern Europe. 
Separately, Ovcharov met on Friday with Turkish counterpart Hilmi Guler. Ovcharov reiterated Bulgaria's desire to be linked to a strategic natural gas pipeline that would carry gas from Azerbaijan to Greece and Italy via Turkey. (Monitor - 04/11/06; Mediapool, Darik - 03/11/06)

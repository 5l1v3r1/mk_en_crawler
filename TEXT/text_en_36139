BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Economy Minister Dragan Marsicanin said Sunday (14 March) that privatisation would continue in full swing, though cases that violated the law would be revised. He said Serbia would strive to have a restitution law in place by autumn, adding that the new government wants to see nationalised property returned to its owners. (B92, Tanjug - 14/03/04)

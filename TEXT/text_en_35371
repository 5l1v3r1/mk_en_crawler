BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government on Monday (19 April) approved 48.2m euros in financing for the construction of a bridge over the Danube, linking the Romanian town of Calafat with Bulgaria's Vidin. The total cost of the project is expected to range from 190m euros to 240m euros. Bulgaria will provide 186m euros. Approval of the financing by the Romanian government is considered an important step for the much-delayed project. (Rompres, Nine O'Clock - 19/04/04)

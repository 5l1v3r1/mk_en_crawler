TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi said on Friday (December 31st) that 2010 will be remembered in Albania's history as the year in which its people saw their dream of free movement come true. "The removal of visas will be written in golden letters in our history," Topi said in his New Year address to the nation. At the same time, he urged politicians to overcome the political stalemate and work more constructively for the country. "Let [2011] be a year of integration with the European family," Topi said.

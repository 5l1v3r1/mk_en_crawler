LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Parliament approved a declaration Thursday (July 15th) on the Western Balkans, describing the region as a key priority and establishing guidelines for future actions aimed at strengthening co-operation. State Secretary at the Foreign Ministry Dragoljuba Bencina explained that the document, which reiterates Slovenia's support for the Euro-Atlantic integration of all countries in the region, provides a framework of sorts. Based on a government decision last week, a special commission on the Western Balkans will be established, tasked with working out an action plan for activities in the region. A national co-ordinator for the Western Balkans, who will monitor Slovenia's activities in Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania and Kosovo, will also be named.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Serbian Helsinki Committee (SHC) is calling on Kosovo Serbs to turn out in massive numbers during the December 12th snap elections. Speaking at the Media Centre in Cagllavica on Thursday (December 2nd), SHC representatives said times have changed and Kosovo Serbs no longer need to rely on directives from Belgrade; rather, they can act in their own political and vital interests. "Experiences during the 1990s in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo show that Serbs do not agree with Belgrade directives, because they have always resulted in short-term benefits and enormous damages," said Ivan Kuzmanovic, of the SHC. The international community in Pristina is urging Serbs to participate in the snap elections but parallel structures in the north object to the idea, favouring strong ties with Belgrade instead.

ATHENS, Greece -- The IMF plans to send a group of experts to Greece next week to discuss the terms of a possible year-long aid package for the country. IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn confirmed Thursday (April 15th) that the team will arrive in Athens on Monday. European Commission (EC) financial experts are also arriving in Athens on Monday. Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou has asked the EC, the European Central Bank and the IMF to start discussions on a "multi-programme of economic policies", though Athens has not decided yet whether it will seek such aid.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The IMF confirmed on Thursday (August 13th) that its mission will arrive in Serbia on August 24th for a first review, under a 2.92 billion-euro stand-by arrangement. The mission will spend 11 days in the country. The IMF approved the loan in May and Belgrade has already drawn the first instalment, worth 788m euros. The main condition for the loan is keeping the budget government deficit at 3% of GDP. Serbia has already revised its 2009 budget once, implementing some minor tax changes and cutting state spending by 10%. Earlier, Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic said the cabinet would ask the IMF to allow Serbia's budget deficit to reach 4.5%. (Beta, Blic, B92, Tanjug - 13/08/09)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Parliament's House of Representatives was due to resume debate Wednesday (26 April) on a series of proposed changes to the constitution, following often-heated discussions Tuesday. Local media reports suggest that despite the agreement reached among the main political parties, the reforms may not have enough support to pass with the required majority. A spate of meetings was held Tuesday night to muster support. (Pincom.info, Vecernji list, Nezavisne novine - 26/04/06)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU leaders are expected to suspend the Union's further enlargement until they have resolved the current institutional crisis, following passage of a resolution on Wednesday (December 13th). The resolution, passed by the European Parliament (EP), calls for reforms to allow the EU "to function in a more efficient, transparent and democratic manner". Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told EP members that the EU should complete the institutional changes by 2009, which means that Croatia, next in line for membership, would probably join the EU no earlier than 2010. 
In other news Wednesday, the first Montenegro-EU interparliamentary meeting was held in Strasbourg. The session marked the launch of regular co-operation between the Montenegrin legislature and the EP, aimed at further integrating Montenegro into the European family of nations.

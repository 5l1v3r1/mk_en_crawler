SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serbs gathered on Monday (July 12th) at the Bratunac Military Cemetery to honour Serbs killed during the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH. Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik laid a wreath in memory of those killed by Muslim forces. On July 12th 1992, Bosnian Muslims led by Naser Oric attacked the Serb villages of Zalazje, Biljaca, Sase and Zagone, killing 69 civilians and wounding more than 70 others. Estimates of Serb casualties during the conflict vary, ranging from the hundreds to the thousands. The ceremony in Bratunac took place a day after a ceremony in Potocari marking the 15th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre. (RTRS, Tanjug, RTS, AP - 12/07/10)

WASHINGTON, United States -- Central and Eastern European countries show the biggest drop in press freedom worldwide, the US-based watchdog Freedom House said in a report published on Friday (May 1st). Its 2009 Freedom of the Press Index, released ahead of World Press Freedom Day on Monday (May 3rd), singled out Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria and Croatia as "partly free" countries with rising negative trends, including murders and intimidation of journalists.

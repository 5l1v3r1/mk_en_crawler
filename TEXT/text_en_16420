ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Zagreb County Court rejected on Wednesday (October 11th) a third request from prosecutors for the detention of former parliament member Branimir Glavas, who is charged with war crimes committed against Serb civilians in Osijek in 1991. Prosecutors want Glavas placed in custody, accusing him of trying to exert pressure on witnesses. But Investigative Judge Zdenko Posavec turned down the request, citing insufficient evidence. The investigation against Glavas, a former senior official of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union and now an independent deputy, was launched in June, after fellow parliament members agreed to lift his immunity.

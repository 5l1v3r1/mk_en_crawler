BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Croatian Foreign Affairs and European Integration Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic expressed confidence Thursday (October 5th) that her country will become the 28th member of the EU by the end of this decade. Addressing the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, she said Croatia would meet all membership criteria and implement the reforms needed to join the Union in 2010.

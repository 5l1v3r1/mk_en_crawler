ATHENS, Greece -- Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis on Monday (January 12th) condemned recent incidents involving Turkish warplanes violating Greece's airspace and warned of stagnating relations with Ankara. "Attempts to improve our relations have stalled, and we will strive to improve this in 2009," Bakoyannis told reporters after an extraordinary meeting of the Council on Foreign Affairs and Defence. Athens has accused Turkey of repeatedly violating its airspace in recent weeks. Bakoyannis criticised Turkey's behaviour as "unacceptable" and warned it harms efforts to improve bilateral relations.

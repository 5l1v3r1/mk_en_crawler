ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police have arrested two people suspected of forging a passport for retired General Ante Gotovina, who is wanted by the UN war crimes tribunal, the interior ministry announced Friday (29 April). During a search of the suspects' flats, police say they discovered a large number of Croatian ID cards, passports, firearms and ammunition. Police say two other people, who allegedly ordered a forged passport for Gotovina, were also detained and charged with aiding and abetting forgery perpetrators. Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said the police operation was the result of a six-point action plan the government implemented to arrest Gotovina, in a bid to start EU accession talks.
Also Friday, Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said Croatian leaders finally understand that there is no shortcut to the EU and that war crimes co-operation is a clear condition. Brussels would not be able to make a decision on Croatia's EU integration until co-operation reaches the desired level, he added. HINA reported his comments, made during an interview with Deutsche Welle. (Vecernji List - 30/04/05; HINA - 29/04/05)

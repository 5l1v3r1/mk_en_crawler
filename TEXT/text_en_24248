BELGRADE, Serbia -- The country wants to build a common future with its neighbours, Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac said on Sunday (April 12th) during a ceremony marking the 64th anniversary of the World War II battle of Srem. "Democratic Serbia wants to build a common future with its neighbours and with the European family based on equality, because this is the only way to contribute to the common well-being of its citizens," Sutanovac said. He added that the anniversary provided a good opportunity to call for peace and understanding among people, states and religions. An estimated 250,000 troops fought on the Srem front between October 1944 and April 1945. 
In other news Sunday, Rasim Ljajic, head of the national council for co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal, said Belgrade will fulfil its obligations by the end of this year by handing over the two remaining fugitives -- Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic. He told Radio Free Europe "I cannot believe that so much effort, work and engagement by services will not finally result in locating Mladic and Hadzic and extraditing them to The Hague." He added, "It is in our interest that it is finalised." (Beta, B92, MIA, Tanjug - 12/04/09)

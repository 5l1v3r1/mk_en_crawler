BUCHAREST, Romania -- The permanent bureaus of parliament's two chambers will decide on Monday (October 26th) the schedule of hearings regarding the new cabinet proposed by Prime Minister-designate Lucian Croitoru. The process is twofold. First, they will receive a vote in the committees, after which the full parliament will decide on the new cabinet. This must take place by November 7th. Croitoru has the support of only the Liberal Democratic Party (PDL), as all parties and minority representatives continue to support Klaus Johannis for the job. Croitoru announced the members of his cabinet Friday afternoon. They are a mixture of PDL members and technocrats. (Hotnews.ro, Mediafax, Romania Libera - 26/10/09)

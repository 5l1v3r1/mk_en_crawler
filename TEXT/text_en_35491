BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Kosovo ombudsman Marek Antoni Nowicki expressed concerns over a recent decision to remove KFOR checkpoints in Velika Hoca, Banjska and Slatina. In a letter sent Tuesday (10 February) to KFOR Commander Holger Kammerhoff, Nowicki said the largely Serb populations in those villages feel insecure without KFOR. He further noted that the areas lack adequate telephone service in case of emergency. (FoNET - 10/02/04)

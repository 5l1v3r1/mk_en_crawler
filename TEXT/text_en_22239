TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Socialist Party (SP) has initiated an action plan seeking to fully compensate victims of the March 15th munitions blasts in the village of Gerdec. A teenager who worked at the depot died on Sunday (April 13th) from burns, bringing the death toll to 29, with hundreds more injured. SP parliamentary group head Valentina Leskaj visited the affected area in Gerdec on Sunday and said, "Legal experts have been involved in this initiative that aims for 100% compensation, and it should be prioritised by the parliament to solve the problem." The cost of repairs to thousands of homes and other buildings would be covered as well. (Gazeta Shqiptare, Shekulli - 14/04/08; BalkanWeb, Topchannel - 13/04/08)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government announced plans Tuesday (November 18th) to file a countersuit against Croatia at the International Justice Court (ICJ), after the court agreed to hear a lawsuit filed by Croatia. Zagreb accuses Belgrade of ethnic cleansing during the 1991-1995 war and is demanding punishment of all those guilty of genocide, as well as the return of all stolen Croatian cultural artefacts. Croatia also wants Serbia to pay military reparations in an amount determined by the court. In response, Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said Belgrade will sue Croatia for war crimes committed during 1995's Operation Storm. (RTS, AFP, RTS, Javno, B92 - 18/11/08)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) announced on Wednesday (26 April) that it has decided to take Greece to the European Court of Justice because authorities failed to comply with an earlier EC decision regarding illegal state aid to Olympic Airways, the national air carrier. Last September, Brussels asked Athens to calculate and collect state subsidies totaling 540m euros that were provided to Olympic Airways, later renamed Olympic Airlines, since December 2002.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The European Parliament passed a resolution Thursday (7 November) urging the Croatian government to fully co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal. The resolution follows the EC's first annual report on the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP) in Southeast Europe. The resolution welcomed Croatia's progress towards improved relations with its neighbours and stressed the importance of resolving open border issues with Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). The resolution also called on the Croatian parliament to adopt a law on protection of national minorities, which should boost refugee returns. (HINA, Hey.hr, HR Hinet - 07/11/02)

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte visited Banja Luka and Belgrade on Wednesday (29 March) to discuss the cases of top war crimes fugitives Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. Following his meeting with del Ponte, Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said he had assured her of the new entity cabinet's determination to fully co-operate with the tribunal. In a report released Tuesday, the interior ministry said it had kept Karadzic's family under constant surveillance in the last quarter of 2005. 
As for Mladic, Hague prosecution spokeswoman Florence Hartmann told the Serbian daily Blic that del Ponte's decision on whether or not to recommend the suspension of Serbia-Montenegro's Stabilisation and Association Talks would depend on what she learns about his case as a result of her visit. Del Ponte will be issuing the recommendation later this week.
On Tuesday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn warned Belgrade that time is running out. Speaking to Reuters, he said ties with the EU would be put at risk if the Mladic case is not resolved by 5 April. (RTRS, Blic, Politika, Nezavisne novine - 29/03/06; RTS, Tanjug, ANA - 28/03/06)

ANKARA, Turkey -- President Ahmet Necdet Sezer has vetoed a new pension law and returned it to parliament for revision. According to statement from his office Wednesday (10 May), Sezer objects to provisions that would raise the retirement age to 65. Currently, retirement age is 60 for men and 55 for women. Sezer argues that the proposed age is too high, given that the average life expectancy in Turkey is 66 years. (TurkishPress.com - 10/05/06)

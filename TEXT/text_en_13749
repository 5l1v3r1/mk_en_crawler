PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Montenegrin government issued a statement Friday (18 November) saying it could delay the proclamation of independence until mid-June 2006. Voters will go to the polls in early 2006 to decide whether the republic should break away from the state union of Serbia-Montenegro. In the statement, the government indicated that it is willing to wait until after Kosovo status negotiations are fully under way before taking action, assuming voters choose independence.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- In a weekend media interview, EU envoy to Macedonia Erwan Fouere warned that irregularities in the next parliamentary elections would mean a much longer road to EU accession. Fouere stressed that Macedonia must prove its capacity to hold a vote in line with EU standards. 
Separately, Macedonian Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski said Friday (17 March) that the exact date of the parliamentary vote -- due to be held between July and September this year -- must be discussed after parliament adopts the new electoral code. His remark came amid continuing pressure from the opposition for early elections. (Makfax, A1 TV - 19/03/06; Utrinski Vesnik - 18/03/06)

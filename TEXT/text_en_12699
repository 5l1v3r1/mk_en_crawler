ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic said Thursday (5 May) that a further postponement of accession talks with the EU should not pose a problem, if the government continues its robust pace of EU-related reforms and harmonisation of domestic legislation with that of the Union. Addressing students from the Zagreb Economic Faculty, Mesic said he believes the country's EU future is not in jeopardy as long as preparations proceed. Nor, he said, should the delay justify a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Ivo Sanader's cabinet. (Vecernji List - 06/05/05)

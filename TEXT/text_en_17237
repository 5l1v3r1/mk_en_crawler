SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament ratified the trilateral agreement for the Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline project Wednesday (May 30th). A total of 109 lawmakers in the 240-seat parliament approved the deal, signed in March by the governments of Bulgaria, Greece and Russia. The agreement was passed without a debate, in the absence of the opposition, which was protesting the fact that the Economy Ministry had not presented it to Parliament. Opponents also are concerned about the environmental impact of the pipeline. (24 Chasa, Dnevnik - 31/05/07; Mediapool, bTV, News.bg, AP - 30/05/07)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU must honour its commitments and proceed with enlargement despite recent setbacks over the Union's constitution, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said in an article published Saturday (18 June). He went on to highlight the importance of a "European perspective" for bringing peace and stability to the Western Balkans. The promise of membership is a strong incentive for reform, Rehn said.
Also Saturday, parliamentary representatives from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Croatia, Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro wrapped up a two-day meeting in Sarajevo. They issued a declaration calling for joint efforts to accelerate the EU accession processes in the region. Albania backed the meeting, but was unable to send representatives. The participants stressed that they are committed to fulfilling reforms related to EU integration. (International Herald Tribune, HINA, Makfax - 18/06/05; Fena - 17/06/05)

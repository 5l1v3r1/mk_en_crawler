SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak made a last-ditch appeal for a compromise prior to the vote by parliament on key police reform legislation. In a video message posted on the www.reci.ba website Tuesday (April 1st), Lajcak reiterated the EU would reward BiH if it adopted police laws. He said the Union would like to seal the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with BiH at the end of this month. The choice for parliament, he added, is between EU integration or self-isolation. Lajcak also stressed that without the SAA there would be no visa liberalisation.
Debate on the two laws governing the structures and supervision of the future BiH police forces begins on Wednesday. BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric has threatened to resign if the measures fail. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 02/04/08; RTRS, Fena, NTV Hayat, OHR website - 01/04/08)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A former Bosnian Serb military officer wanted for genocide surrendered to Serbian authorities and was transferred to The Hague on Saturday (9 October). Colonel Ljubisa Beara was security chief of the Bosnian Serb Army during the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. He is accused of participating in a "joint criminal enterprise" with Ratko Mladic and others, involving a campaign of ethnic cleansing in the Srebrenica area. Prosecutors have also charged Beara with the murders of Muslims in Potocari on 12 July 1995. There are reports the Serbian government will seek his release until trial.
In other news, the trial of Slobodan Milosevic is to resume at The Hague on Tuesday. The tribunal called a month-long break to enable his new lawyers to prepare their case. They have appealed their own appointment and are awaiting a ruling by the tribunal's five-member appeals panel. (AFP - 10/10/04; AP, BBC, AFP, B92 - 09/10/04)

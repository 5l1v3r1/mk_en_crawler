SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Foreign Minister Solomon Passy says the US presence at Sarafovo air base will not affect the start of tourism season, arguing Sunday (23 March) that the tourism sector could instead benefit from the US troops. Deputy Foreign Minister Lyubomir Ivanov says the government signed a three-month contract, worth $1.7m, for use of Sarafovo. Associated services are worth an estimated $700,000 to Bulgaria.

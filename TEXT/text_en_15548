SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A new report issued by the UNDP urges the government to vigorously pursue further reforms aimed at better integrating the country into the global economy, efficiently prepare for EU membership and boost economic growth. The document, titled "Blue Ribbon Commission Report", was officially presented at a news conference Thursday (October 26th). Praising the completion of a "tough" first round of reforms to stabilise the economy, UNDP experts now recommend that the government take measures to balance the budget, increase lending for export-oriented activities, and remove barriers to foreign trade and investment.

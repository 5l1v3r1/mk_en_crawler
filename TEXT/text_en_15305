ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul says Turkey has deployed more than 30,000 additional troops along its borders with Iraq and Iran to fight Kurdish guerrillas and prevent them from coming across the frontier. According to an AP report on Thursday (27 April), the number of Turkish soldiers in the region tops 250,000. Earlier this week, Turkish authorities denied media reports that commandos were crossing into Iraq to pursue Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terrorists. 
Also Thursday, the Turkish National Security Council, chaired by President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, discussed increased terrorist activities within Turkey, especially involving the PKK. (AFP, AP, Anadolu agency, NTV - 27/04/06)

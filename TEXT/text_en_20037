SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Intelligence reports suggest that al-Qaeda is probably using BiH as a transit point, a senior US diplomat said on Friday (August 17th). Raffi Gregorian, a deputy to the international community's High Representative to BiH, Miroslav Lajcak, told the daily Dnevni avaz that there are people in BiH who support the terrorist group and are prepared to shelter its members and provide them with money and false documents. He added that some of the foreign fighters who joined the Bosnian Muslim army during the 1992-1995 conflict had direct links to al-Qaeda. Most of them, he explained, were helpers rather than terrorists waiting for orders. The BiH government recently revoked the citizenships of some 400 former Islamic fighters. 
In other news, EUFOR troops joined a Bosnian army infantry unit for the first joint military exercise since the country's two armies were consolidated into a single force. A spokesman said the four-day drill was aimed at improving EUFOR's readiness to maintain a secure and stable environment in the country.

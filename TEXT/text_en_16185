SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski told visiting Romanian Defence Minister Teodor Atanasiu on Wednesday (17 May) that Skopje expects the November NATO summit in Riga will send a clear signal about enlargement prospects. He thanked Romania for its continued support of Macedonia's Euro-Atlantic aspirations. In turn, Atanasiu voiced confidence that the country's defence reforms would lead to recognition from the Alliance. Crvenkovski meets on Thursday with Britain's Prince Edward, who is in Skopje to mark the 10th anniversary of the British Council's establishment in Macedonia. He will also open the new British Embassy building in Skopje.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The UN war crimes tribunal began three days of questioning of Croatia's retired Gen Mladen Markac in Zagreb on Tuesday (10 December). Attorney Miroslav Separovic says Markac appeared before investigators as a suspect, though indictments had not been officially released. At issue, his role in military operations during the 1991-1995 Serbian-Croatian war.
Meanwhile, Croatia's Office for Missing and Detained Persons began exhumations at Jasikovac, near the town of Gospic, on Tuesday. The UN tribunal suspects that members of Serb paramilitary units were buried there. (Vjesnik, Vecernji List - 11/12/02; HINA - 10/12/02)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Leaders of the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) officially decided on Tuesday (20 April) to support Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski in the 28 April presidential runoff. Both Crvenkovski's ruling SDSM party and DUI denied recent press speculation that the backing was conditional on DUI receiving the post of parliament speaker. With DUI support, Crvenkovski will likely defeat his second round opponent, Sasko Kedev, of the main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE. (Utrinski Vesnik, Dnevnik - 21/04/04; Makfax, A1 TV - 20/04/04)

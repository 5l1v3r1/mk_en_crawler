SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO has decided to start exchanging confidential information with BiH authorities after necessary procedures are established for co-operation with a non-NATO member, BiH Security Ministry Secretary Bakir Dautbasic said on Wednesday (August 15th). He told Dnevni avaz that a senior NATO delegation, headed by Thomas McKeever, director of NATO's Office of Security, will give BiH's representatives a certificate next week, marking the beginning of confidential data exchanges. 
BiH authorities will have access to NATO information marked "confidential", "internal confidential" and "secret". According to Dautbasic, no other country in the region has been given such access. (Dnevni avaz, MIA, A1 - 15/08/07)

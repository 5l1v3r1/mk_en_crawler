VATICAN CITY -- Pope John Paul II and the Orthodox Patriarch of Romania, Teoctist, jointly presided over a mass in St Peter's basilica Sunday (13 October) signalling progress in efforts to close a rift between the Catholic and Orthodox churches that has divided Christianity for more than a millennium. The two men sat together as equals and embraced each other in front of hundreds of pilgrims from both faiths. They spoke of the need for Christian unity in the face of a world beset by a moral crisis. On Saturday, they signed a joint declaration on unity. While the Vatican has been successful in building bridges to several of East Europe's Orthodox churches, its relations with the most powerful of them, the Russian Orthodox Church, have remained strained and have worsened in recent months. In May, the Pope finally went to Bulgaria for a visit delayed for more than 20 years because of differences between the Vatican and the synod in Sofia. (AP, AFP - 13/09/02)

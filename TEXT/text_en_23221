BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of Serbia's national council for ties with the UN war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, stated on Thursday (July 31st) it is still too early to say whether Radovan Karadzic's arrest can lead to the whereabouts of former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic. "It would be unrealistic to think that such an investigation could give us clues leading to Ratko Mladic," he said. Ljajic pledged the hunt for Mladic and fellow fugitive Goran Hadzic would continue in line with Serbia's international obligations. He added that in light of Karadzic's arrest last week, Serbian authorities expect a positive report from the UN tribunal's chief prosecutor, Serge Brammertz, to both the UN Security Council and the EU Council of Ministers.
Visiting Sarajevo, US Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues Clint Williamson said Washington will continue to pressure Serbia into extraditing Mladic and Hadzic as soon as possible. "The story will not end while the remaining two are still at large," Williamson told the daily Dnevni Avaz. (B92, FoNet, Tanjug, Dnevni Avaz - 31/07/08)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission (EC) spokesman Mark Grey on Tuesday (January 5th) slammed the murder of a controversial Bulgarian radio host, allegedly linked to organised crime. Bobi Tsankov, who had been recently writing books about the mafia and was also the subject of several embezzlement lawsuits, was gunned down around noon Tuesday in broad daylight in busy downtown Sofia. His two guards were injured. Grey said any murder is unacceptable and called for additional measures against such incidents. He expressed hope that authorities will bring the perpetrators to justice as soon as possible. Three people have been arrested. (BTA, Dnevnik, Actualno, Focus, Darik - 05/01/10)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Shortly before the start of the EU Council meeting in Brussels on Friday (December 15th), there was a ceremony in honour of Bulgaria and Romania's admission to the Union. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn welcomed the two countries into "their common home". Rehn reminded them however that they must continue reform efforts after accession in order to meet all membership requirements. 
During the council session, the EU leaders formally gave green light to Romania and Bulgaria joining the EU as of January 1st, enlarging the Bloc to 27 countries. The EU Council also approved the EU foreign ministers' decision, earlier this week, to suspend talks in eight of 35 policy areas, to penalise Turkey for shutting its seaports and airports to traffic from Cyprus. Union members continued to debate issues related to EU enlargement. The general mood seems to signal a slowing of the process.

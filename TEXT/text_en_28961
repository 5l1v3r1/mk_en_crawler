SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Leaders of the main political parties gathered on Thursday (April 8th) for another meeting about constitutional amendments. Representatives of the governing and opposition parties presented their views but did not discuss them, opting instead to have expert groups analyse the proposals. If the groups strike an agreement, the leaders will meet again by the end of the month. The draft amendments proposed by the ruling VMRO-DPMNE relate mainly to judicial reform.

TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi will host a meeting between Prime Minister Sali Berisha and opposition leader Edi Rama on Saturday (February 13th). Both have said they will attend. Berisha is mediating in a bid to end the SP's boycott of parliament, which began in September. The SP insists it won't return until alleged manipulations of the June 2009 general elections are investigated. The boycott has hampered EU-related reforms, prompting the Council of Europe to issue a resolution on the stalemate. (Lajmifundit, Top Channel, Balkan Web, Klan, Shekulli - 08/02/10)

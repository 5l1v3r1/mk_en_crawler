BELGRADE, Serbia -- More than 5,000 demonstrators gathered in Belgrade on Saturday (October 9th) to protest a planned gay parade in the capital on Sunday. Protesters marched down a busy pedestrian street in the city centre to parliament, and chanted slogans. The rally took place amid heavy security without any incidents. The parade will be the first since 2001, when marchers were beaten by ultranationalists, football fans and skinheads. Parade plans for last year were cancelled due to threats of violence. Police said Saturday they will exert maximum efforts to secure safety during the march and urged citizens to abstain from violence. (AFP, AP, Beta, Press, B92 - 09/10/10)

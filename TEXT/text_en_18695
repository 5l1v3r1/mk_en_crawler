ANKARA, Turkey -- A court ordered local internet providers on Wednesday (March 7th) to block access to Google's YouTube website because it allegedly contained videos insulting the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. The ruling was prompted by what some described as a "virtual war" between Greek and Turkish users who began posting material in a bid to offend each other's country.
In other news, the Turkish government has launched a full investigation into claims that attempts had been made to poison Abdullah Ocalan, jailed leader of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party. Justice Minister Cemil Cicek dismissed the reports but announced that four doctors had been sent to examine the prisoner. Ocalan's lawyers say traces of toxic metals turned up recently in hair samples. 
Also Wednesday, a second Kurdish politician in Turkey was sentenced to prison for remarks praising Ocalan. A court in Diyarbakir sentenced Sedat Yurttas, a senior official in the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP), to six months in jail. DTP leader Ahmet Turk recently was convicted on a similar charge. (Zaman - 08/03/07; NTV UPI, AP, Anadolu Agency, Turks.US, CNN - 07/03/07)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu acknowledged on Thursday (July 30th) that Romania is likely to miss the targets set by its agreement with the IMF for 2009, as the economic contraction will be greater than the agreed level of 4%. Still, Basescu said the budget gap must remain around 4.6% of GDP in order for Romania to enter the euro-zone in 2014. He predicted the IMF will be "very understanding, as the Fund's representatives are specialists and Romania can demonstrate it is not to be blamed for" the downturn of external markets and declining domestic consumption.
Basescu also urged Prime Minister Emil Boc to cut the number of state employees by 20%, because cutting benefits alone has not reduced spending enough. There is no other option but to reduce the public staff, starting with redundant workers on the payroll, he said.

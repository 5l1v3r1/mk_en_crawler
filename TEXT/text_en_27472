BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government intends to submit the bill outlining its new set of fiscal austerity measures to parliament on Thursday (May 27th), Environment Minister Laszlo Borbely confirmed on Tuesday. The debate could take place as early as Friday, with the actual vote coming on Monday. The cabinet has opted to have all the fiscal measures applied through an emergency procedure, where bills are debated at only one reading, by a joint session of the two parliamentary chambers. Three days after the bill is debated, the cabinet is subject to a confidence vote. If approved, so is the legislation. If the cabinet loses the vote, it must resign. Many of the austerity measures are unpopular, but the ruling coalition feels it has enough support in parliament to proceed. (Mediafax, Financiarul, Cotidianul - 25/05/10)

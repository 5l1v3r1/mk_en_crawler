SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov said on Monday (17 March) that his country should not send combat troops to help disarm Iraq. Parvanov cited the 7 February decision by the National Assembly, which authorised the government to grant the US-led coalition only the right to use Bulgarian airspace and an airfield near Burgas. Lawmakers also limited Bulgaria's role in any deployment to one company of chemical decontamination specialists that will work in a country neighbouring Iraq. Parvanov's comments followed a meeting of the National Security Council.

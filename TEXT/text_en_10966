BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska's (RS) Parliament on Monday (30 May) rejected an EU proposal for police reform in BiH, turning down one of the main principles -- the crossing of entity borders in mapping future police regions. Despite repeated insistence from the international community that blocking police reform would obstruct the EU integration process, 62 RS deputies voted against the proposal, while 14 voted in favour of it.

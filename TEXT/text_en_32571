SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- An audit ordered by the office of Paddy Ashdown, the top international administrator of BiH, has established a link between the Croat nationalist HDZ party and corruption and mismanagement at one of the Muslim-Croat entity's electricity companies. Donald Hays, Ashdown's deputy, told reporters Wednesday (5 March) that the party had used Elektroprivreda "as a bank for their own purposes". In addition, the audit found Dragan Covic, the Croat member of BiH's tripartite presidency and senior HDZ official, had received 750 euros per month from the electricity company for "expert services". According to the auditors, only about 55 per cent of the electricity was actually paid for by customers, while those with political connections got it for free. Elektroprivreda thus lost about 25m euros per year through mismanagement and corruption.
Auditors recently discovered corruption on a greater scale in the Bosnian Serb electricity company, resulting in the sacking of management. The international administration is expected to release a report on an audit of a third power company -- this one in Sarajevo -- within days.

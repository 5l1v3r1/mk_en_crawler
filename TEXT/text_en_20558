TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Socialist Party (SP) proposed on Monday (March 10th) a constitutional amendment that would introduce a proportional electoral system based on administrative regions. According to the SP, this won't change the number of seats in parliament -- currently 140 -- but will divide the country into 12 election zones. 
"This system will produce free and fair elections by eliminating interference with the results and ballot trafficking from one party to another," the head of SP's parliamentary group, Valentina Leskaj, said. The ruling Democratic Party welcomes the proposal, while smaller parties oppose it. (Panorama, Koha Jone, Shqip, Shekulli - 11/03/08; Klan, Vizion Plus, Top Channel - 10/03/08)

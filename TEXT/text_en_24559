ANKARA, Turkey -- A total of 375 members of the outlawed separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) have died in the past five months in northern Iraq, the Turkish military said on Friday (March 6th), either in Turkish military operations or in internecine power struggles. The military has also received intelligence indicating a great increase in desertions from the PKK, military spokesman General Metin Gurak told journalists. 
In additional news, the crash of a military helicopter killed two lieutenants in central Turkey on Saturday (March 7th). The cause of the crash is presently unclear.
Furthermore, a bomb explosion in a bar injured nine people, one seriously, in the town of Besikduzu. Trabzon Provincial Governor Nuri Okutan ruled out any terrorist link but declined to give more details.

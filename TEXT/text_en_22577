NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat meet on Monday (October 13th) for a fifth round of direct reunification talks, discussing power-sharing arrangements in the future federal state in Cyprus, one of the thorniest issues. At their last meeting on Friday, Talat and Christofias agreed to speed up talks and meet on a weekly basis. Once they complete current discussions on governance and power-sharing, they are likely to confront equally controversial property issues.
Meanwhile on Sunday, Greek refugees from the town of Morphou, on the Turkish part of the island, sent a petition to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. They want the UN to pressure Turkey into working towards a solution to the Cyprus issue.

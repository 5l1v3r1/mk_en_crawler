THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Prosecutors at the UN war crimes tribunal on Tuesday (May 6th) sought a 12-year-prison sentence for Macedonian war crimes indictee Ljube Boskovski and 15 years for co-defendant Johan Tarculovski. The two are charged with war crimes committed against ethnic Albanians during a two-day raid on the village of Ljuboten in August 2001. Prosecutors argue that former Interior Minister Boskovski failed to investigate and seek punishment for seven murders, the brutal treatment of 36 ethnic Albanians and the destruction of 14 houses. The trial began in April 2007. (Makfax, A1 - 06/05/08)

TIRANA, Albania -- The country will dismantle its old ammunition with the assistance of the US Army, President Bamir Topi said on Thursday (January 29th) after a meeting in Tirana with Mark P. Fitzgerald, commander of US Naval Forces Europe, and commander of Allied Joint Force Command in Naples. "We have agreed that ammunition dismantling has to be a continuous process, assisted professionally and in co-operation with NATO in order to avoid dramatic situations," Topi said. Fitzgerald praised Albania's progress in its NATO-related reforms and integration process. Albania hopes to become a NATO member during the summit in April.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Rajko Kuzmanovic was sworn in as the new president of Republika Srpska at a ceremony in Banja Luka on Friday (December 28th). The 76-year-old politician from the Union of Independent Socialist Democrats (SNSD) said he would oppose any effort to merge Bosnia's two entities into a single structure. He also vowed to block any attempt at major constitutional changes that could bring the country's two entities closer, as well as further transfers of power from the entities to the central government. Also on Friday, the BiH parliament officially re-appointed Nikola Spiric as the new BiH prime minister designate. He resigned two months ago to protest changes ordered by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak, but was nominated again by the six-party state-level ruling coalition after it reached agreement on new voting rules and EU-required police reform.

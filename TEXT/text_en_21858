ATHENS, Greece -- Customs officers are striking Monday (September 22nd) to protest the removal of a special account that provided about 3,500 of them with additional monthly income of between 600 and 1,250 euros. The account was funded from fees charged on the imposition of customs duties on the import and export of goods. During their strike, customs offices throughout the country will only process the import and export of non-durable goods or goods of national significance. This means fuel imports will only be processed in amounts that would guarantee the normal operation of hospitals and public transportation. 
Emergency aid and prison staff are also on strike Monday. Hospital workers insist that the government should recognise their profession as dangerous to one's health and boost salaries accordingly. Prison guards also want higher pay and better staffing at detention facilities. (Naftemporiki, ERT, NET, Netpress - 22/09/08)

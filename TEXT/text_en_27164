PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci sent a message of condolences on Thursday (December 31st) to his Finnish counterpart Matti Vanhanen, expressing his deep sorrow over the murder of five people by a man of Kosovo Albanian origin earlier in the day. The government "received with deep sorrow the news that the serious crime was committed by a citizen with Kosovo origins," Thaci said, adding that "at these difficult moments, the people and institutions of the Republic of Kosovo are with you to share this deep pain." The incident happened at a shopping mall on Thursday. The gunman, identified as Ibrahim Shkupolli, shot dead four of the colleagues of his ex-girlfriend before turning his weapon on himself. Later, police found the body of the girlfriend in her home near the mall. (AP, AFP, BTA - 31/12/09)

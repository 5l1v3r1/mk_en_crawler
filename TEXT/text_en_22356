PARIS, France -- Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner implied on Tuesday (July 15th) that progress in relations with Serbia, bringing it closer to the EU, is possible. Speaking to members of the European Parliament, Kouchner, whose country assumed the EU's rotating presidency on July 1st, noted that three events could take place by year's end -- the adoption of a trade agreement, the ratification of Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement and the provision to the European Commission of a mandate to start accession talks with Serbia. Kouchner emphasised that the first two are entirely conditional on Serbia's actions with regards to co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal. He meets with Serbian counterpart Vuk Jeremic in Paris on Wednesday to discuss EU integration. (Tanjug - 16/07/08; Beta - 15/07/08)

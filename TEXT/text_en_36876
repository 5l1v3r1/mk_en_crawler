WASHINGTON, United States -- The World Bank's Executive Board approved a $20m loan to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) for the Urban Infrastructure and Services Delivery Project on Thursday (8 July). The funds will be used to improve the quality and reliability of infrastructure services in urban areas and to bolster prospects for local development.
In other news, the UN Security Council confirmed that the mandates of International Community High Representative Paddy Ashdown and SFOR remain unchanged. The decision was made during a closed-door session Thursday called to review a draft resolution in support of the Dayton Peace Agreement. In a statement following the session, the Security Council also stressed that successful realisation of the accord depends primarily on BiH authorities, and on co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
Late Thursday, SFOR personnel searched three apartments in Borik, a suburb of Banja Luka in Republika Srpska. SRNA quotes police sources as saying that the raid was an attempt to detain army officer Dragan Lalovic. He was not located, but documents were seized from his apartment.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK's reconstruction will be a rather radical operation that will change its structure extensively, new mission chief Lamberto Zannier said on Wednesday (June 25th). "The restructuring will realign it with the realities on the ground," Zannier told reporters in Pristina. Those realities include the deployment of a new EU police and court-related mission, EULEX. 
Separately Wednesday, US State Department spokesman Tom Casey, fielding questions from US senators, echoed that sentiment, describing UNMIK as "a smaller operation that will, nonetheless, have a significant role". 
In other news Wednesday, the head of the International Civilian Office in Kosovo, Pieter Feith, said he expects all countries in the region to recognise Kosovo "as soon as possible". "We hope that this will happen very fast," Feith told the Podgorica-based radio and television of Montenegro (RTCG). He said while Belgrade may not view recognition as friendly, it would contribute to regional stability.

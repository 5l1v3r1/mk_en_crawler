SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The fifth anniversary of the Ohrid Peace Accord, which brought an end to the 2001 interethnic conflict in Macedonia, was marked Friday (11 August). Ahead of the occasion, the EU, NATO, OSCE and US envoys in Skopje released a joint statement praising Macedonia's progress in the development of a stable, democratic and multiethnic state. It said that most laws envisaged in the accord have been adopted, and that crucial processes -- such as decentralisation and proportional representation of ethnic communities in state administration -- were under way. Also on Friday, Macedonian Prime Minister-designate Nikola Gruevski vowed that his government would work to complete the remaining obligations under the Ohrid agreement. Two laws called for in the accords -- one on the police and another on use of languages -- remain to be implemented. (Vecer, Dnevnik, Telma TV - 13/08/06)

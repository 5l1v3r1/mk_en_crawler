ANKARA, Turkey -- The government has forwarded a bill to parliament that would amend a controversial law criminalising any insult to Turkish identity. Parliament Speaker Koksal Toptan said he assessed the bill amending Article 301, found it in compliance with legal procedures, and forwarded it to parliament's justice committee late Monday (April 14th) for discussion Friday. The term "insulting Turkishness" would be replaced by "insulting the Turkish nation". Another change would give the president sole authority to approve launching such legal proceedings. While the bill indicates that the ruling Justice and Development Party is beginning finally to tackle an issue key to potential EU integration, the opposition Republican People's Party and the Nationalist Movement Party are not on board. 
In other news, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was in Doha, Qatar, on Monday attending an international conference on democracy and development. He told participants that, despite difficulties on its road to democracy, Turkey never has made concessions, adding, "As Turkey makes progress in democracy, it also will continue to develop economically."

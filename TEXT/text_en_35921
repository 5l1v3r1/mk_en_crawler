PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- During his first official visit to Kosovo, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer told reporters on Friday (16 January) that the Alliance would remain engaged in the province and that no significant downsizing of KFOR should be expected. Scheffer, who met with KFOR commander General Holger Kammerhoff, called on all communities in Kosovo to work together to meet the benchmarks which have been set by the UN. "Despite the progress which has been made... there's a lot to be wished here still," he said. (Tanjug, AFP - 16/01/04)

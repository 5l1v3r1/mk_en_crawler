PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The EU police and judicial mission to Kosovo, EULEX, would need KFOR's help to establish control in Kosovo, EU Special Representative to Kosovo Pieter Feith said on Friday (March 28th). In an interview with AP, Feith explained EULEX would rely on KFOR to deploy in northern Kosovo and convince the Kosovo Serbs to allow EU officials work on their territory. Feith also said he feels Serbia's latest proposal for the functional partitioning of Kosovo would not find broad international support.
Belgrade, meanwhile, is calling for early elections in Kosovo, to coincide with those being held in Serbia on May 11th. Serbia's Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic insisted that since Serbia views Kosovo as an integral part of its state, the elections should be held there as well.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government and opposition politicians united Thursday (29 July) in hailing the UN war crimes tribunal's decision to reduce the 45-year sentence of former Bosnian Croat General Tihomir Blaskic to nine years. President Stipe Mesic said the ruling confirmed that the tribunal is not a "political court", while the justice ministry said it marked a historic moment in "determining the truth about events in central Bosnia". Blaskic, who commanded Bosnian Croat forces in the area during the 1992-1995 war, was found guilty of atrocities against the Muslim population. He surrendered in 1994 with the assistance of Croatian authorities. (Vecernji List - 29/07/04)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Foreign Minister Tonino Picula said Wednesday (4 December) that his country plans to apply for EU membership within the next several months. He cautioned, however that "certain problems which are being linked with Croatia's candidacy should be removed from the agenda, in order to make it more credible." The EU has warned the country that it must improve co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal if it wants its bid to succeed. The EU and Croatia signed an association and co-operation agreement in October 2001. Zagreb has said that it wants to join the Union by 2008. To that end, Croatia's European Integration Minister, Neven Mimica, presented a set of national priorities at the Faculty of Economics in Vienna on Wednesday. He emphasised the government's ambition to join the informal group of Bulgaria and Romania in the second wave of EU enlargement. (Vecernji List, Vjesnik - 05/12/02; AFP, HINA, Infopress - 04/12/02)

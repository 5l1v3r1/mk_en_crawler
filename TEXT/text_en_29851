PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government aims to make constitutional changes that would end the supervised independence by the international community. Addressing his cabinet on Wednesday (April 20th), Prime Minister Hashim Thaci stressed that these changes will be made along with the changes in election laws. Thaci's first deputy, Hajredin Kuci agreed, telling reporters that "Upon our approximation with NATO and the EU, the need for international supervision should be reduced." 
Independence supervisors say that the completion of this process depends exclusively on progress in Kosovo. Pieter Feith, head of the International Civilian Office, said "the country is making progress, but there are some unfinished issues, such as the North." He commented after a meeting with Culture Minister Memli Krasniqi. (Telegrafi, Kohavision, RTK, Klan Kosova - 20/04/11)

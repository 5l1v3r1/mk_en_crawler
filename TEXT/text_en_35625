COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller said Thursday (5 February) that his country would support Croatia's bid for membership in the EU and NATO. Talking to reporters after a meeting with his Croatian counterpart, Miomir Zuzul, he praised Zagreb for the progress it was making in all areas. Moeller said it is now only a matter of time before Croatia becomes part of both organisations. He urged the international community to help Zagreb, particularly in view of certain "disturbing signs around the Balkans". Zuzul pledged his government's commitment to work for stability in the Western Balkans. (AFP - 05/02/04)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament on Wednesday (7 May) passed a law on prevention of human trafficking. The law calls for a national commission, operating under government supervision, to deal with the problem. It also stipulates the establishment of local commissions and centres providing temporary accommodations and protection to victims of human trafficking. They would be ensured special protective measures, should they agree to co-operate with police. (BTA - 07/05/03)

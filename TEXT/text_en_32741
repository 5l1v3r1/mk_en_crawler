BERLIN, Germany -- The magazine Spiegel will publish a poll Monday (16 December) which finds 60 per cent of Germans want Turkey to join the EU if it meets membership requirements. Only 32 per cent said they oppose accession. Some 2.5 million Turks live in Germany, one of the largest expatriate Turkish communities in the world.
On Sunday, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the leader of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party, pledged rapid reforms. The EU promised to open talks with Ankara at the end of 2004 if it meets the criteria for membership. Prime Minister Abdullah Gul has vowed that Turkey will meet those criteria in 2003.

JERUSALEM, Israel -- Defence Minister Ehud Barak expressed concern Monday (April 27th) over a joint military exercise between Turkey and Syria on their shared border. "Today we see a Syrian-Turkish drill, which is certainly a troubling development." He added, however, that he does not think the exercise will harm Ankara's military relations with Israel. On Sunday, Ankara announced this first-ever military exercise with Syria involving both countries' ground forces. Turkey's general staff said the three-day drill marks a watershed in relations with the long-time rival.
Meanwhile, the Black Sea Partnership 2009 military exercise began on Monday in the port town of Eregli. The exercise, involving Turkey, Russia, Romania and Georgia, ends on May 4th and aims to boost co-operation and training.

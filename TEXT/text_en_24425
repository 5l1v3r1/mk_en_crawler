BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Serbian Radical Party (SRS) presidency announced on Thursday (June 11th) that it has rejected the resignation of deputy party leader Dragan Todorovic. The announcement came only hours after the broader party council had approved it. Todorovic stepped down earlier this week in light of the party's poor showing during local elections in the Belgrade municipalities of Zemun and Vozdovac. SRS supporters voted instead for the Serbian Progressive Party, a breakaway party founded by former SRS leader Tomislav Nikolic. (Beta, B92, Tanjug, Politika - 11/06/09)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko warned Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik on Wednesday (December 23rd) that rejecting the authority given the high representative would mean a violation of the Dayton Peace Agreement and UN Security Council resolutions. During talks in Banja Luka, Inzko stressed that the international community has unanimously supported his decision to extend the mandate of international judges and prosecutors working on war crimes cases. Bosnian Serbs have strongly opposed this move and threaten to hold a referendum on the issue. During Wednesday's meeting, Dodik said RS leaders will not give up the right to gauge public opinion.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- A new round of talks aimed at reunifying divided Cyprus -- scheduled for Thursday (September 3rd) -- has been postponed. Former Cypriot Foreign Minister George Iacovou, a current member of the Greek Cypriot negotiating team, said it was because pilgrims who wanted to go to the Morphou church of Ayios Mamas were not allowed to enter the Turkish-controlled northern part of the island. Iacovou said such behaviour by the Turkish Cypriot side cast a shadow on the planned meeting. (Reuters, Famagusta Gazette, MIA, Xinhua - 02/09/09)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- At a news conference Wednesday (October 25th), Deputy Prime Minister in charge of European Issues Gabriela Konevska-Trajkovska presented the government's communication strategy for EU integration, covering 2006-2010. The document is aimed at improving public awareness and understanding of the integration process, building confidence in the relevant Macedonian and EU institutions, and ensuring support from EU member states. 
Konevska-Trajkovska said that in line with the EU policy for direct communication with the public, special government teams would be touring the country. They will visit local self-government authorities and residents and explain the need for EU integration and related obligations and reforms. Recent surveys suggest over 90% of the public backs the EU accession process, Konevska-Trajkovska said. (Makfax, A1 TV - 25/10/06)

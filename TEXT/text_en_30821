ANKARA, Turkey -- The ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) will win between 315 and 335 seats in parliament after the June 12th parliamentary elections, AKP leader and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan predicted on Saturday (April 2nd). He added that the specific number depends on the total number of parties that succeed in entering parliament. AKP won 340 seats with 47% of the votes in 2007 and the number of parties exceeding the 10% national electoral threshold will likely remain the same, according to recent polls. A total of 276 are sufficient to form a single-party government in the 550-seat parliament. (Milliyet, Aksam, Gazete 5 - 03/04/11; NTV - 02/04/11)

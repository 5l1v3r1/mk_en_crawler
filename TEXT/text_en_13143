THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal's Appeals Chamber on Tuesday (30 August) affirmed the seven-year prison term given to former Yugoslav naval chief, Vice Admiral Miodrag Jokic, for the shelling of Dubrovnik in December 1991. The judges rejected the appeal submitted by Jokic's defence team. The shelling of Dubrovnik by the former Yugoslav People's Army under the command of Jokic and others killed at least 43 people and heavily damaged the historic city's Old Town district.
Also Tuesday, Hague prosecutors requested sentences of between 15 and 20 years for three former members of the now disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army. Fatmir Limaj, Haradin Bala and Isak Musliu were accused in connection with crimes committed in the Llapushnik prison camp in eastern Kosovo, from May to July of 1998.
Separately, prosecutors sought a 10-year sentence for former Bosniak army deputy commander Sefer Halilovic. He was accused of war crimes against Croatian civilians in the Neretva Valley in BiH in 1993. (ICTY Web site, Tanjug, RTRS - 30/08/05)

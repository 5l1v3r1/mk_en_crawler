NEW YORK, Unites States -- Cypriot reunification was among the main topics discussed by Greek Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas during his meeting with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Friday (February 18th) in New York. "We want to see a settlement, and the settlement in our view must be based on the UN Security Council resolutions but also on the full respect of the EU acquis communautaire,'' Droutsas said afterwards. He urged Turkish Cypriot leaders to be more constructive in the ongoing reunification talks. Concerning the long-standing name dispute with Skopje, Droutsas reaffirmed Greece's commitment to finding a solution. (Famagusta Gazette - 19/02/11; ANA-MPA - 18/02/11)

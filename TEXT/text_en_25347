PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Election Complaints and Appeals Commission (ECAC) on Tuesday (November 24th) asked the Central Election Commission to annul results in 15 polling stations in Kosovo, eight of them in the Gjakova/Djakovica municipality. The ECAC says that about 1,500 votes cast at these stations during the November 15th municipal elections involved false signatures.
Early Tuesday, gunmen fired at the municipal building of Gjakova/Djakovica, breaking windows. A 41-year-old man has been arrested and questioned as the main suspect in the incident. Political parties downplayed any link between the attack and local elections results. (Koha Ditore, Express, Lajm, Zeri, Kosova Sot - 25/11/09)

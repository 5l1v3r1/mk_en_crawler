BUCHAREST, Romania -- Bogdan Olteanu of the ruling National Liberal Party was elected the new speaker of Romania's Chamber of Deputies on Monday (20 March), beating out Valer Dorneanu from the opposition Social Democratic Party and Daniela Popa from the Conservative Party. The position opened up last week, following the resignation of Adrian Nastase, who is facing corruption charges.
Also Monday, Health Minister Eugen Nicolaescu said Romania wants to manufacture a vaccine against the deadly strain of H5N1 avian influenza that has been developed in Hungary. "In six months maximum, Romania could produce the first vaccines at the Cantacuzino institute," Nicolaescu told reporters after a visit to Budapest.

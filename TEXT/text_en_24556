SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The European Commission (EC) will send a new technical mission in January to assess the progress made in addressing irregularities in the management of EU funding, Michael Leigh, EC director general for enlargement, said during a visit Monday (December 8th). Leigh acknowledged that there has been some progress since the appointment of Meglena Plugchieva, deputy prime minister for EU funding. However, he underlined that time is needed to see whether tightened controls have led to any practical results. Bulgaria has lost hundreds of millions of euros in EU aid over mismanagement issues.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- For the past decade, war crimes in Kosovo have not been considered a priority, the OSCE concludes in a report presented on Tuesday (June 15th). The document calls for involvement by local judges and prosecutors in the trials, and for more active engagement by competent international authorities. EULEX judge Gianfranco Gallo notes that at times, not everyone working for UNMIK or EULEX meets the necessary standards. "Another issue is that many professionals don't stay here for very long. You have to stay longer in a place in order to be efficient," Gallo, a former UNMIK prosecutor, said. In the report, titled "Kosovo's War Crimes Trials - An Assessment Ten Years On (1999-2009)", the OSCE said the timely delivery of justice in such cases is particularly important because it challenges the perception of impunity. "This failure runs counter to the expectations of the public and to the interests of justice and reconciliation. War crimes, due to their nature, gravity, and importance to the reconciliation process, were not regarded with due consideration by the judicial institutions."

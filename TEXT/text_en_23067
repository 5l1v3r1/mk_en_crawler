BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic will lead a high-ranking delegation to Brussels on Wednesday (September 3rd) for talks with top EU officials regarding Serbia's integration process. The delegation will include Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic, Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Delic and Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic. They will meet with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn. Observers expect the Serbian parliament to meet to ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU soon. Although Serbia signed the SAA in April, political turmoil in parliament has stalled ratification for months. (Tanjug, B92, AFP -01/09/08)

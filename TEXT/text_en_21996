NEW YORK, United States -- UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Manfred Novak announced on Thursday (November 20th) that Albania, along with Switzerland and a number of other European countries, has agreed to accept prisoners from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility if they are unable to return to their homelands after the camp closes. US President-elect Barack Obama promised during the campaign to shut down the facility, which holds terrorism suspects. He further vowed that inmates will either undergo a trial or receive their freedom. Novak says around 100 people in Guantanamo Bay face persecution and torture if they return to their countries.

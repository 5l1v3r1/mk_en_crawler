BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU security chief Javier Solana issued a statement Friday (27 December) highlighting the Union's commitment to a stronger role in Balkan peacekeeping and stability. He said the unprecedented deployment of an EU-led force to train and monitor Bosnia and Herzegovina's police was a "strong symbol of the collective will of Europeans to act jointly." The mission will consist of 512 officers, 422 of whom will come from EU countries. It will be supported by 50 civilian advisers and 300 local staff. Germany will be the biggest contributor. Non-EU members Russia, Canada, and Turkey will also be represented. The official transfer of functions from the UN to the EU will take place in Sarajevo on 16 January.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The war crimes trial of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic was suspended on Thursday (September 16th) until September 27th to give the defendant more time to review a large amount of documents submitted by prosecutors. In late August, they presented more than 1,000 documents seized during December 2009 searches of the apartments of two former Bosnian Serb military officers: Dragomir Pecanac and Milorad Pelemis. Karadzic had sought three weeks to review the documents. (Beta, B92, Fena - 16/09/10)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- In an interview published Sunday (25 April) in <I>Vecernji List</I>, EU security chief Javier Solana said Croatia will likely get candidate status in June. However, this did not mean a starting date for accession talks would be set automatically, he added. In the interview, Solana said he was satisfied with the European Commission's positive avis on Croatia's membership application, but noted it marked the beginning of a long process.
Meanwhile, several hundred people gathered in Jasenovac on Sunday to remember those killed by the country's fascist regime during World War II. Thousands of Serbs, Jews and Gypsies died at the Jasenovac concentration camp, which became known as the Croatian Auschwitz. (Vecernji List - 26/04/04; HINA, AFP - 25/04/04)

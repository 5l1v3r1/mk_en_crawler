THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal's Appeals Chamber announced on Friday (21 April) that it would allow Kosovo Albanian Haradin Bala, sentenced in November to 13 years for war crimes, to return briefly to the province for family reasons. According to an official statement from The Hague, Bala is being released until 27 April to attend his daughter's memorial service in Kosovo. UNMIK is responsible for him until he is returned to The Hague. The former Kosovo Liberation Army prison guard at the Lapusnik camp has appealed his sentence. (ICTY Web site - 21/04/06)

TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition Socialist Party (SP) lawmakers walked out of a parliamentary session Thursday (July 1st), resuming to their months-long boycott of legislative work. The SP group left the session just before votes on several bills were about to begin. They say they will return only after the government decides to demonstrate that the June 2009 elections were transparent. Thursday's decision brings the situation back to prior to March, when the SP ended a complete boycott of parliament staged for months over the government's refusal to open ballot boxes and investigate the elections.

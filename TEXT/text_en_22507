SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik announced on Monday (October 13th) there will be no new transfers of RS's powers to BiH, especially in terms of state-level lawmaking. Dodik recommended RS's parliament adopt the argument that transfers from the entities to the state level violated the Dayton Peace Accords and that jurisdiction transfers not approved by RS's parliament must be reversed. RS President Rajko Kuzmanovic called Monday's parliamentary session in response to statements by BiH Presidency Chairman Haris Silajdzic, who questioned the viability of the Dayton Peace Accords in a speech before the UN General Assembly last month. For his part, High Representative Miroslav Lajcak urged politicians to "once and for all stop threats to unilaterally change the Dayton Peace Accords and ... instead turn towards European priorities".

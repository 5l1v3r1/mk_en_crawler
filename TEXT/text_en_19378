SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) authorities say that war crimes fugitive Stojan Zupljanin had been hiding in Serbia and Russia until late last year, according to media reports in Serbia on Thursday (September 27th). The RS secretariat for co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal says Zupljanin's family home in Banja Luka was under constant surveillance earlier this year, as were several areas in the Kotor Varos municipality and areas in the Knejevo and Laktasi municipalities, with suspected links to Zupljanin's support network.

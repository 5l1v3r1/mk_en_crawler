STRASBOURG, France -- Members of the European Parliament (EP) on Wednesday (September 16th) endorsed the European Commission's recommendation to scrap visa requirements for citizens of Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia. Swedish Minister for EU Affairs Cecilia Malmstrom, whose country currently holds the rotating EU's presidency, said the goal is visa liberalisation for the three Balkan countries effective January 1st 2010. During a debate on the EC's proposal, some EP members criticised the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania were excluded, arguing this could lead to divisions within the Western Balkans. The EP is scheduled to vote on a resolution for visa liberalisation in November. (RTS, Tanjug, Medjunarodni Radio Srbija, Sitel, Alsat - 16/09/09)

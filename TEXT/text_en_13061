ATHENS, Greece -- Police chief George Angelakos submitted his resignation Friday (24 February), six months before his mandate was scheduled to end. He suggested that he wanted to step aside in favour of younger professionals; however, some reports suggest Public Order Minister Vyron Polydoras was seeking a change at the top police post. A new police chief is expected to be appointed on Tuesday. (Kathimerini, ANA - 25/02/06)

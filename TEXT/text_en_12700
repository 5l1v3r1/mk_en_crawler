ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police arrested a 19-year old man Friday (3 June) on suspicion of sending threatening letters to the national media. The letters, which claimed responsibility for a series of bomb attacks on ethnic Serb settlements in the Vukovar area, were supposedly signed by a group calling itself Terrorist Network Racija Politike. In Monday's edition of the newspaper Vecernji list, however, the suspect -- identified as "Branko B." -- said he wrote the letters only to "become popular". He denied any connection to the bombings.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Democratic Party (PD) has finally managed to file a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu's minority government, officials confirmed on Monday (June 4th). PD presented 119 signatures in support of its initiative, three more than legally required. Two previous attempts to file last week failed due to insufficient signatures. PD, the party of President Traian Basescu, insists on the cabinet's resignation or dismissal, citing the failure of the May 19th impeachment referendum against Basescu.

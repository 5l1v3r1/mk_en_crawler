PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Kosovo's main opposition party has claimed victory in Saturday's (November 17th) parliamentary and local elections in Kosovo. With nearly all votes counted, Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo (DPK) leads with 35%, while the ruling Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) is trailing with 22%. It is the LDK's first defeat in the five elections held in the province so far.
Speaking to reporters, Thaci vowed that Kosovo would declare independence immediately after December 10th, when the latest round of internationally mediated talks on Kosovo ends. He acknowledged, however, that his party lacked the votes to rule alone and said he would seek a coalition with the LDK.
Turnout of 45% was reported at the polls. However, only five of 40,000 Serbs eligible voted. (Kosova Live, Tanjug, B92, RTS, Beta, Reuters, AP, AFP - 18/11/07)

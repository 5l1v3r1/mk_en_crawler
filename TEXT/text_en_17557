ZAGREB, Croatia -- Serbia does not see how giving independence to Kosovo could be construed as a compromise, Serbian President Boris Tadic said late on Sunday (June 24th), after meeting with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of a regional energy summit in Zagreb. Moscow has said it opposes any Kosovo status solution that is not acceptable to Serbia, which wants to retain sovereignty over the province. 
Putin also met with Albanian counterpart Alfred Moisiu. The Russian leader said his country seeks a solution that would respect the interests of all sides and would guarantee stability in the Balkans. Albania backs former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan, which would give Kosovo supervised independence. (Glas javnosti, Reuters, AFP - 25/06/07; Tanjug, Beta, Interfax - 24/06/07)

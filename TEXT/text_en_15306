ATHENS, Greece -- The EU justice and home affairs ministers in Luxemburg approved an increase Thursday (27 April) of visa fees for non-EU nationals, a decision affecting most Southeast European states. The hike -- from 35 euros to 60 euros -- was endorsed despite objections from Greece, Hungary and Sweden. Greek Public Order Minister Vyron Polydoras had said EU policy should be more flexible regarding countries of "special interest", such as candidate countries, Western Balkan states and strategic partners such as Russia and Ukraine.

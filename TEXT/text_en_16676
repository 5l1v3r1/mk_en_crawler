BUCHAREST, Romania -- Livia Saplacan, spokeswoman for the National Anti-Corruption Directorate, confirmed on Thursday (8 June) that the agency has begun investigating the former cabinet of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), for allegedly accepting a 10m-euro bribe to buy back two frigates from the United Kingdom in 2004. The scandal primarily involves former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase and his colleagues in the PSD cabinet, but also implicates former President Ion Iliescu, who received the frigates with honours in late 2004. 
In other news Thursday, five people died, four were seriously injured and one is missing in an accident at Romania's seaport Constanta. Two huge cranes reportedly collided around noon, apparently due to operator error. (Adevarul, Gandul, Nine o'clock - 09/06/06)

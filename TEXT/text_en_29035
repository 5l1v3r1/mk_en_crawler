ANKARA, Turkey -- Opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) leader Kemal Kilicaroglu has filed a criminal complaint over a Facebook group that claimed he was a member of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The move sparked speculation that the popular social network, which has 22.5m users in Turkey, may share the fate of YouTube, which has been banned. Kilicadorlu says his CHP wants the offensive content removed, not the site shut down altogether. (Hurriyet - 07/10/10)

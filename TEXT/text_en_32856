ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish Prime Minister Abdullah Gul told Turkish TV Sunday (2 February) that Greek and Turkish Cypriots should make some concessions in order to reach a settlement. Gul said both sides should take "reasonable steps" in order to move closer to a final agreement before the deadline of 28 February set by the UN and EU. Gul said the Turkish government would consider a scenario involving no settlement as a failure and would do its best to avoid such a situation. In the meantime, Turkish media reported that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has rejected the amendments to the peace plan put forward by the Greek side. In turn, the proposals made by the Turkish Cypriots were also rejected. The UN Special Envoy to Cyprus, Alvaro de Soto, proposed a revised plan to be offered to the two sides by 23 February, while a referendum on adopting the settlement could take place on 30 March.

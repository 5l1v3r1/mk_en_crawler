TIRANA, Albania -- In comments published Wednesday (16 July), NATO Secretary General George Robertson urged Albania to tighten its borders and fight corruption and organised crime. Robertson made the remarks ahead of a visit by the Alliance's top decision-making body. He told the daily <I>Koha Jone</I> that Albania has to make its borders secure to prevent drug smuggling and human trafficking networks in the Balkans from financing terror groups in Central Asia. Robertson also warned against NATO aspirants expecting a free ride into the organisation, saying they had to put their own houses in order first. He praised Tirana's "important role" in the global fight against terrorism, and its participation in the peacekeeping operation in Iraq. (AP - 16/07/03)

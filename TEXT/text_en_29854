ZAGREB, Croatia -- Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mario Dragun confirmed on Monday (December 27th) that Croatia has submitted its response to Serbia's genocide countersuit at The International Court of Justice (ICJ). In 1999, Zagreb lodged a lawsuit against Serbia for alleged genocide in the 1991-1995 conflict. Serbia filed a countersuit in January 2010. Croatia's 2,000-page response, submitted a week ago, is expected to remain confidential until the start of deliberations. The ICJ process is protracted, and any ruling is still years away.

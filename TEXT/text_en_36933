LISBON, Portugal -- Greece continued its miracle run in the 2004 European Championship, reaching the final by beating the Czech Republic 1-0 late Thursday (1 July). Traianos Dellas scored the winning goal just seconds before the end of the first overtime period. Under FIFA's "silver goal" rule, the second 15-minute overtime was not played. The Greeks meet Portugal in the final on Sunday, the first time the Greek national team will have reached the finals of an international soccer tournament.

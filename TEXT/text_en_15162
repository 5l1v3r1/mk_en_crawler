BUCHAREST, Romania -- Tensions within Romania's ruling coalition sharpened Thursday (29 June), with the prime minister and president in open disagreement over Romanian troops in Iraq. Citing security concerns and the operation's cost, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu on Thursday called for a pullout, by year's end, of the 890 Romanian troops deployed in Iraq. President Traian Basescu then accused Tariceanu of making statements harmful to national interests and Romania's credibility abroad. He said Tariceanu had consulted neither relevant domestic authorities nor Romania's foreign partners. (Ziua, Cotidianul - 30/06/06; AP, FT.com, Rompres, Reuters - 29/06/06)

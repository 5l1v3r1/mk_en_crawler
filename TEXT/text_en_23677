BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Sunday (December 21st) "the time is right" for the EU to start applying the interim trade agreement with Serbia, as the country is showing good co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal Implementing the trade deal will contribute to -- rather than hamper -- efforts to arrest the last two high-profile war crimes fugitives, Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic, Rehn told Reuters news agency. The interim trade agreement is part of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement signed between the EU and Serbia in April. But it underwent an immediate suspension because of Serbia's unsatisfactory co-operation with The Hague. In October, Serbia decided to unilaterally implement the interim trade agreement, effective next month. (Reuters, B92, Tanjug - 21/12/08)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Muslim and Croat members of BiH's tripartite presidency have sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, urging the UN to end the division of the country into two entities. "The situation created in Bosnia [and] Herzegovina ... is a direct result of genocide, ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Therefore, we are urging you to use your authority and influence to ensure that â¦ all efforts are made to eliminate the results of genocide," Haris Silajdzic and Zeljko Komsic said in their letter. The presidents based their request on a recent ruling by the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which found Republika Srpska guilty of genocide in connection with the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. 
Nebojsa Radmanovic, the Serb member of the BiH presidency, issued a statement saying the move was careless and had not been discussed with him. He also said the letter represented a direct challenge to the Dayton Peace Accords, which Silajdzic and Komsic swore to uphold when they took office.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Rasim Ljajic, the head of Serbia's council for co-operation with The Hague tribunal, told the Belgrade-based daily Blic on Thursday (September 24th) that he will step down if former Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic is not arrested by the end of the year. Asked what makes him so sure this will happen, Ljajic said the search has intensified and there has been some progress. On Tuesday, Serbia's war crimes prosecutor, Vladimir Vukcevic, said authorities are working "day and night" to catch Mladic. His arrest and that of the other remaining war crimes fugitive, Goran Hadzic, are the last conditions Serbia must meet in order to achieve full co-operation with the UN tribunal. That, in turn, is a condition for implementing Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. (B92, Blic - 24/09/09)

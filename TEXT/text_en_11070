SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva has submitted a formal demarche or complaint to European Commission (EC) Ambassador to Skopje Donato Chiarini, as well as EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, protesting remarks appearing on the EC's official Internet site. According to a government release Wednesday (27 July), Mitreva described as unacceptable the information about Macedonia published in the section "The EU's Relationship with The Western Balkan Countries" and demanded its immediate removal. She stressed that the information did not present the real image of Macedonia and is offensive to its citizens. The article described Macedonia as "venerable territory" and "a country that combines Bulgarian, Serb, Albanian and Greek cultures, and both Orthodox Christianity and Islam." Macedonian media, which first reported on the wording, noted that there was no mention of either a "Macedonian nation" or "Macedonian language".

KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- Kosovo Serb leaders did not announce a decision Saturday (19 October) whether Kosovo-Metohija Serbs will take part in the upcoming local elections 26 October. The final decision is likely to be made on Monday, after a discussion with UNMIK chief Michael Steiner. The Serb People's Council of Kosovo-Metohija said Friday that Kosovo Serbs need stronger guarantees that Kosovo-Metohija institutions would be decentralised and that the return of refugees will be ensured.

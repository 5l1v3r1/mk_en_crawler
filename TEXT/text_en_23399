BUCHAREST, Romania -- As many as 10,000 railway workers protested in Bucharest on Wednesday (April 29th) against the transport ministry's plan to lay off about 12,000 people in the sector. Protestors blocked Victoria Square in front of the cabinet's headquarters, as union representatives met with government officials inside. Union leaders stress that they are not seeking higher salaries for the workers but rather the derailment of a transport ministry restructuring plan involving layoffs.
Also Wednesday, education sector trade unions threatened to stage protests after the cabinet decided to freeze all wages in the public sector through the end of the year. Unions fear that the decision will also bring layoffs and lower salaries for teachers and professors, as the cabinet hunts for budget cuts. The leader of the National Federation of Education, Teodor Fartolea, says there are indications bonuses are already on the chopping block. The teachers are threatening to block upcoming national exams. (Cotidianul - 30/04/09; Realitatea, Hotnews.ro, Mediafax - 29/04/09)

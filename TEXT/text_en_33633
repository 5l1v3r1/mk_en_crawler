ATHENS, Greece -- Several senior Greek officials hit the airwaves Thursday (11 September) to promote security arrangements for the 2004 Summer Olympics. "Relative to what is happening on the rest of the planet ... Greece is a true oasis," Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos said, echoing two government spokesmen. The officials said the hosts have made all necessary arrangements, and assured teams that they do not need to bring their own security personnel. Organisers are spending a record 556m euros on security. (AP, ANA, MPA - 11/09/03)

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- The year 2003 should see the resolution of refugee problems in Serbia, according to Commissioner for Refugees Sanda Raskovic. She asserted Monday (6 January) that refugees will have to decide whether to become integrated in their current community or return home. "The budget for this year, along with UN High Commissioner for Refugees funds, will be enough to support people in collective [refugee] centres, which will be gradually closing down," she added. Closing these centres will actually increase efforts to find solutions, said Raskovic. (Serbian Studio B TV, BBC - 06/01/03)

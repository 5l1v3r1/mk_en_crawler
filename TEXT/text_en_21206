BELGRADE, Serbia -- Miroslav Radic, a defendant in the "Vukovar Three" trial, returned to Serbia late Friday (September 28th), a day after Hague tribunal judges acquitted him of all charges stemming from the 1991 massacre of more than 260 Croats and other non-Serbs on a farm in Vukovar. The main suspect in the trial -- Serb army commander Mile Mrksic -- got 20 years in prison and his subordinate, Veselin Sljivancanin, received five years for aiding the crime.
On Monday, the trial against former Kosovo Prime Minister and leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) Ramush Haradinaj resumes at The Hague. Haradinaj and two other KLA commanders are charged with war crimes committed in the spring and summer of 1998 in the Decani valley in Kosovo. (Beta - 30/09/07; B92, Tanjug, AP - 29/09/07)

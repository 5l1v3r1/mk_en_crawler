BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romaniaâs Foreign Minister Mihai-Razvan Ungureanu tendered his resignation on Friday (2 February), in line with a demand by Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu. The prime minister had sharply criticised him for failing to inform the government about the arrest of two Romanians working on a military base in Iraq. Tariceanu said he learned about the arrests from media reports. The Romanians, detained on espionage charges, were freed on Friday.

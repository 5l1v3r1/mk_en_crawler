ANKARA, Turkey -- At a meeting in Ankara on Thursday (27 March), Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul and his Spanish counterpart, Ana Palacio, discussed the Iraqi crisis and contingency plans for averting a refugee crisis. Gul told reporters later that Turkey hopes for Spanish support in its relations with the EU and accession aspirations.
Also Thursday, the retrial of human rights award winner Leyla Zana and three other former Kurdish members of parliament began Thursday. Their 1994 convictions for collaborating with the banned Kurdistan Workers Party were later overturned. That prompted the new trial, which is being attended by two members of the European Parliament.

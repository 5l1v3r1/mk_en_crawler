BELGRADE, Serbia -- The main opposition Serbian Radical Party (SRS) said on Monday (October 13th) it will file an embezzlement case against its former deputy leader, Tomislav Nikolic. The SRS will sue Nikolic for a loan worth 614,000 euros he arranged with Banca Intesa, allegedly without permission from the party's Central Homeland Administration. The SRS also wants to check whether Nikolic took out other loans on behalf of the party. He denies any abuse of power, calling the allegations "abominable lies", and suggested the SRS is concerned that his newly established Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) is gaining support and could threaten the SRS. He left the party after a disagreement over ratifying Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. (Beta, Tanjug, B92, FoNet - 13/10/08)

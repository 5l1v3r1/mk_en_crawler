BUCHAREST, Romania -- Senate Speaker Nicolae Vacaroiu said on Wednesday (20 September) that he expects President Traian Basescu to name new heads of the Romanian Intelligence Service and of the Romanian Foreign Intelligence, now that parliament has endorsed the resignations of the two services' previous chiefs. Radu Timofte and Gheoghe Fulga stepped down in late July, after the disappearance of Syrian-born businessman Omar Hayssam, accused of masterminding the March 2005 kidnapping of three Romanian journalists in Iraq. Parliament plans to discuss the appointments of new intelligence chiefs in October. (Antena 3 TV, Nine o'clock - 21/09/06)

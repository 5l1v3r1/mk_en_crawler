SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Several thousand Albanians are expected to gather in Skopje on Monday (May 10th) to protest what they describe as discriminatory policies based on ethnic and religious grounds. The gathering is being organised by 40 NGOs representing ethnic Albanians. The opposition New Democracy Party, headed by Imer Selmani, supports the protest, but other ethnic Albanian parties have not. (Dnevnik, Utrinski Vesnik - 10/05/10; Alsat - 09/05/10)

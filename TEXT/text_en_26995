SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Boyko Borisov criticised President Georgi Parvanov on Monday (March 8th) for his behaviour in a recent dispute with Finance Minister Simeon Dyankov. "What Parvanov did was an act of a small-minded fellow. In fact, he was looking for a pretext to attack the cabinet," Borisov told Standart. The controversy began on March 1st. When asked by local TV whether it is true that Parvanov is a young billionaire, Dyankov replied "he is not young" The next day, Parvnov's office issued a statement accusing the minister of slander. Dyankov says his response was misinterpreted. On Friday, the two met to clear the air, but instead, it made matters worse. Parvanov published a transcript of the conversation, which Borisov's ruling GERB party and parliament say broke the law. No one, the critics noted, can record a conversation and publish it without the consent of both parties. (Standart - 08/03/10; Capital, Darik - 07/03/10)

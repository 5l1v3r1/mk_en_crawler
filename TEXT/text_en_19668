PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Several hundred former Serbian army reservists threw rocks and burning tyres at police and KFOR peacekeepers as they attacked the border checkpoint at Merdare in an attempt to cross over to Kosovo on Thursday (February 21st). The veterans, from the Serbian town of Kursumlija, wore their uniforms and chanted "Kosovo is ours!" According to the AP, they even brought a bulldozer with them, forcing UN and NATO peacekeepers to build a large steel barrier across the road to stop them. On Tuesday, thousands of Serbs set fire to two other border checkpoints.
Also Thursday, Kosovo police blocked the Bosniak neighbourhood in the ethnically divided town of Mitrovica in an operation aimed at locating explosive materials. One person was reportedly detained after three shells and sniper munitions were found in his home. (RTS, Beta, AFP, AP, Tanjug - 21/02/08)

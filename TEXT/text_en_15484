PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The parties and coalitions that will participate in the 10 September parliamentary and local elections sealed a declaration on ethical behaviour Wednesday (23 August). They agreed to observe all democratic principles during the campaign and to contribute to a fair and calm atmosphere. The opposition Socialist People's Party refused to sign it, saying it had always behaved ethically during elections. (Vijesti, Pobjeda - 23/08/06)

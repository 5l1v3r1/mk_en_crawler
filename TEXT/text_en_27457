SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- An appeals chamber of the Court of BiH will discuss a motion Monday (November 29th) filed by Branimir Glavas against his war crimes sentence. The former Croatian lawmaker was sentenced in July in Croatia to eight years in prison for war crimes against Serbian civilians during the 1991-1995 conflict. Glavas, who left Croatia last year for neighbouring BiH to avoid prison, was arrested by Bosnian authorities in September after a local court upheld the verdict. The appeals chamber's decision is expected in the coming days. (Srna, sarajevo-x.com, BHRT - 29/11/10)

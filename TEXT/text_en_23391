PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The European Commission (EC) Liaison Office launched a project Friday (May 22nd) to rebuild five bridges along the road connecting Kosovo and Macedonia. The head of the EC Liaison Office, Renzo Daviddi, said the initiative will contribute to Kosovo's economic development and regional integration. "The M2 road is heavily congested, and it is essential that it meets the necessary standards for its proper functioning," Daviddi said. The 7m-euro project will last around 18 months.
In other news, Kosovo police arrested four people, including a woman, in an operation dubbed "Schengen", local media reported Saturday. The four are suspected of human trafficking, as well as visa and document fraud. Police sources identify the suspects as the owner and employees of two travel agencies in Pristina and Ferizaj.

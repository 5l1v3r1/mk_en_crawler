MOSCOW, Russia -- A storm in the Kerchen Gulf, which connects the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, has smashed a Russian oil tanker, three cargo ships and has sunk two barges since Sunday (November 11th). As a result, more than 6,800 tonnes of sulphur and at least 2,000 tonnes of fuel oil have been spilled, threatening parts of the Russian and Ukrainian coasts with ecological catastrophe. Three sailors were found dead and 20 are missing after the wrecks. Rescue teams have saved 35 others. Investigators say the captains of the vessels did not take into account weather warnings issued on Saturday. But survivors say the storm struck without warning, leaving no time to prepare.
On Monday, Russia and Ukraine launched a joint operation to contain the spills that reportedly have killed 30,000 birds and significant numbers of fish. The European Commission says it will help Russia and Ukraine deal with the fuel spills, if requested.

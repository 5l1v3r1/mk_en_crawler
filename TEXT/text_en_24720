BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia is determined to complete its co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal by year's end, the head of Serbia's national council for co-operation, Rasim Ljajic, said on Saturday (June 6th). He said authorities have been checking new leads in the search for the two remaining fugitives, Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic. The Netherlands still insists Mladic in particular must be captured before Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU is implemented. Amsterdam refuses to budge on the issue, despite the positive assessment regarding Serbia that tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz just submitted to the UN Security Council.
On Saturday, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini weighed in, saying implementing Serbia's SAA and its ratification by the EU are issues "that can no longer be postponed". "The EU should recognise and accept positive signals received from Serbia by granting the country an EU candidate status," he said in an interview with the Tanjug news agency. He visits Belgrade on Monday.
On Tuesday meanwhile, the UN tribunal plans to resume the trial of two former senior Serb security chiefs: Jovica Stanisic and his deputy, Franko Simatovic. They are accused of training, arming and directing paramilitary units that persecuted and killed non-Serbs during the 1992-1995 Balkan conflicts. The legal proceedings were halted a year ago due to Stanisic's poor health. (Glas Srbije, Tanjug, B92 - 06/06/09; Reuters, AFP, AKI, Tanjug, BTA - 05/06/09)

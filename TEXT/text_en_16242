SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) leader Dragan Cavic -- the former Republika Srpska president -- resigned on Tuesday (November 14th) amid pressure from the party's main board. Deputy SDS leader Mladen Bosic and Bosko Siljegovic, a member of the SDS presidency, have also stepped down because of the party's failure in last month's general elections.

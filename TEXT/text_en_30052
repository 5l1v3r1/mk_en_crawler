SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Peace Implementation Council (PIC) ambassadors condemned on Friday (April 15th) a decision by Republika Srpska's (RS) Parliament to call a referendum on High Representative-imposed laws, particularly regarding the BiH Court and Prosecutor's Office. The ambassadors voiced support for BiH state level judicial institutions and warned that RS's decision represents an attempt to undermine the rule of law and the Dayton Peace Accords. The Bosnian Serb parliament decided on Wednesday to call a referendum on the judicial institutions, saying BiH's Court and Prosecutor's Office are biased with regard to war crimes cases involving Serbs.

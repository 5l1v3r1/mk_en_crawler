TIRANA, Albania -- Border police announced on Monday (August 16th) that the number of foreign tourists who have entered Albania since the beginning of August is double that of the same period last year. Experts say the record growth in the number of foreign visits is mainly due to new infrastructure, particularly the new highway that connects Albania and Kosovo.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Local media is reporting that the office of Turkish Army Chief of General Staff Gen Tuncer Kilinc sent a communiqu√© Monday (19 May) to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, expressing some of the military's objections to EU accession-related reform proposals. Reportedly, the military objects to amendments to the anti-terror act, a provision allowing foreign observers to monitor elections, and a proposal allowing private television channels to broadcast in minority languages, mainly Kurdish. Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin, however, said the government has received no such report and is counting on the military's support in the EU accession process.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- It took two votes rather than one, but parliament Wednesday (April 28th) adopted a bill on restructuring the National Integrity Agency (ANI), the chief anti-corruption body. The Constitutional Court recently ruled that the ANI has no right to inspect the accuracy of asset declarations filed by senior officials, or to seize illegally-acquired assets. This stripped the ANI of its power. The bill, proposed by the government, transfers some of the agency's functions to the national revenue agency, the ANAF, and others to the prosecutor's office.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The tripartite presidency on Thursday (April 23rd) threatened to take Croatia to court unless the countries quickly negotiate a settlement to their sea border dispute. "An agreement on these issues would save both countries' time and means. Otherwise, we shall have to seek to defend our rights and interests in line with section 2, Article 15 [of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea]," the BiH presidency said in a letter to Croatian President Stipe Mesic and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader. At issue are a small stretch of land on the Adriatic and the status of the Ploce and Naum ports, through which BiH tries to secure its sole sea outlet. Further provoking BiH is Croatia's plan to build a bridge bypassing the BiH stretch, which BiH fears will complicate its access to international waters.
In other news Thursday, Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik criticised the Office of the High Representative (OHR), saying BiH is under "an international protectorate where the high representative rules by decree, violating human rights". He said political officials in the country have been "blackmailed and replaced without evidence and only based on decisions by the high representatives", adding the OHR has transferred entity powers to the state level most often "under the guise of so-called needed reforms for harmonisation with European standards".

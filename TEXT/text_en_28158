PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The Higher Court in Podgorica on Saturday (May 15th) sentenced six former members of the Yugoslav National Army (JNA) for war crimes. They were found guilty of ordering and committing torture against prisoners of war and civilians between October 1991 and August 1992 during an attack on Dubrovnik, and got sentences ranging from 18 months to four years. About 300 prisoners of war are believed to have been taken to a detention camp in the coastal village of Morinj, where they were tortured for months. This is the first such sentence issued in Montenegro since the country declared independence in 2006. (AFP, Reuters, AP - 15/05/10)

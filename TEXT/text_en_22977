LUXEMBOURG -- The European Court of First Instance cancelled on Thursday (April 3rd) a decision listing the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) as a terrorist organisation. The court explained that the 2002 decision to include the PKK in the EU's blacklist of terror organisations was illegal under EU law. A spokesperson, however, stressed that Thursday's decision addressed a procedural shortcoming, but has no practical effect. 
The ruling does not prevent EU members from including the PKK in their blacklists of terror organisations. Despite the clarification, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Cemil Cicek criticised the Court decision as unacceptable. (AFP, Hurriyet, Turkish Daily News, DPA, Zaman, AP, Reuters - 03/04/08)

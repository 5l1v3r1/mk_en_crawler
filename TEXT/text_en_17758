SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A former Bosnian Muslim police commander went on trial in Sarajevo's war crimes court on Friday (May 18th) for atrocities allegedly committed during the 1992-1995 conflict. Zijad Kurtovic was charged with war crimes against Croat civilians and prisoners of war, and with violating the laws and customs of war. Prosecutors say he and other members of his platoon tortured prisoners at the All Saints Church in Donja Dreznica near Mostar, beating them with bats and crosses. Inmates were also forced to eat the Bible and other religious books, and were used as human shields on the front line between Muslim and Croat forces in 1993. 
In other news, a Bosnian Serb war crimes convict Miroslav Deronjic died in Sweden, where he had been serving a ten-year sentence handed down by the UN tribunal. Swedish authorities say he died of natural causes. Deronjic, 52, was jailed for crimes committed against Bosniaks in the village of Glogovo in 1992. (RTRS, Srna, Reuters - 18/05/07)

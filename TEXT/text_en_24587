ANKARA, Turkey -- US President Barack Obama will visit Turkey next month, US. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Saturday (March 7th) during a working visit to Ankara. The planned visit is "a reflection of the value we place on our friendship with Turkey", Clinton said. She added the two countries would discuss the safest and most effective way to withdraw US forces from Iraq. 
Clinton met with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Ali Babacan. The two sides discussed the US-Turkey strategic partnership and the latest developments in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the fight against terrorism. "We share [with Turkey] a commitment to democracy, a secular constitution, respect for religious freedom, and a sense of global responsibility," she told reporters. Clinton praised Turkey's mediation between Syria and Israel and its "productive" efforts in Iraq.
The US secretary of state pledged a continuation of US intelligence support for Turkey's military operations against the outlawed separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which she described as "a common enemy". In addition, she reiterated her country's support for Turkey's EU accession process. (Anadolu news agency, Hurriyet, Zaman, Sabah, NTV, CNN Turk, Reuters, AP, AFP, CNN, VOA, Xinhua - 07/03/09)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney again called for the establishment of a single, functioning and efficient police structure in the country Monday (24 January). Speaking to a local TV channel, he said negotiations would determine what the future organisation of the police system should be. McElhaney also repeated that BiH could join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme only if it co-operates fully with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
 In other news, EUFOR confirmed Monday that a crime-fighting operation has been ongoing in the Federation of BiH. Over the past week, EUFOR set up a total of four checkpoints in the Hercegovina-Neretva and Srjednobosanski cantons. 
Also Monday, the Bosniak opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) rejected an invitation by Republika Srpska Prime Minister-designate Pero Bukejlovic to participate in talks on forming a new entity government. SDP says it will oppose the new cabinet when voted on by parliament. Four minor parties in parliament have formed a bloc and are pledging conditional support for the cabinet.

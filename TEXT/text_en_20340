BUCHAREST, Romania -- Sources say leaders of the ruling National Liberal Party (PNL) approved on Monday (February 11th) the nomination of Senator Radu Stroe to assume the position of defence minister from Teodor Melescanu, who will keep the justice minister position he is currently occupying in the interim. The reshuffle must be officially proposed and is subject to President Traian Basescu's approval. 
Melescanu has been in charge of both ministries since Basescu rejected Norica Nicolai's nomination as justice minister. The opposition Social Democratic Party has said it opposes changes in the government, and instead seeks the resignation of the entire government.

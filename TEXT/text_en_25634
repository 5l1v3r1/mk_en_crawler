PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A joint initiative by the Kosovo Police, customs officials and EULEX will strengthen control at two northern border gates in a bid to stop illegal activity there. On Monday (March 22nd), authorities began stopping and registering every vehicle coming in or out of Kosovo, while checking for proper customs documents. Previously, only EULEX personnel registered vehicles and drivers entering and leaving Kosovo at those two gates. Serb arsonists burned the gates after Kosovo declared its independence in 2008. Kosovo is believed to have lost around 400m euros in revenue due to the smuggling of goods through the crossings. (Koha Ditore, Zeri - 23/03/10; Kohavision, Klan Kosova - 22/03/10)

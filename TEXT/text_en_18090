NEW YORK, United States -- The future status of Kosovo was the focus of talks between Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha and UN General-Secretary Ban Ki-moon in New York on Friday (June 15th). Meeting within the framework of a UN forum on transition, the UN chief told Berisha that delays in finalising the status process are unnecessary, given the importance of the a settlement to the entire region. Berisha, in turn, reiterated Albania's support for UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's proposal for supervised independence. 
In New York, Berisha also met with former US President Bill Clinton, who congratulated Albania for its progress in fighting corruption and organised crime. (Shekulli, Kohajone, Top-Channel - 17/06/07; Kohajone, A1 TV, Telma TV, Top-Channel, Balkanweb - 16/06/07)

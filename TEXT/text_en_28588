BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania, Georgia and Azerbaijan signed an official agreement in Bucharest on Tuesday (April 13th), to provide natural gas from the Caspian Sea to Romania. Under the project, Romania will build at least two liquefied gas terminals, with an annual capacity of 7 billion cubic metres. To assure availability, Azerbaijan plans to expand extraction from 23.5 billion cubic metres to 28.5 billion in the near future. A feasibility study will determine exact costs, but a preliminary estimate is between 2 billion and 4 billion euros. Bucharest hopes the project can be completed before the EU's Nabucco natural gas pipeline is functioning, suggesting that Romania may not need Nabucco.

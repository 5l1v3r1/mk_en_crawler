NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu said on Sunday (June 27th) that talks to reunify the divided island could lead to a deal by the end of the year. This would require the Greek Cypriot side to demonstrate that it wants to meet the target, Eroglu told the Anadolu news agency before leaving for New York, where he is meeting with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Monday.

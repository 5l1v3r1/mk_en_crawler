BELGRADE, Serbia -- US Ambassador to Belgrade Cameron Munter says his country considers Serbia to be co-operating with The Hague war crimes tribunal and has told The Netherlands this. The Dutch government has long refused to advance Serbia's EU accession process, until it arrests war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic. On Wednesday (June 3rd), Munter stressed that Washington believes Serbia's future is in the EU. Local politicians have repeatedly warned that the lack of progress in EU integration could strengthen radical and populist parties. 
Hague tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz submits his report on Serbia's co-operation with the tribunal to the UN Security Council on Thursday. His opinion will be crucial in determining whether to allow implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement that Serbia signed with the EU 14 months ago.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- German Lieutenant General Roland Kather, the commander of 16,000 KFOR troops in Kosovo, warned on Tuesday (August 14th) that the patience of Kosovo's residents is not endless and the situation in the province could deteriorate in December. That is when the troika of mediators conducting talks on Kosovo submits its report to the UN Security Council. Kather said the issue of Kosovo's future status must be resolved as soon as possible, in light of growing tensions that could escalate into violence. 
Separately Tuesday, Serbian Army Chief of Staff Major General Zdravko Ponos met with Kather in Nis, saying afterwards that the situation in the security zone along the administrative border with Kosovo is under control. (AP, B92, Beta - 14/08/07)

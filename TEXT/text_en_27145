BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The 27 EU member states support the work of EULEX and its planned signing of a protocol on police co-operation with Serbia. They have agreed that consultations on the matter should continue in order to find an appropriate solution, local media reported on Tuesday (September 1st). During a meeting with representatives of EU member states, the EU Political and Security Committee backed the signing of the document with Belgrade, despite strong opposition from Pristina. EULEX spokesperson Karin Limdal described the technical arrangement as "very important for finding ways to fight organised crime, which will be beneficial to all in Kosovo".
In other news Tuesday, former UN envoy in the Kosovo status talks Martti Ahtisaari urged the EU to make recognition of Kosovo's independence a precondition for Serbia's EU bid, local media reported. Ahtisaari is also urging foreign investors to come to Kosovo, given its coal resources. (Koha Ditore, Lajm, Express, Kosova Sot - 02/09/09; TV 21, Kohavision - 01/09/09)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatian prosecutors have halted a probe against Macedonian Army Chief General Miroslav Stojanovski, after two months of investigation failed to turn up evidence that he was involved in war crimes on Croatian territory. Macedonian media reports quoted Vukovar prosecutor Bozidar Piljic as confirming Saturday (28 January) that the inquiry has ended. Stojanovski rejected the allegations. (A1 TV, Telma TV - 28/01/06)

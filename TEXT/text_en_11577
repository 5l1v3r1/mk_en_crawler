BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The co-chairman of the BiH defence reform panel, Raffi Gregorian, said Saturday (22 January) that the defence ministries of the entities should be abolished by autumn of this year. He said the current priority is to put the work of the entity defence ministries and the army headquarters under the control of the state authorities. No demand has been made yet for the two entity armies to be abolished, Gregorian added. Eliminating the entity defence ministries is a key part of the country's defence reforms.

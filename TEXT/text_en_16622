SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The right-wing opposition Democrats for Strong Bulgaria (DSB) has asked the Sofia Municipal Election Commission to sack Sofia Mayor Boyko Borisov. DSB official Atanas Atanasov said on Sunday (9 July) that the effort is based on Borisov's alleged participation in the management boards of two trading companies -- Interbulpred and G&B Travel -- in violation of the law on local self-government. Atanasov says Borisov actually breached the law for five years, going back to his term as chief secretary of the interior ministry. (Darik - 09/07/06)

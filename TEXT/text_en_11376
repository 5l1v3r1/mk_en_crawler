SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament on Wednesday (26 January) adopted a key package of draft constitutional amendments related to the country's future EU membership, in its first reading. The changes are aimed at liberalising the real estate market by lifting the current ban over foreigners' purchase of land, enabling EU citizens to reside permanently in Bulgaria, vote, and be elected to local institutions. By law, the measures must be approved in two more readings. 
Also Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Plamen Panayotov said a national programme for combating human trafficking would start in February. Panayotov heads the government's ad-hoc panel on the issue. (bTV, Mediapool, Bulgarian government Web site - 26/01/05)

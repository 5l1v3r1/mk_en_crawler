ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Turkish police have arrested a senior member of al-Qaeda who was involved in planning the November terrorist attacks in Istanbul, the city's governor said Friday (30 January). He would not reveal the suspect's identity, but newspapers reported that he is Baki Yigit, one of the six most wanted terrorists in the country.
In other news, six people died in Istanbul when two old buildings in the town's European quarter collapsed late on Saturday. Meanwhile, authorities closed several lanes to ease traffic on one of the two bridges spanning across the Bosporus when one of its 236 cables snapped during a heavy storm. According to experts, there is no immediate danger of collapse, but urgent repairs are needed. (AFP - 01/02/04; AP, Reuters, AFP -- 30/01/04)

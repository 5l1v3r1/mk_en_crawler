ZAGREB, Croatia -- German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said on Tuesday (1 June) that his country would back Croatia in its efforts to start accession talks with the EU. He arrived in Zagreb on Monday for two days of talks with his Croatian counterpart, Miomir Zuzul, as well as with Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and President Stipe Mesic. At their summit later this month, EU leaders are expected to authorise the European Commission to launch negotiations with Croatia. European Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen says Croatia would negotiate separately from the Bulgaria-Romania group. (Vjesnik - 02/06/04; AFP, HINA - 01/06/04)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Several hundred ethnic Albanians gathered on Sunday (December 28th) in the southern town of Presevo to protest the arrest of ten former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) for alleged war crimes. Families of the ten suspects and an association of former members of the so-called Liberation Army of Presevo, Bujanovac, and Medvedja accused Serb authorities of causing tension in Presevo and of intimidating Albanians living there. Protesters also called on the international community to become involved in the case.
Meanwhile, nine of the ten former KLA members arrested on Friday will now spend 30 days in custody after questioning by an investigating judge with the Belgrade District Court's War Crimes Chamber. They allegedly committed war crimes against a civilian population, court spokeswoman Ivana Ramic said on Monday. The ten are suspected members of the so-called "Group of Gnjilane" that kidnapped 159 Serbian civilians and killed at least 51 people in Gnjilane between June and October 1999. A local court in Presevo will handle the tenth suspect's case.
In other news, UNMIK has announced a new round of technical talks between Pristina and Belgrade early in 2009, media reported on Monday. UNMIK spokesman Russell Geekie said the talks would be direct, with the participation of Serb and ethnic Albanian experts in the presence of UNMIK and EULEX representatives. The focus will be implementing the UN's six-point plan on the international presence in Kosovo. (Lajm, B92 - 29/12/08; Beta, AFP, Tanjug, Radio Srbija, RFE RL - 28/12/08)

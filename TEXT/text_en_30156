ATHENS, Greece -- Antonis Samaras, leader of the opposition New Democracy party, rejected on Tuesday (May 17th) calls from EU representatives to introduce fresh austerity measures that would help the PASOK-led government meet its economic targets. Eurogroup president Jean-Claude Juncker and EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn urged Greece on Monday to secure the written support of the opposition for the austerity programme, during a two-day meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels that focused on ways to help Greece overcome its crisis. 
According to Samaras, the government's current plan is harmful and his party won't support it. Meanwhile, Rehn said on Tuesday that the European Commission may ask private creditors and banks to voluntarily extend Greece's debt repayment scheme. He emphasised however that restructuring Greece's debt "is not on the agenda". (Imerisia - 18/05/11; Ta Nea, ERT, Sigma Live - 17/05/11)

ATHENS, Greece -- Three bombs exploded in downtown Athens early Wednesday (5 May), damaging a police station just 100 days before the start of the Summer Olympics. An officer was slightly injured in the attack. The authorities received a warning from an anonymous caller and sealed off the area.
In other news, International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge praised Athens for its efforts to complete work on the venues in time for the Games. Of 39 key Olympic installations, 18 are ready. The roof over the main Olympic stadium remains problematic. The IOC says the project will be scrapped if it is not in place by 20 May. Officials hope to have it ready early next week. (AP, AFP, CNN - 05/05/04; ANA, Kathimerini - 04/05/04)

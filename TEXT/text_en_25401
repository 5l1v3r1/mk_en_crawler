PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Vetevendosje (Self Determination) movement on Sunday (January 24th) accused EULEX of lacking the time and political will to deal with Serb criminals and corrupt politicians in Kosovo. Vetevendosje's reaction came a day after EULEX summoned Vetevendosje leader Albin Kurti to trial, which is scheduled to start on February 15th. The charges stem from a February 2007 demonstration called by Vetevendosje that turned violent. To prevent the rioting crowd from breaking into Kosovo government and parliament buildings, Romanian UNMIK police opened fire with rubber bullets, killing two protestors. 
Kurti insists that EULEX justice in Kosovo is selective. "By not dealing with war crimes committed by Serbia, with the crimes committed by Serb parallel structures, with the local corrupted politicians, but dealing with ordinary soldiers of the KLA and activists of Vetevendosje, they are doing the same thing as UNMIK," he said.

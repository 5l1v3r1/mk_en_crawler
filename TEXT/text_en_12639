BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Kicking off a visit to Brussels Tuesday (5 April), High Representative Paddy Ashdown again said that BiH would not be able to join the EU and NATO's Partnership for Peace programme until Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic are in custody. In a statement for the Sarajevo daily Dnevni Avaz, Ashdown said Republika Srpska has begun co-operating with the UN war crimes tribunal but must complete the process.
In other news, the BiH presidency's Bosniak member, Sulejman Tihic, called Tuesday for the establishment of a state-level commission to determine the truth about war crimes committed in BiH.

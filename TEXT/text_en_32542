SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The largest opposition party, VMRO-DPMNE, issued a booklet Friday (7 March) condemning the first steps of the new multiethnic coalition government.The publication cites what it describes as an unimproved security and economic situation, poor tax policy, nepotism and a deteriorating judicial system. It also accuses the government of waging "selective combat against organised crime, focused only on VMRO-DPMNE members".
In other news, a NATO spokesman announced Friday that the landmine that killed two Polish peacekeepers and injured three civilians last week was the result of a "a criminal act". NATO experts are working with Macedonian police to investigate. (MIA, A1 TV, AP - 07/03/03)

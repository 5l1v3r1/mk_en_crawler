ATHENS, Greece -- Over 200 immigrants, who had staged a hunger strike outside Athens University's Law School for five days, ended their occupation early Friday (January 28th) after police moved in. The protestors, most from North African countries, arrived at the campus Tuesday from the island of Crete, demanding residency papers. By law, university facilities in Greece are off limits to police. University authorities, however, lifted the ban giving police the rarely granted power to intervene. Scores of police officers, including special forces, surrounded the area and, after ten hours of tense negotiations, persuaded the protestors to end their action.

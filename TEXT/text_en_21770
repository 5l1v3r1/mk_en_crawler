PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Masked gunmen were spotted at the border between Kosovo and Macedonia at the weekend. The Macedonian Interior Ministry said on Sunday (April 20th) that the situation on the border is calm. "There are no signs of destabilisation," ministry spokesperson Ivo Kotevski said. The Kosovo Police Service confirmed that it was investigating reports of gunmen in the villages of Debellde and Mjak, after Pristina media carried stories and photos of the men. Kosovo Interior Minister Zenun Pajaziti says he has no information on their identity or location. 
Media reports suggest the gunmen reject a 2001 agreement between Skopje and Belgrade shifting the border villages under Macedonia's rule. On Friday, Pristina and Skopje signed a protocol that outlines a year-long process for the demarcation of the Kosovo-Macedonia border in accordance with former UN envoy for Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari's plans.

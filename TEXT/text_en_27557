TIRANA, Albania -- Interior Minister Lulzim Basha visited on Monday (May 24th) the southern village of Lazarat, which is synonymous with illegal drug production. Basha went there to underscore the government's commitment to combating the phenomenon. "We send a strong message from Lazarat that things are changing, and only good news will be heard from here," Basha said. The village has been one the most isolated locations in Albania for the past two decades and has managed to keep authorities away. But now the interior ministry has launched an awareness campaign there, aimed at stopping the growth of marijuana, the cash crop. Basha stressed that controlling the production of illegal drugs will boost the EU visa liberalisation process. (Ora News, Top Channel, News 24 - 24/05/10)

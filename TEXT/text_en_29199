ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament approved on Tuesday (May 4th) one of the remaining two most critical items of a constitutional reform package proposed by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). Article 17, which envisions restructuring the Constitutional Court, passed 337-69. The votes in support were enough to include the article in a possible referendum on the entire reform package. The AKP has stepped up efforts to ensure that the remaining articles are approved, after one that would make party closures more difficult narrowly failed earlier this week. That prompted the main opposition Republican People's Party to consider supporting the entire package of amendments if other controversial articles regarding the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors were also removed.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- Rada Trajkovic, the head of the parliamentary group of the Kosovo Serb coalition Return, stepped down Monday evening (30 December). In a statement, the coalition said she was voted out of the post due to the unsatisfactory work of the group as a whole and Trajkovic in particular, which had led to "the marginalisation of the coalition" in parliament. Return members walked out of parliament a few months ago, protesting attempts by ethnic Albanians to derail their work.
In other news, Oscar-winning actress Angelina Jolie wrapped up a three-day visit to Kosovo, lamenting the slow pace of refugee returns. Jolie serves as the goodwill ambassador for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. (Tanjug, B92, BBC, FoNet - 31/12/02; AP, AFP, CNN - 30/12/02)

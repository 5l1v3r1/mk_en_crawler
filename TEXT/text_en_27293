BUCHAREST, Romania -- A hotel in the Sinaia Mountain resort has closed after 40 students staying there were diagnosed with swine flu. Health Ministry State Secretary Adrian Streinu-Cercel announced on Sunday (November 1st) that members of the group, who were at the hotel for a week attending a law conference, have been hospitalised. Authorities say they contracted the flu from a Portuguese tourist at the hotel, who refused to be hospitalised although she was confirmed to be carrying the disease. The conference was attended by 260 students from 31 European countries. 
Meanwhile, Turkey confirmed on Sunday that a 27-year-old health care worker in Ankara has succumbed to swine flu, bringing the death toll to four. (Yeni Safak, Radikal, Milliyet, Hurriyet, Zaman, Evenimentul Zilei, Sabah - 02/11/09; AP, CP - 01/11/09)

TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament officially elected Gazemend Oketa as the country's new defence minister Thursday (March 27th). The vote was 73-0, with opposition lawmakers refusing to participate. They insisted parliament should instead continue debating the March 15th Gerdec ammunition depot tragedy. Oketa replaces Fatmir Mediu, who resigned over the deadly series of blasts.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Belgrade would incur heavy losses, amounting to billions of dollars, if international aid is suspended, Serbian Minister for International Economic Relations Goran Pitic warned. He said Sunday (2 March) that the possibility of aid suspension should be taken more seriously, given the profound effect it would have on the economy. "I believe that we are in a situation in which we have to do what is expected of us," said Pitic, referring to the requirements that both the United States and EU have set. The most significant among these is stepping up war crimes co-operation. (Blic, B92 - 03/03/03)

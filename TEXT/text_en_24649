SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH is stagnating in its EU integration efforts because of its nationalistic programmes, High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said on Friday (December 5th) in his third report to the UN Security Council. "Despite progress on the Euro-Atlantic agenda, the political situation remains difficult ... the nationalist and ethnic agendas have continued to prevail over the agenda that actually should matter -- the Euro-Atlantic agenda," Lajcak said.

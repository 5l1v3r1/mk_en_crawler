SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Movement for Rights and Freedom (MRF), a partner in the ruling coalition, said Tuesday (1 July) it would launch negotiations within the coalition on possible government reforms. MRF Chairman Ahmed Dogan added that the party would rather seek changes to the cabinet structure than staff replacements.
Also on Tuesday, the newly elected Executive Director of the Dutch Group in the IMF, Jeroen Kremers, gave high marks to Bulgaria's economic development. He met with Finance Minister Milen Velchev and said macroeconomic stability was an important basis for boosting economic growth and reducing unemployment.

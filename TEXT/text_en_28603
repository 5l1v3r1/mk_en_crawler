ATHENS, Greece -- Voters are heading to the polls Sunday (November 14th) for the second round of municipal and regional elections, seen as a gauge of support for the government's austerity measures. Ruling PASOK party-backed candidates picked up two regions -- PASOK stronghold Crete and the Southern Aegean -- in the first round a week ago, leaving the remaining 11 regions to be decided in run-offs. The November 7th vote gave PASOK's candidates a slim lead over the opposition. Prime Minister George Papandreou has since dropped the threat of early general elections.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic said on Saturday (August 11th) he is ready to testify before The Hague war crimes tribunal in the trial of six men charged with ethnic cleansing. They are former Bosniak Foreign Minister Jadranko Prlic, who served as prime minister of the self-declared "Croatian Republic of Herceg-Bosna" in 1993, retired generals Milivoj Petkovic and Slobodan Praljak, who commanded the Herceg-Bosna armed forces, former military police commander Valentin Coric, former defence minister of the so-called "republic", Bruno Stojic and Berislav Pusic, who headed a prisoner exchange commission. They were indicted in March 2004 for participating in an ethnic cleansing plan, allegedly masterminded in part by Croatia's late president, Franjo Tudjman.
Mesic told Croatian radio that if summoned, he would testify "because all Croatian citizens are obliged to this by the constitutional law on co-operation with The Hague tribunal". (HRT, HINA - 11/08/07)

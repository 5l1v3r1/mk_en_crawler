ANKARA, Turkey -- The chief prosecutor of the Supreme Court of Appeals, Sabih Kanadoglu, requested on Thursday (9 January) that the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) be banned. Furthermore, Kanadoglu asked the Constitutional Court to place an injunction on AKP leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, barring him from running in the repeat vote in the province of Siirt. Kanadoglu is arguing that the AKP violates text in the constitution which bans parties established on religious principles. The Welfare Party was dissolved in 1997 on similar grounds. Chief of General Staff Gen Hilmi Ozkok criticised Prime Minister Abdullah Gul for tolerating Islamist activities, insisting that no such government deserves a place in power.

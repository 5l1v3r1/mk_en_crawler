BELGRADE, Serbia -- Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic reiterated on Monday (July 2nd) that expects Serbia could sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU by the end of this year. Djelic said he received such assurances during recent talks with Portugal's Foreign Minister Luis Amado, whose country now holds the rotating EU presidency. The EU resumed SAA negotiations with Serbia last month, in light of improved co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. (Blic - 03/07/07; RTS - 02/07/07)

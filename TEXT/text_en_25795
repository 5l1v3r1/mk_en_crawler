PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Anti-Corruption Agency (AKK) says the judicial system is the most corrupt institution in Kosovo, followed by the central government, local authorities, and publicly owned companies. Speaking to Deutsche Welle on Sunday (September 20th), AKK head Hasan Preteni said the fight against corruption is an uphill battle. Since 2006, the AKK has sent files on suspected cases to the Public Prosecutor, but no legal procedure has been initiated, Preteni said. "The agency has sent more than 150 files on possible corruption cases, but no official has been arrested," he added. As a result, most of the cases have been sent to EULEX for investigation.

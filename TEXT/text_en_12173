SKOPJE, Macedonia -- International observers said Monday (11 April) that Sunday's delayed second round of municipal elections was generally calm but was again marked by irregularities in some areas. Officials from the ODIHR and the Council of Europe cited numerous cases of ballot box stuffing, group voting and voters failing to sign the voter lists. Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski said Monday there were a few small incidents, but added that they did not affect the results of the vote.

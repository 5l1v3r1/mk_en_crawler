ANKARA, Turkey -- The army will respond to attacks by Kurdish rebels in a way they cannot imagine, Chief of General Staff General Yasar Buyukanit warned on Sunday (October 28th) in a statement marking Turkey's national holiday. "Nobody should doubt that the Turkish armed forces will continue their fight until the annihilation of the [Kurdistan Workers' Party] terrorists, whose goal is to destroy the unity of the country," he said. Turkey is marking the 84th anniversary of the founding of the republic by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. 
Meanwhile, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari told the BBC on Sunday that any incursion by Turkish troops into northern Iraq will have grave consequences. Zebari described the ongoing crisis as very serious and says Turkey lacks the will to search for peaceful solutions. (Turkish Weekly, Radikal, Anadolu news agency- 29/10/07; AP, BBC - 28/10/07)

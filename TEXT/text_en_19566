BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission condemned on Monday (September 24th) the bomb attack in Pristina that killed three people, injured ten others and caused heavy damage. Krisztina Nagy, spokeswoman for EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, said "We trust that the police will carry out an investigation ... and that the perpetrators will be brought to justice." 
Meanwhile, Kosovo government spokesman Avni Arifi said the explosion was not related to ongoing negotiations regarding Kosovo's final status. Police suggest it may have been the result of organised crime groups settling scores.

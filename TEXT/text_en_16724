ANKARA, Turkey -- UN Secretary General Kofi Annan met with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul in Ankara on Wednesday (6 September), and praised Turkey's recent decision to contribute troops to the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon. Annan hailed the decision as a "sign of international solidarity" and dismissed concerns that the Turkish soldiers could end up in clashes with Hezbollah.
Protests against the decision continued on Wednesday. According to local media reports, some 35 people were arrested in Ankara after demonstrations turned violent. 
Meanwhile, Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis confirmed in a phone conversation Wednesday with Annan that Athens would send a navy frigate to Lebanon within days. Greece pledged the assistance last month. (Sabah, Zaman, Kathimerini - 07/09/06; NTV, ANA-MPA - 06/09/06)

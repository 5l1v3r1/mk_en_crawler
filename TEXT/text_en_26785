BUCHAREST, Romania -- Heavy snow and high winds lashed Bulgaria and Romania on Monday (February 8th), causing huge transportation headaches in both countries. In Bulgaria, the situation is the worst in the southeast, where a state of emergency has been declared. Power is out in nearly 150 villages. Snow drifts in the northeast are as high as 1.5m to 2m. 
Bucharest is battling to dig out as well. Road travel is now banned, following three dozen accidents in one day in the capital. In Turkey, heavy rains battered Thrace and the coast of the Aegean Sea. Many roads are closed and one person died after being struck by lightning. (Dnevnik, AFP, CNN Turk - 08/02/10)

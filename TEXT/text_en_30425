PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Central Election Commission (CEC) confirmed on Thursday (December 16th) that voting will be repeated in three municipalities due to irregularities during the December 12th snap elections. The decision was made following recommendations by the Elections Complaint and Appeal Panel (ECAP), which found major violations in these towns. The ECAP reported irregularities at 30 polling stations in Skenderaj/Srbica, Drenas/Gllogovac and Decan/Decane. In Skenderaj/Srbica alone, about 8,000 votes were stolen. The do-overs are expected in early January. (RTK, Kohavision, TV 21 - 16/12/10)

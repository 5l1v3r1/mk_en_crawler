BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Director-General of the European Commission's (EC) Enlargement Directorate Michael Leigh presented a "roadmap" Thursday (May 8th) to Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki to liberalise Macedonia's visa regime with the EU. Describing it as "a balanced approach and ... tailor made", Leigh said it identifies "specific measures authorities need to take and we believe that the benchmarks are realistic and achievable". 
The plan covers the security of personal documents, border management, illegal migration and the fight against organised crime and corruption. EC Vice-President Jacques Barrot described it as "another important step towards EU integration". A visa relaxation agreement with the EU took effect in January. The following month, Macedonia began technical negotiations on fully liberalising the visa regime. (Dnevnik, Utrinski Vesnik - 09/05/08; MIA, Makfax, MRT - 08/05/08)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of High Representative (OHR) issued a statement Tuesday (6 June) criticising the decision of RS representatives in the Police Directorate to withdraw their active participation. The OHR stressed that police reform is crucial to fighting organised crime, adding that any setbacks in this process would discourage the EU from liberalising the visa regime for BiH citizens. Brussels wants BiH authorities to demonstrate they are serious about security, the statement said. As a positive example, it cited the State Border Service, saying this institution -- now in its sixth year of operation -- has been successful in preventing trafficking, smuggling and money laundering attempts.

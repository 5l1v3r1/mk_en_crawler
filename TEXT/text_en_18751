SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Sofia Military Court on Tuesday (February 6th) acquitted the former head of the National Fire Brigade, General Kiril Voynov, of abuse of office charges. Prosecutors filed them in relation to illegal benefits Voynov allegedly provided to his subordinates. He still faces separate charges of embezzlement, stemming from the issuance of construction permits. Voynov resigned from his post in late August, after prosecutors confirmed the charges against him.

WASHINGTON, United States -- Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns told VOA on Thursday (January 11th) that a solution to the issue of Kosovo's future status could be found by April. He added that UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari would launch talks with the ethnic Albanian government of Kosovo and with leaders in Belgrade soon after the January 21st elections in Serbia. A decision could then be made within one or two months, he added. Separately, the BBC is reporting that Ahtisaari plans to present his status proposal in Pristina and Belgrade on February 2nd, and that the UN Security Council would vote on the final proposal by April.

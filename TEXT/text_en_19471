ANKARA, Turkey -- The ruling Justice and Development Party and the opposition Nationalist Movement Party agreed on Thursday (January 24th) to work together to lift the ban on wearing headscarves on university campuses. Together, the two parties have enough votes in parliament to amend articles 10 and 42 of the constitution and remove the ban. On Friday, they kick off two days of talks regarding technicalities. The Sabah newspaper describes it as a historic political agreement for Turkey, though the reaction of the secular judiciary remains to be seen. Headscarves were banned in schools and universities in 1980. Many women refuse to attend university because of the ban. (Zaman, Sabah - 25/01/08; NTV, BBC, Reuters - 24/01/08)

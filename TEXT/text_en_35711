TIRANA, Albania -- The government Wednesday (2 June) adopted a draft bill on combating the financing of terrorism. The measure allows the judiciary to arrest those suspected of collaborating with terrorists or providing financial aid. The bill is considered a major weapon in the fight against organised crime and terrorism.
In other news, Washington is commending the political co-operation demonstrated by Albanian parties in the process of writing the property bill. On Thursday, the charge d'affaires of the US Embassy in Tirana, Steven Zate, was quoted by Albanian Daily News as saying "the United States and other countries regard the majority-opposition collaboration as a very good opportunity towards Albania's membership in NATO and the EU."

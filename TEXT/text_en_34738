SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The armed forces of the BiH Federation will skip part of their training this year due to insufficient financial resources, according to Maj Gen Ramiz Drekovic, deputy commander of the Federation Army. Despite the cuts, Drekovic insisted in a press interview Wednesday (13 August) that combat capabilities would not be affected. He also confirmed that problems with unpaid bills have led to power cuts, disconnected phone service, and suspended water supplies for several units. "Provision of quality food to soldiers is suffering due to financial problems," he added. (BH Radio 1, BBC - 13/08/03)

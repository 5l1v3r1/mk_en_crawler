SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Boris Trajkovski met on Monday (24 March) with Gen Pierre Maral, the commander of the EU force that is replacing the NATO mission in Macedonia at the end of the month. Maral promised that the takeover would be smooth, resulting in no security vacuum.
In other news, the government decided Monday to propose a measure that would allow authorities to tap phones and email communications, as part of surveillance efforts aimed at organised crime. To take effect, parliament would first have to amend the constitution. (Dnevnik, Utrinski Vesnik,- 25/03/03; MIA, Makfax, A1 TV - 24/03/03)

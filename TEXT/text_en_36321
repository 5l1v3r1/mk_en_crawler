PORTOROZ, Slovenia -- Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic warned that keeping his country in international isolation could breed extremism and instability. He also said that victory by "retrograde extremist parties" in next month's presidential election would represent a dramatic step backwards. Draskovic urged all pro-democracy parties in Serbia to unite against the ultranationalist Radicals and their candidate, Tomislav Nikolic. Draskovic was in Ljubljana for a meeting of the foreign ministers of the 17-member Central European Initiative.
In other news, Serbian Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic announced that the government plans to propose slashing the corporate tax rate from 14 per cent to 10 per cent, making it the lowest in Europe. According to Dinkic, the move would attract foreign investment and discourage corporate tax evasion. (AFP, UPI - 25/05/04)

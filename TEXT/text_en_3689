Former communist dictator Josip Broz Tito has been dead for years, but his image lives on. It can be found on a host of souvenir items, from teacups to pairs of socks. His family, upset by what they see as the trivialisation of Tito's historical legacy, have taken steps to assert their legal rights. 
Those seeking to produce Tito souvenirs now need to obtain permission from the family. Permission fees will help support a foundation for the gifted and talented, set up by Tito's son, Miso, and granddaughter Sasa. 
Sasa has also signed an agreement giving Brijuni National Park the right to use Tito's name, signature and image for a variety of commercial and touristic purposes. The deal clears the way for the park to sell authorised Tito merchandise, with 10% of the proceeds going to an orphanage in Zagreb. 
"We want to respect the law," says park director Ratomir Ivicic. "After the Broz family decided to protect Tito's name, we called them and it took us just two minutes to arrange a deal. We consider 'Tito' a brand name of Brijuni and we will develop our promotional strategy in agreement with the Broz family." 
Tito had a special emotional attachment to Brijuni, Sasa explains. The late leader spent his summers there, together with famous guests from the world of politics, entertainment and the arts. 
Brijuni Park will offer tourists a full range of Tito memorabilia, ranging from 3 euros to 200 euros (the price of a golden brooch with his signature). Those wishing for a more authentic Tito experience can take a ride around the islands in his famous Cadillac. At 700 euros an hour, it's a luxury. 
The Broz family acknowledges that it probably won't succeed in eliminating illegal merchandise, but it hopes at least to dampen the trend. As for visitors to Brijuni, buying a family-sanctioned souvenir is the closest they'll come to a welcome from Tito himself

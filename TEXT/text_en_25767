PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The leader of the main opposition Movement for Change (PzP), Nebojsa Medojevic, was attacked outside his home in Podgorica, PzP spokesman Koca Pavlovic said on Saturday (February 20th). He says the attacker tried to strike Medojevic and warned him "to stop mentioning the name of Branislav Micunovic". He is a wealthy businessman that Medojevic has described as "the most powerful person" in the country, allegedly controlling even the police. The PzP says the attacker, who is in custody, is one of Mucinovic's relatives. (Tanjug, B92, DPA, RTCG - 20/02/10)

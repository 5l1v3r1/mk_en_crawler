BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Harri Holkeri told reporters on Monday (29 September) that the first round of direct talks between Serbian and Kosovo authorities should "focus on concrete issues". The meeting will be "short", he said, citing transport, energy, missing persons and refugee return as likely topics. EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and NATO Secretary General Lord George Robertson will take part in the meeting, he added. Holkeri was in Belgrade for talks with Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic and Deputy Prime Minister Nebojsa Covic, who is expected to head the Serbian delegation. From Pristina, Parliament Speaker Nexhat Daci said Monday that no discussion of Kosovo's final status would occur until the second phase of talks. (AFP, B92, BBC, Tanjug, FoNet - 29/09/03)

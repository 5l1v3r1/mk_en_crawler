PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The level of public dissatisfaction with government institutions is growing, compared to a couple of months ago, with the courts still the leading source of frustration. The UNDP published its "Early Warning Report" on Saturday (June 19th), based on research conducted in April and May. The surveys found that only 29% of the public is satisfied with the government's work, down 7% from January. Unemployment and poverty are seen as the main problems facing Kosovo. According to the report, the public is most satisfied with the performance of KFOR and the Kosovo Police. Satisfaction with EULEX grew compared to January.

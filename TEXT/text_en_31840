ANKARA, Turkey -- The High Election Board (YSK) announced on Thursday (2 January) it might postpone the by-election in the province of Siirt by one month. Under new election legislation adopted by parliament and signed by President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, by-elections should be held within 90 days of regular elections. YSK had used the former law, which stipulated 60 days, as the basis for choosing 9 February as the date for the by-election. The vote will now likely will be moved to 9 March. It is expected to give ruling party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan the chance to win a seat in parliament, a springboard to the premiership. (Anadolu Agency, TRT - 02/01/03)

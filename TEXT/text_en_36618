SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The international rating agency Standard & Poor's announced Friday (30 July) that it has assigned Macedonia a BB/B foreign currency and BB+/B local currency sovereign credit rating, with a positive outlook. This marks the first time Skopje has received a credit rating. The agency said the ratings are supported by rapid progress towards political stability, driven by the Ohrid Framework Agreement and the prospect of EU membership. The major risks cited by S&P are interethnic relations and structural and governance issues. (S&P press release - 30/07/04)

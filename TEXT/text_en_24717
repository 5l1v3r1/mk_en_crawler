PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX chief prosecutor Theo Jacobs said on Friday (June 5th) the EU mission has launched a new investigation into a February 2001 attack on a bus near Podujevo, which killed ten Serbs and injured 11 others. Jacobs said the case will be forwarded to the special prosecutor's office in charge of war crimes cases. In March, Kosovo's Supreme Court, whose council also included EULEX judges, decided to release the sole defendant in the case, Florim Ejupi, for lack of proof. Ejupi had earlier received a maximum 40-year prison sentence in connection with the bus attack. (Contact Plus, Tanjug, B92 - 05/06/09)

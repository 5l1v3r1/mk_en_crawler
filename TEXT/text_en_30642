ANKARA, Turkey -- Political officials criticised the army Thursday (April 7th) for allegedly trying to interfere in the work of the judiciary. The reaction came after the General Staff issued a statement Wednesday, saying it has "difficulty understanding the arrest of 163 active-duty and reserve officers" detained as part of investigations into the so-called Sledgehammer plot to topple the government. Parliament Speaker Mehmet Ali Sahin said the army should not interfere, as this may be interpreted as an attempt to meddle in the work of the judiciary. Ruling Justice and Development Party lawmaker Suat Kilic slammed the army's statement as "wrong". (Hurriyet, Zaman - 07/04/11)

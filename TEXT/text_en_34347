SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Polling stations opened across Bulgaria early Sunday (26 October) for local elections that many observers see as a possible prelude to early parliamentary elections. A Gallup poll on the eve of the vote predicted victory for the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) in 120 out of the country's 263 municipalities. The results showed a dramatic slide in confidence in the ruling Simeon II National Movement, which was projected to win no more than 10 per cent of seats in the municipal councils. Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg's party was also seen as unlikely to elect a mayor in any of the 30 largest cities or towns. Polls also found that 45 per cent of registered voters will stay home. A total of 147 political parties and coalitions registered to run. (BNT, BNR, Mediapool, bTV - 26/10/03; AFP, BTA, Dnevnik, Standart - 25/10/03)

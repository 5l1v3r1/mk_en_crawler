TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu has vetoed and sent back to Parliament for reconsideration a new law on internal auditing in the public sector. His office issued a statement Tuesday (May 15th) saying Moisiu views the law -- passed a few days ago by the ruling majority and without the opposition's consent -- as violating constitutional provisions regarding distribution of powers. This is the second bill vetoed by Moisiu in recent weeks. The first involved a controversial measure regarding fines on businesses.

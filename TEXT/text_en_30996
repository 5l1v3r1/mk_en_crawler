BUCHAREST, Romania -- Foreign Ministry State Secretary Bogdan Aurescu and visiting US Under-Secretary of State Ellen Tauscher announced on Tuesday (May 3rd) that US missile interceptors will be deployed at the Deveselu Airbase in southern Romania, near the Bulgarian border. "This choice contributes to the security of Romania, the US and NATO Allies," Aurescu told a press conference in Slatina, the capital of Olt County. Tauscher said "Romania will play a major role in the new NATO missile defence capability." The estimated $400m cost of the missile defence system deployment and annual maintenance costs of $20m will be footed by the US. About 200 US troops will be serving at the Deveselu base.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Former President Emil Constantinescu was elected as the leader of the People's Action Party, a new rightist group established earlier this year. During the party's first congress, held at the weekend, the 1,200 delegates also elected members of the 15-member executive bureau. According to the party, Constantinescu will likely run in the 2004 presidential race.
In other news, the European Commission Delegation Chief in Romania Jonathan Scheele is urging NGOs to become actively involved in supporting and promoting European values. His call came during a seminar held in Bucharest late last week. (ACT Media, Nine o'Clock - 14/07/03; Rompres, Mediafax - 12/07/03)

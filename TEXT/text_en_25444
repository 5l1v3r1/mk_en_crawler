ANKARA, Turkey -- Almost 10,000 people took part on Friday (September 25th) in a peaceful rally in the southeast city of Diyarbakir, calling for a ceasefire between the Turkish army and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The demonstrators marched through the city centre, carrying signs praising PKK terrorists as "martyrs". The armed conflict has taken almost 45,000 lives, most of them Kurdish rebels.

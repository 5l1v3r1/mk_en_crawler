PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX Commander Yves de Kermabon said on Wednesday (October 15th) the deployment of the EU mission in Kosovo has no linkage to Serbia's EU accession. "These two processes are parallel. I am in charge of deploying the mission in Kosovo, and on my side, no such conditions will be set," he said. De Kermabon reiterated that the mission will deploy on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 1244, which Belgrade recognises, and on the basis of a decision by all 27 EU member states.
In other news Wednesday, EU special representative to Kosovo Pieter Feith said EULEX may receive some form of approval from the UN for its operations in Kosovo. Feith also stressed Serbia's co-operation is necessary for enabling deployment in northern Kosovo "since the Kosovo Serb community receives instructions from Belgrade".

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament adopted the bill on classified information Tuesday (10 February). It sets rules for the use of and access to classified information, and establishes a mechanism for preventing the abuse of such information. It also requires co-operation with international organisations and foreign states in the area of classified information exchange.
In other news Tuesday, the EU published a blacklist of Macedonians involved in extremist activities and considered to be hampering democratic processes and stability in the country. The list includes 12 people, most of whom are members of the now disbanded National Liberation Army. However, two are ethnic Macedonians, including the former commander of a disbanded elite police unit. The United States has published its own blacklist, to which it recently added three more ethnic Albanians from Macedonia. (MIA, Makfax, A1 TV - 10/02/04; Utrinski Vesnik - 09/02/04)

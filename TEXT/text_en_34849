ZAGREB, Croatia -- Authorities reported on Sunday (3 August) the arrest of a Serb man who is wanted for war crimes. Nikola Knezevic, 31, was picked up at a border crossing with Bosnia and Herzegovina. He is suspected of burning houses and robbing Croats in the village of Maovica near the Serb stronghold of Knin during the 1991-1995 conflict. Knezevic will be tried in Croatia, as his alleged offences are not grave enough to be dealt with by the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. (AFP - 03/08/03)

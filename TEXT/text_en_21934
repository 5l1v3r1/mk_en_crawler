ATHENS, Greece -- A union protest in Athens turned violent Tuesday (October 21st) after riot police fired tear gas at a group of demonstrators throwing stones. The street protest was part of a nationwide, 24-hour strike called by Greece's major trade unions, the General Confederation of Workers of Greece and the Civil Servants Supreme Administrative Council. The strike was in response to the government's taxation policy, provisions of the 2009 state budget, the social security system and the planned privatisation of state-owned companies. Thousands of people participated in the demonstration, causing massive disruption of public transport. It also crippled schools, universities, banks and post and tax offices.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Local leaders criticised on Tuesday (June 23rd) Serbian President Boris Tadic's visit to Banja Luka, arguing that he voiced support only for Bosnian Serb leaders. Bosniak member of the tripartite presidency Haris Silajdzic accused Tadic of violating the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, during his visit Monday with Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik. According to the Croat member of the presidency, Zeljko Komsic, Tadic's statements represent interference in BiH's internal affairs.

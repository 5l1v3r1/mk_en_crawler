SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The foreign ministry announced on Tuesday (8 August) that Warsaw has decided to ease the visa regime for BiH citizens transiting via Poland. Holders of BiH passports would not need visas for transits up to five days via Polish territory, as long as the travellers have visas or travel permits issued by any of the EU states or states forming the so-called Schengen group.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Based on 83% of ballots, turnout in local elections Sunday (October 28th) was 42.4%, another record low. Preliminary results show the Citizens for Bulgaria's European Development (GERB) won in Sofia and Plovdiv. GERB leader Boyko Borisov won a second term as mayor of Sofia, with almost 53% of the vote, while Slavcho Atanasov, backed by VMRO and GERB, won almost 56% of the vote in Plovdiv. 
The Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) managed to keep Varna, where Kiril Yordanov, the incumbent, landed a third term. The situation remains unclear in Burgas, where Dimitar Nikolov (GERB) leads with 42.66%, but faces a run-off against Valeri Simeonov (Attack), who won 22.84% of the vote.

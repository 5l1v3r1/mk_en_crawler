BELGRADE, Serbia -- The ruling Democratic Party-New Serbia (DSS-NS) coalition is threatening to initiate a motion for dismissal against President Boris Tadic if he signs the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU, NS leader and outgoing Infrastructure Minister Velimir Ilic warned on Sunday (April 13th). "We advise President Tadic and his associates not to play games with Serbia and not to sign anything because they will have a big problem on their hands," he said. Ilic, a close ally of Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, the DSS leader, reiterated that signing the SAA equals accepting Kosovo's independence. 
According to a recently changed law regarding the presidency, a third of MPs could propose parliamentary debate on impeachment if they believe the president has violated the constitution. The process continues from there, moving next to the constitutional court, then back to parliament. On Friday, the Vecernje Novosti newspaper reported that Tadic would claim that the Vienna convention gives him the right to sign international treaties such as the SAA.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Visiting Sarajevo on Sunday (1 December), Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Manuel Durao Barroso called on BiH authorities to continue reforms. Following talks with the BiH Presidency Chairman Mirko Sarovic, Barroso said Lisbon follows and would continue to support the development of BiH and its institutions. He stressed that the recent fair and free parliamentary elections -- for the first time administered by the BiH authorities -- not only marked the end of the transition period but should ensure a government, stable enough to proceed on the way of Euro-Atlantic integration.
In other news Sunday, a spokesman for the international community's High Representative in BiH, Paddy Ashdown, said Ashdown may impose the new draft law on the BiH Council of Ministers this week. It would be based on the agreement reached among the BiH Parliamentary powers last week and would envision eight ministries and a chairman at the central level.

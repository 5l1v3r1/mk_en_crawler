BERLIN, Germany -- Turkish State Minister Mustafa Said Yazicioglu is leading a team of investigators making an emergency visit to Germany, in light of two consecutive fires in buildings housing mostly ethnic Turks. The first, early Monday (February 4th) in the town of Ludwigshafen, left nine Turks dead and 60 injured. The second fire, in the town of Herne on Tuesday, caused no injuries. "We will closely watch the results of the investigation. I hope that no act of xenophobia is involved," Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told parliament Tuesday. Experts are working to determine if arson caused the fires. (Radikal, Focus, Turkish Daily News, Turkish Press, Xinhua, Zaman, Sabah - 06/02/08; Reuters - 05/02/08)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbs must vote in Kosovo's elections to gain more influence in running the province, US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Marc Grossman said in Pristina on Thursday (30 September). Earlier in the day, he visited Belgrade to try to persuade Serbia's leaders to support the elections. Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica has urged the Serb minority to boycott the vote. Serbian President Boris Tadic conveyed Serbia's concerns about security in the province to Grossman but promised to raise the issue of the elections with the government in Belgrade.

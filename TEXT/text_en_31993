BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- On Monday (21 October), Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic congratulated Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic on the victory of his Democratic Party of Socialists in Sunday's parliamentary election. Djindjic said that the two republics will now be able to focus on formation of the loose alliance that was agreed upon with the mediation of the EU, and would be able to work together to join European institutions. But one of Djukanovic's top aides, Igor Luksic, said the victory signals that the majority of Montenegrins support independence for their country. Under the EU-sponsored deal, either republic can opt out of the new federation after three years.
OSCE and EU officials also congratulated authorities in Montenegro on the elections. During a delegation visit to Belgrade, however, EU foreign ministers called on Serbia and Montenegro to finalise the texts of the new constitutional charter in order to proceed with admission to the Council of Europe.

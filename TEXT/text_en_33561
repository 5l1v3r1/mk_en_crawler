BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian Constitutional Court decided Thursday (18 September) to keep the minimum turnout requirement for the presidential elections. Under the requirement, at least 50 per cent of eligible voters must go to the polls during the first round in order for the outcome to be recognised as valid. An identical requirement for the second round has been dropped. Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic, amid widespread criticism, said he believes the elections will be successful. Meanwhile, Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) leader and former Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica has said that he will not run. (B92, BBC, Tanjug, FoNet - 18/09/03)

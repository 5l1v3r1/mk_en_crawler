SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Economy Minister Fatmir Besimi said on Wednesday (18 January) that the privatisation of the power utility ESM Distribucja would continue, regardless of ongoing demonstrations in Skopje. Organisers staged a third day of protests Wednesday, insisting the privitisation, part of the programme to restructure the energy sector, would lead to enormous hikes in the price of electricity. Besimi says the independent energy regulatory commission sets prices. The minister also warned of the negative impact protests could have on the privatisation process. Short-listed candidate buyers are currently conducting due diligence on ESM. (Telma TV, Makfax - 18/01/06)

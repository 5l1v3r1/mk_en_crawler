SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Croatian President Ivo Josipovic on Thursday (April 15th) visited the central village of Ahmici and paid tribute to Bosniak civilians murdered by Croatian forces in 1993. Accompanying him were BiH's Catholic leader, Cardinal Vinko Puljic, and Muslim grand mufti Mustafa Ceric, the head of the Islamic community in BiH. Both clerics described the visit as an important step in restoring and strengthening mutual trust. From Ahmici, Josipovic travelled to the nearby village of Krizancevo Selo and laid a wreath in memory of Croatian civilians murdered by members of BiH's Army, also in 1993. "We are uniting here ... to remember the victims and to say 'never again'," Josipovic said. (AP, Radio Free Europe, Glas Javnosti, Tanjug, Nacional - 15/04/10)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- British Minister for Europe Denis MacShane visited Pristina on Tuesday (26 October) and urged the international community to give more power to Kosovo authorities. MacShane also said those authorities must ensure that "no Serb living in Kosovo has to walk in fear, no Serb is worried about his churches, no Serb is worried about his house". 
Later in the day, MacShane visited Macedonia, where he discussed the upcoming referendum on the country's new local decentralisation laws, which redraw the borders of some municipalities. The laws are an important component of the Ohrid Peace Agreement, MacShane said. (Utrinski Vesnik, Dnevnik, Vest - 27/10/04; AFP, Makfax, A1 TV - 26/10/04)

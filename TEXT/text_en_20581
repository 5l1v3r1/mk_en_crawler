ZAGREB, Croatia -- The ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the Croatian Pensioners' Party signed a coalition agreement Monday (December 10th). Thus, the country's new government will most likely be formed by the HDZ, which won 68 seats in parliament -- not enough for an outright majority in elections last month. The HDZ said on Monday it is also negotiating with the coalition of the Croatian Peasant Party and the Social Liberal Party. (Vjesnik - 11/12/07; HINA, HRT, Poslovni Dnevnik, Index.hr - 10/12/07)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- During a session Wednesday (2 February), the European Parliament's (EP) Foreign Affairs Committee voiced serious concerns over the economic and social situation in the Western Balkans and called on the EU to adopt a clearer strategy for integration. In a draft resolution, the committee also urged the states to work together to improve regional infrastructure, and in most cases, co-operate better with the UN war crimes tribunal. The panel stressed the importance of settling the political crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina and apprehending indictees Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. For Croatia, it recommended enhanced ties with The Hague tribunal and the arrest of fugitive General Ante Gotovina. Serbia-Montenegro was urged to resolve problems stemming from the federal union and the status of Kosovo. The resolution cited achieving greater political stability, implementing administrative reform and boosting the fight against crime and corruption as major priorities for Albania, while calling on Macedonia to implement key peace accords, particularly decentralisation.

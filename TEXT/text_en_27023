ANKARA, Turkey/BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised on Saturday (March 6th) the "Armenian genocide" resolution passed by the US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, warning it could damage the US-Turkey relations. "Let me say quite clearly that this resolution will not harm us. But it will damage bilateral relations between countries, their interests and their visions for the future. We will not be the losers," said Erdogan at a business forum in Istanbul. Turkish ambassador to the US Namik Tan arrived home Saturday after being recalled for consultations on the issue. 
In other news, thousands of Kurds gathered in Brussels on Saturday to protest recent raids and arrests of people suspected of being linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). As many as 30 Kurds, including former lawmakers and prominent activists, were arrested in Belgium Thursday as part of a police operation against the terrorist organization. Eight remain in custody on charges of helping to recruit fighters for the PKK. (Reuters, Hurriyet, Xinhua, AP, RIA Novosti, Euronews - 06/03/10)

BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Iraq is criticising Turkey's restrictions of water flow along rivers on its territory as "unacceptable", and is calling for an agreement to regulate the issue. Government spokesperson Ali al-Dabbagh said on Tuesday (May 24th) that Baghdad will use all its diplomatic ties to guarantee his country's share of the water. He warned that parliament will not approve a strategic co-operation council with Turkey unless Ankara agrees to sign the deal. Iraq and Syria have frequently complained that Turkey monopolises waters of both the Euphrates and Tigris rivers via dams on both rivers. Turkey says it ensures better management and constant water flow downstream. (Buratha News, France 24 - 24/05/11)

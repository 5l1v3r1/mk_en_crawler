PRAGUE, Czech Republic -- Defence Minister Karel Kuhnl met with his Serbia-Montenegro counterpart Zoran Stankovic on Monday (10 April), assuring him that the Czech Republic strongly supports Serbia-Montenegro's Euro-Atlantic integration bid and defence reform efforts. However, Kuhnl added, Prague expects Belgrade to fully implement its obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal. For his part, Stankovic insisted the Serbia-Montenegro Army is not sheltering fugitive Ratko Mladic and that Belgrade authorities are determined to find him and hand over him over to The Hague.

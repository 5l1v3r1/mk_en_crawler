BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- US Ambassador to Serbia-Montenegro Michael Polt said on Wednesday (19 October) that Washington's financial aid to the federal union might be withheld again, unless Ratko Mladic is arrested and extradited to The Hague tribunal quickly. Western officials have said recently they expect Mladic and fellow top war crimes indictee Radovan Karadzic to be in The Hague by December, in time for the 10th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords.
In other news, Serbia-Montenegro's parliament plans to debate on Friday the resignation of Prvoslav Davinic from the post of federal defence minister and the appointment of Zoran Stankovic to the position. Davinic stepped down over a procurement scandal. (Danas - 20/10/05; Beta - 19/10/05)

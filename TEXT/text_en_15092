BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian government and the Austrian consortium of investors in the troubled GSM carrier Mobtel have reached an agreement to resolve controversial issues surrounding the company, Serbian Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic announced on Tuesday (28 February). He told a news conference that the two sides have agreed to form a new firm between the Serbian state-run postal operator PTT Srbija and a consortium of Austrian investors, controlling 70 per cent and 30 per cent of capital respectively. The company would be put up for sale in an international tender next month, with revenues distributed between the co-owners.
In other news Tuesday, lawyers representing Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) outlined their genocide case against Serbia-Montenegro before the International Court of Justice. They said they would rely heavily on evidence collected by UN prosecutors to prove that Belgrade played a role in atrocities committed during the 1992-1995 conflict.

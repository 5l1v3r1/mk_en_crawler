PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Attackers threw stones at two cars driven by Kosovo Serbs in the Albanian part of Suvi Dol village late Saturday (November 8th). Northern Mitrovica police spokesperson Milija Milosevic said on Sunday the rock-throwers damaged the cars but injured nobody. The village of Suvi Dol is a few kilometres away from the divided town of Mitrovica, whose northern part has a predominantly Serb population. About 40 Serb families live in the village, in which Kosovo Albanians are preponderant. (Blic, B92, Tanjug - 09/11/08)

ANKARA, Turkey -- A separatist Kurdish group called Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK) on Thursday (November 4th) claimed responsibility for Sunday's bombing in the heart of Istanbul that injured 32 people. In a statement posted on its website, TAK said the attack was "an act of revenge" aimed at Turkish police. The group said also that it does not recognise the unilateral ceasefire announced by the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The PKK has denied any links to the attack, and instead, extended its unilateral ceasefire with Turkey until next summer's general elections. (CNN, AP, AFP, Bloomberg - 04/11/10)

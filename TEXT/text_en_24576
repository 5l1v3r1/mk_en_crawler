BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic is calling for a debate on possible changes to Serbia's constitution. Speaking to members of his Democratic Party on Wednesday (May 6th), Tadic explained that Serbia must undergo structural change, as an efficient constitutional order is a precondition for successful development. He said constitutional order should guarantee balanced development in all regions of the country and should specify the jurisdiction of each institution. Tadic stressed that Serbia "is traditionally a decentralised country and it is not natural for there to be only one region where authority is accurately defined", a likely reference to the law on Vojvodina's status, which parliament is considering. Tadic first indicated interest in amending the constitution a couple of weeks ago, when he discussed reducing the number of seats in parliament from 250 to 150. He also called for a new law on political parties to make financing more transparent. (Tanjug, RTV - 06/05/09)

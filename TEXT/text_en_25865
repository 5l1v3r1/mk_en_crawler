SARAJEVO (BiH) -- The 12th inter-parliamentary meeting between Bosnia and Herzegovina and European Parliament (EP) ended in Sarajevo on Tuesday (February 16th). Members of the EP delegation urged the country to proceed with constitutional changes, saying it would help BiH institutions meet EU obligations for integration. Delegation head Eduard Kukan told journalists that BiH should amend its constitution to the European Convention on Human Rights and scrap discriminatory provisions against minorities in line with a recent decision by the European Court of Human Rights. There is enough time, Kukan said, for authorities to approve the changes before the general elections in October. (BHRT, Fena, RTRS - 16/02/10)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic called on Serbian authorities Friday (7 November) to extradite the four generals who have been indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal. He argued that refusing to hand over the suspects would halt the country's European integration. "Absence of co-operation would close the doors to continuing the integration process for both Serbia and Montenegro," Marovic said, adding that the scandal over the extradition of the four generals was detracting attention from the search for former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic.
Meanwhile, Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic also called for Mladic's arrest. In a press interview released Saturday, Svilanovic said the arrest is a key to holding trials against all other UN war crimes suspects. (Tanjug, Vecernje Novosti, TV Pink - 08/11/03; AFP - 07/11/03)

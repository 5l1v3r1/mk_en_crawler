SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime MiNister Boyko Borisov reiterated on Monday (March 1st) Bulgaria's commitment to current energy projects, highlighting the country's goal of diversifying gas supply. Borisov spoke at a meeting with EU Energy Commissioner Gunther Oettinger, ahead of an Energy Security conference hosted by Sofia on Tuesday. Regarding projects with Russia, Borisov said the South Stream gas pipeline is not a rival to the Nabucco pipeline and there should be no problem building both. Moscow has expressed concerns that Sofia may give up on South Stream if Nabucco succeeds. As for building the controversial nuclear plant in the town of Belene, Borisov said the country has already invested too much to abandon it. (Darik, Capital, Mediapool - 02/03/10)

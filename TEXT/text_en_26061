SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Mostar city administration workers walked off their jobs Monday (November 16th) to protest the City Council's inability to elect a mayor and adopt the 2009 budget. The trade union representing fire-fighters even threatened to block all entrances to the city on Tuesday. Despite numerous attempts, Mostar has no mayor and no budget adopted because of disagreements among City Council members. High Representative Valentin Inzko warned last week that he would have to take the initiative after the City Council failed to elect a mayor for a 17th time.
In other news Monday, BiH confirmed its first swine flu death. A 40-year old man from Mostar passed away late Sunday. (Dnevni Avaz, Fena, RTRS, Srna, BHRT - 16/11/09)

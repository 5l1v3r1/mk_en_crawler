ANKARA, Turkey -- Talks on a possible merger or pre-election coalition between Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) and the smaller Democratic Left Party (DSP) have failed to yield an agreement, local newspapers reported on Tuesday (May 15th). Party sources say the main sticking point was the distribution of seats in the future parliament. CHP reportedly says DSP should be more reasonable and realistic on the matter. 
Meanwhile, another massive rally in support of the secular state is planned for Sunday in the Black Sea city of Samsun. A weekend rally in Izmir drew nearly 1.5 million people. (Sabah, Radikal, Zaman - 15/05/07; NTV - 14/05/07)

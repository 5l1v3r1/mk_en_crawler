BELGRADE, Serbia -- The OSCE expressed strong concern Friday (September 29th) over parliament's re-approval of controversial changes to Serbia's broadcasting law. OSCE Ambassador to Serbia Hans Ola Urstad said his organisation regretted the fact that deputies adopted the same amendments, vetoed by President Boris Tadic in late July because they undermined the independence of the Republican Broadcasting Agency, and threatened the principle of equality in awarding licences. 
On Saturday, the Independent Association of Serbian Journalists weighed in, saying parliament had demonstrated a shameful neglect of opinions of the president, industry professionals, the OSCE and the European Commission. (Beta, Tanjug - 30/09/06; OSCE website - 29/09/06)

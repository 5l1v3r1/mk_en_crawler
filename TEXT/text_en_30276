ANKARA, Turkey -- Cyprus is ready to start direct talks with Turkey to find a solution to the Mediterranean island's longstanding division, Cypriot Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou said in an interview with the Ankara-based daily Hurriyet on Friday (December 17th). "We should start the direct exchange of opinions. We should directly share our demands and our complaints," Kyprianou said."We know that Turkey is opposed to official negotiations, but we can meet in an unofficial format." 
Ankara has said it favours quadrilateral meetings involving Greece, Turkey, and Greek and Turkish Cypriots. (Hurriyet - 17/12/10)

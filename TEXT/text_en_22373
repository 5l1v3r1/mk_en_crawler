THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal's chief prosecutor, Serge Brammertz, wants Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj to be represented by lawyers. Seselj is on trial for incitement of nationalism and of ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, along with murder, torture, imprisonment and deportation. According to Brammertz, the defendant is hindering the procedure by conducting his own defence.
In other news, the defence team of Johan Tarculovski filed an appeal against the sentence handed down to him by The Hague tribunal last month. The former Macedonian police official was given 12 years in prison for his role in violence committed against ethnic Albanians during a two-day police raid in August 2001.

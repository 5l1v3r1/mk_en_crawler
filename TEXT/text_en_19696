BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Wednesday (November 21st) that Croatia could wrap up its EU accession negotiations in early 2009, marking the first time Rehn has indicated a deadline for completing the talks. He stressed however that negotiations would continue until Croatia meets all membership criteria. He described Croatia as one of the best performing countries in Southeast Europe in terms of fighting corruption, but noted "this does not mean there are no serious problems".

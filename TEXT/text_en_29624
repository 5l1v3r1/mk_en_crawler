BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Police in Banja Luka have arrested Zoran Copic, one the closest associates of alleged drug trafficker Darko Saric, media reported on Tuesday (April 26th). Authorities have frozen Copic's assets worth about 15m euros, suspecting that his companies have been used for money laundering. Media reports suggest police have been investigating Copic for months. Saric, who is on the run, and his group already face charges of smuggling 2.5 tonnes of cocaine from South America. (Glas Srpske, RTRS, Radio Free Europe, Beta - 26/04/11)

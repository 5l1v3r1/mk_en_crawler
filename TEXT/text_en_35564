SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament on Tuesday (8 June) approved the nominees for deputy ministerial posts. Three new deputies will join the new cabinet of Prime Minister Hari Kostov; other cabinet members will retain the posts they held under former Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski. The opposition VMRO-DPMNE party boycotted the vote, claiming the list of candidates was not based on qualifications.
In other news, Mile Zecevik was appointed chief of the security and counterintelligence department. He replaces Siljian Avramovski, who has been appointed interior minister. Until now, Zecevik had served as general secretary in Crvenkovski's cabinet. (Utrinski Vesnik, Dnevnik - 09/06/04; A1 TV - 08/06/04)

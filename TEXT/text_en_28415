BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Senate approved on Wednesday (May 12th) updated legislation on the National Integrity Agency (ANI), the country's main corruption-fighting institution. Last month, a ruling by the Constitutional Court substantially trimmed the ANI's authority, stripping it of its right to verify the validity of asset statements filed by senior officials and to seize illegally-acquired assets. Under the new legislation, the ANI will investigate the validity of asset statements, and if it finds irregularities, turn the matter over to the prosecutor's office for criminal offences or to the revenue collection agency. In addition, the ANI will issue public statements containing general data -- for example, the total assets of a public figure -- rather than detailed information on specific holdings.

Protests in Bucharest and Galac were marred by police clashes. The pension cuts and others are to take effect on June 1st.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The Turkish Foreign Ministry has said it welcomes NATO's decision to move its Air Component Command from Italy to Turkey's western province of Izmir. The command will become fully operational next year. The move is part of a major reform of NATO's command structure, approved by alliance defence ministers during a meeting in Brussels on Thursday (12 June). Under the reform, the number of commands will be reduced from 20 to 11 and their responsibilities will be redefined. The defence ministers of the seven countries invited to join the Alliance in 2004 also attended the meeting. NATO ministers praised the invitee nations for the steps taken so far to adapt their forces for participation in alliance structures. (Anadolu Agency - 13/06/03; NATO, Anadolu Agency - 12/06/03)

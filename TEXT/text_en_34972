PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The ruling Democratic Party of Socialists expressed support Thursday (11 December) for Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, who is also party leader. This was in response to accusations by former Interior Minister Andrija Jovicevic, who says Djukanovic was personally involved in the human trafficking scandal involving a young Moldovan woman.

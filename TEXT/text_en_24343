SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The appointment of Austrian diplomat Valentin Inzko as new high representative is almost certain, Austrian media reported on Wednesday (March 11th), citing unnamed foreign ministry sources. According to them, Inzko was appointed EU special representative to BiH on Tuesday. It is up to the Peace Implementation Council to appoint Miroslav Lajcak's successor, likely at its meeting later this month. Lajcak stepped down in early February to become Slovakia's foreign minister.
In other news, BiH signed an agreement with NATO on Wednesday to join the international peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan, NATO spokesman James Appathurai announced. Under the agreement signed in Brussels, BiH was acknowledged as a non-NATO country contributing to the international force in Afghanistan. (Dnevni Avaz, DPA, RTT, MIA, European Voice - 11/03/09)

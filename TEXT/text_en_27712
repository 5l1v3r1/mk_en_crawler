BELGRADE, Serbia -- The leader of the Democratic Christian Party of Serbia, Vladan Batic, on Sunday (October 24th) called on former Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic to surrender, if he considers himself a patriot. Batic, a former justice minister, said that Mladic is holding the nation hostage. He added that other parties should also urge Mladic to turn himself in, for the sake of Serbia and its citizens. Mladic has been on the run since 1995, when the UN war crimes tribunal charged him with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, stemming from the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A Turkish Red Crescent convoy entered northern Iraq on Monday (28 April) to deliver the first shipment of humanitarian aid from Ankara. The seven trucks carrying food, water and medical supplies were headed to hospitals in Kirkuk and Mosul. Ankara reportedly is preparing to dispatch a field hospital to the same area. Ertan Gonen, the chief of the relief agency, told reporters his organisation had already chartered a plane to bring wounded Iraqis from Baghdad to Turkey for treatment.
In Ankara meanwhile, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with US Congressman Robert Wexler on Monday, and assured him that Turkey and the United States were two indispensable partners in the region.
Also Monday, Gen Tommy Franks, the chief of US Central Command, said that the United States does not need to fly any more patrols over the north and south of Iraq from Turkey and Saudi Arabia. The US Air Force used airfields in both countries to enforce the no-fly zones after the end of the 1991 Gulf conflict. (AFP, Anadolu Agency, TRT 2 - 28/04/03)

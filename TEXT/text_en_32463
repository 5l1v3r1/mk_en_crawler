ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivica Racan urged countries in the region to step up co-operation against organised crime Monday (17 March). Following his return from the funeral of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic in Belgrade, Racan said that since organised crime groups in Serbia-Montenegro and Croatia were effectively co-operating, the respective governments must launch joint operations against them.
Also Monday, the leaders of the five ruling parties in Croatia held a brief meeting about Iraq. Zagreb had favoured a second UN resolution before military action against Iraq, a position that is now moot. (Vjesnik, Vecernji List - 18/03/03; HINA - 17/03/03)

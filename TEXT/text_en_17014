HELSINKI, Finland -- The EU defence ministers agreed at a meeting in Finland to reduce the number of international peacekeepers in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to about 1,500. EUFOR currently has more than 6,000 soldiers there. The ministers could not agree on the timing of the move, however. Germany suggests that the downsizing could begin in December, while others argue that the troops remain in place until Kosovo's future status is resolved. (Reuters, Euronews - 03/10/06)

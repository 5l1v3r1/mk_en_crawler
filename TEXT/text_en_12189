SOFIA, Bulgaria -- As expected, the coalition cabinet survived a no-confidence vote Friday (11 February), with 128 of the 236 parliament members present backing the government, 106 voting against it and two abstaining. The outcome was no surprise, given a deal hammered out between the ruling coalition and a minor party, New Time. This is the sixth time Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg's cabinet has survived a no-confidence motion launched by the opposition. Afterwards, Saxe-Coburg expressed satisfaction with the outcome, but vowed to consider some criticisms raised by the opposition. Many regard a cabinet shuffle as a strong possibility.

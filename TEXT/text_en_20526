BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Bulgaria on Thursday (October 11th) warned that it may block the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between the EU and Montenegro. At issue is the way the word "euro" is spelled in the SAA. Visiting Brussels, Bulgaria's European Affairs Minister Gergana Grancharova explained that her country insists the Cyrillic spelling, "evro", appear in Bulgaria's copy of the document. Sofia stresses this is not a dispute with Montenegro, rather, a bid to standarise official use of the Cyrillic alphabet.
Montenegro is expected to seal the SAA on the sidelines of the EU foreign ministers' meeting in Luxemburg early next week. (EUObserver, 24 Chasa - 12/10/07; bTV, Nova TV, BNR - 11/10/07)

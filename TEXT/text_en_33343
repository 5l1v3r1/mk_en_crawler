SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Council of Ministers approved a draft of its reciprocal agreement with the United States concerning the International Criminal Court (ICC) for ratification on Thursday (5 June), forwarding the document to the BiH presidency. The government said the agreement, which bars extradition of citizens to the ICC, would not cause any problems in the country's EU relations.
Also on Thursday, the Republika Srpska Parliament adopted the Internal Affairs Act, which regulates the functions and responsibilities of the interior ministry and police forces. The law introduces principles and regulations applied in the EU. It also bans participation of employees of the interior ministry in political parties or managing boards of companies.

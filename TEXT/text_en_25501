SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina(BiH) -- The country has failed to meet conditions for its inclusion in a visa-free regime with the EU, European Commission (EC) Director for the Western Balkans, Pierre Mirel, said in an interview with Sarajevo-based daily Dnevni Avaz on Sunday (November 22nd). He added that although the country has made some progress, it still trails behind Serbia and Montenegro. According to him, BiH should step up its efforts in the fight against corruption and should tighten border controls. Mirel announced that an EC team will arrive in BiH next month to assess Sarajevo's readiness to meet the criteria for visa-scrapping. Once the criteria are met, the EC could propose abolishing visas for Bosnian citizens early next year. (Dnevni Avaz, RTRS, Srna, B92, FoNet - 22/11/09)

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Opposition parties proposed on Monday (March 22nd) that President Filip Vujanovic schedule local elections on June 6th. Socialist People's Party leader Srdjan Milic suggested the date on behalf of several opposition parties. They reportedly want to avoid May 23rd -- suggested by the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists-led coalition -- fearing the fourth anniversary of the country's independence might give the ruling party the advantage.

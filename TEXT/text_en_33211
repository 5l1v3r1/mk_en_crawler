TIRANA, Albania -- The two main parties in parliament reached a compromise on electoral reform Tuesday (13 May). A bipartisan commission on reform, made up of members of the ruling Socialist Party (SP) and opposition Democratic Party (DP), agreed on guidelines for re-establishment of the Central Electoral Commission. According to the SP's Ethem Ruka, the package of amendments to the electoral law will be submitted to parliament by the end of May. They envision that DP and SP nominate commission members, who would then be approved by the High Council of Justice. (Albanian Daily News, Shekulli - 14/05/03)

STRASBOURG, France -- The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) decided Thursday (7 November) that Ankara should pay 300,000 euros to Turkish citizen Yasar Ozel in compensation for violating his human rights. The court agreed with an appeal filed by Ozel, claiming that his right to fair trial had been infringed upon. He was sentenced to life in prison in 1997 under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, after pleading guilty to charges of armed robbery aimed at funding an illegal organisation. He says the tribunal was not impartial and that he was not allowed to see a lawyer while in police custody. (ECRH web site, Anadolu Agency, BBC - 07/11/02)

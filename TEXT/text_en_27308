ATHENS, Greece -- Economy Minister Louka Katseli said on Sunday (February 28th) that Athens may soon unveil new measures to cut its deficit. Katseli said Prime Minister George Papandreou will take further measures regarding the country's austerity plan in the wake of last week's visit to Athens by EU financial experts. The group concluded that moves undertaken so far were not strong enough to reassure and ease global financial markets. 
Separately Sunday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Greece should do its part of the clean-up job and face problems resulting from its huge debts and budget deficit. She denied rumours that Berlin has allocated money from its 2010 budget to provide financial assistance to Athens, but added that she does not rule out such aid.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Operation Storm, aimed at restoring Croatia's control over the Krajina region, was launched 12 years ago Saturday (August 4th). Sunday is a national holiday in Croatia. While Croats celebrated the occasion, relatives of Serbs who went missing or were killed during the operation staged a protest in front of the Croatian Embassy in Belgrade. Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, meanwhile, said Serbs were the victims of ethnic cleansing by the Croatian Army.

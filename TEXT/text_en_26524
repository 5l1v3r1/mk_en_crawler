SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA), Menduh Thaci, announced on Monday (August 10th) that his party will boycott work in parliament starting next week. The party is frustrated that its efforts to make Albanian a second official language in Macedonia have been thwarted. Thaci also urged the junior partner in the ruling coalition -- the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration -- to leave the cabinet. He added that during his meeting with Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha in Tirana last week, he considered urging Albania to veto Macedonia's NATO accession bid, but later changed his mind. Earlier Monday, US Ambassador to Macedonia Philip Reeker urged the DPA not to stage a boycott, saying it would only damage its credibility. (Makfax, A1, Alsat, Sitel - 10/08/09)

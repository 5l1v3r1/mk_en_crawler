PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana on Sunday (July 12th) called on all those involved to adopt a pragmatic approach toward Kosovo. Speaking ahead of a visit to Pristina on Tuesday, Solana said that EULEX "has made a great progress, but ... still has a lot of work to do". "I want to emphasise the good co-operation between Belgrade and EULEX, and this is a co-operation which needs to continue and to be strengthened. There should be pragmatism, which would certainly be beneficial first of all for the Serb community in Kosovo," Solana said, stressing that the Western Balkans are important to the EU and that European prospects for the region are clear.

NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council on Wednesday (March 25th) unanimously approved the appointment of Austrian diplomat Valentin Inzko as the new high representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Inzko, 52, was Austria's first ambassador to BiH following the initialling of the Dayton Peace Accord. He will replace Miroslav Lajcak in the international community's top post in BiH, after Lajcak left to become Slovakia's foreign minister. Currently, Inzko is Austria's ambassador to Slovenia. He officially takes over his new post on Thursday, following a session of the Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council. (Dnevni Avaz, RTRS, SRNA, Nezavisne Novine, BTA - 25/03/09)

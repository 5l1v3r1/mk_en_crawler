SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Boyko Borisov clarified on Saturday (June 12th) that the government will wait for an environmental impact assessment before making a final decision on its participation in the Burgas-Alexandroupolis pipeline. A day earlier he'd said the cabinet has decided to halt construction of the facility because of environmental risks, as well as the fact the pipeline would pass through protected territories, included in the EU's Natura 2000 network. He also mentioned the questionable economic benefits of the project. The environmental impact study was initiated late last year and is expected to last up to 18 months.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Following a meeting of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) in Brussels Friday (28 March), High Representative Paddy Ashdown said PIC has authorised him to consider the removal of the BiH Presidency's Serb member and incumbent chairman, Mirko Sarovic. He has repeatedly denied involvement in the illegal sale of weapons to Iraq by a firm in Republika Srpska while he was president of RS. BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic, who served as RS prime minister, maintains that Sarovic's removal would represent a serious blow to the country's dignity and says evidence against him is lacking.

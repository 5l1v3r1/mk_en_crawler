BELGRADE, Serbia -- Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said on Monday (June 8th) that Serbia is co-operating fully with The Hague war crimes tribunal. Speaking at a press conference in Belgrade after meeting with Serbian and Romanian foreign ministers, Vuk Jeremic and Cristian Diaconescu, Frattini said Italy believes Serbia's integration into EU institutions should be accelerated. He added that Rome will insist that Serbia's visa regime with the EU be liberalised by the end of this year. Both Romania and Italy said they would lobby for visa-free travel for Serbians at next week's EU summit in Brussels. Jeremic thanked Italy and Romania for their support. He noted in regards to Kosovo's independence declaration that "We agreed that this issue must not stop us on the road to EU membership." (Beta, B92, Tanjug, Blic - 08/06/09)

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- UN war crimes tribunal prosecution spokeswoman Olga Kavran said on Wednesday (May 16th) that Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic -- as well as other fugitives -- are in Serbia, according to information available in The Hague. Kavran also said that the Serbian military police action on Tuesday was based on tips from The Hague on Mladic's possible location. The tribunal is ready to work with the new Serbian democratic coalition government, she said, noting that Serbia's co-operation with The Hague tribunal has been blocked for over a year. The new authorities in Belgrade must take concrete steps to change the situation, Kavran added. (Danas, B92, Politika - 17/05/07)

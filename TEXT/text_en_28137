ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Four people, including a teenage girl, died and 12 others were injured by a remote-controlled bomb that exploded as a military bus transporting army officers and their families passed it in Istanbul early Tuesday (June 22nd). The incident happened in the Halkali suburb. Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack so far. Last weekend, members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) threatened to stage attacks in all Turkish cities amid intensified military raids against the rebels.

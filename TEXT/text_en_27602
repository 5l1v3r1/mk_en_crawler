BUCHAREST, Romania -- Interior Minister Vasile Blaga resigned on Monday (September 27th) after a protest by about 6,000 police officers Friday. The rally prompted both President Traian Basescu and Prime Minister Emil Boc to ask the interior ministry to withdraw the officers. Commenting on his decision to resign, Blaga said the protest had dishonoured him. He told protesting police officers they had "forgotten the oath they swore".

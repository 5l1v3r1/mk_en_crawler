SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The commission investigating cases of citizenship illegally granted to foreigners from 1992-2006 has reversed 120 such decisions, panel chief Vjekoslav Vukovic said on Tuesday (5 September). He noted that around 1,500 cases are being scrutinised, mostly people of Afro-Asian origin, who came to BiH to fight. Some involve individuals on the UN black list for suspected links to al Qaeda terrorists. 
In other news Tuesday, the Banja Luka Public Security Centre forwarded to BiH prosecutors war crimes charges against 20 former members of the army's 5th and 7th corps. They are accused of crimes against civilians and prisoners of war in the municipalities of Bihac, Krupa, Bosanski Petrovac, Kljuc, Sanski Most, Cazin and the Dvor na Uni municipality in Croatia, between October 1994 and December 1995.
Meanwhile, the UN war crimes tribunal has decided to transfer two cases to the BiH judiciary. Bosnian Serbs Mitar Rasevic and Savo Todovic will answer charges of murder, persecution, unlawful detention and torture of Muslims at an infamous detention camp in Foca from 1992-1994.

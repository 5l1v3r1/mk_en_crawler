BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina -- Preliminary findings by the Republika Srpska (RS) Supreme Defence Council conclude that the Orao Aviation Institute violated the UN arms embargo against Iraq. The findings also suggest that a number of officers in the RS General Staff made decisions related to conducting business for end users in Iraq. A final report will be sent later this week to the BiH presidency and international organisations in BiH. No violations were discovered by investigators from the Federation of Bosnia and Heregovina (FBiH) Ministry of Defence, who looked at nine companies in FBiH.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Speaking to local media on Sunday (August 26th), Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said he is not afraid of a recent warning by international community High Representative Miroslav Lajcak regarding possible sanctions. Last week Lajcak called on Dodik to stop making provocative remarks related to the BiH's future. Otherwise, the envoy said, he would be forced to sanction or dismiss him. 
Dodik, in turn, said it is time the international community starts to respect the Dayton Accord's constitutional order and to respect the RS entity as integral part of it. No previous EU candidate was forced to change its constitutional order, Dodik said. (Nezavisne Novine, Dnevni Avaz - 27/08/07; RTRS - 26/08/07)

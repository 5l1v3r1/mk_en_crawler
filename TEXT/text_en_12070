SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The leaders of 11 large parties began two days of talks Monday (16 May), focusing on key issues related to restructuring the police sector. The politicians are to review and eventually adopt one of three draft proposals forwarded last week by the special task force for mapping BiH's future police regions. Restructuring is crucial to BiH's EU integration prospects.
In other news, the BiH Prosecutor's Office has launched a probe into Republika Srpska (RS) Interior Minister Darko Matijasevic, in connection with the January transfer of Bosnian Serb war crimes indictee Savo Todovic to The Hague. RS President Dragan Cavic told the Belgrade daily Vecernje novine that the state prosecutor seeks to establish whether Matijasevic is responsible for an unspecified incident between the RS police and the BiH State Border Service that occurred during the extradition procedure.

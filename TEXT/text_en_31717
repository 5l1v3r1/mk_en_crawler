ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia's Liberal Party (LS) suggested Saturday (11 January) that Croatia should adopt a proportional electoral system for the forthcoming general elections. The party also said that parties should be allowed more freedom to form coalitions, which under current legislation must be established prior to the registration deadline for the elections, and called for more transparent financing of political parties. Though LS is currently a member of the ruling coalition, the party leadership has decided it will run independently in the next general elections, expected to take place at the end of the year.

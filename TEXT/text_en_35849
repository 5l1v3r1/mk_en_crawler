BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Divisions in Serbia's reformist camp widened Sunday (25 January) when the executive board of the Democratic Party (DS) said after a meeting that it continues to insist on portfolios in the next government. But Vojislav Kostunica, whose Democratic Party of Serbia is leading the effort to form a cabinet, ruled out the possibility of inviting the DS to take part. Kostunica wants to form a cabinet with two other parties. Tuesday's inaugural session of parliament may indicate whether the four reformist parties will be able to join forces to elect a speaker.

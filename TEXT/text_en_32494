BUCHAREST, Romania -- The cabinet adopted amendments to an anti-corruption measure Thursday (13 March) and sent the bill to parliament for approval. The amendments would ban participation by parliamentary members in executive or supervisory boards of private or state-owned companies. Exceptions would be made on a case-by-case basis and only after explicit permission from parliament. The bill would also force high-ranking officials to declare their annual income.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Serbian army is the best and most professional in the region, Defence Ministry Secretary Dusan Spasojevic said on Monday (April 6th), citing a report by the US analysis and research agency Stratfor. He noted that in 2006, Serbia was the last country in the northern hemisphere to be admitted to NATO's Partnership for Peace programme. He also acknowledged that Belgrade is still unclear about the direction it must take in developing the country's future defence strategy. He described Croatia and Albania's new NATO memberships as "a positive thing for us", as Serbia will benefit from increased security along its northwest and southern borders. (B92, MIA - 06/04/09)

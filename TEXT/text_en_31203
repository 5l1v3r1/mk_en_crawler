PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Parliament will decide on the future talks with Serbia, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said on Wednesday (March 2nd). "I have full trust that we will have a co-operative approach, as we had earlier, in all important phases for our country by the whole political spectrum, including the Kosovo opposition," Thaci said. He described these talks as the closing of a hostile chapter, and opening of a new co-operation chapter. Thaci added at a government meeting that the talks will focus on practical issues such as free transport of goods, trade, and economic development. Government officials say no exact date for starting the talks has been set. Deputy Prime Minister Edita Tahiri will head Kosovo's negotiating team. (Klan Kosova, RTK, Kohavision - 02/03/11)

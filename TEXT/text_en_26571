SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Authorities issued an international arrest warrant Wednesday (October 7th) for Oliver Knezovic, the suspected killer of a Sarajevo football club fan in the southwest town of Siroki Brijeg. Knezovic escaped from detention shortly after being arrested and may have fled to neighbouring Croatia. Sarajevo resident Vedran Puljic, 24, was killed on Sunday in clashes that broke out as soon as fans of the Sarajevo team arrived in Siroki Brijeg to watch the game against the local soccer squad. Puljic was killed by a gunshot. (Dnevni avaz, Fena, BHRT, Pincom.info - 07/10/09)

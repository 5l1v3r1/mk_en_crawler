DUBROVNIK, Croatia -- An informal meeting of the foreign ministers of Southeast European countries was held Wednesday (9 June) in Dubrovnik. Discussions focused on EU integration and the Union's enlargement policy, as well as on ways to expand regional co-operation. On the sidelines, Croatian Minister for European Integration Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic met with Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Yiannis Valinakis, who praised the progress Croatia has made in the EU integration process. Grabar-Kitarovic said Greece's support has been crucial -- especially early last year, when Athens held the rotating EU presidency. (HINA - 09/06/04)

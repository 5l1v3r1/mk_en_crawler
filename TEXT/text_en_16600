MITROVICA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Two young Serbs, Jovan Milosevic, 19, and Jablan Jeftic, 21, were seriously wounded after a gunman opened fire on them early Thursday morning (11 May) as they worked at a fuelling station in Mitrovica. This is the second armed attack on Kosovo Serbs in the divided city in less than a week. At the weekend, gunmen shot at a Serbian Orthodox Church vehicle carrying a priest, his wife, and their two young children. 
Thursday's Belgrade daily Glas javnosti quoted UNMIK spokesperson Neeraj Singh as suggesting renewed violence could be a concern as the decision on Kosovo's final status draws nearer. 
In other news, German police have arrested a former senior member of the now disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army, according to media reports Wednesday. The man, identified only as XG, is accused of abducting people and then torturing and killing them at a prison camp in Drenovac, Prizren in June-October 1998. Wanted by UNMIK, he may be tried in Kosovo if extradited. (Tanjug, RTS, Glas javnosti, B92 - 11/05/06; Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, RFE, Beta - 10/05/06)

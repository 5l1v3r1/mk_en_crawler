THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal announced Friday (12 December) that it has banned Slobodan Milosevic and nationalist leader Vojislav Seselj from campaigning from their prison cells. Both men are running in Serbia's parliamentary elections on 28 December. The move came after Milosevic recorded a speech that was later broadcast in Belgrade.
In Serbia, meanwhile, the Electoral Commission said Saturday that a total of 20 entities have registered to participate in the upcoming vote. The deadline for submitting election lists expired Friday. Out of all entities, 16 include political parties while the others comprise other formations. The commission will post 17 December the final list of all candidates.
In other news, retired General Pavle Strugar returned to The Hague to stand trial before the UN war crimes tribunal on Friday, after a delay of more than 10 days. He spent time at a Belgrade military hospital recovering from an undisclosed illness. Strugar, who was indicted for Dubrovnik war crimes, is to face trial Monday if his medical exam at the tribunal indicates he is fit. (Reuters, AFP, B92, Tanjug, FoNet, BBC - 12/12/03)

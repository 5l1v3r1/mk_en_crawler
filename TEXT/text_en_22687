THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal acquitted former Macedonian Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski of war crimes Thursday (July 10th), stemming from a police attack against an ethnic Albanian village in 2001. But the judges found Boskovski's co-defendant, former police officer Johan Tarculovski, who led the attack, guilty of murdering three villagers and sentenced him to 12 years in prison. The tribunal concluded that Tarculovski planned and ordered the attack on the civilians in Ljuboten but found no evidence that Boskovski was responsible for the crimes as supreme commander of security forces. In addition to the murders, Tarculovski was convicted of destruction of property and the inhumane treatment of 23 ethnic Albanian civilians. The attack in Ljuboten is the only war crimes case in Macedonia being examined by the UN tribunal. (Dnevnik - 11/07/08, Makfax, A1, AP, AFP, RIA Novosti, Radio Netherlands - 10/07/08)

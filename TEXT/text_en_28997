PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Though his official mandate ends on June 14th, the EU Political and Security Committee has suggested extending EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon's mandate until a suitable successor is found. EULEX spokesperson Blerim Krasniqi said on Tuesday (June 8th) that de Kermabon is open to the idea "in order to secure the good functioning of the mission". 
Last week, the EU ambassadors agreed to recommend that the Council of the EU extend the mission's mandate by two years, until June 8th 2012. The extension "underlines the EU's strong commitment to Kosovo, the rule of law in particular, and the European perspective of Kosovo in the framework of the whole region", said Krasniqi. A vote is expected on Tuesday. (Zeri, Kosova Sot, Infopress, Koha Ditore - 08/06/10)

LEFKOSA, Cyprus -- The Council of Ministers of the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" finalised preparation Sunday (14 March) of a draft law concerning a referendum to be held on 20 April, after negotiators have ironed out differences with Greek Cypriots. According to the draft, eligible voters would be those who were allowed to participate in the last parliamentary election.
In other news, Cyprus reunification talks shifted gears on Monday, with UN negotiators talking separately to Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders in hopes of persuading them to agree to trade-offs on a complex peace blueprint. Negotiators on Friday abandoned an earlier format that involved only direct talks between the two sides. (Reuters - 15/03/04; Anadolu Agency - 14/03/04)

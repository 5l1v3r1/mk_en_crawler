ISTANBUL, Turkey -- The government on Wednesday (11 August) blamed Kurdish separatists for Tuesday's deadly Istanbul bomb attacks, dismissing a rival claim of responsibility by a group linked to al-Qaeda. Newspapers quoted Turkish officials as saying the Kurdistan Workers Party, which recently called off a unilateral six-year ceasefire, was behind the three blasts. Two separate groups claimed responsibility for the attacks, which killed two people and injured 11 others. According to media reports, a previously unknown Kurdish group calling itself the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons claims to have planted the bombs at two hotels and a gas plant. The Islamist Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades, believed to have ties to al-Qaeda, also claimed responsibility, in a statement published on the group's Web site. (Reuters, BBC - 11/08/04; NTV - 10/08/04)

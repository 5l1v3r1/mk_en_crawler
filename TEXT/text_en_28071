TIRANA, Albania -- Floods have returned to northern Albania, leaving 1,280 hectares of land under water. The Committee for Emergencies met on Tuesday (April 20th) to discuss the situation. Parts of Shkodra are already under water as a result of large amounts of water coming from hydro plants in the area, following ten days of virtually continuous rain. Residents of flooded areas are still waiting for compensation due them after two waves of floods in the beginning of the year. (Klan, Top Channel, Telegrafi, VoA - 20/04/10)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Two people died and nine were injured in clashes between Kurdish protestors and police in southeast Turkey on Saturday (April 4th). It happened during a rally organised to mark terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan's 60th birthday. Demonstrators threw stones at police who tried to block the road to Halfeti, which leads to Ocalan's home village of Omerli. Police had to use tear gas and water canons to disperse the protestors. Ocalan is serving a life sentence in a prison on the island of Imrali. (Hurriyet, Dogan, BTA - 04/04/09)

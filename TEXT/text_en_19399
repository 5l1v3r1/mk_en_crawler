PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said on Sunday (February 24th) that despite protests about Kosovo's unilaterally-declared independence, he will help Serbs integrate. "There are those who are unhappy with the fact that Kosovo is now an independent state, but they will very soon adapt to the positive and democratic reality," Thaci said. Kosovo is also their country, he stressed, adding that minority rights in Kosovo will be respected. 
Meanwhile, at least 5,000 Serbs protested Kosovo's independence in Vienna on Sunday. The rally began peacefully but at one point the crowd burned a US flag. Police thwarted an attempt to march on the US Embassy. Protestors then went to a neighbourhood with a high number of immigrants from Kosovo and smashed windows. (Telegrafi, RTK, RFE - 24/02/08)

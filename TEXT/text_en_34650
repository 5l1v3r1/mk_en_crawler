PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The leaders of Montenegro and Croatia met on Friday (22 August) to discuss ways to further strengthen bilateral relations. Croatian President Stipe Mesic told reporters that he was particularly pleased with the situation on the disputed Prevlaka Peninsula following the withdrawal of the UN observer mission at the end of last year. Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said the first-ever visit by a Croatian leader "heralds a good future for relations between Croatia and Montenegro". Mesic also met with President Filip Vujanovic. "We should not be hostages to the past, and those who brought about the war should be held accountable for it," Mesic told the Montenegrin news agency MINA.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The office of UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte has denied making a deal that allowed Serbian authorities to keep key information on the former Yugoslav wars confidential. A statement issued Monday (April 16th) dismissed allegations contained in letter supposedly written by Geoffrey Nice, the former lead attorney in the case against the late Slobodan Milosevic, and published in the Zagreb daily Jutarnji list. The letter claimed that Belgrade was allowed to classify documents regarding the former Yugoslavia's role in the conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Croatia, making them inaccessible to the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
Del Ponte's office insists there was no such deal with Belgrade and no tribunal involvement in concealing information from the ICJ. (Vecernji list, Poslovni dnevnik - 17/04/07; HINA, HRT, Beta - 16/04/07)

NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council will discuss on Tuesday (July 6th) the situation in northern Kosovo in the wake of recent violence there. Attending the session, requested by Belgrade, will be Serbian President Boris Tadic and UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier. Pristina media have reported that Kosovo Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni has also asked to participate. 
Two serious incidents in Mitrovica prompted the session. On Friday, an explosion killed one man and injured 11 others during a Serb protest in the divided town. Tensions rose further on Monday when Kosovo Serb lawmaker Petar Miletic was shot and wounded outside his home. Serbian Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic says the attack against Miletic represents a threat to Serbs living in Kosovo, but he urged them to refrain from violence and ignore provocations.

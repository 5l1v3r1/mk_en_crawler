ANKARA, Turkey -- President Abdullah Gul held a closed-door meeting Wednesday (January 21st) with leaders of the country's legislative, executive and judicial branches. Attending it were Parliament Speaker Koksal Toptan; Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan; Constitutional Court Chairman Hashim Kilic; the chairman of the Court of Cassation, Hasan Gerceker; State Council head Mustafa Birden and other senior officials. Afterwards, Gerceker said they discussed domestic and international issues related to the judiciary. Some media in Turkey suggest it was an effort to reduce tensions stemming from the investigation of the ultra-nationalist organisation Ergenekon, which was allegedly plotting a coup. According to media reports Thursday, police detained another 26 suspects in connection with the case.
In other news, in Istanbul a trial of 60 people charged with beating political activist Engin Ceber to death while in custody began on Wednesday. Authorities arrested him in October during a protest against police violence. The suspects include a prison guard, police officers and soldiers, who allegedly committed torture, abuse of duty and neglect and failed to report a crime.

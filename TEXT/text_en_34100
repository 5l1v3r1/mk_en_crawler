ATHENS, Greece -- The government unveiled a draft law on Monday (21 July) that would allow the installation of temporary mobile transmitters on vehicles and platforms on wheels during the 2004 Summer Olympics. Mobile phone operators will also get extra frequencies to avert possible communication blackouts. Industry executives warned last week that networks could crash at peak hours during the games.
In other news, new figures reflect the impact of the Olympics on the Greek economy. Investments in the second quarter jumped to 8.6 per cent, while consumer spending rose to 3.8 per cent. (AFP - 21/07/03)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government imposed an interim ban on poultry imports from Hungary on Wednesday (January 24th), following an official notification from Budapest about a suspected bird flu outbreak in southern Hungary. The ban will remain in effect until Hungary clarifies the avian influenza presence and its scope. Local authorities have quarantined the area around a Lapisto, Hungary farm and culled more than 3,300 fowl. (HINA, MTI - 24/01/07)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The OSCE says Croatia has made significant strides in terms of judicial reforms and human rights issues. OSCE Mission in Croatia head Jorge Fuentes Monzonis-Villalonga said on Wednesday (October 31st) that the country might join the EU within the next four years. He warned, however, that the European Commission would likely be very critical of recent developments related to corruption, as fighting corruption has become one of the most important criteria for EU membership in recent years.

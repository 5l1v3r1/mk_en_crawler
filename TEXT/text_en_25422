BUCHAREST, Romania -- Border police announced on Thursday (March 25th) that they have busted a network trafficking illegal immigrants into the United States by way of Hungary and Mexico. It took six years to investigate the ring, allegedly composed of a group of Romanians who made hundreds of thousands of euros from the racket. Officials said about 140 Romanians were smuggled to the west, with each immigrant paying between 7,000 and 10,000 euros. (AFP, Javno - 25/03/10)

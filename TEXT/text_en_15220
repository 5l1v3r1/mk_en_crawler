SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The ambassadors of the Peace Implementation Council Steering Board member countries met in Sarajevo Friday (28 April) with High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling. A joint statement issued after the meeting voiced deep regret over the BiH Parliament's failure to adopt crucial constitutional changes earlier in the week. The BiH parties must accept responsibility for "the negative impact of missing this opportunity to move forward, which affects the future of the citizens of this country", the statement said. The reforms would have shifted some power from BiH's two entities to the central cabinet, streamlining the government. (OHR Sources, Fena - 28/04/06)

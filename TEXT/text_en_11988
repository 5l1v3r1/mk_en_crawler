SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO is committed to helping BiH authorities use every resource to locate and bring to justice all those indicted for war crimes, NATO spokesman Derek Chappell said during a press conference Tuesday (12 July). Regarding the detainment of Aleksander Karadzic, the son of Republika Srpska wartime leader Radovan Karadzic, Chappell said he will stay in custody "for as long as it takes for us to conclude this investigation". He confirmed that the action was conducted based on credible evidence linking the younger Karadzic to support networks for war criminals. Also Tuesday, former US envoy Richard Holbrooke alleged that Radovan Karadzic is being protected by the SDS party and the Orthodox Church. (Dnevni Avaz -13/07/05; OHR, FENA, RTRS, AP - 12/07/05)

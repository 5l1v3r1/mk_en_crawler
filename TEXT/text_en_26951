BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU once again failed to set a deadline for Turkey's accession, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Friday (October 2nd) after talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu. Rehn said the bloc has decided no deadline makes sense, since it is impossible to know when Ankara will be able to meet the requirements for accession. In order to speed up the process, Turkey should undertake measures to deal with human rights problems, and ensure freedom of speech and the media. Davutoglu said he hopes for accession by 2015, but refused to accept the EU's ultimatum to open Turkey's ports and airports to Greek Cypriots by the end of this year. (AFP, Reuters - 02/10/09)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- US Ambassador to Belgrade Cameron Munter officially requested on Tuesday (July 1st) the arrest and extradition of Miladin Kovacevic, a 20-year-old Serbian basketball player who fled New York last month after being charged with attempted murder. "This case is a top priority for the US government," Munter said. Earlier this week, Serbia dismissed its vice consul to the US, Igor Milosevic, after discovering he issued an illegal emergency passport to help Kovacevic flee the US. Kovacevic played basketball for Binghamton University in New York. On May 4th, he allegedly beat a fellow student nearly to death after a row in a bar. The victim remains in critical condition.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The Turkish military announced Monday (4 August) that it has appointed Gen Sukru Sariisik as secretary general of the National Security Council (MGK). The appointment comes just a few days after parliament approved the 7th EU reform package, which envisions the reduction of the military's influence on politics and says the head of the MGK could be a civilian. The EU harmonisation package has not yet taken effect, as it needs the official approval of President Ahmet Necdet Sezer. (Radikal - 05/08/03; Anadolu Agency, NTV, TRT 2, AFP - 04/08/03)

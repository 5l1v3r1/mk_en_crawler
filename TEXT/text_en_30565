TIRANA, Albania -- A team of OSCE observers has described the May 8th local elections in Albania as competitive and transparent but held in a polarised environment. In their first report on Tuesday (May 10th), observers said that the main political parties failed to respect the elections process, which had a negative impact on the administration of the process. "Some aspects have set a basis for progress in the future. But unfortunately, the two biggest political parties [the ruling Democratic Party and the main opposition Socialist Party] once again abused with their role of administering the elections and continued their political battle," the head of the observers mission Jonathan Stonestreet told a conference. Meanwhile, observers from the Congress of the Council of Europe welcomed the peaceful elections process but expressed concern about the extreme political polarisation.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A former Serbian general charged in connection with war crimes committed by Serb forces in Kosovo went before the UN tribunal on Tuesday (June 19th) and asked to delay entering a plea. Vlastimir Djordjevic, who was arrested in Montenegro last week, said he had not yet hired lawyers to represent him. The judges agreed to give him 30 more days. Djordjevic, 58, a former deputy interior minister, is charged with participating in the forcible deportation of 800,000 Kosovo Albanians, the killing of more than 700 people, and other atrocities committed by troops under his control.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Interior Ministry official Rodoljub Milovic took the stand Monday (27 December) in the trial stemming from the March 2003 assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. He testified that defendant Zvezdan Jovanovic confessed to the crime in early April, with his court-appointed attorney present. But Jovanovic, a former member of the special police unit, denied the claim and again contested the objectivity of the court and the trial. (Beta - 28/12/04)

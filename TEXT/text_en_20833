BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government adopted a set of measures on Monday (November 5th) to improve collaboration with Italian authorities and protect Romanians working and living legally in Italy. The steps followed last week's murder of an Italian woman allegedly by a Romanian national, ensuing violence against Romanians, and Italy's decision to begin deporting Romanians with criminal records. The government's new measures would boost co-operation between police forces of the two countries and increase the number of Romanian police staff in Italy. They are also aimed at helping Romanians better integrate into Italian society. 
For his part Monday, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi defended the expulsion of Romanian emigrants deemed dangerous by authorities, but warned against "xenophobic" acts and the "criminalisation" of all Romanians. He rejected right-wing calls for massive deportations of immigrants, arguing that Italy's economy needs foreign labour. He is meeting with Romanian counterpart Calin Tariceanu in Rome on Tuesday.

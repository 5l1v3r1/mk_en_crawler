TIRANA, Albania -- After ten hours of debate, parliament adopted changes to the immunity provisions covering lawmakers Thursday (February 24th). The opposition walked out of the session the moment 73 members of the 140-seat parliament endorsed the changes, under which immunity could be lifted via a simplified procedure. It also allows the voluntary surrender of immunity. Though the government says these are another pair of tools in the fight against government-level corruption, the opposition notes they do not extend to deputies in ministerial posts. 
Earlier in the session, parliament supported stripping the immunity of opposition lawmaker Dritan Priftin, who will be investigated for possible corruption. Prifti, the former minister for energy and member of the Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI), moved to the opposition after he was dismissed from the cabinet for allegedly releasing an incriminating video of his former chief at the SMI, Ilir Meta.

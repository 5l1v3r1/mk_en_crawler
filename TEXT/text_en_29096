LONDON, United Kingdom -- Albanian President Bamir Topi is asking that Kosovo be admitted soon to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), media reported on Friday (November 5th). Topi, who met with EBRD President Thomas Mirow in London on Thursday, stressed that Kosovo's accession is important both for its own economic development and that of the region. Topi and Mirow also discussed the EBRD's projects in Albania. Mirow praised economic reforms there, saying they help boost Albania's image as an investment destination. But he warned that the country still faces significant institutional challenges. (MIA, Koha Ditore, Telegrafi, EBRD website - 05/11/10)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, the current OSCE chairman-in-office, said in Belgrade on Monday (4 April) that the EU wants three principles followed in future discussions about Kosovo's status. According to Rupel, these are: no return to the situation before 1999, no territorial splits and no territorial ties to any Albanian-populated and Albanian-speaking region outside Kosovo. Rupel's comment followed talks with Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic and Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica. Tuesday, Rupel visits Podgorica. (B92, Beta - 04/04/05)

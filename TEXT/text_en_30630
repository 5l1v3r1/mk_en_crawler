PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX deputy head Andy Sparks is working to present a new strategy to reintegrate the north, Klan Kosova reported on Monday (February 14th). According to the media, Sparks spent the weekend in the Serb-dominated north meeting with Serbian representatives, police and civil society organisations. Sparks was in southern Mitrovica on Monday, meeting with EULEX officials. European personnel living and working in Mitrovica have been instructed to boost contact with residents by renting apartments in the north and patrolling more on foot, rather than in vehicles. 
In other news, EULEX announced on Tuesday the arrest of three people in Zubin-Potok, in connection with organised crime. Police raided private houses and a business. (Klan Kosova, Indeksonline, Kohavision - 14/02/11)

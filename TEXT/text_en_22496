SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Hague war crimes tribunal's chief prosecutor, Serge Brammertz, said on Wednesday (November 12th) that capturing fugitives Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic is a key priority. Brammertz, who met with BiH presidency members Zeljko Komsic and Haris Silajdzic in Sarajevo, said countries in the region should co-operate with the UN tribunal to detain these last two high-profile indictees. This co-operation, he said, could be key to completing the ICTY's mandate. The tribunal is scheduled to close by 2010, though Brammertz says that may not be enough time to wrap up all the trials. Komsic and Silajdzic agreed and insisted on measures to extend the mandate, so the tribunal could conclude all cases, including appeals.

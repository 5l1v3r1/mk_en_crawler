PRISTINA, Kosovo -- About 100 Serb protesters took control of a UN court in Mitrovica, northern Kosovo on Friday (March 14th) and are refusing to leave the premises. They have been standing in front of the building for three weeks, preventing Albanian employees of the court from passing the bridge over the Ibar River, which divides Mitrovica into a Serb-populated north and Albanian south. The building's seizure occurred hours before NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer arrived in Mitrovica for his first visit to Kosovo after its declaration of independence. 
Scheffer expressed regret that the Serb officials' did not meet with him. He also slammed the occupation of the court building as a provocation, describing it as an attack against the UN, the international community and the law. The United States and the EU also condemned the attack. (Beta, B92, AFP - 15/03/08; Reuters, RIA Novosti - 14/03/08)

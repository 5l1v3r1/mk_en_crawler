ATHENS, Greece -- Negotiations between the government and Greece's largest trade union failed to reach an agreement on the liberalisation of work hours on Monday (11 July). Labour Minister Panos Panayiotopoulos said talks cannot last forever, implying that a controversial bill on work hours will soon be sent to parliament. The unions oppose government plans to extend the work day for store employees, claiming business owners, employees and customers should choose the hours of operation. (ERA, ANA - 11/07/05)

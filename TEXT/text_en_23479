TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha announced on Wednesday (July 29th) that his government is considering a law to legalise gay marriage. A draft law prepared by an NGO in Tirana has the government's support and will be sent to parliament. "It provides a legal basis against discrimination, bringing the country in line with a framework already approved by the EU," said Berisha. Gays and lesbians are still heavily stigmatised in Albania, and live clandestine lives, for fear their safety might be threatened if they reveal their sexual orientation.

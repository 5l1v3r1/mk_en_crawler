WASHINGTON, United States -- The Executive Board of the IMF approved on Thursday (1 September) a three-year stand-by arrangement for Macedonia worth $75.8m. According to an official statement, $15.4m will be disbursed immediately. Takatoshi Kato, IMF deputy managing director and acting chairman, said the Macedonian government follows sound macroeconomic policies but must press ahead with strong structural reforms.
In other news Thursday, UNMIK and the provisional institutions of self-government concluded an interim free trade agreement with Macedonia. The agreement is asymmetrical, meaning that Kosovo's exports will have duty-free treatment in Macedonia, while Kosovo will collect customs on a limited number of products, which will gradually decrease.

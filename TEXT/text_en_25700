BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU leaders agreed on Thursday (November 19th) to appoint Belgian Prime Minister Herman van Rompuy as the first permanent European Council President. EU Trade Commissioner Catherine Ashton of the UK was named as EU foreign policy supremo. The two posts were created under the Lisbon Treaty, which aims to streamline decision-making within the EU. The treaty will enter into force on December 1st. Van Rompuy said he regretted have to give up his post as Belgian prime minister, but accepted the challenge. "I thank you for the honour you have given me," he said.
The United States welcomed the two appointments, saying they will strengthen Europe's relationship with Washington. But pro-EU politicians in Turkey voiced concerns that van Rompuy's nomination could affect Ankara's EU bid. Turkish parliament member Onur Oymen told the BBC that a few years ago, van Rompuy said he opposed Turkey's membership on religious and cultural grounds. "We are not very optimistic about the future of our relations during his presidency," Oymen added. (AFP, AP, Reuters, DPA, BBC, CNN, EUobserver - 19/11/09)

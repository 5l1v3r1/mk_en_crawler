ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prosecutors from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Croatia and Serbia agreed to co-operate in investigating alleged war crimes committed against ethnic Serb civilians in the Croatian Krajina region during Operation Storm in 1995. Regional TV stations began airing videotape last week that allegedly shows Bosniak and Croat paramilitaries killing a Serb civilian, as well as burning Serb refugees' houses in Krajina in the summer of 1995. Chief prosecutors from the three countries met in Zagreb on Thursday (10 August) and agreed to exchange information on the case. Republika Srpska officials meanwhile are filing charges against Atif Dudakovic, wartime commander of the Bosniak Army's Fifth Corps, who appears on the video.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised on Thursday (February 11th) the European Parliament's latest report on Turkey's accession progress, calling it biased. At a luncheon with the ambassadors representing EU-member countries in Ankara, Erdogan expressed concern over remarks in the report which questioned if Turkey is even part of Europe. 
"Although all member states signed the agreement to kick off accession negotiations with Turkey, it is discouraging and unrealistic to question its European identity," Erdogan said. At the same time, he reiterated Ankara's commitment to continue implementing EU-related reforms. The EP report, adopted on Wednesday, criticises Turkey for its policy towards Cyprus.

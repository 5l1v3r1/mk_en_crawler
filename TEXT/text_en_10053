Albania is preparing to reform its health care system, giving more autonomy to hospitals, clinics and other medical centres throughout the country and allowing citizens greater choice in choosing where they will receive treatment.
"Albanians will be free to choose the medical institutions where they would prefer treatment. Health insurance authorities will be obliged to compensate citizens for the treatment they get from a state or private health institution," said National Health Insurance head Gjergj Leka. The legislation would offer citizens the opportunity to obtain a health insurance document providing for free treatment; those without the document would have to pay.
According to Leka, the new bill also provides for a limited amount of subsidised health care for citizens who are travelling abroad.
Albanian Minister of Health Leonard Solis has described the proposed legislation as a key step in consolidating the country's health care system. Economics, Solis argues, conditions the actual state of health care in Albania. Under current conditions, the quality of medical treatment is limited and corruption is widespread, he says.
Part of the problem, analysts say, is that doctors receive low wages. Though Albania's medical professionals are highly qualified, the system has not offering salaries to match. Many doctors have opened private clinics to supplement their state wages. These clinics, however, are often unlicensed. According to the health ministry, there are 52 private medical institutions in the country; out of that figure, 43 are unlicensed clinics in Tirana. Authorities are said to be cracking down.
At the same time, the new legislation will seek to address the problem by changing the legal and financial status of health institutions and giving them more independence, while ensuring that the cost to citizens does not change.

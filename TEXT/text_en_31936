ZAGREB, Croatia -- An interior ministry spokeswoman announced Saturday (26 October) that authorities have discovered gunpowder aboard a Tonga-registered merchant vessel which had sailed from the port of Bar in Montenegro and was apparently headed to Iraq. Tests are underway to determine whether any of the material could be used in Scud missiles, as initially suspected. Though local media speculated the ship might have been carrying spare parts from a Bosnian Serb company, Orao, to the Iraqi Air Force, the Associated Press reports no such parts have been found.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative to BiH Paddy Ashdown on Tuesday (24 January) stressed the importance of the EU integration process for the country. Speaking the day before Wednesday's launch of technical negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU, Ashdown called on domestic politicians and institutions to "take care of and drive forward" an agenda of EU-related reforms. 
In other news, BiH's bid to join the NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme was the focus of talks between Republika Srpska President Dragan Cavic and the NATO HQ Sarajevo's political advisor, Raffi Gregorian, in Banja Luka on Tuesday. The two agreed that ongoing defence reforms created the basic grounds for full NATO integration via the PfP process. However, BiH still faces a hurdle due to its failure to extradite key war criminals. (Nezavisne novine - 25/01/06; OHR Sources, Fena, RTRS, PBS BiH, RTRS - 24/01/06)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown plans to visit Banja Luka on Monday (22 August) for talks with local leaders on the key issue of restructuring BiH's police sector. On Tuesday, senior state and entity officials are to meet in Mostar to continue negotiations on the reform, which is crucial to launching Stabilisation and Association talks with the EU. According to a source identified in Sunday's Nezavisne novine as a senior member of Republika Srpska's (RS) ruling Serb Democratic Party, Ashdown has warned that if RS continues to boycott the reform -- especially the EU-set principle of police regions' crossing of entity borders -- the EU might consider the option of integrating BiH without RS, similar to the Cyprus scenario.

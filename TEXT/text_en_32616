SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Stojan Andov, leader of the small opposition Liberal Party (LP), says that LP plans to end its boycott and resume participation in parliament in January. Still unclear is whether the major partner in the opposition coalition, VMRO-DPMNE, will do so as well. The boycott was to protest the participation in the government of Ali Ahmeti's Democratic Union of Integration.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament approved Djuro Popijac as the country's new economy minister on Thursday (November 19th). He replaces Damir Polancec, who resigned late last month amid a corporate scandal involving the food company Podravka. Lawmakers also approved the nominations of Health Minister Darko Milinovic and Finance Minister Ivan Suker as deputy prime ministers. The two will retain their other portfolios. Popijac says he will be presenting concrete solutions to long-term and short-term economic problems, including in the troubled shipbuilding sector.

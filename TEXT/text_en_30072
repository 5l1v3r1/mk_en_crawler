TIRANA, Albania -- The government expressed its readiness Wednesday (December 22nd) to co-operate with any future investigation related to alleged human organ trafficking, and will officially invite the UN war crimes tribunal to investigate the case unencumbered, even though the tribunal only has jurisdiction on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. 
During a cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Sali Berisha stressed Albania "is a country completely open for investigations". A report by Senator Dick Marty, adopted by a Council of Europe committee last week, alleges human organ trafficking operations occurred on Albanian territory a decade ago and that incumbent Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci led criminal networks during and after the 1998-1999 war.

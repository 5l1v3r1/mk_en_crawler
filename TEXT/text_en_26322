ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish and German navy personnel prevented pirates Friday (August 14th) from attacking a cargo ship in the Gulf of Aden off the Somali coast. The pirates were aboard a speedboat. A Turkish frigate patrolling the area as part of NATO's anti-piracy mission reported the attack and a German helicopter was dispatched to scare them off. All 19 people aboard the Turkish-flagged vessel are reported safe. (AFP, RIA Novosti - 14/08/09)

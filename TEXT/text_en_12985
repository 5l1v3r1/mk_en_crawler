PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said Monday (28 February) that he is convinced Podgorica's recent proposal to transform the federal union with Serbia is not anti-constitutional. According to Djukanovic, the Montenegrin side proposed creating a new commonwealth of independent states as an alternative to outright Montenegrin independence. He reiterated that an independence referendum would take place in Montenegro by February 2006 at the latest. (Politika - 01/03/05; Tanjug, Beta - 28/02/05)

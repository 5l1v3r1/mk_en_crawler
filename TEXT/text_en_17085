BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Romanian human rights activist and writer Andras Suto died at a Budapest hospital on Saturday (September 30th). He was 79. Suto actively opposed former Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's campaigns against ethnic Hungarians, including the closing of Hungarian language schools and plans for the razing of entire villages. In 1990 he was severely beaten and lost an eye in ethnic clashes shortly after Ceausescu was deposed. Suto was a member of the Romanian parliament from 1965 to 1977. (AP - 02/10/06)

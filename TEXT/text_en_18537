WASHINGTON, United States -- New Albanian Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha reaffirmed on Tuesday (May 8th) his country's willingness to play a stabilising role in the Balkans, especially in light of the Kosovo status settlement issue, during talks with US counterpart Condoleezza Rice. His visit to Washington comes just days after taking over the post from Besnik Mustafaj, who resigned for personal reasons. Basha assured Rice that Tirana is working to counsel Kosovo Albanians to refrain from any moves that could destabilise the region.

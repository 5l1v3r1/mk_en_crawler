PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The International Civilian Office (ICO) has opened new offices in four towns across Kosovo, local media reported on Tuesday (March 10th). They are Pristina, Peja, Prizren and Giljan. ICO representatives located at municipal assemblies will advise the municipalities on implementing recommendations derived from former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's blueprint for Kosovo. "The main fields of focus are cultural heritage, decentralisation and the rights of communities," ICO spokesman Andy McGuffie said. (Kosova Sot, Kohavision, Kosovalive - 10/03/09)

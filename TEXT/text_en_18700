PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Serbs and ethnic Albanians remain deeply divided over the plan on Kosovo's future drafted by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari. He sent a revised version of his blueprint to both sides on Wednesday (March 7th), ahead of Saturday's final round of talks in Vienna. Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu said the amendments were "mainly positive" and did not change the essence of the plan. The province's leaders plan to meet late Thursday to discuss it. In Belgrade, a spokesman for Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's ruling Democratic Party of Serbia said the new version was "even worse", as it is "completely in line with position of the Albanian separatists".
In other news, UNMIK has launched a programme to promote the better integration of minorities and boost the quality of governance and living standards. The effort will include a series of meetings in various municipalities, public gatherings and conferences. (Danas, Glas Javnosti - 08/03/07; AP, UPI, RTS, Tanjug, KosovaLive, UN website - 07/03/07)

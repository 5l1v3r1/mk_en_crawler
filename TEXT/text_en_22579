BELGRADE, Serbia -- The main board of the Democratic Party (DS) on Saturday (June 7th) authorised its leader, Serbian President Boris Tadic, to lead talks on the formation of a government. Tadic also received a green light to decide which DS members may become ministers. 
In an interview with Tanjug on Friday, Tadic called for the quick formation of a government and expressed hope that it will happen by the end of this month. "Only ... a socially responsible government, which will speedily apply the Association and Stabilisation Agreement, will open horizons for all our citizens," Tadic said.

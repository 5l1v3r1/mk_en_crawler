BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Serbian presidential candidate Vojislav Kostunica is refusing to accept the conditional support of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's Democratic Party (DP). Kostunica, currently Yugoslav President, said Tuesday (26 November) there is no point in talking about any conditions as he had presented his programme in the September 2000 general elections and is unwilling to compromise it. Djindjic had promised potentially crucial DP support in the 8 December vote if Kostunica pledged a certain amount of co-operation by his party within the ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia coalition.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Foreign Minister Cristian Diaconescu says he assured EU officials that Romania has no plans to grant mass citizenship to Moldovans. Returning on Tuesday (April 28th) from a meeting of the EU's General Affairs and External Relations Council in Luxembourg, Diaconescu said Bucharest has guaranteed a case-by-case assessment in granting citizenship to foreigners. Earlier this month, President Traian Basescu announced he asked the government to amend the law on citizenship to expedite the procedure for granting citizenship to those of Romanian origin who live in neighbouring Moldova, which could number up to a million people. The EU had criticised the move. (Agerpes, Mediafax, Ziare - 28/04/09)

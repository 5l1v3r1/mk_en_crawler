BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The first direct negotiations between BiH and the EU on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) will be held on 25 January, Michael Humphreys, head of the EC delegation to BiH, confirmed on Thursday (19 January). He stressed that talks will be held with state-level officials, not those representing the entities. After his meetings with Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Pero Bukejlovic and Milorad Dodik, leader of the main opposition party, SNSD, Humphreys said that any effort to organise a no confidence vote against the RS government would have a direct impact on the SAA talks. Dodik, however, reiterated that the opposition in RS has enough votes to remove the government and establishing a new one would take less time than expected.

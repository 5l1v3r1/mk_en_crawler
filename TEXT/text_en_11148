BUCHAREST, Romania -- EU Taxation and Customs Commissioner Laszlo Kovacs has voiced support for the scheduled 2007 accession of Romania and Bulgaria. During his visit to Bucharest on Friday (24 June), Kovacs said the EU enlargement process is set to continue, despite the results of recent referenda in France and the Netherlands. 
In other news, the leader of Germany's Christian Democrats (CD), Angela Merkel, said in an interview with Frankfurt's Allgemeine Zeitung last week that the EU should keep its promises to Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania. She appeared to back away from earlier CD statements suggesting Bulgaria's and Romania's memberships were not certain. (Rompres, Nine o'clock, EU Observer - 24/06/05)

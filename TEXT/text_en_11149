BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Democratic Party (PD), a senior partner in the ruling coalition, has elected a new leader and officially abandoned its former socialist ideology to take a more market-oriented stance. During the party's congress Saturday (25 June), delegates approved the election of Cluj Mayor Emil Boc as the new PD chairman, succeeding Romanian President Traian Basescu. Boc, acting leader of the party after Basescu resigned to assume the president's duties late last year, was the sole nominee for the position. Bucharest Mayor Adriean Videanu was elected as PD executive chairman. The participants also endorsed Boc's proposal to move to a centrist, market-oriented approach.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Belgium has signaled its readiness to extradite Fehriye Erdal, a left-wing Turkish militant, to her home country as soon as she is located and arrested, according to press reports in Ankara on Monday (13 March). At the weekend, Belgian Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht said extradition is possible, now that Turkey has abolished the death penalty. Erdal, who went missing a few weeks ago from house arrest in Belgium, was convicted of terrorism.
In other news, Turkish Justice Minister Cemil Cicek predicted on Monday that the EU screening process harmonising Turkish laws with those of the EU would likely be completed this year. Negotiations on specific chapters would follow. (TurkishPress.com, NTV - 13/03/06)

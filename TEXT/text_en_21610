ANKARA, Turkey -- Police on Sunday (October 26th) detained four more people suspected of belonging to the shadowy separatist group Ergenekon. All four work for the TV channel Kanalturk, the fiercest opponent of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) until earlier this year, when a pro-AKP group bought it, according to local media reports. Kanalturk's founder is Tuncay Ozkan, whom police detained last month in the Ergenekon operation. The trial of 86 suspected Ergenekon members opened last week. The defendants include retired army officers, leftist politicians, members of secular associations, journalists, and academics who are known opponents of the AKP. All face charges of forming an illegal organisation that planned to incite chaos and disorder to trigger a military coup d'etat. (CNN Turk, NTV, Anadolu news agency, Hurriyet, Zaman - 26/10/08)

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Republika Srpska (RS) Parliament adopted a decision Wednesday (April 11th), according to which entity authorities might organise a referendum on future BiH police reform. The resolution also implied that RS would oppose any reform model that fails to comply with the BiH and the RS constitutions. The process has been deadlocked for nearly two years, thwarting the EU integration process. (Dnevni avaz, Nezavisne novine - 12/04/07; RTRS - 11/04/07)

ATHENS, Greece -- UN special envoy Matthew Nimetz denied allegations that third parties influenced him while he was drafting his latest proposed solution to the name dispute between Greece and Macedonia. In a statement published in Greek newspapers Thursday (October 23rd), Nimetz denied receiving instructions from third parties while mediating the dispute. Greek media had reported that the latest set of ideas was "a proposal designed by the US". Nimetz stressed he personally prepared all proposals presented to Athens and Skopje so far and that third parties never received or reviewed them. (ANA-MPA, Eleftheros typos, A1 - 23/10/08)

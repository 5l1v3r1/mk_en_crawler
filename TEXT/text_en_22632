TIRANA, Albania -- Six US federal agents arrived on Sunday (April 6th) to investigate the March 15th army depot blasts in Gerdec that killed 27 and injured 300, the US Embassy in Tirana announced on Monday. The agents from the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms arrived following a request by Prosecutor General Ina Rama to carry out a full criminal investigation and determine the source of the blasts. Rama said authorities "are also awaiting US assistance" regarding details in contracts signed by the companies involved in the arms trade, including the US-based Southern Ammunition Company.

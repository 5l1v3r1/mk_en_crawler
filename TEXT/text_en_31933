BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic and Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic said Friday (25 October) that their republics may agree on the constitution of the new federation within ten days. They urged the adoption of elements already agreed upon so as to proceed with implementation of the EU-sponsored deal on the future of the country. Both leaders noted that striking a deal is vital to European integration of the future federation. The only unresolved issue is the manner in which the members of the future federal assembly will be elected. Serbia wants a direct ballot, while Montenegro insists on the deputies being appointed by the parliaments of the two republics. (AP - 25/10/02)

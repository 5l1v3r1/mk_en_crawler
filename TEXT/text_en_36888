ATHENS, Greece -- Foreign Minister Petros Molyviatis met on Tuesday (6 July) with French counterpart Michel Barnier. The main topics on the agenda were the EU Constitution and enlargement challenges. In addition, the two foreign ministers discussed Iraq, the Middle East, the Cyprus issue and Greece's efforts towards stabilisation and development of the Balkans. While in Athens, Barnier also met with Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis.
Karamanlis, meanwhile, has been invited to serve as a witness when Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's daughter marries on Sunday. Relations between Greece and Turkey have strengthened steadily since 1999, as has the friendship between Erdogan and Karamanlis. (ANA, AFP - 06/07/04)

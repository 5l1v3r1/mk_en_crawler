SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria must speed up judiciary reforms and combat corruption, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Friday (1 September), after his meeting with Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev. Rehn stressed that it was his wish to see Bulgaria join the EU next year. Rehn's official visit to Bulgaria was the last one before the European Commission publishes its next monitoring report at the end of September. 
Also on Friday, Romanian Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said he sees his country on track for EU accession in January, Bulgarian National Radio reported. Tariceanu acknowledged that his country had problems at the beginning of 2005, but has since invested substantial effort and implemented a series of reforms necessary to make local institutions function as European ones.

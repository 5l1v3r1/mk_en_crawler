THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte and the heads of the intelligence services in three Balkan countries met in secret in The Hague on Tuesday (October 9th) to discuss possible actions aimed at arresting four remaining high profile war crimes fugitives: Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic, Goran Hadzic and Stojan Zupljanin. Dnevni Avaz reported on Wednesday that BiH Intelligence-Security Agency General-Director Almir Dzuvo attended the meeting, along with Serbian counterpart Rade Bulatovic and Montenegrin counterpart Dusko Markovic. Tomislav Karamarko, head of Croatia's state security service, had to miss the meeting because of official business in the United States. This marked the first time the heads of the Balkan regional intelligence agencies gathered to exchange information on fugitives. (Dnevni Avaz, Javno.com, AIA, HINA - 10/10/07)

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar denied on Sunday (December 20th) media allegations that Slovenia is again blocking Croatia's EU membership talks. The statement came after the weekly European Voice reported that Zagreb will be unable to open three negotiation chapters because of Ljubljana's reservations. The chapters are environment, fisheries and foreign, security and defence policy. Zbogar stressed on Sunday that Slovenia's move is not a blockade, rather, stems from reservations in principle over some parts of the text. At Monday's accession conference in Brussels, Croatia will close two other negotiation chapters, bringing the total number of closed chapters to 17 out of 33. Two other chapters don't require talks because domestic laws are already harmonised with those of the EU. (STA, HRT, HINA - 20/12/09)

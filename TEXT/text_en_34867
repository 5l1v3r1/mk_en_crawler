ANKARA, Turkey -- President Ahmet Necdet Sezer reportedly will veto two of the articles in the 7th EU harmonisation package, which was approved by parliament earlier this week. According to the newspaper <I>Sabah</I>, at least one article pertains to the anti-terrorism act, which Sezer does not view as contrary to EU legislation. According to the newspaper <I>Milliyet</I>, the president intends to veto the law and then call a referendum should parliament pass it a second time. The European Commission had praised Wednesday's (30 July) adoption of the package by parliament, saying that reforming the National Security Council was an important step.

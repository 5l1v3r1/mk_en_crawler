BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Polling stations opened in Serbia early Sunday (13 October) for the second round of the presidential election. Vojislav Kostunica has emerged as the clear front-runner since round one two weeks ago, and is expected to defeat rival Miroljub Labus. But observers in Belgrade say voter turnout will be key, as more than 50 per cent of the voters must go to the polls for the election results to stand. Extreme nationalist Vojislav Seselj, who won more than 20 per cent in the first round, has called on supporters to boycott the elections. Only 55.6 per cent of Serbia's voters cast their ballots in the first round. (AP, AFP, Reuters - 13/10/02; B92, Tanjug - 12/10/02)

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Parliament adopted a draft constitution on Tuesday (July 31st). It makes Montenegrin the official language and enshrines separation of church and state. The coat-of-arms will remain the golden two-headed eagle, the flag will be red with the coat-of-arms in the centre, and the national anthem is "Oj, svijetla majska zoro". The Cyrillic and Latin writing will be considered equally official. 
The draft also calls for the direct election of a president, who will serve a maximum of two five-year terms. Montenegro has been working on the new constitution since declaring independence last summer. (MINA, Reporter.gr; MRT, B92, Beta, Tanjug - 31/07/07)

ATHENS, Greece -- The interior ministry said Friday (11 February) that it worked on a new draft law aimed at regulating the status of immigrants, which will be placed on parliament's agenda next month. According to the statement, the bill will seek to settle the situation of some 200,000 immigrants, who have been in Greece for several years and meet certain conditions, but have not yet been given residency permits. One of the measures would merge the working and residence permits, which would reduce the amount of official application papers and streamline the bureaucratic process. (Kathimerini - 12/02/05)

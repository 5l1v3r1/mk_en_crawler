GENEVA, Switzerland -- A Swiss court has found a Turkish politician guilty of denying the alleged Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire during and shortly after World War I. Dogu Perincek, leader of the Turkish Workers' Party, was fined around 1,900 euros. Judge Pierre-Henri Winzap argued that he deserved punishment because he denied an established historical fact. 
Perincek said he would appeal the verdict before Switzerland's Supreme Court and take the matter to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary. The Turkish Foreign Ministry reacted immediately with a statement, saying it was saddened by the ruling. It said the defendant was being denied freedom of expression. (AP - 09/03/07)

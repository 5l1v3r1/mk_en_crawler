BELGRADE, Serbia-- Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic says Serbia will submit its application for EU membership in the first half of this year, even if its efforts to unblock its Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Brussels fail. Belgrade signed the SAA with the EU in April, but the Netherlands has been blocking its implementation over Serbia's failure to arrest war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic and extradite him to The Hague tribunal. Speaking on Tuesday (December 30th), Cvetkovic told reporters "I am optimistic that the agreement will be unblocked. But we will apply even if this does not happen." He stressed Serbia has two goals in 2009 regarding its European integration -- to fulfil conditions for the Schengen List and to apply for EU member candidate status. He also announced the government would postpone its planned unilateral implementation of the interim trade agreement that is part of the SAA. (Beta, B92, AFP, Reuters - 31/12/08; Beta - 30/12/08)

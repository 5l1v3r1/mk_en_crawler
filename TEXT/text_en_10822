ZAGREB, Croatia -- Theodor Meron, the president of the UN war crimes tribunal, urged Croatia on Thursday (4 November) to arrest General Ante Gotovina and other indictees. He said after talks with Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul that it is of "critical importance" for Zagreb to deliver the remaining fugitives to The Hague. Meron will present a report on co-operation to the UN General Assembly on 15 November and one to the UN Security Council a week later. 
Meanwhile, Croatia's opposition parties called Thursday for Zuzul's resignation, following reports that his wife had accepted a 19,000-euro bribe. Zuzul has denied the charges. The opposition Social Democrats are demanding a parliamentary investigation, claiming they have documents proving the allegations. (AFP, HINA, HRT - 04/11/04)

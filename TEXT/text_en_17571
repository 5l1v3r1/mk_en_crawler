BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU opened new chapters in its accession talks with Turkey and Croatia on Thursday (March 29th). Turkey's chief negotiator Ali Babacan met with German Ambassador to the EU Wilhelm Schoenfelder to launch negotiations in the area of enterprise and industry. They emphasised the symbolism of the event, following a standstill in negotiations over Turkey's refusal to open its seaports and airports to Cypriot traffic. Germany will try to open several more chapters with Turkey before the end of its EU presidency in late June.
The European Commission, meanwhile, began talks on intellectual property with Croatia, the sixth chapter to be opened so far. Membership negotiations with the EU began early last year. (HINA, Vecernji List, Dow Jones - 29/03/07)

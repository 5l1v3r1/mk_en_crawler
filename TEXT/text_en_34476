TIRANA, Albania -- Low turnout marked local elections on Sunday (12 October) as just over 50 per cent of the country's 2.7 million registered voters went to the polls. The electoral commission allowed an additional hour for voting in Tirana, where lines had formed in front of polling stations shortly before the scheduled closing. First results were expected later on Monday. In all, 60 political parties fielded candidates, but the main contest was between the ruling Socialist Party and the Democratic Party of former President Sali Berisha, who insisted that the vote was marred by "massive fraud". The electoral commission and the OSCE, which supplied foreign observers, reported no major incidents. Officials acknowledge three minor election-related injuries in the town of Himara.

MADRID, Spain -- Several local newspapers reported Tuesday (4 May) that a Bulgarian arms trafficker has sold submachine guns to the Islamic terrorists behind the 11 March train attacks in Madrid. According to reports, the leader of the terrorists, Jamal Ahmidan, got weapons from an unidentified Bulgarian national in a deal completed late last year.
Meanwhile, Bulgarian military reconnaissance warned Monday of possible new attacks on Bulgaria's contingent in Karbala, Iraq. The threat reportedly becomes more likely should US troops begin an offensive against the cities of Falluja or Kufa. (BNT, Novinite, news.bg - 04/05/04; Novinite, Mediapool - 03/05/04)

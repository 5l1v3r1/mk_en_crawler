ANKARA, Turkey -- President Abdullah Gul warned the United States on Tuesday (October 9th) that bilateral ties will be damaged if a resolution defining the killings of Armenians during World War I as genocide is adopted by the US Congress. "Relations will seriously suffer," Gul said in a letter to US counterpart George W. Bush, whose administration is working to block passage of the resolution.

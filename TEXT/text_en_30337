ATHENS, Greece -- A group of youths threw a Molotov cocktail at a police station in downtown Athens, injuring three people in the ensuing fire Saturday (May 14th). The blaze also damaged one police car and several other vehicles parked nearby. Citizen Protection Minister Christos Papoutsis had called for calm Friday amid what he described as a "very high risk of hate crimes". 
Athens has endured a wave of violence since Tuesday, when a man was killed allegedly by immigrants. The incident spurred nationalist attacks against foreigners: the Pakistani community says more than 100 Asian and African immigrants were attacked on Thursday by youth protesting the killing. A Bangladeshi worker was stabbed to death Wednesday, though the motive is unclear. (ERT, Ta Nea, To Vima, SKAI, Eleftherotypia - 14/05/11)

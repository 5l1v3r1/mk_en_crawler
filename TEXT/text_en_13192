BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica phoned his Croatian counterpart, Ivo Sanader, on Friday (27 January) to express his deep regret over last week's attack on two Croatian diplomats in Belgrade. He told Sanader that a probe was immediately launched and that the perpetrators -- four men aged between 20 and 25 -- have been identified and arrested. The attack took place Wednesday while the two diplomats, Deputy Ambassador Branimir Loncar and First Secretary Branko Herceg, were parked in an upscale Belgrade neighbourhood. The assailants surrounded the car and assaulted Herceg. (Novi list - 28/01/06; Tanjug, Hina - 27/01/06)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The head of the OSCE mission to Croatia, Peter Semneby, said the European Council's decision to grant candidate status to Croatia recognised the great progress the country had made. In a statement Friday (18 June), he congratulated the government and the Croatian people for accomplishing one of their main objectives. Noting that new status means new challenges, Semneby pledged OSCE support. Croatia was also congratulated by neighbours Slovenia and Serbia-Montenegro.

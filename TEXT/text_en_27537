BELGRADE, Serbia -- Justice Minister Snezana Malovic and his Croatian counterpart Ivan Simonovic signed an agreement Tuesday (June 29th) in Belgrade on the extradition of those suspected of organised crime and corruption. "Although the agreement will require ratification by the two parliaments, it will come into force now as the two countries are closely co-operating in combating organised crime," Malovic said. The deal will enable Zagreb to extradite Sretko Kalinic, a member of the Zemun Clan crime gang who is wanted in connection with the 2003 murder of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. Justice Ministry senior official Slobodan Homen says Belgrade is negotiating similar agreements with Italy and the United States. (RTS, Tanjug, Beta, B92, Reuters - 29/06/10)

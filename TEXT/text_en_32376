BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian police say they have found the remains of former President Ivan Stambolic, who disappeared while jogging in Belgrade in August 2000.
Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic said Stambolic's remains were dug out of a pit in Mount Fruska Gora, a hilly region in northern Serbia. "He was executed with two shots and buried in a quicklime pit dug out in advance," said Mihajlovic, who added the murder was politically motivated. Stambolic disappeared shortly after his ally-turned-enemy Slobodan Milosevic was ousted. (CNN - 28/03/03)

YEREVAN, Armenia -- The country and Armenians worldwide marked on Saturday (April 24th) the 95th anniversary of the killing of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. Yerevan maintains that an estimated 1.5 million Armenians were massacred by the Ottoman Turks between 1915 and 1917. Turkey acknowledges that thousands of Armenians did indeed perish but denies that genocide took place. Hundreds of people gathered at Istanbul's Taksim Square on Saturday for a tribute amid heavy police security. The event ended without incident. 
Marking the anniversary, US President Barack Obama issued a statement calling the 1915 events "one of the worst atrocities of the 20th century", but avoided the term genocide. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan welcomed that, saying Obama has taken into account Ankara's sensibility on the issue. The commemoration comes two days after Armenia's parliamentary majority announced it will freeze the ratification of two protocols aimed at normalising ties with Ankara. The documents on establishing diplomatic ties and reopening the border between the two countries were signed in October. (Hurriyet, AFP, Reuters - 24/04/10)

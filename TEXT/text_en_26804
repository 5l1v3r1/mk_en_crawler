ANKARA, Turkey -- One person was shot dead Sunday (December 6th) in Diyarbakir during demonstrations in support of jailed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan. The student was killed on the Dicle University campus, though the circumstances are unclear. Thousands of protestors threw stones and Molotov cocktails at the headquarters of the ruling Justice and Development Party in the southeast city before police used tear gas to disperse them. At least one police officer was injured in the clashes, which resulted in 113 arrests. Rallies in support of Ocalan were also held in the neighbouring cities of Siirt, Mardin, Batman and Hakkari, part of an ongoing effort by supporters to protest the conditions in which he is being jailed for life.
In other news, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Ankara has no plans to send more troops to Afghanistan. "Turkey has already done what it can do by boosting its contingent of soldiers there to 1,750 from around 700, without being asked," Erdogan said on Sunday. He is heading to Washington for talks with US President Barack Obama, who announced plans last week to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan.

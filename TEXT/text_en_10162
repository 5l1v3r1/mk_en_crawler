BUCHAREST, Romania -- The country takes an important step forward in the judicial reform process Wednesday (29 September), when prerogatives pertaining to magistrates' appointments are to be officially transferred from the justice ministry to the High Council of Magistrates. Council General Secretary Dan Lupascu says the transfer represents a major move towards EU accession. Magistrates have urged such a step, saying it would help prevent political interference in judicial affairs. (Nine o'clock - 28/09/04)

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The trial of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was set to resume on Monday (25 August) after a three-week recess. The UN war crimes tribunal has been hearing the case for 230 days, its longest trial yet. The prosecution phase is to be completed by year's end; Milosevic will then have the opportunity to prove his innocence. The trial is expected to last until 2005. (AFP - 24/08/03)

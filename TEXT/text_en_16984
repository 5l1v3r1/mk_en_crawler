BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Bulgaria and Romania will be allowed to join the EU on 1 January 2007 despite problems with meeting some of the EU standards, international media reported on Tuesday (4 April). Diplomats are quoted as saying that the EU will invoke a safeguard clause for Bulgaria in the justice and home affairs chapter. This could mean that the Union would not recognise verdicts issued by the country's courts until problems with the Bulgarian judiciary are fixed. EU Commissioner for Enlargement Olli Rehn briefed the European Parliament on the matter Monday night. He praised Romania for overhauling its judicial system and taking "immensely important" steps in the fight against corruption. Bulgaria's progress in the same areas has been limited, however, Rehn said.

WASHINGTON, United States -- A Serbian government delegation says it garnered sound support during a series of meetings with top officials from international organizations. Wrapping up its visit to Washington on Monday (14 April), the delegation said it was pleased with the results of talks with the IMF and the World Bank. Among those results was a preliminary agreement to call a donor conference for Serbia-Montenegro this autumn. In the context of these meetings, Serbian and Montenegrin officials managed to agree on federal representation in international financial institutions. (B92, Tanjug, FoNet, BBC - 14/04/03)

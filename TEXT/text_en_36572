ATHENS, Greece -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Athens late Thursday (6 May) hoping to forge better bilateral relations with Greece following the failure of a UN-led effort to reunify Cyprus. Erdogan's visit began with a private dinner with his counterpart Costas Karamanlis. Official talks between the two prime ministers will take place on Friday, and Erdogan will also meet with President Costas Stephanopoulos. Karamanlis told a Turkish newspaper on Thursday that Greece wants to open a new page in relations with Turkey. Erdogan says Turkey cannot achieve ts strategic and global goals if it fails to form solid ties with immediate neighbours in the Aegean. Erdogan is the first Turkish prime minister to visit in 16 years, according to Reuters. (Reuters - 07/05/04; AFP, TRT 2, Anadolu Agency, ANA, MPA - 06/05/04)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The court in Sabac ruled on Thursday (April 21st) that former Bosnian Serb politician Bozidar Vucurevic can be handed over to either Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) or Croatia for trial, saying it is up to the justice ministry to decide where to extradite wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic's former close ally. Serbian police arrested Vucurevic on April 4th at a Bosnian-Serbian border crossing based on war crimes charges. Prosecutors insist he has to face trial in BiH as he is Bosnian citizen and is subject to an investigation into war crimes committed in Trebinje. Vucurevic is also wanted by Zagreb for war crimes against civilians committed during the 1991 shelling of Dubrovnik. (Nezavisne Novine, Press Online - 21/04/11)

LONDON, Great Britain -- A court on Tuesday (March 20th) rejected Zagreb's request for the extradition of Croatian Serb Milan Spanovic, who was convicted in absentia for war crimes in 1995 and sentenced to 20 years in prison by Croatia. Prosecutors said he was a member of a Serbian paramilitary unit that destroyed a Catholic church and committed crimes against Croatian civilians in the Glina municipality in 1991. Spanovic has been living in Surrey since 1998, but was arrested earlier this year on the basis of an international warrant. Judge Timothy Workman ruled that the alleged crimes took place so long ago, there are doubts Spanovic could receive a fair retrial in Croatia. (Novi list - 21/03/07; HRT, Reuters - 20/03/07)

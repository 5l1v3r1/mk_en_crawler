SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament meets on Monday (March 31st) to debate the final proposal offered by UN envoy Matthew Nimetz, aimed at resolving the long running name dispute with Greece. Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki said on Saturday (March 29th) party leaders agree that "the matter will "end in the parliament". He said he still believes the dispute can be resolved before the NATO summit begins in Bucharest on Wednesday.
Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis, however, voiced scepticism that a deal can be reached in time. Her country has threatened to block a membership invitation to Macedonia over the issue. (MIA, MRT, Makfax, ANA-MPA, Reuters - 29/03/08)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Dragan Marsicanin, deputy leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) said Saturday (24 January) that there has been no progress in talks on forming a government. He reiterated that DSS supports only a minority government and said that the party's position has not changed. Marsicanin denied media reports that DSS has met with the Socialists about forming a cabinet. Parliament, meanwhile, is scheduled to meet on Tuesday for the first time since last month's election. A speaker will likely be selected at the session. (Tanjug, B92 - 24/01/04)

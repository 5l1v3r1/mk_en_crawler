ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader on Tuesday (13 September) denied rumours of early elections, assuring reporters that his conservative cabinet is stable and strong and would serve out its full term, through November 2007. The government has been criticised recently about the state of the economy, particularly by Ivica Racan, leader of the main opposition Social Democratic Party. 
In other news Tuesday, it was announced that Croatian investigators would be allowed to interrogate Croatian businessman Hrvoje Petrac, who was arrested on 31 August in Greece. Petrac, sentenced in absentia in Croatia for kidnapping, is suspected of aiding top Croatian war crimes fugitive Ante Gotovina. (Novi list - 14/09/05; AP, HINA, HRT - 13/09/05)

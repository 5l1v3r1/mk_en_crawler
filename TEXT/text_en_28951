ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian People's Party (HNS) and the Croatian Pensioners' Party (HSU) will form a coalition for next year's parliamentary elections, party leaders announced on Tuesday (June 8th). On paper, the new alliance represents a significant chunk of votes: the HNS is the third most popular party in the country, while the HSU ranks fifth or sixth. Leader Radimir Cacic says his HNS would be open to expanding the coalition to include more centre-left parties. HSU leader Silvano Hrelja says he expects the two parties to be an important factor in shaping the government after the elections. (HINA, Poslovni Dnevnik, Nacional - 08/06/10)

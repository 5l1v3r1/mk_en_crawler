BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia-Montenegro soccer coach Ilija Petkovic announced on Saturday (17 June) he will resign after the team's disastrous 6-0 defeat at the hands of Argentina. Petkovic will stay on for the last match in Germany on Wednesday, which will also mark the last time Serbia and Montenegro field a soccer team together. The union between the two countries dissolved on 21 May. Also leaving the national side are captain Savo Milosevic, defender Mladen Krstajic and midfielder Predrag Djordjevic. The announcement came amid scathing criticism by the Belgrade media. Most newspapers called the match a disgrace. Petkovic complained that he had been pressured to adopt a more offensive tactic against Argentina, leaving room for the opponents' counterattacks. He also conceded that there were bitter divisions within the team.
In other news, Croatian captain Niko Kovac has dismissed media reports of squabbles in his team. He denied rumours that Ivan Klasnic has been involved in heated exchanges with Josip Simunic and Robert Kovac. Dado Prso also was reportedly calling for changes in the team's midfield, singling out teammate Niko Kranjcar for particularly strong criticism. Croatia plays Japan on Sunday. (AP, Kyodo - 17/06/06)

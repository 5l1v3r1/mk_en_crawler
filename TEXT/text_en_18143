PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The OSCE Mission to Kosovo presented a report Thursday (December 14th) on the province's judicial system, focusing on the problems of witness protection, the administration of justice in minor offences courts and juveniles in criminal proceedings. Jens Modvig, OSCE deputy head of mission, said that the conclusions suggest challenges faced by the courts are not insurmountable. He urged in part that more efforts be directed at securing adequate protection of witnesses and preventing their intimidation. Modvig stressed that an efficient court system and implementation of rule of law is the best way to ensure public confidence in the judiciary.

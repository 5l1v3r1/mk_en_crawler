BELGRADE, Serbia -- The US Embassy in Belgrade has voiced concern that no one has been convicted for the 1999 killings of three Albanian brothers with US citizenship -- Illy, Mehmet and Agron Bytyqi, local media reported on Thursday (September 24th). On Tuesday, Serbia's war crimes court acquitted two former Serb policemen charged with torturing the three brothers. They allegedly then handed them over to members of a special Serbian police unit who shot and killed them in their training camp. The bodies of the Bytyqi brothers were found in 2001 in a mass grave in the eastern village of Petrovo Selo. Prosecutors say they will appeal the acquittals. (Tanjug, B92 - 24/09/09)

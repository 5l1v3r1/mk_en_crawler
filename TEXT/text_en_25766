ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis met in the first live televised debate Monday (September 21st) with his main rival in the October 4th snap elections, PASOK leader George Papandreou and leaders of the four other parties in parliament. Over the course of two hours, Karamanlis praised the work of his government, but at the same time admitted mistakes. He promised, however, that if his New Democracy party wins a new mandate, it will strengthen its efforts against corruption and red tape and would continue to support Turkey's EU membership bid. 
Papandreou criticised the government's policies and promised he would fight tax evasion, improve the management of EU funding and work to improve Greece's relationships with its neighbours. A second TV debate will be held Tuesday evening. According to the latest social polls, PASOK leads New Democracy by about 7%. (ANA-MPA, Xinhua - 21/09/09)

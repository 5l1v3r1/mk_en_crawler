PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The government reiterated on Thursday (December 11th) that it plans to apply for EU membership by year's end. "By taking this step, Montenegro commits itself to the accession process and the strategic goal of building a united Europe," an official statement said.
In other news, media reported on Thursday that an IMF mission visiting Montenegro warned that the country might have public finance problems without some major foreign direct investment.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament Speaker Ognyan Gerdzhikov said Sunday (19 October) that a Bulgarian Parliamentary delegation and US officials discussed the possibility of an at least partial repayment of Iraqi debt. He added that Bulgaria had been assured it would receive preferential treatment, though the US side made no promises and asked for patience, as the total Iraqi foreign debt amounts to $100 billion. The Bulgarian delegation proposed that the debt be repaid in oil supplies, or by hiring Bulgarian contractors to implement health care and construction projects.
In other news Sunday, Foreign Minster Solomon Passy said that more than 87 per cent of Bulgarians support the country's EU accession. That figure is up from 82 per cent two years ago. (Trud, 24 Chassa, Standart - 20/10/03; BTA, BNT, bTV - 19/10/03)

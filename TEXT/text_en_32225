ZAGREB, Croatia -- Investigators from the UN war crimes tribunal reportedly have started questioning witnesses in Croatia about a military operation in the so-called Medak pocket, which claimed the lives of several dozen Serb civilians. Local media said Saturday (9 November) that the two men interviewed so far are Lt Kresimir Tomljenovic, an intelligence officer during the 1991-1995 war, and Zvonko Brajkovic. The international court also announced last week that it wanted to interview retired Adm Davor Domazet, who served as chief of military intelligence at the time of the operation. Domazet says he will comply with the request.
At The Hague, meanwhile, chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte sent a letter to the court demanding the appointment of legal counsel for Slobodan Milosevic. She argued that his refusal to work with an attorney is straining his health and delaying the trial. (AFP - 09/11/02; AP - 08/10/02)

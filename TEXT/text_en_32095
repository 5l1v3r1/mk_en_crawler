PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- On Monday (14 October), the Return coalition's caucus in parliament protested UNMIK's decision to open two border crossings between Kosovo and Albania. The caucus also demanded that Yugoslav Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic take a stand on the issue. In a letter to Svilanovic, Return said that UN Security Council Resolution 1244 is directly violated by the opening of border crossings and establishment of customs services, and accused UNMIK and neighbouring Albania of trespassing on sovereign Yugoslav territory. UNMIK spokeswoman Susan Manuel denied opening customs crossings with Albania and said UNMIK is only trying to prevent villagers from smuggling. (B92 - 15/10/02; ATA 12/10/02)

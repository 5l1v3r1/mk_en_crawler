VIENNA, Austria -- A third round of negotiations between Kosovo Albanian and Serbian officials ended without agreement on Monday (3 April). The talks focused on ways to provide greater freedom for local governments to manage their own affairs. According to UN officials, Serbs continued to insist on autonomy for their municipalities and strong ties to Belgrade. The Kosovo Albanian delegation was opposed to what it viewed as a bid to create a Serb entity in the province. Deputy UN envoy Albert Rohan, chairman of the meeting, acknowledged considerable differences between the two sides. The next round of discussions is scheduled for 28 April.
On Wednesday meanwhile, Athens hosts a meeting on the future status of Kosovo. The event will be held under the auspices of Greece's chairmanship of the South East European Co-operation Process. (Politika, Danas - 04/04/06; AP, AFP, Reuters, RFE, Beta, Tanjug - 03/04/06)

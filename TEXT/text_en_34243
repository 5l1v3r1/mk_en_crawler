ANKARA, Turkey -- An explosion at a petrol station late Saturday (5 July) left nearly 200 people injured, 40 of them seriously. Witnesses reported seeing a large ball of fire rising in the centre of Ankara as a tanker truck unloaded fuel at the station. The injuries occurred among people attending a wedding party in a hall on the second floor of the same building. Health Minister Recep Akdag said the government would issue a ban on liquid gas stations in residential areas. Liquid petroleum gas is popular in Turkey as a cheap alternative to gasoline.

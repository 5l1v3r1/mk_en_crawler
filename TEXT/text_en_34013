ZAGREB, Croatia -- The United States would welcome a decision to send Croatian military units to participate in the stabilisation of post-war Iraq, said new US Ambassador Ralph Frank in his first statement to the Croatian media. According to Frank, the move would demonstrate Croatia was ready and capable of contributing to international security and stability. It would also provide the Croatian Army with important experience in international peace missions as well as improve the process of NATO integration. He added that negotiations between Washington and Zagreb were under way. (MediaScan - 31/07/03)

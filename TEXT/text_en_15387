SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Council of Ministers adopted draft amendments Thursday (27 July), envisioning the introduction of two new ministries -- agriculture and rural development, and science, technology and environment. The measure also stipulates the abolition of the second deputy ministerial seat in the defence ministry. Ministers from Republika Srpska (RS) oppose the changes, suggesting political consensus on enlarging the state cabinet remains elusive.
Also Thursday, RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik announced that the entity government plans to abolish 57 decisions made by previous cabinets and propose changes to 31 laws. He said the measures are aimed at improving the business climate in RS. (Nezavisne Novine - 28/07/06; RTRS, Fena - 27/07/06)

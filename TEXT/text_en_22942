TIRANA, Albania -- Deputy Environment Minister Aleksander Garuli says Albania plans to mark its freshwater border with Greece for the first time. He said on Sunday (October 5th) the two countries' officials will soon sign a pact in the Greek city of Ioannina to mark lake and river borders. It will take effect after ratification by both countries' parliaments. Greek patrols have frequently caught Albanian fishermen who crossed the undefined border into Greek waters.

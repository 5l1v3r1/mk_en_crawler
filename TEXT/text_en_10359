BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) warned Turkey on Monday (20 September) that it would block the start of accession negotiations until the country adopts a new penal code. Parliament had nearly passed the new legislation last week when the effort was thwarted by a government attempt to include a provision criminalising adultery. The EC is to issue a progress report on Turkey on 6 October. EU leaders will examine the report and decide on whether to launch accession talks at a summit in December. Justice Minister Cemil Cicek downplayed the statement, saying Turkey would proceed with reforms even if it does not get a date for starting negotiations. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan will visit Brussels on Thursday to discuss the issue. (AP, AFP, NTV, Reuters, FT - 20/09/04)

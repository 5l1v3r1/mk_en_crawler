ZAGREB, Croatia -- European Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten said Thursday (13 March) that the EU would begin evaluating Croatia's membership application next month. The year-long review will determine whether the country is prepared to start accession negotiations on 30 chapters. In a series of meetings with officials in Zagreb, Patten congratulated the government on economic and political reforms. Patten had been scheduled to stay two days, but cut his visit short and travelled to Belgrade following the assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.

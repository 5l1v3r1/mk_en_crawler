ATHENS, Greece -- Police on Monday (March 24th) arrested the secretary general of Reporters Without Borders, Robert Menard, and two other members of the organisation who interrupted the Olympic torch-lighting ceremony in Ancient Olympia to draw attention to China's crackdown in Tibet. During a speech by Liu Qi, head of the organising committee for the Summer Games in Beijing, three people carrying black flags with the Olympic rings depicted as handcuffs managed to hurdle themselves over crowd -control fencing at the Ancient Olympia stadium. Two reached the microphones and chanted slogans in support of Tibet.
Despite the incident, the Olympic torch was lit by Greek actress Maria Nafpliotou and will travel through 16 prefectures and 43 municipalities across the country before being returned to Athens during a ceremony next week. (Net, RIA-Novosti, Naftemporiki, ANA-MPA, AP - 24/03/08)

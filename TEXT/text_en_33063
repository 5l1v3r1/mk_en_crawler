ATHENS, Greece -- On Monday (23 June), the Greek Coast Guard questioned the crew of a ship carrying 750 tonnes of explosives, seeking to determine if there is any possible terrorist or criminal link. An army demolitions expert was also asked to examine the cargo aboard the Comoros-flagged Baltic Sky, which docked Sunday in the tiny port of Platiyali, northwest of Athens. Authorities have not said what type of material was aboard. "We want this cleared up as soon as possible and the ship removed because of its cargo," said Pythagoras Samaras, the mayor of Astakos, a small town near Platiyali. (AP, CNN - 23/06/03)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci on Saturday (April 18th) described his decision to allow Serbian President Boris Tadic to enter Kosovo as in the state's interest. Tadic visited the Decani Monastery in western Kosovo on Friday, the eve of Serb Orthodox Easter. He arrived by KFOR helicopter. "My message is a message of peace for Serbs, for Albanians and all people who live in Kosovo, in our Serbia," Tadic was quoted saying.
Thaci explained on Saturday that when making decisions, he takes into account the interests of the state and Kosovo's future Euro-Atlantic interests, rather than deciding issues on an ad hoc basis or via personal views. Opposition parties roundly objected to allowing Tadic's visit. Other high-ranking Serbian officials have been unable to enter Kosovo if they ignore official procedures.
In other news Saturday, police announced that a patrol car came under fire along the main road between Mitrovica and Leposaviq in Serb-dominated northern Kosovo. It happened on Friday, as police tried to stop and check a tractor. Three suspects managed to flee the scene.
Elsewhere, someone set fire to a vehicle belonging to the EU mission in Kosovo, EULEX, on Saturday. Authorities reported no injuries. (Koha Ditore, Zeri, Kosova Sot - 19/04/09; RTK, Kohavision, Telegrafi, Kosovalive - 18/04/09)

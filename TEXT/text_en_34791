ANKARA, Turkey -- Gen Yasar Buyukanit, deputy chief of staff of the Turkish Army, told reporters Sunday (10 August) that the military is ready to participate in the stabilisation effort in Iraq. "If there is instability next door, we can't keep our eyes closed," he said, signalling the army's readiness to accept a US request for troops. Buyukanit added, however, that the decision would be a political one, and said the country's top leaders and military commanders would meet Tuesday to discuss the possible deployment. President Ahmet Necdet Sezer will lead the session. (AP, Reuters, AFP, Anadolu Agency, TRT 2 - 10/08/03)

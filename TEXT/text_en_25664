PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The High Court concluded on Monday (February 22nd) that there are no grounds to extradite two Montenegrins wanted by Serbia for drug trafficking. Goran Sokovic and Dejan Secularac are citizens of Montenegro and the constitution does not cover extradition of its citizens, the court ruled. The two were arrested on February 9th for suspected involvement in trafficking more than two tonnes of cocaine from South America. They were released from custody a couple of days later, when local authorities failed to receive documents from Serbia that would permit an investigation.

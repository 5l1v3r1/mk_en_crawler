SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) in BiH has opposed requests for deportation of Roma refugees in Prijedor, according to a report by BHTV1 on Saturday (16 August). Kosovo's Roma population has moved to the town for the past four years, seeking better living conditions. A local Roma association, however, has sent a request to the OHR asking that the refugees be removed, citing increased crime rates which it argues are unfairly blamed on the existing Roma population. TV reports show the newly settled families in Prijedor live in extremely difficult conditions, finding shelter in old houses without running water and electricity. The OHR fears returning the refugees to Kosovo may only worsen their plight. (BHTV1, BBC - 16/08/03)

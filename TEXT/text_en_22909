TIRANA, Albania -- The government is drafting the country's 2009 budget and it will exceed this year's budget by 690m euros, Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on Wednesday (September 3rd). The increase will enable higher salaries and pensions next year, Berisha noted, as well as construction of more roads and schools. Opposition representatives accused Berisha of manipulating the public. They say budget increases have been common in recent years. (BBC, Alsat, Shqip - 04/09/08)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic announced on Friday (23 June) that the country's military budget would grow, starting next year. Spending for the Serbian armed forces would be increased from the current 1.9 per cent of GDP to 2.4 per cent of GDP, to support the army's modernisation and transformation into a professional force, according to Dinkic. 
On Thursday, meanwhile, two US F-16s flew into Serbia's Batajnica Military Airfield, a move described as a landmark event in bilateral military co-operation. The further boosting of ties will be discussed during a Serbian delegation's upcoming visit to the Pentagon. (Danas, Politika - 24/06/06; Beta, RTS - 23/06/06)

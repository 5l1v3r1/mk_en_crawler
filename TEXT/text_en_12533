THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Yugoslav General Vladimir Lazarevic appeared before the UN tribunal on Monday (7 February) to plead not guilty to five charges of murder and persecution of ethnic Albanians during the 1999 conflict. According to prosecutors, troops under his command "murdered hundreds of Kosovo Albanian civilians as part of a widespread and systematic campaign of brutality and violence that resulted in the forced deportation of approximately 800,000 Kosovo Albanian civilians." Lazarevic was indicted in October 2003 and surrendered to the UN court on Saturday. (Danas - 08/02/05; Reuters, AP, AFP - 07/02/05)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government urgently called its ambassador to Ljubljana, Mario Nobilo, back to Zagreb for consultations Thursday (25 August). The decision followed one by the Slovenian cabinet to endorse -- despite Croatia's earlier objections -- a draft proposal establishing a protected environmental zone in the Adriatic Sea and send it to parliament for adoption. The Croatian Foreign Ministry warned that the development violated the spirit of good neighbourly relations and said it would notify the EU. Zagreb also demanded a formal explanation from Slovenian Ambassador to Zagreb Peter Bekes. (Vecernji list, Novi list - 26/08/05; HRT, HINA, STA - 25/08/05)

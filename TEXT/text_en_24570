PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A delegation of ambassadors from the EU's 27 member states visited Kosovo on Wednesday (May 6th) to gather more information on efforts by EULEX personnel. The ambassadors, members of the Political and Security Committee (PSC) in Brussels, assist with the EU's political activities by preparing opinions for European Council sessions. The PSC also exercises political control and strategic leadership of crisis management operations, such as EULEX. During their visit, the ambassadors met with EU representatives, political leaders, UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier and KFOR Commander Giuseppe Emilio Gay.
In other news Wednesday, Germany announced it will extend its participation in KFOR by another year. However, it is slashing the number of troops it potentially will send from 8,500 to 3,500. Given the situation since Kosovo declared independence nearly 15 months ago, "We believe that [this number] is suitable," deputy government spokesman Thomas Steg told reporters. Parliament must approve the government's decision. There are currently 2,300 German troops deployed in Kosovo. (Koha Ditore, Zeri, Express - 07/05/09; Klan, Kohavision, AFP, DPA, N-TV - 06/05/09)

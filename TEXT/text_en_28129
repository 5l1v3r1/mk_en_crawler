ANKARA, Turkey -- German President Christian Wulff on Tuesday (October 19th) urged Turkish immigrants in his country to learn German from "a very early age". During a joint press conference with Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul in Ankara, Wulff was asked about the complex issue of immigration. He acknowledged the contribution of Turkish guest workers and the successful integration of many of them, but at the same time pointed out that the Germans' fears of "religious fundamentalism and terrorism" could not be ignored. Gul urged German politicians not to exploit the issue of immigration for political gain and asked them to work for the better integration of the Turkish community. He also urged Turkish immigrants in Germany to learn German "for their own sake ... for the sake of their families, and so that they may be of use for their environment and society". After the meeting, Wulff became the first German president to address the Turkish parliament, where he stressed religious tolerance. (Zaman - 20/10/10; Financial Times, AP, Hurriyet - 19/10/10)

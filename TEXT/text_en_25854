ANKARA, Turkey -- Interpol has published a red notice for Turkish businessman Cem Uzan, who has applied for political asylum in France, Turkish police announced on Saturday (October 17th). The statement came after a court in Istanbul requested a warrant earlier in the week, based on charges of large-scale embezzlement. Paris says it won't extradite Cem, pending his request for political asylum. 
The Uzan family attracted media attention in 2004, when the government seized more than 200 of their companies, in what authorities described as an attempt to collect debts totalling billions of euros. The seized companies include the Star Media Group, cement factories and Turkey's second largest mobile telephone network, Telsim. The government said the move was necessary to stop the Uzans from siphoning off company assets. The Uzans have also been locked in a legal battle with US telecommunications equipment maker Motorola and Finland's Nokia, over nearly $3 billion in loans to Telsim.

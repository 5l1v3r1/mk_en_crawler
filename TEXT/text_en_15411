SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis insists there is no such thing as a Macedonian minority in Greece. In an interview published in Saturday's (October 28th) edition of the Skopje daily Dnevnik, she said there is one officially recognised minority in Greece -- the Muslim one in western Thrace. Commenting on bilateral relations with Skopje, Bakoyannis said they were advancing "spectacularly" and that the sole open issue is the name dispute, currently being mediated by the UN.

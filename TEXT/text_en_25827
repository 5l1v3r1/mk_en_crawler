ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey has agreed to increase the flow of water from the Euphrates River to Iraq, Iraq's government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said in a statement Saturday (September 19th). This happened at a meeting between Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari and Turkish Environment Minister Veysel Eroglu in Istanbul. "Turkey has agreed to give Iraq 450 to 500 cubic meters of water per second along the Euphrates until October 20th," al-Dabbagh said. Iraq and Syria have often accused Turkey of establishing a monopoly on the Euphrates and Tigris by dams it built on both rivers as part of a big project to irrigate its southeast. Turkey has defended the project, arguing that it will improve water management and will secure the constant flow of water, regardless of seasonal changes. The Istanbul area was battered by torrential rains and flash floods last week, while Iraq is enduring one of its worst droughts in memory. (Reuters, AFP, Press TV - 19/09/09)

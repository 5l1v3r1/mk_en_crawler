PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Officials said on Tuesday (24 January) that the death toll from the train derailment in a mountainous area near Podgorica has climbed to 44, with 148 injured. At least five of the dead and 75 of the injured were children, many returning from a skiing trip. It is one of the worst rail disasters in the republic's history. Interior Minister Jusuf Kalamperovic says several carriages plunged into the Moraca canyon when the train's brakes failed at Bioce, about 10km outside Podgorica. Montenegro has declared three days of mourning. Both Transport Minister Andrija Lompar and National Railways chief Ranko Medenica have tendered their resignations.

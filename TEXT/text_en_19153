VIENNA, Austria -- Officials say Wednesday's (February 28th) talks on Kosovo's cultural and religious heritage, held between the Belgrade and Pristina delegations in Vienna under UN mediation, failed to result in any real progress. According to media reports, the two sides accused each other of politicising the issue and refusing to make concessions. The Serbian team reportedly rejected the possibility of Kosovo police -- augmented by foreign troops -- guarding Serb cultural and religious objects in Kosovo as proposed by UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari. Belgrade instead proposes that special Serb police --supervised by international forces in the province -- handle guard duty. Talks on Ahtisaari's proposed final status settlement continued Thursday.

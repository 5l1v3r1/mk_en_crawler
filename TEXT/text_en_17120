ROME, Italy -- On the third and final day of its congress in Rome, the European People's Party (EPP) passed a resolution Saturday (1 April) in support of Croatia's accelerated membership in the EU. It pledged to lobby within the EU in favour of the accession bid. Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, who participated in the EPP congress, welcomed the resolution and said it was particularly important in light of recent calls for halting EU enlargement.

TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi has sent the law on property return and compensation back to parliament, insisting it requires work. In more than two pages of explanation, Topi urged lawmakers Monday (August 16th) to bring the law closer to the constitution and the standards of human rights. His main objection is the so-called "right to property". Under the current bill, the National Agency for Property Return is entitled to deal with cases involving property disputes. Topi instead maintains such cases should be handled by the courts. The opposition Socialist Party welcomed Topi's reaction, while the ruling Democratic Party, which secured a majority for the law in July, expressed confidence that it will be eventually passed after only minor changes. Experts believe that The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg will be flooded with complaints by Albanians if the measure is enforced.

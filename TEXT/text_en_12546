SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown has urged Republika Srpska (RS) authorities to proceed with establishing the truth about the Srebrenica massacre and to analyse documents produced by the Srebrenica Commission. During talks with outgoing RS Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic last week, Ashdown voiced concern that Banja Luka had not yet formed a panel to review these documents. He says analysis is necessary to identify and consider administrative action against officials whose names appear in the report. 
In other news, a day after naming Pero Bukejlovic as RS's new Prime Minister-designate, RS President Dragan Cavic declared Sunday (9 January) that there is no room for the major Bosniak Party for Democratic Action in the future cabinet. Bukejlovic, however, said he would consult with all parliamentary powers to form the new cabinet. (Dnevni avaz - 10/01/05; Fena - 09/01/05; OHR Sources - 07/01/05)

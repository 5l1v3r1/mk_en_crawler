NICOSIA, Cyprus -- More than 2,400 passengers experienced delays due to a four-hour strike Monday (December 1st) involving pilots from the national air carrier, Cyprus Airways. They are demanding better pay and shorter hours. The airline had to reschedule around 30 flights because of the strike, which management criticised as "unjustified" as the company struggles with the global financial crisis.

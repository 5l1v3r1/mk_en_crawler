BUCHAREST, Romania -- The National Council of ethnic Hungarians from Transylvania is asking for territorial and cultural autonomy, Romanian Pro TV reported Monday (28 April). At least 1,200 delegates representing the radical wing of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR) attended a meeting of the Council on Saturday, and claimed to have set up the basis for local self-governance by ethnic Hungarians in Romania. The forum criticised the leaders of UDMR and discussed options for separate participation in next year's local elections. (Pro TV, BBC - 28/04/03)

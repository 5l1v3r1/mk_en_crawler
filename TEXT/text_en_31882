BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania will build a storage facility for small to medium radioactive waste near its Cernavoda nuclear plant, according to a report in Romania Libera on Thursday (28 November). The newspaper cites the National Nuclear Programme, approved earlier this month, under which the construction of the facility should be completed in 2010. The programme also envisions construction of a smaller facility nearby for temporary storage of spent nuclear fuel from Cernavoda. That is to be completed in the beginning of 2004, after the existing facility is full. (Rompres - 28/11/02)

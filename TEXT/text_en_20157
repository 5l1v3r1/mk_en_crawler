BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian President Boris Tadic said Sunday (December 16th) that he expects Russia, China, and perhaps other members of the UN Security Council, to push for a resumption of talks on Kosovo's future status. The Council is scheduled to discuss the just completed negotiations at a session on Wednesday. The EU and the United States have said further talks would be pointless, as neither side has changed its position during the previous two years of negotiations. 
"As long as I am this country's president, I will never accept Kosovo's independence because I am convinced that such a solution would put a question mark over the development and the future of the Balkans," Tadic said during an annual conference of Serbian ambassadors abroad. Addressing the same forum, Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said the EU member states are far from united on Kosovo. "Weeks and months ahead will be spent on continuing this hard diplomatic battle within the EU because the Union does not yet have a clearly defined position," he said.
Also on Sunday, Italy's Ambassador to the UN Marcello Spatafora said Security Council members have decided to allow Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu to address the debate Wednesday. Sejdiu will formally speak at the closed-door meeting. Serbia has objected to the idea. (Blic, Danas - 17/12/07; DPA, Beta, Tanjug, B92, RTK, Telegrafi, RFE, Balkanweb - 16/12/07)

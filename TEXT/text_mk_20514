ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on Thursday (January 10th) that he would hold a three-way meeting with the leaders of France and Germany to try to resolve differences over his country's bid for EU membership. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are the most outspoken critics of Turkey's bid. They propose a privileged relationship rather than full membership for Ankara. 
In other news Thursday, Erdogan announced details of the government's new action plan for 2008. The document involves major reforms covering a broad range of issues -- everything from unemployment to foreign policy.
Also Thursday, Erdogan said Iran will resume shipping natural gas to Turkey by Monday. Teheran suspended gas supplies earlier this week complaining of low temperatures and reduced supplies from Turkmenistan. In turn, Ankara was forced to terminate natural gas supplies to Greece.

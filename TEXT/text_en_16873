MALA RECICA, Macedonia -- The ethnic Albanian opposition Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) and its ally, the Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDP), decided on Monday (4 September) to boycott the work of parliamentary commissions. DUI and PDP leaders Ali Ahmeti and Abduladi Vejseli announced the decision after a meeting in Mala Recica. The coalition insists it should have been included in the new government, after winning the majority of ethnic Albanian votes in the 5 July parliamentary elections. DUI spokesperson Ermira Mehmeti says DUI-PDP plans further to stage a complete boycott of the legislature. (Makfax, Vecer - 05/09/06; A1 TV - 04/09/06)

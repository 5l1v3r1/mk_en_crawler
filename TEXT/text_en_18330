SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament's committee on political system and cross-community relations approved on Tuesday (March 13th) a law on co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal. Deputy Justice Minister Sasho Vasilevski said debate by the full Parliament would begin next week. The law binds all state institutions -- including the government, judiciary, and prosecutors -- to active co-operation with The Hague and regulates the scope of relations.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greek Cypriots should stop trying to please the church and hard-liners if they want to achieve progress in ongoing reunification talks, Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat warned on Saturday (November 15th). The Greek Cypriot administration "has to leave aside moves aimed at keeping the hard-line circles happy", Talat said at a ceremony marking the 25th anniversary of the founding of the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). "You cannot please extreme nationalists and at the same time extend your hand to Turkish Cypriots in peace," he stressed. Talat also condemned demonstrations Friday by Greek Cypriots against the TRNC's unilaterally declared independence.
Also on Friday, Cypriot President Demetris Christofias accused Turkey of failing to work for a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation but rather for a two-state solution on the island. He described as "devious" attempts by the Turkish side to persuade the international community that there are "two peoples in Cyprus instead of two communities".

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government will ban imports of goods from Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) starting on Thursday (January 1st), authorities announced on Friday. The move is in response to a decision by Belgrade and Sarajevo to ban the import and transport of goods that are marked with Kosovo customs stamps instead of UNMIK's. The decision is "final and supported by most consumers in Kosovo", said Safet Grcaliu, head of the foreign trade department at the Kosovo Chamber of Economy, adding Pristina would implement the measures gradually, in three or four stages.
In other news Friday, Belgrade reacted to Kosovo's announcement that it may ban Serbian government delegations from entering the country. The government "has never, nor will ever ask for [Pristina's] permission" to visit Kosovo, Serbian Secretary for Kosovo Oliver Ivanovic said. Pristina maintains that visiting Serbian delegations "seek to support Serb parallel structures and agitate Serbs against Kosovo institutions". (B92, Tanjug - 27/12/08; Beta - 26/12/08)

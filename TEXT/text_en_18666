TIRANA, Albania -- The parliamentary vote for president again failed on Sunday (July 8th) when neither of the two candidates could get the 84 votes needed. The ruling coalition's nominee, Bamir Topi, deputy chairman of the Democratic Party, collected 75 votes. Former Socialist Party Chairman Fatos Nano won just two votes, and two ballots were ruled invalid. The Socialist-led opposition walked out before the vote, refusing to back either candidate, though both had been approved earlier in the afternoon by the Parliamentary Law Commission. There is also controversy regarding the impact of Sunday's failed round: the Democratic Party says it should be considered the first round, as there were no concrete candidates to choose between in the two earlier rounds. The Socialists say this was the third failed round, clearing the way for early general elections.

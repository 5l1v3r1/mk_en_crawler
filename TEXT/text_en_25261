BUCHAREST, Romania -- Magistrates at the High Court of Cassation announced on Monday (September 28th) that they have decided to suspend their protest until October 31st. Their decision "was not prompted by any concrete offer from the government", they said, adding that their sole motivation was to serve "the rights and best interest of defendants, who are affected" by prolonging the work slow-down. The protest was prompted by a set of government measures to slash public spending, including the removal of a number of bonuses paid to public employees and freezing wages in the public sector. For judges in particular, this means abolishing their bonuses for workplace stress, which is roughly half of their net wage. (Gardianul - 29/09/09; Agerpres, EU Observer - 28/09/09)

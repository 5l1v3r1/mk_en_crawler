The second annual Serbia Open wrapped up on Sunday (May 9th) in Belgrade. Tens of thousands of fans from around the country came to see the best in international tennis battle it out for the trophy. 
The star of the show, however, bowed out early. Health problems forced defending champ Novak Djokovic, currently ranked number two in the world, to withdraw in the quarterfinal. 
 "Allergies are a big problem for me," Djokovic told reporters, after surrendering the match to fellow Serb Filip Krajinovic. "I will have to rest before preparing for Roland Garros and Wimbledon." 
It was a blow to his legions of Serbian fans. "I'm very sorry that Novak had to surrender the match," said student Milica Vasic, who came from Novi Sad to watch the tournament in Belgrade. "I had hoped for his triumph in the tournament, so I nearly cried when he had to quit." 
"I wish him a speedy recovery and many more victories," she told SETimes. 
 The finals match featured two Americans -- Sam Querrey and John Isner. The two are frequent doubles partners. 
On Sunday, Querrey survived a match point and rallied to beat Isner, 3-6, 7-6 (4), 6-4. 
This year's Serbia Open showcased 32 players in the singles bracket -- including world-ranked Swiss player Stanislas Wawrinka and Croat Ivo Karlovic. Novak's brother Marko Djokovic was also among the participants, but was eliminated in the first round. 
Sixteen pairs took part in the doubles, with Spaniard Santiago Gonzalez and American Travis Rettenmaier beating Poles Tomasz Bednarek and Mateusz Kowalczyk in the final. 
A former top player who recently ended his tennis career, Russia's Marat Safin, was the tournament's promoter. Prizes totalled 424,950 euros, with 74 matches played in nine days.

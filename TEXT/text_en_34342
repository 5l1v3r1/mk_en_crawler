TIRANA, Albania -- Economy Minister Arben Malaj said Friday (24 October) that ongoing political squabbles would not cripple the economy. But he urged the parties to work together to resolve differences so the economy is not affected. At issue is a decision by Prime Minister Fatos Nano to work with deputy ministers, since agreement on selecting two new cabinet ministers cannot be reached. (Albanian Daily News - 24/10/03)

TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu issued a statement Tuesday (28 February), voicing concern over recent domestic political tensions. Moisiu's statement referred particularly to the ruling Democratic Party and the main opposition Socialist Party, whose sniping lately has affected parliament's work and crucial electoral reform. Noting that Albania is poised to seal a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, Moisiu called on the parties to act responsibly.

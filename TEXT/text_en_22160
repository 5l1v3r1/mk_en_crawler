SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) is meeting on Wednesday (November 19th) and could discuss a new formula for the international presence in BiH. The Office of the High Representative was to end its mission in July 2007, but PIC members decided that political turmoil at the time prevented self-government. High Representative Miroslav Lajcak refused to elaborate on the new formula in an interview in Tuesday's edition of the Banja Luka-based daily Glas Srpske. He did, however, welcome the recent agreement among the main Bosniak, Serb and Croat leaders -- Sulejman Tihic, Milorad Dodik and Dragan Covic -- adding this is how BiH should function: namely, on the basis of a compromise among the three constituent peoples.
He also expressed pleasure with the response by the Council of Ministers, which has moved to put a nationwide census project on track and to implement decisions related to state assets and the state budget. The document, signed by the three political leaders on November 8th, stipulates their commitment to reforming the constitution, settling the state property issue and holding a census in 2011, a key precondition for eventual EU membership.

ANKARA, Turkey -- President Ahmet Necdet Sezer announced on Monday (June 18th) that he vetoed government-sponsored legislation aimed at reducing the time it takes to hold a nationwide referendum on changing the current presidential election system. The legislation was proposed by the ruling Justice and Development Party and approved by Parliament two weeks ago with an eye to holding the referendum on July 22nd, along with scheduled general elections. 
Sezer maintains that as the current parliament has completed its term, key decisions such as amending the constitution and changing the electoral system should be left to the next parliament. (Zaman - 19/06/07; NTV - 18/06/07)

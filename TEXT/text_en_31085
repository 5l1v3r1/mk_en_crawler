PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Parliament is expected to provide input Monday (March 7th) on the upcoming dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina. The government has proposed a draft resolution to legitimise the technical talks with Serbia. But some opposition parties want to delay the talks, insisting Kosovo should not act hastily given what they describe as much more urgent tasks that require attention. The Vetevendosje movement is expected to submit a resolution that will ask lawmakers to make the government suspend the talks, just a day before the first meeting between the delegations from Belgrade and Pristina in Brussels.

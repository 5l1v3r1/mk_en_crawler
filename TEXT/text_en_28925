TIRANA, Albania -- The OSCE head to Tirana Eugen Wollfarth urged various political parties on Tuesday (November 9th) to make sure women get their legal 30% representation in the next local elections. Equal representation in politics is a key parameter of modern democracy, Wollfarth said at a conference on increasing the participation of women. He called on political parties to respect the electoral code, pointing out that the May 2011 local elections are not that far off. The OSCE-organised conference in Tirana brought together more than 120 women active in political and public life from Albania, Slovenia and Macedonia. (Balkan Web, News 24, Alsat - 09/11/10)

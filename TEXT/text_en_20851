VIENNA, Austria -- The future of Kosovo is in Europe while its political status should be independence, Gregory Schulte, US permanent representative to the UN office in Vienna, told Radio Free Europe on Sunday (August 5th). He acknowledged that while Moscow and Washington share the same opinions on several issues, Kosovo remains a point of disagreement.
Separately Sunday, Veton Surroi, leader of the Kosovo reformist party ORA, said Pristina will start new negotiations with Belgrade because the international community requested it, but insisted that Kosovo independence is non-negotiable. Surroi is a member of the Kosovo negotiating team. (Kohajone, Lajm - 06/08/07; RTK, Kosovalive, Balkanweb, Telegrafi - 05/08/07)

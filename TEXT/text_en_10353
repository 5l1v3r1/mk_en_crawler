BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Leonid Milivojevic, on trial for the assassination of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic, denied any involvement in the crime Monday (20 September), changing the statement he made during arraignment hearings last year. Testimony related to the August 2000 murder of Stambolic and the attempted murder -- during the same year -- of then Serbian opposition leader Vuk Draskovic resumed at the Belgrade District Court on Monday. Milivojevic is a former member of a Serbian special police unit. Citing health problems, he said he could not recall his previous statements admitting guilt to police and investigating magistrates in either case. (B92, Tanjug - 20/09/04)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The minor Democratic Republican Union for Macedonia (DRUM) has decided to join the ruling VMRO-DPMNE-led coalition. DRUM leader Dosta Dimovska announced on Monday (November 6th) that the party rank and file are willing to help implement the cabinet's reform programme. She added that smaller parties are realising that, since the July elections, their future depends on joining efforts with the VMRO-DPMNE. (Vecer - 07/11/06; A1 TV, Focus - 06/11/06)

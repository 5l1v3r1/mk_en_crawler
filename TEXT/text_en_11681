SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown is making a four-day visit to the United States. In New York, Ashdown will address the UN Security Council about the situation in BiH, while in Washington he is expected to discuss co-operation with The Hague tribunal, BiH's bid to join Euro-Atlantic structures, and domestic political developments. 
In Sarajevo, meanwhile, weekend media reports suggested pressure is growing on BiH presidency Croat member Dragan Cavic to resign, amid charges of embezzlement and abuse of office. Calls reportedly have come from the Office of the High Representative, the Peace Implementation Council management board, the EU presidency in Luxembourg, and the US Embassy in Sarajevo.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The ruling Justice and Development Party's (AKP) Central Executive Board decides on Monday (April 7th) the formula it will pursue to fight a lawsuit aimed at closing it down. The AKP is also expected to tackle some long-awaited EU harmonisation bills, all within a mini-democratisation package aimed at gaining support from some opposition parties. If they fail to co-operate, then referendum options will also be debated during Monday's meeting. The lawsuit was filed by Chief Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya, who accuses the AKP of threatening secularism. 
The AKP's scramble for support has led to some horse-trading. The opposition Nationalist Movement Party, for example, wants parliamentary immunity lifted as a precondition for supporting any amendments that would make party closures more difficult.

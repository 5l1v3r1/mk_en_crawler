PRISTINA, Kosovo -- US Ambassador to Kosovo Christopher Dell predicts the new government will be formed before Independence Day, February 17th, the Kosova Sot daily reported on Wednesday (January 26th). "This is an important event for Kosovo. It is an important symbol to have a new, completely functional government on the third anniversary of the independence," Dell said, adding he'd like to see a government with a clear and coherent agenda. 
Incumbent Prime Minister Hashim Thaci has kept coalition options open and members of his Democratic Party (PDK) have hinted that the government would be formed in the first half of February. Preliminary results following the December snap general elections put Thaci's party first with about 32% of the votes. The second-place Democratic League of Kosovo and the fourth-place Alliance for the Future of Kosovo have hinted they are open to offers but are in no rush to form a coalition.

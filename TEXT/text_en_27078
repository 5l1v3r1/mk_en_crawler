BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO foreign ministers decided on Friday (December4th) to offer Montenegro a Membership Action Plan (MAP), but postponed a decision on Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) application, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen announced. 
"Today Montenegro has been granted its request to join the Membership Action Plan (MAP), and a clear message has been given to Bosnia that it will join the MAP once it achieves the necessary progress in reform," Anders Fogh Rasmussen said. He stressed that the Alliance will keep a close eye on the situation in BiH, which is in stalemate because of frequent conflicts between leaders of the three main ethic communities. 
The country "must and will also find its home in NATO: it's not a question of if, but when," he said. "But it is also true that Bosnia has more to do. We therefore decided that Bosnia will join the MAP once it achieves the necessary progress in its reform efforts." (DPA, ITAR-TASS â€“ 04/12/09)

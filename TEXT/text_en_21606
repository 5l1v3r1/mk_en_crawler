BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Democratic Party (DS) and G17 Plus on Friday (July 25th) condemned recent threats by Serbian Radical Party (SRS) member Vjerica Radeta against President Boris Tadic. Regarding the arrest of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, Radeta said a couple of days ago that Tadic should know that Serbia's betrayers do not go unpunished and warned that the president may suffer the same fate as Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, who was assassinated in March 2003. The DS and G17 Plus asked prosecutors to press charges against Radeta. "Unfortunately, we must conclude that the statement ... can be interpreted as a call for violence," said Nada Kolundzija, an official with the "For a European Serbia" coalition, led by Tadic's DS.

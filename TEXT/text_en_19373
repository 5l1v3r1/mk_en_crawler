SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Leaders of the right-wing Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) and Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria (DSB) met again on Monday (August 27th) to discuss whether to back the same candidate for mayor of Sofia in the October 28th local elections. This session followed failed negotiations between the UDF and Citizens for Bulgaria's European Development (GERB). The UDF refused to support GERB leader Boyko Borisov, the incumbent mayor. 
According to press reports, possible joint candidates include former Labour Minister Ivan Neykov of the UDF, and Ivan Grigorov, chairman of the Supreme Court of Cassation, who is backed by the DSB. (Monitor, Standart - 28/08/07; Netinfo, Darik, News.bg, BNT - 27/08/07)

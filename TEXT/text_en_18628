ATHENS, Greece -- Three hand-made bombs went off in Athens early Friday (June 8th). One damaged a bus belonging to a German-Greek school. The other two were thrown at cars parked in front of Opel and Mercedes-Benz car dealerships in Athens. The attacks all happened within ten minutes of each other but caused no injuries. Police say the attacks may be related to the G8 summit being held at a German resort. 
In other news, a Greek court opened extradition hearings Thursday against Australian drug lord Tony Mokbel, who was arrested in Athens earlier this week on an international arrest warrant. He faces charges of murder and drug trafficking in Australia. (Kathimerini, AP, DPA, AFP - 08/06/07)

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki said on Monday (August 31st) that Greece has toughened its stance in the name dispute with Skopje. He voiced concern that Athens could block Macedonia's EU bid as it did last year with the country's NATO accession. "The only shift was for the worse in their attitude. They have toughened their position," Milososki told Reuters on the sidelines of a Strategic Forum held in Bled, Slovenia. Greek Secretary General for European Affairs Dimitrios Katsoudas, who also attended the conference, said he is not optimistic the name dispute can be resolved soon.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The appeals panel of the war crimes chamber in BiH upheld on Tuesday (November 20th) the 34-year prison sentence handed down against former Bosnian Serb paramilitary commander Gojko Jankovic. He was found guilty of murdering, torturing and raping Bosniak and Croat civilians in Foca between 1992 and 1993. Although the court acquitted Jankovic of one rape charge, the judges confirmed all other charges related to crimes against humanity. His was the second case transferred to the BiH court by the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. (FENA, RTRS - 20/11/07)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Members of the terrorist organisation Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) killed four Turkish soldiers and injured at least seven others in weekend attacks. Militants opened fire on a military truck near Siran, in the province of Gumushane, causing the vehicle to overturn. Four soldiers were killed and three injured. The PKK had not been active in that area but according to experts, recent attacks suggest they are attempting to establish a presence there. In a separate incident, a mine blew up under a freight train, injuring four guards. (Hurriyet, Radikal - 07/08/06; AP, AFP - 06/08/06)

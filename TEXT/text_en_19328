PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Germany has boosted its contingent in Kosovo with another 500 troops to prevent possible unrest if Kosovo Albanians declare independence next month, the German Defence Ministry announced on Wednesday (November 28th). The German contingent now numbers 2,800. Defence Minister Franz Joseph Jung told the Rheinischer Merkur that Berlin added the battalion to strengthen regional security, whatever the result of the Kosovo status negotiations may be. He said Germany intends to keep its current 300 troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina, should any unrest in Kosovo spill over the border. (BNR, AFP, BTA, Rheinischer Merkur - 28/11/07)

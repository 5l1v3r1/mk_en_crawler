NEW YORK, United States -- Talks between Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas, Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan were to continue Thursday (12 February), following a 90-minute meeting Wednesday. None of the participants made any comment on the talks. However, Turkish media are reporting that Denktas proposed a tight new timetable, aimed at breaking the deadlock in peace negotiations to allow a reunited island to join the EU on 1 May. This timetable broadly incorporates proposals already made by Annan and includes a pledge to hold a referendum on a final agreement on 21 April.

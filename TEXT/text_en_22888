ANKARA, Turkey -- Chief prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya launched an investigation Wednesday (November 5th) into the ruling Justice and Development Party's (AKP) alleged links to a case of charity fraud in Germany. In September, a Frankfurt court convicted three managers of the Deniz Feneri charity foundation of illegally transferring Turkish-Germans' donations worth 14.5m euros to private companies.
Several people with close ties to the AKP, including the head of Turkey's media regulatory authority RTUK, Zahid Akman, were allegedly implicated. Yalcinkaya earlier prosecuted the AKP for allegedly threatening secularism in Turkey. (CNN Turk, Hurriyet, DPA - 05/11/08)

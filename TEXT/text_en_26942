ZAGREB, Croatia -- The country marked the 14th anniversary of the military offensive dubbed Operation Storm on Wednesday (August 5th). It ended the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina, which occupied around one-third of Croatia's territory in 1995. The biggest ceremony Wednesday was in the southern town of Knin, where senior government officials, war veterans and thousands of other people gathered. 
President Stipe Mesic denounced wartime atrocities committed during the offensive. "I condemn ... without hesitation, all crimes committed during the patriotic war," he said. The offensive killed hundreds of Serb civilians and prompted about 200,000 more to flee the area. (HRT, HINA, Dnevnik, Javno, AFP - 05/08/09)

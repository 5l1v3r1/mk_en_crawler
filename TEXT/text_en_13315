BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Belgrade's negotiating team for talks on Kosovo's final status must be formed after the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan appoints a special envoy, said Slobodan Samardzic, an adviser to Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica. Speaking Wednesday (26 October), Samardzic said an atmosphere of "haste" must not be created and moves must be carefully considered. 
Also Wednesday, Albanian President Alfred Moisiu sent a letter to Kosovo counterpart Ibrahim Rugova, backing independence for the province. Such an outcome would be best for Kosovo and the region, he wrote.
In Macedonia meanwhile, the opposition Democratic Union's leader Pavle Trajanov said Wednesday that Skopje must build its own strategy ahead of the Kosovo status talks and try to co-ordinate a common regional position with the other Balkan states.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Four elderly Serb returnees were injured in an explosion in the western Kosovo town of Klina on Tuesday (19 September). According to local officials, a bomb was thrown through the window of their home. A police spokeswoman said the four victims were hospitalised but their injuries were not life threatening. 
The incident comes days ahead of UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's report to the Security Council on the situation in the province, scheduled for Friday. Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku says he expects Ahtisaari to give a positive assessment of efforts to meet international standards and protect the rights of minorities.

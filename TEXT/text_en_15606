ATHENS, Greece -- Hundreds of tourists and residents left their hotels and homes in Halkidiki on Monday (21 August) to escape rapidly spreading forest fires. Most people fled to the beaches and were ferried out of harm's way. At least 20 homes were destroyed in the Cassandra area, prompting the government to declare Halkidiki a disaster zone. The authorities say they suspect arson. (Reuters, Evening Standard - 22/08/06)

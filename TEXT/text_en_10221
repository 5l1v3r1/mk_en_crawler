ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader failed to resolve their differences concerning the head of Croatia's counterintelligence agency (POA), Josko Podbevsek. Mesic said Sunday (28 November) that he rejected Sanader's proposal for the National Security Council to deal with the issue. The dispute started when Mesic proposed Podbevsek's dismissal after reporter Helena Puljiz was detained and questioned for hours by the POA over her alleged links to a businessman sought by the police. Sanader refused to sign the dismissal decree, saying Mesic's act was in response to the recent investigation into his former adviser, Zeljko Bagic. 
In other news, a 33-year-old Croatian mine removal technician was killed Saturday in Moscenica, near the town of Sisak. He was the 11th victim of mines planted in the area during the conflict of the 1990s. (Vjesnik - 29/11/04; HINA, HRT - 28/11/04; HINA - 27/11/04)

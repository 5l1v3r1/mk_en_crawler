ZAGREB, Croatia -- Four former Croatian policemen were sentenced to prison by a Croatian court on Friday (December 21st) for assisting in war crimes committed in Bjelovar in October 1991. The first convict, Luka Markesic, was sentenced to four years in prison, while the other three -- Zdenko Radic, Zoran Maras and Ivan Orlovic, were sentenced to three years each. 
The defendants were found guilty of allowing unidentified Croat militiamen to take six captured Yugoslav National Army soldiers and a civilian from a prison in Bjelovar to a nearby forest, where the militiamen opened fire on them. The soldiers were killed but the civilian survived. The four defendants were originally accused of war crimes, but the prosecution later dropped these charges and changed them to helping in war crimes. (B92 - 22/12/07; Hina, Beta, UPI - 21/12/07)

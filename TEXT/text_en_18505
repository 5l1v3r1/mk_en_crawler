PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- President Fatmir Sejdiu was elected leader of the biggest provincial party, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), during a LDK convention on Saturday (December 9th). The position has been vacant since the death of Ibrahim Rugova in January. Sejdiu received 189 votes, compared to 160 for his main rival, Nedzhat Daci. Addressing the delegates, Sejdiu said he would follow Rugova's vision for an independent Kosovo, based on the principles of Western democracies and respect for human rights.

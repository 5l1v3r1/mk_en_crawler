BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Parliament Speaker Predrag Markovic is expected Thursday (11 March) to announce the date for presidential elections and to outline work being done on the draft constitution. By law, elections must be announced 60 days after parliament is formed. Since 30 days must elapse between calling them and actually holding them, the vote could occur between 9 May and the end of June. On Wednesday, Democratic Party deputy head Dusan Petrovic said the party would likely decide next week whether to support an existing candidate or nominate its own.
In other news, Serbia-Montenegro Navy Corps Chief of Staff Rear Admiral Jovan Grbovac met on Wednesday with high-ranking US Navy officials, including military attache Gordon Drake and his deputy, Thomas Newcomb. They discussed the pace of army reforms and Serbia-Montenegro's readiness to enter Euro-Atlantic structures. (B92, Beta, BBC - 11/03/04; B92, BBC, Tanjug, Beta, Mina - 10/03/04)

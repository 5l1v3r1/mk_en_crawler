TIRANA, Albania -- The OSCE office in Albania has provided the Central Elections Commission (CEC) with equipment to be used in the elections process, media reported on Thursday (March 31st). About 35 computers will be used by middle-level commissions to help improve professionalism in the May 8th local vote. The OSCE is also financing TV clips and brochures that will be distributed under the name of the CEC inviting the citizens to participate in the process. Meanwhile, OSCE Ambassador Eugen Wollfarth confirmed that these elections will be held under the current Elections Code. According to him it will be impossible to make any changes in the last moment. This was a response to calls for part of the code to be changed before the process, a reform that has been delayed with a non-functioning parliament and boycott of the opposition.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Preparations for the next EU enlargement wave -- expected to result in the accession of Bulgaria and Romania -- have started at the European Parliament (EP), according to a report Friday (12 November) in the EU Observer. The EP Bureau is expected shortly to endorse a formal proposal to Sofia and Bucharest to designate representatives to the EP as soon as the two seal the accession treaty with the Union in 2005.

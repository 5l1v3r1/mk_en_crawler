SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A delegation of NATO's Parliamentary Assembly met on Thursday (June 24th) in Sarajevo with members of BiH's tripartite presidency. The 25-member delegation, led by Sverre Myrli, discussed regional issues, constitutional changes in BiH and the upcoming general elections. The Bosnian officials reaffirmed their country's commitment to Euro-Atlantic integration. Nebojsa Radmanovic said that BiH's constitution could be changed gradually and through consensus among local leaders, without pressure from the outside. Zeljko Komsic said that while BiH lacks functionality right now, by implementing reforms -- including constitutional ones -- it could become an efficient partner of the EU and NATO. Myrli stressed the importance of peace and stability. (Fena, Radio Free Europe - 24/06/10)

TIRANA, Albania -- Main opposition Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama accused the government of obstructing justice Sunday (October 12th) by protecting Bosnian businessman Damir Fazlic. Last week, Albanian prosecutors opened criminal proceedings against Fazlic for allegedly illegal financial activity. The justice ministry, in turn, launched an investigation into the legality of the prosecution's probe. "It is unacceptable that [Prime Minister Sali] Berisha threatens the prosecution in an attempt to defend a typical Balkan fraud," Rama said. 
In other news Sunday, local media reported that Albanian police seized 150kg of marijuana from a motorboat near the coastal town of Valona. The drugs allegedly were bound for Italy. Earlier last week, police seized another 300kg of marijuana intended for Greece, in the southern town of Girokastro.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Authorities received a note from the Albanian Interior Ministry on Saturday (17 July), praising the successful completion of power decentralisation talks by the ruling coalition partners. The proposed territorial division would enlarge the area of the Skopje municipality to allow the use of Albanian as a second official language there. The statement described the agreement as representing a major step towards full implementation of the Ohrid Peace Accord. However, opposition parties in Macedonia are planning a protest in Skopje on 25 July, the day before parliament starts debating the decentralisation package.

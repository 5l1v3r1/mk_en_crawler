BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Prime Minister Nikola Spiric said on Wednesday (September 17th) that the support he received from senior EU officials for BiH's European path translates into a responsibility for the country to meet European standards. Spiric was speaking in Brussels after meeting EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, European Commission Vice President Jacques Barrot, and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn. He briefed them on the current economic and political situation in BiH, noting this has been a successful year for the country: it has signed its Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, launched a dialogue regarding visa-regime liberalisation and received the status of intensive dialogue with NATO.

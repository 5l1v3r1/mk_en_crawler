Clerides said he wants to bring about the historic moment establishing unity and peace on the island in light of the UN Secretary Annan's plan for reunification. However, the 83-year-old president added that, if elected, he would perform his duty for only 16 months of the five-year term. Elections will be held in Cyprus on 16 February.

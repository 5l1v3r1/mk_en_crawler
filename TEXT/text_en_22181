THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic will face the UN war crimes tribunal Wednesday (September 17th) during a status conference in his trial, involving lawyers and prosecutors. Karadzic allegedly committed genocide, war crimes and violations of the rules and traditions of war during the armed conflict in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995. He has denied all charges.
Meanwhile, another former Bosnian Serb leader, Momcilo Krajisnik, requested on Tuesday that Karadzic be summoned as witness in the appeal of his Hague sentence. Krajisnik's request followed a three-hour meeting Friday with Karadzic in The Hague detention facility in Scheveningen. He is appealing a 27-year sentence.

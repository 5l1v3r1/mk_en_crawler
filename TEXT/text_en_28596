SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The head of Serbia's national council for co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, has reaffirmed Belgrade's determination to arrest former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic. But at the same time, he acknowledged it is a difficult task. In an interview with the Sarajevo-based Dnevni Avaz daily on Saturday (November 13th), he said that Mladic is being protected by a small group, less than five people. Ljajic also said that there is no indication Mladic is dead, as his family has claimed. (Dnevni Avaz, Tanjug - 13/11/10)

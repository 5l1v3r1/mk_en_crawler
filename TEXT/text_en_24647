BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Human Rights Watch (HRW) urged the EU on Friday (December 5th) to continue insisting that Serbia should detain war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic. "The EU needs to send a message to Serbia that full co-operation with the Hague war crimes tribunal [ICTY] remains essential for EU membership," the human rights watchdog wrote to the EU. Lotte Leicht of HRW said in the letter that the detention of Stojan Zupljanin and Radovan Karadzic is important but "does not constitute full co-operation".
Also on Friday, the HRW said cases of police brutality in Turkey have increased since the 2007 amendments to the law on police. The organisation alleges at least 28 cases of police brutality in 2008. It argues those amendments enable police to stop suspects and carry out raids without court approval. (Beta, B92, BBC, MIA - 05/12/08)

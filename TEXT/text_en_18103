SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Skopje Basic Court 2 ruled in favour Friday (June 15th) of 17 journalists from several Macedonian media and publications that sued the Interior Ministry and the telecom operator MT for illegally tapping their phones in 2001. The decision follows years of proceedings since the so-called "Big Ear" affair surfaced. Under the ruling, the state is ordered to pay each plaintiff almost 6,000 euros for the stress that resulted from the tapping. The lawyer representing the journalists says they will seek more compensation. (Utrinski Vesnik, Dnevnik, Vecer - 16/06/07; A1 TV - 15/06/07)

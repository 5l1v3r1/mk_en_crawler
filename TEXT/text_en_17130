BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU has given Serbian authorities more time to arrest and hand over Ratko Mladic to the UN tribunal, extending the deadline from Wednesday (5 April) until the end of the month. Speaking at a news conference Friday after a meeting with chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte in Brussels, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said progress has been made in Belgrade's co-operation with the tribunal. He also suggested "a credible possibility of concrete results in the weeks to come", saying Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica had given him a "firm commitment" that Mladic will be handed over. 
Brussels had been threatening to call off the next round of talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia-Montenegro, due to begin Wednesday, because of the Mladic case. Friday's decision means the talks will go ahead as scheduled. (Beta - 02/04/06; Danas, RTS - 01/03/06; BBC, AFP, AP, AFP, Reuters - 31/03/06)

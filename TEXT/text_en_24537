SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Tsvetan Tsvetanov, chairman of the election-winning Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), will serve as interior minister, the party's informal leader, Boyko Borisov, said on Wednesday (July 8th). Tsvetanov's background is in law enforcement -- he was an inspector for 17 years and an administrator for eight. GERB won Sunday's election, falling just five seats short of the 121 required to form a government. Borisov will be the next prime minister. (Trud, Novinar, Dnevnik, Klasa, Darik - 08/07/09)

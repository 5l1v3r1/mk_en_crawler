SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Republika Srpska (RS) government extended Friday (16 July) the deadline for its Srebrenica panel to present its final report. The new deadline, approved by High Representative Paddy Ashdown, is 15 October. RS government spokesperson Cvijeta Kovacevic said the extension was needed to ensure the successful completion of the commission's work, following the discovery of important new information related to the Srebrenica massacre, which took place in July 1995.
In other news Friday, the RS cabinet adopted draft amendments to the laws on territorial organisation, aimed at removing the prefix "Srpski" and changing the names of some settlements. The changes, which follow a recent ruling of the BiH Constitutional Court, were forwarded to the RS Assembly for approval. (Fena - 18/07/04; NTV Hayat, RS government Web site - 16/07/04)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu implied Tuesday evening (12 July) that he might reconsider his decision to resign. The comment followed a meeting with President Traian Basescu. Tariceanu said early elections could be avoided if parliament finds a way to push through key justice reform bills which were rejected by the Constitutional Court. Earlier in the day, Basescu met with the speakers of the two chambers of parliament. He urged them to rephrase articles in the bills so judicial reforms can be passed without affecting the EU accession agenda. (Rompres - 12/07/05)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Boyko Borisov told visiting Serbian counterpart Mirko Cvetkovic on Monday (February 21st) that a recent controversy related to commemorating the 138th anniversary of the death of Bulgarian national hero Vasil Levski in the Serbian town of Bosilegrad should be overcome. On February 18th, Serbian authorities created difficulties for Bulgarian citizens who wanted to lay flowers at a monument of Levski. Borisov told Cvetkovic that Levski is a national hero, who also fought for the freedom of all countries in the Balkans. Cvetkovic insisted that Serbian authorities never intended to ban the commemoration. The two leaders also discussed the EU integration of the Western Balkans, joint energy projects and ways to boost co-operation. (Dnevnik, BNR, Focus, BNT - 21/02/11)

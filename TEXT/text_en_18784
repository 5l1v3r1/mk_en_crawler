BRUSSELS, Belgium -- At a meeting in Brussels on Monday (March 5th), the EU foreign ministers urged Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) authorities to speed up police reforms, the main precondition to signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU. In a statement after the summit, the EU welcomed the formation of the new BiH Council of Ministers and encouraged the new authorities to quickly meet the three others conditions for an SAA -- reform of the national broadcaster RTV, co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal and continued administrative and legislative reforms. 
Also on Monday, Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik vowed that the RS police will remain responsible for the entity's territory while he is at the helm. RS's reluctance to transfer authority to state-level institutions has been an ongoing obstacle to police reform.

A new culture and sports centre opened this week in Gjilan, southeastern Kosovo. The centre -- funded by KFOR and USAID -- cost around 147,000 euros to build in the village of Partesh, which is a Serb enclave and a pilot municipality. 
Congratulating local residents, Tina Kaidanow, chief of mission of the US Office in Pristina, said that she is in Partesh to support the local community. "This project is a symbol of co-operation between Partesh and [the US government]. This is also a way to demonstrate that we care for the future," she said. 
 Kaidanow also said that co-operation between the Kosovo Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians is expected to increase, which will improve the life of Serbs in Partesh and other parts of Kosovo. 
According to US General Douglas B. Earhart, commander of the KFOR Multinational Brigade East, this is a very important centre for the citizens of Partesh. He said the centre is a symbol of the country's partnership with different agencies, of the partnership with the population and the youth of Partesh, and of the co-operation that will continue in the future. 
"I can assure you that the KFOR commitment for your benefit will continue for a long time in order to achieve a peaceful and safer environment in Kosovo," Earhart said. On behalf of Partesh's inhabitants, Kosovo Assembly Member Vesna Jovanovic thanked the US government for their significant support, saying that the project is very important for motivating the village youth. 
US soldiers, representatives from the US Office in Pristina and USAID, and members of KFOR attended Monday's dedication. Also present were two representatives from the Pentagon in Washington, DC, and from the office for social assistance. 
"I am very happy that we have this centre now and I hope that [the United States] will help us also in the future," said the Partesh resident Ljubisha Markoviq.

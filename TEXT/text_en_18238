PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The parliamentary commission for constitutional issues met on Tuesday (16 January), with members of the opposition finally participating. The panel is to draft a new constitution in light of the break-up of the former Serbia-Montenegro union and Montenegro's independence. The opposition had refused to take part in the commission's work while it awaited rulings from the Constitutional Court on their objections regarding procedural issues. 
Since the Court rejected all their appeals, the opposition parties finally assigned members to the panel's three sub-committees, working to draft specific parts of the new constitution. (Vijesti - 17/01/07; Mina - 16/01/07)

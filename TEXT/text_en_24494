SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik urged Serb soldiers Thursday (May 7th) to boycott NATO military exercises being held in Georgia through June 1st. BiH is supposed to send a total of 17 troops to the exercises, including members of its Serb, Bosniak and Croat communities. Dodik said soldiers from RS, which is an ally of Russia, should boycott the exercises, because Moscow strongly opposes them. In response, the Croat member of the three-member presidency, Zeljko Komsic, suggested removing Dodik from office and charging him with incitement of insubordination.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Local media are reporting on a series of high-level meetings in Ankara on Thursday (June 21st) that could be related to a possible cross-border military operation against Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terrorist bases in northern Iraq. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said only that he had met with senior military brass for a briefing on national security. But involvement by the Foreign Ministry, the National Intelligence Agency and the president -- among others -- may indicate more than that.

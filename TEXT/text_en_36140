ATHENS, Greece -- Acting on a tip, Greek police discovered a bomb in front of a Citibank branch in Athens on Sunday (14 March). An unidentified caller phoned a local newspaper saying the device would go off within 35 minutes. When officers arrived at the scene, they discovered a plastic bag containing two sticks of dynamite, a clock and a detonator. The device was later described as unsophisticated but powerful enough to cause death or injury. Police have no motives or suspects. (Reuters - 14/03/04)

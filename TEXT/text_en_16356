SREBRENICA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Several thousand Serbs gathered in Srebrenica on Wednesday (12 July) to honour their war dead. The event at the Bratunac military cemetery took place a day after Muslims marked the 11th anniversary of the massacre at Srebrenica by invading Bosnian Serb forces.
In other news Wednesday, a US court found a Bosnian immigrant guilty of hiding the fact that he had served in a Serb unit involved in the Srebrenica massacre when applying to settle in the United States. Marko Boskic, 41, a Croat, was acquitted on several other charges of document fraud but could serve up to ten years on each of the remaining two counts. He could then be deported to BiH.

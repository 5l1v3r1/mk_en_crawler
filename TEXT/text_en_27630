PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Six organisations representing civil society presented their own progress report Monday (October 25th) outlining a number of setbacks in Kosovo's development. The document is in advance of the European Commission's (EC) Progress Report on Kosovo, due on November 9th. The NGOs -- the Kosovar Centre for Security Studies, FOL Movement, the Institute for Advanced Studies-GAP, the Foreign Policy Club, the Kosova Democratic Institute, and the Balkan Policy Institute -- say that between October 2009 and October 2010, Kosovo institutions regressed in regards to fulfilling their obligations outlined in the EC Progress Report. They cite a continuing failure to effectively fight corruption and a poverty level of 45.5% across Kosovo. As for foreign policy, the report noted that eight countries have recognised Kosovo in the past year. Another issue highlighted in the report is northern Kosovo, which, according to the document's authors, remains outside the control of Pristina institutions.

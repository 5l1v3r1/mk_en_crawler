STRASBOURG, France -- The Council of Ministers within the Council of Europe decided Thursday (7 November) that it was not in a position to invite Yugoslavia to join at this time. The ministers "strongly encouraged the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and of Serbia and Montenegro to reach agreement and to adopt rapidly the constitutional charter," indicating that this was one of the conditions for admission. They also urged Belgrade to fulfil its international obligations and improve co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. (FoNet - 08/11/02; AFP, Tanjug - 07/11/02)

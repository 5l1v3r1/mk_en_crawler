BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Serbia's Parliament is expected Tuesday (5 November) to discuss draft amendments, proposed by the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition, to the Law on Presidential Elections. The draft is being resubmitted to the legislature after undergoing changes in response to the failed September election. The revised draft would eliminate the 50 per cent turnout requirement for the second round. It also provides for a shorter election campaign - 30 rather than 45 days. Meanwhile, Belgrade media sources are speculating that Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) may end its several-month boycott and finally appear at Tuesday's parliamentary session. Talks continue on restoring the mandates of 45 DSS members stripped of their seats in Parliament over the summer. (Tanjug, BBC, RTS TV - 04/11/02)

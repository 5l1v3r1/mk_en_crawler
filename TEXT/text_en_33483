ANKARA, Turkey -- On Friday (26 September), Turkish police requested Interpol's assistance in the arrest of two members of the Uzan family. Brothers Kemal and Yavuz Uzan have allegedly fled to Jordan after failing to appear on trial for the misappropriation of more than $6 billion. The investigation against the family and its business empire started in June after police confiscated the accounts of 82 Uzan firms in connection with embezzlement charges. Uzan family members claim the action against them is politically motivated. (AFP - 26/09/03)

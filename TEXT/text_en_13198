BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian prosecutors have indicted Deputy Prime Minister George Copos on charges of tax evasion, international media reported Friday (27 January). The move is being seen as part of the government's efforts to stamp out corruption ahead of the country's EU accession. It was not immediately clear whether Copos's Conservative Party will remain in the cabinet following the indictment. (Reuters - 28/01/06, 27/01/06)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Constitutional Court ruled on Wednesday (October 6th) that amendments to the pension law are constitutional, thus rejecting appeals submitted by the opposition. Parliament approved important changes to the law in mid-September, sparking appeals from 88 lawmakers representing the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) and National Liberal Party (PNL). In addition, the opposition accused the president of the Deputies Chamber, Roberta Anastase, of vote forgery, taking legal action against her as well. That part, however, is beyond the scope of the Constitutional Court. After Wednesday's ruling on the pension law, the next move in the process is for President Traian Basescu to promulgate the legislation, a formality in this case. But opposition leaders have threatened to launch an impeachment procedure against him if he proceeds. The controversial amendments to the pension law envision gradually raising the retirement age to 65 for both men and women, one of several austerity measures implemented in July.

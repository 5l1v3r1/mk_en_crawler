ATHENS, Greece -- France and Greece signed an agreement on Friday (June 6th) on strategic co-operation in security and defence. The deal was inked during a one-day official visit by French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy to Athens. The Greek government said that "this partnership, based on political solidarity and mutual support, will boost defence in Europe and the Atlantic Alliance". The document urged the strengthening of military and civil capacity for coping with crises. 
During his visit, Sarkozy delivered the first speech to the Greek parliament by a French president in more than 25 years. He highlighted immigration and supported the idea of setting up a joint "European border system". Sarkozy expressed interest in Greece's idea of a joint French-Greek system of coast guard patrols.

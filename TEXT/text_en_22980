PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Deploying military officers to missions abroad will position Montenegro on the international political scene and will prove its commitment to global peace, Montenegrin Defence Minister Boro Vucinic said on Saturday (May 3rd), in an interview with Podgorica-based newspaper Vijesti. He added that Montenegro's defence system is committed to protecting national security, as well as regional co-operation and beyond. Vucinic said that if a country benefits from collective security, it should contribute to it. According to the minister, the issue of deploying troops to missions abroad is a professional challenge and a chance for army officers to advance in their career and pay scale. (Vijesti - 03/05/08)

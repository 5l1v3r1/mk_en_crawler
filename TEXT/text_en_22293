THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal announced on Tuesday (May 13th) it transferred Bosnian Croat Vinko Martinovic to serve the rest of his 18-year prison sentence in Italy. Martinovic, also known as Stela, served as commander of a Convicts' Battalion sub-unit with the Croatian Defence Council that attempted to drive Bosnian Muslims from the west bank of Mostar between April 1993 and April 1994. A court convicted him in March 2003 of forcing Muslims out of their homes and into a detention camp, "where they were forced to dig trenches or carry wounded or dead soldiers, and serve as human shields on the front line". In May 2006, the court rejected an appeal and upheld the 18-year sentence. Italy is one of 15 countries in Europe that volunteered to enforce Hague tribunal sentences.

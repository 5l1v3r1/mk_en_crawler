ATHENS, Greece -- Interior Minister Prokopis Pavlopoulos filed his resignation after a series of riots rocked the country and a policeman shot and killed a teenager on Saturday (December 6th). Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, however, has refused to accept the resignation. 
Riots broke out in Athens, Thessaloniki and other cities late on Saturday after the police killed a 16-year-old boy. According to witnesses, two boys threw rocks and firebombs at a police car in the Exarchia district of the capital. An officer inside the vehicle shot one of the teenagers. The incident brought hundreds of rioting youths onto the streets, whom police dispersed with tear gas. "An investigation is under way, and those found responsible with be punished," Pavlopoulos said.
Also on Saturday, hundreds of immigrants awaiting their turn to submit asylum applications rioted in downtown Athens, setting trash bins on fire and stoning cars. Participants said the riot started when a man fell into a nearby canal, after which authorities stopped admitting applications for the day.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The leader of the Ansar movement in BiH, Imad al Husini, also known as Abu Hamza, said on Wednesday (December 26th) that the Mujahideen plan to organise protests in Sarajevo against perceived human rights violations against people of Afro-Asian origin in the country. "When the holidays are over, we will organise protests in Sarajevo over the violation of our rights. We expect to draw 5,000 people, but we will observe all laws," Abu Hamza said. He criticised recent government measures that he said stripped some individuals of their BiH citizenship. A review commission in parliament has taken away the passports of about 400 people, mainly of Afro-Asian origin, who arrived in BiH during the conflicts of the 1990s.

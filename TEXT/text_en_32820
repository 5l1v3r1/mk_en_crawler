SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The foreign ministry issued a statement Thursday (5 December), suggesting the attack on the offices of its honorary consul in Karachi may have been the work of Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network. A foreign ministry official told reporters later in the day that messages on the walls of the building appeared to confirm the connection. There were also threats of future attacks. The office of President Boris Trajkovski denied any link between the bombing and an incident in March in which six Pakistanis were killed by Macedonian police who suspected them of plotting attacks on foreign embassies in the country.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- President Ibrahim Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo won 47 per cent of the vote in the province's general elections, an independent monitoring organization said Sunday (24 October). Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo came in second, with a projected 27 per cent, and Ramush Haradinaj's Alliance for the Future of Kosovo was third, with 8 per cent. If the results are confirmed, no single party would be able to form a cabinet on its own and a coalition would have to be negotiated. Official preliminary results are expected Monday. Kosovo's Electoral Commission said turnout among the 1.4 million registered voters was 53 per cent. 
Serbs in Kosovo and Serb refugees in Serbia largely boycotted the vote. UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen said many members of the minority would have gone to the polls if they had not been put under pressure by their leaders. He added that only those Serb politicians who had participated in the election would take part in determining the province's final status.

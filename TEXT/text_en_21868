PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu signed a decree Wednesday (June 18th) establishing the first nine Kosovo embassies in capitals of countries that have recognised its independence: Brussels, Washington, London, Paris, Berlin, Rome, Vienna, Bern and Tirana. Still unclear is when the embassies will actually open.
Sejdiu and Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni plan to attend Friday's UN Security Council meeting in New York, where the reconfiguration of UNMIK is on the agenda. On Wednesday, Sejdiu awarded outgoing UNMIK chief Joachim Rucker the Medal for Civil Service for his contributions to Kosovo.

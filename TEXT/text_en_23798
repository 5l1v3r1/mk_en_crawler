SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor who had received death sentences in Libya on charges of deliberately infecting more than 400 children with AIDS will demand millions of euros in compensation from Libya over their unfair detention, their Dutch lawyer, Liesbeth Zegveld, announced on Monday (April 20th). In a letter to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, Zegveld requested "humanitarian assistance and financial support" that would allow the six medics to start over after their unfair imprisonment for more than eight years in Libya. The medics want Libya to pay for all "economically assessable damages", which amount to "several million euros" for their years behind bars, during which they could not make any income. Libya released them in the summer of 2007 after intervention by French President Nicolas Sarkozy. (AFP, BTA, Dnevnik, BNR - 20/04/09)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg dismissed on Monday (1 November) rumours of a planned cabinet reshuffle, saying government changes were "not on the agenda". Local media continue to speculate, however, that he intends a reshuffle prior to the 2005 parliamentary elections due to public disapproval of certain cabinet members. 
In other news Monday, the defence ministry announced that it has started the long-anticipated relocation of its troops in Iraq from Karbala to Al-Diwaniyah. The move started on Friday. For security reasons, no exact numbers were given. The troops will remain under Polish command at their new location. (Sega, Standart - 02/11/04; Mediapool, AFP, bTV - 01/11/04)

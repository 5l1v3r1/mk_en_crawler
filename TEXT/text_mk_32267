SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria and Romania may provide logistical support to potential US military operations against Iraq, according to Bulgarian and Romanian Defence Ministers Nikolay Svinarov and Ioan Pascu. According to Pascu, Romania might even provide support without a UN resolution, as it has already begun to act as an US ally without being a member of NATO yet. Svinarov took a more cautious approach and said that the Bulgarian government would take decisive measures only after all diplomatic means are exhausted. In any case, both ministers said that Washington would most probably sign explicit agreements with the two countries, if the US Congress approves military strikes against Iraq.

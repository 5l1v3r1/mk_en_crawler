SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Former National Liberation Army (NLA) commander and current leader of the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) Ali Ahmeti said on Wednesday (15 February) there is a written agreement that prevents the processing in Macedonia of four cases dealing with alleged atrocities committed by the NLA during the 2001 conflict. Ahmeti told reporters in Skopje that the agreement was sealed between the late Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski and NATO special envoy Pieter Feith in 2001, guaranteeing that the four cases were exclusively under the jurisdiction of the UN tribunal. A government delegation from Skopje is at The Hague to discuss taking over the four cases, suspended by the tribunal last year. (A1 TV, Telma TV - 15/02/06)

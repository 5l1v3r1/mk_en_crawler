According to an annual report conducted by Greek police forces and sent to Europol, authorities investigated 157 cases of organised crime during 2003. Fourteen types of crime were recorded, ranging from relatively minor ones -- such as insider betting and illegal trading of cultural products -- to extremely serious ones, including drug smuggling, blackmail, forgery, child pornography and human trafficking. 
Organised crime groups are generally structured according to nationality, with members of a particular nationality usually engaging in the same type of crime, the report found. Of the groups reported in Greece, none are sufficiently organised to engage in international operations. 
According to the police, Albanian crime groups are the best-organised and most violent, as well as the most likely to collaborate with Greeks. They are mainly involved in cross-border drug smuggling, human trafficking, thefts, robberies and illegal immigration. Despite the notoriety of Albanian organised crime, however, the report found that the number of Albanian citizens in Greece who are involved in criminal activity is relatively small. Only 1 out of every 3,000 have been convicted in a criminal case. 
Bulgarian crime groups in Greece engage in counterfeiting, forgery, human trafficking and drug dealing, the report said. Crime groups from Macedonia, Turkey, Pakistan, Iran and China are mostly involved in cases of illegal immigration. Russian and Ukrainian groups deal mainly in cigarette smuggling and the sex trade. 
Most of the groups' members use modern technology to expand and broaden their operations and to elude police. To differing degrees, all groups use physical brutality to ensure internal cohesion and to intimidate victims.

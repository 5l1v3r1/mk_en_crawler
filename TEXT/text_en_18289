PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Parliament Speaker Ranko Krivokapic announced on Monday (January 15th) that he has scheduled an extraordinary session of the legislature for January 30th to discuss the unsolved murder of Montenegrin journalist Dusko Jovanovic. Late last month, the Montenegrin High Court acquitted Damir Mandic, one of those charged in connection with the 2004 murder of the Dan editor-in-chief. Critics described the verdict as scandalous, given the evidence presented. (Vijesti - 17/01/07; Mina - 16/01/07)

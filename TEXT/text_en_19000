TIRANA, Albania -- Political parties that plan to run in next month's local elections must register by December 10th, the Central Election Commission (CEC) announced on Sunday (December 3rd). The same deadline applies to local authorities responsible for submitting the final voter lists. On Saturday, President Alfred Moisiu decided to schedule the election for January 20th, criticising the main parties for failing to agree on a date themselves. (Albanian News - 04/12/06)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- In an official statement released Friday (7 May), UNMIK denied accusations by Amnesty International about human trafficking and prostitution in the province. The human rights organisation said human trafficking and prostitution were widespread in the province, and that about 20 per cent of the men hiring prostitutes were from international missions in the province. UNMIK described the report as tactless and said it used data from 1999 to 2001, which failed to account for new efforts by UNMIK to end this activity. While conceding that one international police officer and three UNMIK employees were apprehended for using such services, UNMIK insisted the numbers presented by the NGO were inaccurate.

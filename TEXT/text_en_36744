STRUGA, Macedonia -- At least 17 people, including seven policemen, were injured in Thursday's (22 July) riot in front of the regional headquarters of the ruling party SDSM. The unrest was triggered by the unexpected visits of Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski and SDSM Secretary General Nikola Kurciev to the headquarters. A crowd gathered outside to protest the government's new bill on territorial division. They ended up throwing stones, bottles and Molotov cocktails at the building. Buckovski and Kurciev were under siege for almost five hours until special police units arrived and managed to disperse the crowd.

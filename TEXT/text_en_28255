BUCHAREST, Romania -- NGOs protecting Roma rights urged Bucharest on Monday (August 16th) to secure integration for those soon returning from France, but at the same time warned against their illegal extradition by French authorities. "The Romanian authorities must concentrate on social integration, not only at the central level through strategies and programmes, but also at a local level," Magda Matache, head of the NGO Romani Criss, told AFP. According to her, children who lived in France will need help matriculating into Romania's education system, while adults should be offered assistance to receive professional qualification and start work. Mihai Neacsu, of the NGO Amare Rromentza, says most Romas who leave home to work abroad come from very poor communities with little education or infrastructure. France recently announced plans to close illegal Roma camps on its territory and extradite those with criminal pasts. (AFP - 16/08/10)

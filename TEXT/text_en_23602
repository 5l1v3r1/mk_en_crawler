ATHENS, Greece -- Police clashed on Wednesday (January 28th) with disgruntled public employees in downtown Athens. Around 800 demonstrators protested problems with the government's pension insurance policy and tried to enter the building housing the economy and finance ministry. Police used rubber truncheons and tear gas to disperse them.
Meanwhile, some of the farmers who have been blocking main roads throughout Greece for days demanding higher state subsidies began to disperse on Wednesday. The blockade of one of the main roads -- connecting the Peloponnese peninsula with the rest of Greece -- ended. However, much of the north remains paralysed, including the Promachon checkpoint at the border with Bulgaria, where hundreds of truckers have languished for a week.
Air traffic controllers had also planned a strike for Wednesday, demanding additional staff and better healthcare benefits. However, a last-minute court ruling declared that strike illegal. Despite that, international airlines cancelled dozens of international flights to and from Greece. (ANA-MPA, Kathimerini, UPI, DPA, Reuters, BTA - 28/01/09)

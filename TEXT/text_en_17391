STRASBOURG, France -- The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe endorsed on Wednesday (June 27th) the report by rapporteur Dick Marty on secret CIA detention centres in Europe, especially in Romania and Poland. Romania's delegation refused to take part in the vote, leaving the hall after its demands for corrections were rejected. Bucharest insists Marty lacks sufficient evidence for his claims.

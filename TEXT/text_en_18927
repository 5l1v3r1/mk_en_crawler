ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan stressed that the government's priority would be to ensure that the presidential elections next month are held in an atmosphere of peace and confidence. Speaking to the media Tuesday (April 3rd), he added that he wants to avoid any tension before the vote, implying this might be one reason he is delaying the official announcement of his candidacy. Secular circles oppose the notion of Erdogan running, in light of his party's Islamist roots.
In other news Tuesday, a prosecutor in the southeastern Anatolian province of DiyarbakÄ±r asked a court to imprison more than 53 mayors for allegedly supporting the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party. The mayors sent a letter to Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, asking him to allow pro-Kurdish Roj TV to continue its broadcasts. (Zaman, The New Anatolian - 04/03/07; AP - 03/04/07)

ATHENS, Greece -- A two-day strike by bank employees ended on Friday (17 February) with clashes between riot police and workers. The strikers had tried to force their way into a branch of the ATEbank in Athens, to protest the refusal of bankers to negotiate with union workers on a new collective labour agreement. New Labour Minister Savvas Tsitouridis is calling for restraint. (Kathimerini - 18/02/06; ANA - 17/02/06)

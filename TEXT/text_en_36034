BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen told Reuters Thursday (25 March) that Romania is back on track for EU entry in 2007 after recent "warning shots" and the dismissal of the justice minister over corruption concerns. While Verheugen did not exclude the possibility of Bulgaria completing EU accession negotiations before Romania, he said it was more realistic to expect the two countries would join the Union in January 2007.

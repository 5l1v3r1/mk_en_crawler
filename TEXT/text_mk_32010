DURRES, Albania -- The Italian ship Romea arrived at the port of Durres with aid from the Italian government for the Albanian Armed Forces (AAF) on Sunday (20 October). The ship is carrying materials needed to rebuild the Buna Bridge as well as a considerable number of vehicles, worth 1.75m euros. Gen Kostaq Karoli, the Albanian Army's commander of land forces, and the Italian ambassador to Albania, Mario Bova, were on hand at the port, along with the chief of the Italian Delegation of Experts (DIE), Gen Luigi Cantone. DIE has been a presence in Albania since 1997 following an agreement between the two defence ministries. The organisation supports AAF in the adoption of NATO model structures. Currently DIE and the defence ministry are working on 21 different projects. (ATA - 20/10/02)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Public transportation vehicles operating between Serb-dominated enclaves and Serbia have been banned, for lack of necessary licenses. Vehicles were prevented from crossing the border at the Merdare checkpoint on Sunday (May 9th), Pristina-based media reported on Monday, quoting Kosovo Serb media. Since 1999, mini-buses have been operating from Gracanica to Serbia, based on licenses issued by UNMIK authorities. Now, the ministry of transport and telecommunications wants full-sized buses used, and operated only out of the main bus station in Pristina.

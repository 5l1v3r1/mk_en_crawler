SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia has no alternative to the Ohrid Agreement, said Party for Democratic Prosperity leader Abdulmenaf Bexheti. In an interview Sunday (10 August) for Radio Free Europe, he explained that if the agreement is not implemented within set deadlines, the idea of self-determination of Albanians in Macedonia might become a reality. He added that no economic prosperity could be expected in a country where the ministers of interior and defence continue to be the most important government figures. (A1 TV, MIA - 10/08/03)

Gazprom plans to build a 400km pipeline through Serbia, extending from the border of Bulgaria to that of Croatia. A memorandum of understanding has been signed by the Russian firm's general manager, Alexander Medvedev, together with Serbian Energy and Mining Minister Radomir Naumov and Srbijagas general manager Milos Milankovic. 
The pipeline will carry Russian natural gas from Turkey to northern Italy via Bulgaria, Serbia, and Croatia. Its capacity will total 20 billion cubic metres of gas per year. According to government calculations, the pipeline will deliver $200m in revenue, to be divided between Serbia and Gazprom. Construction amounts to a $1 billion investment. 
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said the project is important not only because it constitutes a large investment, but also because of the potential for secured gas supplies to Serbia. Economy Minister Predrag Bubalo added that the pipeline construction will contribute to the country's energy and overall security, while President Boris Tadic emphasised the importance of making Serbian industry natural-gas oriented, as natural gas is cheaper. This, he said, will make Serbian products more competitive on the European market. 
Russian Ambassador to Belgrade Alexander Alexiev said the signing of the pipeline memorandum brings Serbia and Russia closer to resolving the economic issues that have stalled enhanced bilateral co-operation. "Russia is Serbia's main trade partner, and this year's trade will exceed $ 2 billion," Alexiev said. 
There are about 190,000 natural gas consumers in Serbia. But only 1,000 of these are industrial facilities, which use natural gas mostly for heating. Estimates suggest there are some 250,000 potential new users. Serbia currently meets 14% of its energy demands with natural gas, and by 2020 the share is to increase to 20%.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The EU reportedly has invited Croatia to present its position on the Energy chapter of the acquis, ahead of its opening. State TV HRT quoted a statement Tuesday (May 22nd) from the German EU Presidency, which suggested talks on the chapter could begin before Germany's term ends in late June. The government in Zagreb hopes to open all chapters this year and close them by the end of 2008. (Vjesnik - 23/05/07; HRT - 22/05/07)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The leader of Kosovo's Vetevendosje (Self-Determination) movement, Albin Kurti, was held briefly at the Blace border point between Kosovo and Macedonia late Tuesday (May 5th). Authorities stopped him for questioning, Macedonian Interior Ministry spokesman Ivo Kotevski said. Kurti was travelling to Macedonia to help celebrate the third anniversary of the Skopje-based civil movement Zgjohu. He told media in Pristina that Macedonian inspectors carrying weapons questioned him in a dark room. "They told me 'There is no reason for you to come here and talk about Albanians' rights, '" Kurti said. (Koha Ditore, Epoka e re - 06/05/09; Kohavision, RTK - 05/05/09)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A divided BiH cannot be a member of the EU, bloc foreign policy chief Javier Solana said on Tuesday (March 24th). In an interview with Federation of BiH (FBiH) state television, Solana urged all politicians and international representatives to work for the functioning of local institutions. He also said he hopes BiH will implement its recently signed Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. Solana added that while the Union will continue to work on behalf of BiH, the country itself should implement reforms.
Newly appointed High Representative Valentin Inzko echoed that sentiment Tuesday, saying BiH is welcome to join the EU, provided it implements the necessary reforms and meets the necessary conditions. Inzko plans to meet on Thursday with the Peace Implementation Council, which his predecessor, Miroslav Lajcak, still chairs. Thursday is Inzko's first formal day in office in Sarajevo.

ATHENS, Greece -- A new report by the US State Department has found that the Greek media are not objective, the Macedonia Press Agency (MPA) reported on Friday (3 October). Many media sources are owned by large business interests which use their newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations to promote their agendas, the report concludes.
Also on Friday, MPA reported that the US State Department has included 17 November and the Revolutionary Cores on its list of 36 groups considered to be active terrorist organisations.
Meanwhile, several public sector trade unions announced plans to launch strikes this week, demanding a larger pay increase than the government has offered. (Kathimerini, Mediapool - 06/10/03; AFP - 05/10/03; MPA - 03/10/03)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign ministry spokesman Namik Tan reacted strongly Tuesday (5 September) to a draft report on Turkey's progress in the EU accession process that the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee approved on Monday. The document was highly critical of slowdown in reforms, as well as repeated warnings Ankara has received about failing to open its naval and air space to Greek Cypriot vessels and planes. Tan rejected these statements, as well as a call -- implied in the report -- for Turkey to recognise its WWI-era actions in Armenia as genocide. (Sabah - 06/09/06; Zaman, Cihan - 05/09/06)

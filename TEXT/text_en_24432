SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov on Sunday (January 11th) asked his Romanian counterpart Traian Basescu to allow the free transit of Ukrainian gas to Bulgaria through Romania's distribution network, the president's office said in a statement. Ukraine has proposed supplying Bulgaria with 1.5 to 2 million cubic metres of natural gas per day from its own reserves to help Sofia cope with the ongoing gas crisis. Bulgaria, however, needs Romania's assistance so that the promised Ukrainian gas can reach it. Basescu said his country will start transporting Ukrainian gas to Bulgaria as soon as it reaches its territory. He also said Romania is ready to supply Bulgaria with electricity if needed. Bulgaria has been facing a severe natural gas shortage since last Tuesday, when all Russian gas deliveries via Ukraine ceased over a row between Moscow and Kiev.

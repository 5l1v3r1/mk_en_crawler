SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Georgi Stoev, a crime story writer believed to have had ties with organised crime, died in hospital after he was shot in broad daylight Monday (April 7th). The gunmen managed to escape amid heavy traffic on one of Sofia's busiest streets. Stoev, 34, was reportedly on his way to a meeting to discuss his latest book about organised crime in Bulgaria. A former figure in the criminal world himself, Stoev purportedly was familiar with deals involving hit men, drug distribution and grudges among crime bosses. 
He was killed less than 24 hours after the murder -- late Sunday -- of Borislav Georgiev, a businessman close to Hristo Kovachki, one of the most successful local entrepreneurs in the energy sector. (BTA, BGNES, Darik, AP - 07/04/08; BTV - 06/04/08)

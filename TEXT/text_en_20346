SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Security Minister Tarik Sadovic officially launched the operation Monday (October 15th) of the new Migration Information System (IMS). It consists of an integrated electronic database that incorporates all data regarding foreign nationals seeking to enter, reside in, or leave BiH. It also provides a real-time connection between databases in the foreign ministry, ministry of security, the BiH Border Police and the Service for Foreigners' Affairs, enabling the collection, sharing and dissemination of relevant migration information. BiH will use the new system to boost border controls and convince the EU to further liberalise its visa regime for BiH citizens. (EC Delegation press release, Reuters, RTRS - 15/10/07)

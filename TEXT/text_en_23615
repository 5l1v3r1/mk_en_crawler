NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias and Attorney General Petros Clerides met on Tuesday (January 27th) and decided to file a case with the European Court of Human Rights after a Turkish actor said he killed ten people during the 1974 Turkish military operation on Cyprus. Government spokesman Stefanos Stefanou says Nicosia will raise the matter before the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers as well. Last week, actor Attila Olgac, who served in Cyprus in 1974, told a TV show in Turkey that he shot dead a 19-year-old prisoner of war in cold blood and then nine other Greek Cypriots. He later retracted the claim, saying he made it up to attract attention to the brutality of war. Stefanou said Cyprus intends to force Turkey to help clarify the fate of about 1,500 people who went missing during the Turkish invasion.
In other news, Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat are meeting Wednesday for their 17th round of direct reunification talks. They are expected to start discussing property, one of the thorniest issues. (Vatan, Yeni Safak, Hurriyet - 28/01/09; CNA, NET, ANA-MPA, Reuters, AP, AFP, Xinhua - 27/01/09)

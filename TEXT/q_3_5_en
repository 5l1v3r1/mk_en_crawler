IV. NON-HARMONISED AREAS 
A. Measures having an equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions 

1. Do measures exist in the laws, regulations or administrative provisions adopted at national or local level on the production, distribution and marketing of food products and industrial products: 
a) Relating to the price of such products (e. g. fixing the prices above or below which the importation or marketing of a product is prohibited or restricted, laying down profit margins or other price components, etc.)? There are no legal measures, regulations or provisions in the Republic of Macedonia relating to product prices. b) Which require automatic or non-automatic import licence or permits for imported goods (e.g. licence for import of automobiles)? There are no legal measures, regulations or provisions in the Republic of Macedonia requiring an import license or permits for imported goods. c) Which make access to the domestic market conditional upon having an agent or representative in the territory of your country (e.g. legislation which provides for the sale of certain goods in your country subject to authorisation that may be obtained only by a person established there)? There are no legal measures, regulations or provisions in the Republic of Macedonia enabling access to the domestic market provided that there is one agent or representative on the territory of Macedonia. d) Which oblige importers to have storage facilities in the territory of your country (e.g. legislation applying only to imported goods which require these imported goods to be stored for some time before being marketed)? Companies importing oil derivates are obliged to have special warehouses. This obligation applies for wholesale importers and traders as well. e) Which impose on the marketing of imported products conditions (relating in particular to shape, size, weight, composition, presentation, identification and packaging, labeling) that are different from those imposed on domestic products or which require or encourage the use of certain type of packaging (shape, size, composition) for the marketing of a certain product, whether domestic or imported (e.g. requirement that some goods may only be sold in a package with special form)? 
The Law on Safety of Foodstuffs and Products and Materials in Contact with Foodstuffs (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 54/2002) provides certain requirements for packaging, types and size of packaging, net weight or volume of the product, composition, identification and labelling, but these conditions refer to all products, regardless whether they are of domestic produce or imported. For all stipulated requirements, the producer, foodstuff trader or importer are obliged to satisfy the conditions under the Macedonian Food Code.  Part of the rulebooks has been developed and part is at the development procedure and they comply with European legislation. f) Which oblige economic operators to label their product with the “Made in …” marking (obligatory origin marking)? Does not exist. g) Which encourage or authorise the purchase (by individuals or public authorities) of domestic products alone or give preference to the purchase of such products in advertising campaigns (e.g. promotion actions with the participation of public authorities applying only to goods produced by producers in your country or from domestic raw materials)? Does not exist. h) Which exclude imported products alone, in full or in part, from the possibility of using domestic facilities or equipment or which reserve the use of such facilities or equipment, in full or in part, for domestic products alone? Does not exist. i) Which subject imported products to controls, other than those inherent in customs clearance procedures, which are not carried out on domestic products (e.g. veterinary, sanitary, phytosanitary and other controls)?  Inspection authorities enforce exactly the same measures for control of both domestic and imported goods. j) Which allow only traders holding a production licence or wholesale licence to import some goods (e.g. licensing system for the production and wholesale of some goods, which allow only the licence holder to import these goods)? There are no measures in the Republic of Macedonia enabling only traders with a production or wholesale import license to import certain goods. k) Which creates monopolies of sale of some goods (e.g. tobacco products, alcohol products, etc)? There are no measures in the Republic of Macedonia creating a monopoly of the sale of certain goods. l) Which reserve certain trade names for domestic products alone and, if so, on what conditions (e.g. rules which reserve the use of a certain description to products prepared in your country from domestic raw materials)? There are no measures in the Republic of Macedonia enabling the use of registered names solely for domestic products. 
2. Do you have any information – albeit incomplete – which would make it possible to assess the number of times your authorities intervened to prohibit the marketing of products or withdraw products from the market during 2002 and 2003 for any reason whatsoever, e.g. health risk, incomplete labelling, inadequate consumer information, failure to comply with compulsory standards, etc.? Please describe the current status and the foreseen evolution with a precise timetable. 
The State Market Inspectorate, as an authority within the Ministry of Economy, carries out control of foodstuffs and agricultural products in accordance with the Law on Quality Control of Agricultural Products and Foodstuffs in the Foreign Trade (“Official Gazette of RM” 5/98). Data on the control of imported foodstuffs and agricultural products carried out:

Total inspections: 25.917 Decisions in administrative procedure  4.101 Claims for initiating a misdemeanour charge 9.266 Confiscated products 13.333.675 Products with an expired period of use withdrawn from circulation 1.263.901 Products withdrawn from circulation on other grounds 4.108.861 On-the-spot penalties 415 On-the-spot fines  909.000 Citizen complaints and reports 942 Police reports 471 The table indicates that in 2003 there have been 25,917 inspections carried out, most of which, i.e. 17,228 inspections, in trade, and the others in tourism and catering, artisanship, as well as for the quality of foodstuffs. Decisions in an administrative procedure mainly refer to satisfied minimum technical and other requirements prescribed by law, not keeping or not updated records of procurement and sales etc. The total of 9,226 claims to basic courts for initiating a misdemeanour charge relate to infringements of legal regulations in trade, catering, artisanship, as well as consumer protection in several areas.  In that period inspections also focused on fighting piracy, hence the greatest numbers of confiscated goods were pirate CDs, DVDs etc., who were destroyed at the Drisla landfill following the end of the court or other procedures. The Veterinary Directorate, in accordance with the Law on Veterinary Healthcare (“Official Gazette of RM” No 28/98) has carried out in the course of 2003 a total of 13,360 ex officio inspections of shipments of animal origin, 7,964 of which in import, 1,023 in export and 4,373 in transit. At the controls and inspections of the process of production and circulation, the following has been confiscated as hygienically unsafe products: meat – 54,091 kg in internal circulation, 2,513 kg imported, and 25,541 exported; meat products - 24,814 kg in internal circulation; dairy products – 17,655 kg in internal circulation; fish and fish products – 2,785 kg in internal circulation. The State Agricultural Inspectorate, as an authority within the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy - in addition to its general authorisations under the special regulations referred to in the Law on Agricultural Inspection, as a primary law stipulating provisions on adopting a decision for prohibition, withdrawal from circulation and removing flaw, temporary seizure with a receipt for temporarily seized items – shall also carry out inspection supervision on the grounds of other laws in the field of agriculture and fishing, as follows:   The Law on Plant Protection (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 25/98 and 6/2000)   Law on Quality and Quality Control of Fertilizers (Official Gazette of SRM 10/73 and Official Gazette of RM 83/92)   The Law on Fisheries (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 62/93)   Law on seed and plant materials and multiplication materials, type adoption, certification and protection (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 41/2000)   The Law on Tobacco  (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 69/96 and 15/98)   The Law on Breeding Livestock (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 61/97) The inspection supervision of the State Agricultural Inspectorate under this legal regulation is towards consistent enforcement of the provisions from these laws in order to protect consumers, end beneficiaries, human health and the environment in general. The work of the State Agricultural Inspectorate in the past two years related to the aforementioned laws has been the following: In 2002 state agricultural inspectors have carried out a total of 3,049 controls, written 2,643 minutes, adopted 291 decisions for removal of established flaws, and submitted 437 claims for initiating a misdemeanour charge, 35 of which criminal procedures related to the Law on Fisheries. The subjects of supervision in the controls were:   10.919 tons of various seeds, where 42,277 kg of various seeds have been removed from circulation and temporarily seized with a decision as they have not complied with the declared quality, the expiry date had exceeded, the declaration had not been in Macedonian, the packaging had not been original, no origin stated, i.e. illegally imported.   708.063 items of various types of saplings (fruit and viticulture), where 15,760 items of various types of saplings have been temporarily seized, and a large portion of them destroyed, as they were without origin, declaration and sanitary safety.   14.858 tons of fertilisers, 2,836 tons cattle feed, and 54 tons of cattle feed have been removed from circulation and use due to established flaws and as they did not fit the declared quality.   82.534 kg/l of various plant protection chemicals, where 2,935 kg/l of various plant protection chemicals have been temporarily seized due to expired date of declaration, no origin, no original packaging, declaration and instructions for use not identical with circulation approval, as well as due to circulating chemicals prohibited for use on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia.   due to violation of the legal regulation 247 kg of cut tobacco intended for sale on green markets, whose sale is prohibited, have been temporarily seized, or the total amount of temporarily seized unprocessed tobacco leaves is 1,915 kg because it has moved between regions.   3.199 items of various fishing tools and 1,873 kg of fish have been temporarily seized due to fishing with not allowed means, at night, during spawning periods, i.e. during closed season, as well as due to pollution of fishing waters with detrimental and hazardous matter jeopardizing the fish fund. During controls for the precise establishment of the quality of removed seeds, fertilizer, cattle feed and fish, agricultural inspectors have taken a total of 33 samples forwarded to laboratory examination. Results show that 20 are in order, 10 samples have flaws and the results for 3 delivered samples have still not arrived. In 2003 state agricultural inspectors have carried out, in accordance with the abovementioned laws, a total of 4,007 controls, written 3,698 minutes, and adopted 535 decisions for removal of established flaws and stopping operation, and submitted 764 claims for initiating a misdemeanour charge and 18 claims for criminal procedure in accordance with the Law on Fisheries, for operating during closed season; or a total of 782 procedure claims have been filed. The subjects of supervision in the controls were:   8.037 tons of various seeds, where 77.480 kg of various seeds have been removed from circulation and temporarily seized with a decision as they have not complied with the declared quality, the declaration had not been in Macedonian, the expiry date on the declaration had exceeded, no origin stated, illegally imported.   1.365.467 items of various types of saplings (fruit and viticulture), where 67,707 items of various types of saplings have been temporarily seized, and a large portion of them destroyed, as they did not fit the prescribed quality, did not have the appropriate documentation, were without origin and did not have the appropriate health certificate.   8.146 tons of fertilisers, where 1,039 tons have been removed from circulation and use with a decision, due to inappropriate declaration and unoriginal packaging.   2.509 tons of cattle feed, inspectors have, with a decision, removed from circulation and use 112 tons for removing flaws, as they did not fit the declared quality.   during control, due to violation of legal regulations 6 kg of cut tobacco and 1,700 kg of unprocessed tobacco in leaves have been temporarily seized, or a total of 1,706 kg of tobacco have been temporarily seized.   1,651 items of various fishing equipment and 1,363 kg of fish have been temporarily seized due to violation of legal provisions, hunting during closed season with illegal means. During controls for precise establishment of the quality of removed seeds, fertilizer and cattle feed a total of 14 samples have been taken and forwarded to laboratory examination, and the results state that 7 of them are in order, 6 were not, while results are pending for one more sample. In the course of 2003 the State Sanitary and Health Inspectorate, on the basis of the annual report on field activities and received laboratory analyses, issued information for all products not safe for humans and enforced the penal provisions of the legal regulation within the competence of the service.  The implementation of activities within the national monitoring of sanitary safety of foodstuffs in the Republic of Macedonia is carried out by authorised professional institutions: The Republic Healthcare Bureau, the ten regional healthcare institutes, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, as well as the competent inspection services: The State Sanitary and Health Inspectorate, the State Market Inspectorate and Veterinary Inspection. Operations are carried out for import, production and circulation.  In the following annexed tables: 1 to 19 give an overview of all laboratory tested products. In all the cases where positive results have been received, i.e. that the products are not safe for use with a decision of the State Sanitary and Health Inspectorate, they are returned to the country of export or are destroyed under inspection supervision by an authorized professional institution.  The procedure for products originating from the Republic of Macedonia is similar, i.e. the product is destroyed or re-appropriated with a previous expert opinion from an authorised institution.  In the course of 2003, twelve claims for initiating a misdemeanour charge have been filed to the competent court due to unsafe imported products and not acting upon the decision issued by the state sanitary and health inspectors. A total of 128 claims for initiating a misdemeanour procedure have been filed for products of domestic produce due to failure to act upon a decision from an inspector, as well as 12 reports for initiating a criminal procedure due to detriment to human health due to unsafe food. In the event of detriment to human health, criminal charges are files, as well as a ban on operations from three months up to one year.

3. What are the general rules applicable in your country to non-food products? For example, is the marketing of products with a label and instructions written in a foreign language allowed? What particulars must be mentioned on the label of any industrial product intended for sale to consumers? Please describe the current status and the foreseen evolution with a precise timetable. 
According to the Trade Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 16/2004) imported products shall be controlled at customs terminals in terms of: declaration, instructions for use in conformity with the product technical requirements, quality of goods in terms of chemical and organoleptic features, quantity, packaging, as well as transporting conditions, which are conditions for clearing the product. The trader is obliged to provide all these evidence for inspection to the competent inspection authorities.

B. Return of unlawfully removed cultural objects 

1. Do you have legislation providing for the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of an EU Member State? 
The issue of recovering the cultural heritage illegally taken from the territory of another country and currently on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia is regulated uniformly for all countries, including EU member countries. In particular, the subject matter is regulated with the Law on Protection of the Cultural Heritage (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 20/04). The law was adopted on 09.04.2004 and has been applied since 01.01.2005. It already incorporates adequately the key provisions from Directive 93/7/EEC of 15 March 1993 on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State.  In addition to this, as regards the subject matter, the valid document for Macedonia is the Convention on measures for prohibiting and preventing the unlawful import, export and transfer of ownership of cultural objects of 14 November 1970 (Official Gazette of SFRY 50/73), adopted by the Republic of Macedonia on the basis of succession (with a notification act of October 1996), with legal effect since 30 April 1997. At the same time, from the same date, regarding the subject matter, but in the event of armed conflict, the following are also relevant for the Republic of Macedonia: The Convention on the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 14 May 1954 (the 1954 Hague Convention) and its First Protocol of the same date, ratified in the former FNRY in 1955 (Official Gazette of FNRY – International Agreements and Treaties 4/56). Furthermore, an integral part of the Internal legal order of the Republic of Macedonia is considered the Second Protocol of the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 26 March 1999 (“Official Gazette of RM” 13/02).  The EU member states that have ratified the abovementioned conventions and protocols can, on that basis and according to their provisions, exercise in the Republic of Macedonia the right to recovery of cultural objects unlawfully taken from their territory. EU member states can also exercise this right with the Law on Protection of the Cultural (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 20/04), starting from 1 January 2005, which is in compliance with the respective Directive of the European Union. 
2. What are the legal provisions ensuring the return of cultural goods, before or after their unlawful removal from the territory of your country? 
The recovery of cultural goods prior to their illegal taking out of the territory of the Republic of Macedonia is exercised on the basis of the general regulations on the protection of property rights and the special regulations for the restitution of movable cultural heritage.  Namely, according to the Law on Ownership and Other Real Rights (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 18/01), the protection of the property right can be exercised, inter alia, by lodging a complaint for return of property (Article 156 paragraph 1), but in that they must prove ownership of the goods they claim, as well as that the goods are in factual possession of the defendant (Article 156 paragraph 2). In accordance with paragraph 3 of that same article, the lodging a complaint for return of property cannot become prescribed.  The return of a movable cultural goods stolen and/or illegally taken from the territory of another country and found on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia shall be exercised according to the provisions of the on Protection of the Cultural Heritage (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 20/04) (Article 100). In particular, the competent body of claiming country can file their restitution claim either diplomatically or directly to the competent court in the Republic of Macedonia, unless otherwise provided with a law or an international agreement. However, if the competent body of the claiming country has initiated a restitution procedure, i.e. a procedure for return of the goods, against the holder before the competent court in the Republic of Macedonia, they are obliged to notify immediately the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Macedonia. In that, the restitution claim (complaint) can be filed within 1 (one) year, counting from the day when the claiming country has discovered, i.e. was notified of the place where the goods in question are found and of the identity of its holder, but not longer than 30 (thirty) years from the day when the claimed goods were stolen, i.e. illegally taken from the territory of the claiming country.  As an exception, if it is a matter of movable goods part of a public collection or under special protection of the country of origin, the restitution claim can be filed within 75 years from the day when the claimed goods were stolen or illegally taken (exported). The restitution procedure, i.e. the procedure for return of the cultural goods, before the competent court in the Republic of Macedonia can be initiated if there is evidence: that the goods in question have the status of protected goods according to the regulations of the country claiming restitution and claiming that they were stolen and/or illegally exported from its territory. However, such a procedure cannot be carried out if the export is no longer illegal at the time when the return of the goods was claimed (Article 100 paragraph 8).  The person who has acquired the claimed goods after they were stolen and/or illegally exported, if he/she is a conscientious owner, is entitled to fair compensation on the basis of and in the amount established with a decision of the competent court and after the goods have been returned to the territory of the country of origin (Article 100 paragraph 9). With respect to the rights and obligations of the conscientious and unconscientious holder of the claimed goods, the general regulations apply, i.e. the provisions under Articles 157, 158 and 159 of the Law on Ownership and Other Real Rights (“Official Gazette of RM” No.18/01), precisely stipulating the relationships regarding the rights and obligations of such categories of subjects. In accordance with Article 100 paragraph 10 of the Law on Protection of the Cultural Heritage  (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 20/04), all expenses concerning the restitution claim and the procedure shall be charged upon the claiming country.  In accordance with Article 100 paragraph 3 of the Law on Protection of the Cultural Heritage (“Official Gazette of RM”.  No. 20/04) the central authority for coordinating the restitution of the claiming country can request from the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Macedonia: more accurate identification of the whereabouts of the goods in question in the Republic of Macedonia, as well as a more accurate identification of its owner, i.e. holder; that it enables the authorised persons from the claiming country to carry out, within two months from lodging the restitution claim, the necessary inspections regarding the claimed goods; to allow the claiming country to cooperate in undertaking measures for the physical protection of the claimed goods etc.  If the movable cultural goods have been stolen and/or illegally taken from the territory of the Republic of Macedonia, action shall be carried out in accordance with Article 100 paragraph 2 of the Law on Protection of the Cultural Heritage (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 20/04) and the relevant provisions of the ratified international conventions and protocols, as well as in accordance with EU documents. Namely, in accordance with Article 100 paragraph 2 of the Law on Protection of the Cultural Heritage (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 20/04), the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Macedonia shall: undertake activities for completing the information, records and documents on the cultural heritage dispersed abroad, which can be subject to restitution; file restitution claims to the competent bodies of other countries, in accordance with their regulations and international agreements; cooperate with the central authorities of other countries with a view to coordinate the restitution (recovery) of the goods. At the same time, as a member country to the Convention on measures for prohibiting and preventing the unlawful import, export and transfer of ownership of cultural goods, the Republic of Macedonia is entitled to seek from another country who is a member of that Convention to act pursuant to the provision under Article 7 item (b) sub-item II and Article 13 of the Convention. Hence, in accordance with Article 7 item (b) sub-item II of the Convention, the Republic of Macedonia can seek seizure and recovery of the goods in question if such a claim has been forwarded diplomatically, substantiated by evidence justifying the same and if the buyer in good faith or the legal owner of the claimed goods is paid fair compensation, as well as customs waiver and other levies for the cultural goods subject to recovery according to that Article of the Convention. In accordance with Article 13 of the Convention, the Republic of Macedonia is entitled to seek from another country which is a member of that Convention, to ensure the cooperation of its competent services in order to facilitate the return of the claimed goods and receive a complaint for return of the respective goods. In accordance with Article 34 paragraph 1 of the Law on Protection of the Cultural Heritage (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 20/04), in the Republic of Macedonia there will be special records on the movable goods whose country of origin is the Republic of Macedonia and are found abroad on any basis and regardless the date of export if such goods present an interest from the point of view of their restitution in the country (dispersed cultural heritage), as well as for the movable goods part of the cultural heritage of another country and found on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia (foreign cultural heritage). The competent body for maintaining the mentioned records is the Administration for Protection of the Cultural Heritage within the Ministry of Culture, which started to operate on 1 January 2005. 
3. If such legislation exists, what categories of cultural goods are covered? 
The Law on Protection of the Cultural Heritage  (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 20/04) has made official, as key generic terms for identifying the goods under protection,  the following expressions: “cultural heritage” and “protected goods”.  Furthermore, the following expressions have been designated as specific legal categories: “cultural heritage of particular importance” and “important cultural heritage”. In accordance with Article 2 of the Law, the following shall be considered cultural heritage: "...tangible and intangible goods which, as an expression or witness to human creation in the past and in the present or as joint work of man and nature, due to their archaeological, ethnological, historic, art, architectural, urban, ambient, technical, sociological and other scientific or cultural values, features, contents or functions, bear cultural and historic significance and are subject to legal regime for the purpose of their protection and use, in accordance with this and other laws." The respective law establishes 15 types of cultural heritage, with special definitions for each type, classified in three groups (immovable, movable and spiritual cultural heritage). Therein, the movable cultural heritage group defines 9 types of goods, as follows:  archaeological goods;  ethnological goods;  historic goods;  art goods;  technical goods;  archive material;  library goods;  cinematheque goods;  phonotheque goods. In addition to cultural heritage, the following are also subject of protection, i.e. are treated as protected goods pursuant to the aforementioned law:    goods under temporary protection: immovable and movable goods for which there are grounds to assume that they present cultural heritage and are protected as provided by Law (Article 30), for which a protection regime for important cultural heritage, i.e. a regime of guaranteed protection is applied;   protected archaeological zones: restricted areas containing any traces of human existence in the past eras, including places where there are no visible remnants on land or under water, whose excavation and research – in order to protect such material remnants – has been left for future generations (Article 31), for which a protection regime provided for cultural heritage of particular importance, i.e. a regime of special protection is applied. Cultural heritage of particular importance are those parts of the cultural heritage, i.e. such tangible and intangible goods that have exceptional and other special features. This category of cultural heritage includes two sub-categories: cultural heritage of exceptional importance and cultural heritage of great importance (Article 28). The part of cultural heritage that is not of particular importance presents important cultural heritage (Article 29). Taking into account the legal provisions stated, the conclusion may be drawn that in the Republic of Macedonia, as regards the subject matter, the following fall under the Law:   designated immovables, i.e. movable goods that present a constituent part of the protected immovable and that can be physically removed or taken out, regardless of the type and category the immovable goods in question fall under;   movable cultural heritage, regardless of the type and category they fall under, such as individual goods or collections (public or private);   movable goods under temporary protection, such as individual goods or collections (public or private), regardless of whether they have acquired the status of a protected goods ex lege or based on a protection act. Comparing the legal definitions for the protected goods in the Republic of Macedonia, on one hand, and the definitions of the expression cultural goods under Article 1 of the Convention on measures for prohibiting and preventing the unlawful import, export and transfer of ownership of cultural goods (Paris 1970), Article 1 of the Hague Convention of 1954 and Directive 93/7/EEC, on the other hand, the conclusion may be drawn that the Macedonian protection model has a much wider scope, i.e. covers a wider range of goods than the conventions themselves.  Therefore, for certain kinds and types of cultural goods it is required that they are older than 100 years, and for the greater part of them it is required that they are older than 50 years. On the other hand, as regards goods that are subject to return, Macedonian law does not recognise the expression "national heritage”, nor is the possibility to return certain goods limited by the price of the same, as established in the Annex to the Directive.  Consequently, the Macedonian Law allows for the return not only of cultural goods covered with the Directive in question, but it also covers a substantially wider range of protected goods. Such an approach is not excluded by the Directive itself (Article 14 paragraph 1), wherein the possibility has been provided to undertake broader commitments concerning the return of illegally exported cultural goods. 
4. Is there a system of licenses, permits etc. for export or import of cultural goods? 
The  import, export and taking abroad of cultural goods are regulated in the Republic of Macedonia with several laws. With respect to cultural heritage,  goods under temporary protection, with the exception of archive material, are also subject to the provisions of the Law on Protection of the Cultural Heritage (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 20/04).  The  archive material and documentary material are regulated with the provisions from the Law on Archives Material (Official Gazette of SRM 36/90 and Official Gazette of RM 36/95), Regulations in the field for foreign trade operations are also relevant.  
Import of cultural goods 
Concerning import of cultural goods, it must be underlined that the Law on Protection of the Cultural Heritage (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 20/04) establishes a combined protection regime. Such a regime involves:  general prohibition on import of stolen cultural heritage (Article 53): stolen from museums, religious and similar public buildings or institutions on the territory of another country.  allowed import of movable cultural heritage in the form of import pursuant to the regulations on foreign trade operations, except in the cases when, according to the regulations of the exporting country, an export license must be provided for import, with an obligation, in both cases, for the importer to declare the imported goods to  the competent protection institution within eight days from the date of import (Article 99). The  Law Amending the Criminal Code (“Official Gazette of RM” 19/04), violating the general prohibition on import of stolen cultural heritage is established as a crime, punishable according to Article 266-b of the Criminal Code with a prison sentence from one to ten years. According to the Decision for designating goods as forms of import and export (“Official Gazette of RM” 58/04), the import of art goods, collections and antiquities is under a free import regime.  
Export of cultural goods 
The regime for export of cultural goods, laid down in the Law on Protection of the Cultural Heritage (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 20/04), involves:   establishing and updating a National Inventory of protected goods whose export would substantially impoverish national cultural heritage (Article 97);   a general prohibition on exporting cultural heritage of particular importance (Article 52);   export of movable cultural heritage not covered by a general prohibition scheme, as well as of other protected movable goods, only on the basis of an approval of the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Heritage (Article 97);   issuing an approval for exporting protected goods: which are subject to international trade or which are permanently transferred to a holder of public collections abroad; which are not listed in the National Inventory relevant for export; or which are listed in that inventory, but are subject to a restitution claim or their export is of public interest pursuant to an international agreement (Article 97);   adopting a decision for a ban on the export of: protected goods not listed in the National Inventory; and which are not protected, unless a decision for temporary protection is previously adopted (Article 97);   issuing an export certificate for unprotected antiquities and art or other collection items, whose export is not covered by a free export regime within the meaning of the regulations on foreign trade operations (Article 97);   informing the public of: cultural heritage whose export is covered by a general prohibition scheme; protected goods listed in the National Inventory relevant for export; and any adopted decision on prohibiting export (Article 97);   notifying customs authorities of any issued export approval or certificate, as well as of any adopted decision on prohibiting export (Article 98);   delivering to the customs authorities: a complete file with photographic records on the movable goods whose export is allowed or prohibited; an updated list of movable cultural heritage covered by a general export prohibition scheme; and an updated list of protected goods listed in the National Inventory relevant for export (Article 98). The export of cultural heritage or goods under temporary protection without a license, i.e. approval, constitutes a crime punishable in accordance with Article 266 of the Criminal Code. A prison sentence of one to ten years is prescribed, and a fine for legal entities.  In accordance with the Decision for designating goods as forms of export and import, the export of art, collection and antiquity objects is under a "D" regime (export based on license, i.e. approval).  
Taking abroad cultural goods 
The Law on Protection of the Cultural Heritage (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 20/04) also regulates the issue of exit of protected goods abroad (Article 96). In that sense, the respective provisions prescribe:   issuing an approval for taking abroad movable cultural heritage and other protected movable goods abroad for the purpose of exhibition, conservation, expertise and other justified cases;   ensuring a bank deposit in the amount of the value of the protected goods, commercial insurance, guarantee or another kind of obligation of a foreign government, if so required by the authority issuing the approval for taking the goods abroad;   appointing a deadline for return of the protected goods in the country;   stipulating specific terms for handling, packing, transport, escort, accommodation, keeping and presenting the protected goods, depending on specific circumstances;   notification of the authority issuing the approval for taking the goods abroad that the goods in question have been returned in the country within the designated deadline;   treatment of taking abroad as illegal export in the event that the goods in question are not returned in the country within the designated deadline;   notifying customs authorities of any issued approval for taking the goods abroad and enclosing a complete file on the goods in question. In accordance with the Law on Archives Material, the approval for taking abroad archive material is provided by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia upon the proposal of the State Archive of the Republic of Macedonia. The taking abroad of cultural heritage or goods under temporary protection without a license, i.e. approval, constitutes a crime punishable in accordance with Article 266 of the Criminal Code. The penalties are the same as for illegal export itself.  The control of import, export and taking abroad of cultural goods is within the competence of the Customs Administration of the Republic of Macedonia, while approvals for export and taking abroad of cultural goods are issued by the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Heritage within the Ministry of Culture. 
5. Which is the central authority, if any, responsible for dealing with the export of cultural goods and ensuring the return of cultural goods? 
The competent body for deciding upon requests for export of cultural goods, where export is not covered by a general prohibition scheme, is the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Heritage, an authority within the Ministry of Culture with the capacity of a legal entity.  The Institute also decides on requests for taking abroad of protected goods, with the exception of archive material (see answer to question 01_IV_B_4). Namely, in accordance with the Law on Archives Material, taking abroad of archive material is decided upon by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (Article 18).  The competent authority for control of export, import and transit of goods for which measures for protecting cultural goods have been prescribed pursuant to Article 10 paragraph 1 item 9 of the Customs Law (“Official Gazette of RM” 46/04) is the Customs Administration of the Republic of Macedonia (see answer to question 25_II_16).  The central authority for coordinating the return of cultural goods is the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Macedonia. Its competencies in this respect relate both to foreign cultural heritage and to dispersed national cultural heritage (Article 100 paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Law on Protection of the Cultural Heritage (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 20/04) (- see answer to questions 01_IV_B_1 and 01_IV_B_ 2
6. Do you have any plans to modify the existing legislation? Please give details and timetables. 
The Law on Protection of the Cultural Heritage (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 20/04) is new and its application has started on 1.01.2005, as a primary law in this field. Depending on the needs regarding its implementation, changes to it are possible in terms of further precision and upgrading of the import, export and taking abroad regime for cultural goods regarding the European Union, as well as further precision and designation concerning the obligations and procedures arising from other international agreements ratified by the Republic of Macedonia. In addition to this, it is projected to adopt in the 2005-2007 period laws to ratify:   the European Convention on Offences Relating to Cultural Property (Delphi, 1985);   the Revised European Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage (Malta, 1992);   the Convention on the Return of Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects (Rome, 1995). 
C. Control of the acquisition and possession of weapons 

1. Do you have legislation providing for the control of the acquisition and possession of weapons? 
The Law on Weapons adopted on 25 January 2005 ceased to apply the Law on Acquisition, Possession and Carrying Weapons. This Law stipulates the conditions and procedure of issuing consent for purchase of weapons, ammunition and weapon parts with regard to natural and legal persons and weapon authorization or weapon possession authorization within eight days as from the day of the purchase by the local unit of the Ministry of Interior, competent on the basis of natural person’s residence or the seat of the legal entity. This Law, inter alia, stipulates the conditions and procedure regarding withdrawal and annulment of weapon authorization; as well as the procedure with regard to sales of weapons and ammunitions and weapon repair and supervision over keeping, storing, and use and sale of weapons and ammunition with relevance to legal entities.  The text of the Law defines the terms of weapons and implements the provisions with regard to classification of firearms contained in international instruments (short firearms, long firearms, automatic firearms, semi-automatic firearms, repeating firearms, and single-shot firearms). Pursuant to the Directive 91/477/EEC weapons have been classified in: prohibited to purchase (Category A), weapons which may be purchased on the basis of authorization (Category B), weapons which may be purchased for the needs of hunting and sports, subject to authorization issued under mitigating circumstances (Category C), and weapons to be declared and for which authorization is issued (Category D).  With regard to the ammunition quantity, a distinction is considered between the ammunition quantity intended for weapons smooth-bore barrels and non-smooth-bore barrels.   The text of the Law also stipulates the obligations of the owner or user of the weapon with regard to its handling as well as the prohibition on its carrying in public places.  The cases when weapon authorization or weapon possession authorization shall be withdrawn and annulled are explicitly determined as well as the provisions with regard to handling weapons and ammunition in criminal and misdemeanour procedure.  The issue regarding production, repair and circulation of weapons, ammunition and parts of weapon are systemized in relevant Chapters.  With regard to the transport of weapons and ammunition the Law contains conditions concerning trade companies involved in transport of passengers and goods that may undertake transport of weapons as well as a provision providing that the regulations concerning explosive materials accordingly apply to the transport of ammunitions.    The Law also defines the conditions with regard to establishing and operation of civilian rifle range. 
2. Is there a legislation laying down the categories of firearms the acquisition and possession of which by private persons is either prohibited or subject to authorisation or declaration? 
The Law on Weapons clearly defines which type of weapon may be purchased by a natural person. Category B – firearms which may be purchased on the basis of authorization:  1.  Semi-automatic firearms or repeating short firearms; 2.  Single-shot short firearms with centre-fire percussion;  3.  Single-shot short firearms whose overall length is less than 28 cm; 4.  Semi-automatic long firearms whose magazine and chamber can together hold more than three rounds; 5.  Semi-automatic long firearms whose magazine and chamber cannot together hold more than three rounds, where the loading device is removable; 6.  Repeating and semi-automatic long firearms with smooth-bore barrels not exceeding 60 cm in length;   7. Semi-automatic firearms for civilian use which resemble weapons with automatic mechanisms;  8.  Single-shot long firearms with smooth-bore barrels; 9.  Single-shot long firearms with one or more non-smooth-bore barrels; 10. Pneumatic firearms with projectiles energy of 7.5 J and calibre of 4.5 mm; 11. Firearms for industrial purpose. Category C – firearms that may be purchased on the basis of declaration issued under mitigating conditions:  1.   Repeating long firearms other than those listed in category B, point 6; 2.   Semi-automatic long firearms other than those in category B, points 4, 5, 6, and 7;  3.    Single-shot short firearms with rimfire percussion whose overall length is not less than 28 cm; 4.    Pneumatic firearms with projectiles energy of 7.5 J and calibre of 4.5 mm; and   5.    Gas firearms for light-sound signalization.  Category D – firearms that has to be declared and are subject to authorization:  1.   Cultural and historical firearms;  2.   String firearms; and  3.   Cold arms.   This Law also details the prohibited firearms, as follows:  Category A – Prohibited firearms:  1.  Firearms used as military weapons;  2.  Automatic firearms;  3.  Firearms disguised as other objects;  4.  Firearms with integrated silencer;  5.  Firearms with projectiles over 12.7 mm;   6.  Explosive firearms and its parts;   7.  Gas firearms;  8.  Special equipment for firearms;  9.  Electric devices;  10. Ammunition with penetrating, explosive or incendiary projectiles, and the projectiles for such ammunition; 11. Pistol and revolver ammunition with expanding projectiles and the projectiles for such ammunition, except in the case of weapons for hunting or for target shooting; and  12. Marking ammunition.  Hunting and sport firearms with optical or sniper target shall not be considered prohibited firearms.  
3. If the legislation is in force: a) Which categories of firearms are covered? b) Which are the conditions necessary to be fulfilled in order to obtain the authorisation? c) What kind of information must be given in the declaration? 

)  The Law on Weapons lists categories and types of weapons that may be purchased, possessed and carried by enterprises and other legal entities, state bodies and citizens, as follows: Category A, Category B, Category C, and Category D. (Detailed in the answer to the previous question in this Chapter) 
b)  The Law on Weapons lists the general conditions to be fulfilled in case of authorization regarding weapon purchase. Namely, pursuant to this Law:  License regarding weapon purchase to a natural person may be issued on the basis of previously submitted personal written request on issuance of authorization regarding weapon purchase, if the natural person fulfils the following conditions:  1.  He/she is over 18 years of age;  2.  If he/she has not been withdrawn or limited the business capability:  3.  He/she is in a good health capability to possess and carry weapon;  4.  He/she is not likely to be a danger to public order;  5.  He/she has a justified reason to purchase a weapon;  6.  He/she is in possession of technical knowledge concerning standard weapon use, keeping, and handling and knowledge of the weapon rules; and  7.  If he/she has a domicile on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia, and in case of a foreigner to be in possession of residence permit on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia, unless determined otherwise with a ratified international agreement.  Weapon purchase authorization of Category C shall be issued to a natural person, who apart from the conditions referred to in points 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7, needs to be an active member of a hunters’ or shooting organization and to have certificate on passed hunting exam, or certificate that he/she is an active member of a shooting organization.  c)  The request for issuance of weapon purchase authorization shall include the following information: 1. The type of weapon requested for purchase; 2. The purpose for issuance of the weapon purchase authorization; 3. Personal data of the applicant (first name, second name, date and place of birth); residence address, occupation data and company data he/she is employed in, and his/her ID card register number. The applicant, in his/her request for weapon purchase authorization, also provides information whether he/she already possesses a weapon, and the type and number of the weapon authorization.  
4. Are there any special rules for collectors and bodies concerned with the cultural and historical aspects of weapons? If so must these collectors and bodies be recognised by the local authorities? 
The Law on Weapon anticipates special provisions regarding collectors, which regulate the rules and procedures of the weapon collectors. Cultural and historical weapons may be purchased and possessed without a license.   Collectors and other persons who purchase and are in possession of cultural and historical weapons are obliged to declare the weapon in the Republic Bureau for Protection of Cultural Monuments due to the evidence, for which a confirmation is issued.   The Republic Bureau for Protection of Cultural Monuments is obliged to deliver the date regarding the natural person who declares the cultural and historical weapon to the competent body within eight days from the day of the submission.    Carrying cultural and historical weapons and producing, purchasing or possessing ammunition for this type of weapon is not allowed.                Notwithstanding paragraph (1) referred to in this Article, museums may purchase, possess and display, inter alia, cultural and historical weapon to Category A provided for in this Law.    
5. Does the legislation, if any, exclude from its scope weapons and ammunition used for hunting or target shooting? If so, what rules are applied? 
The existing legislation covers hunting weapons, and inter alia, regulates the purchasing procedure, registration, and authorization issuance for possession and carrying hunting weapons, in which scope the submitter is mandatory obliged to submit evidence on being a member of a hunters’ organization.  Having regard to the application of target shooting weapons, the Law anticipates special provisions which regulate this matter. Namely, civilian rifle ranges are facilities intended for sports and recreation exercise in shooting as well as training on proper and safe use of weapons, which fulfill the technical and safety conditions for use of firearms, hunting and sport weapons. Civilian rifle ranges may be established by natural and legal persons that apart from the conditions with regard to the entry in the trade registry shall obtain authorization from the Minister of interior. Only natural persons, who, pursuant to this Law or other laws are authorized to carry such weapons or have a special request for weapon purchase, may exercise shooting in rifle ranges.  
If so, what rules are applied?   
This matter is also stipulated in the Law on Hunting (“Official Gazette of RM” No 20/96) whose application is in competence of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy.   
6. Do you have any plans to modify the existing legislation? Please give details and timetables. 
The negative trend in the growth of crime in the Republic of Macedonia, including illegal possession of weapons and the increase in the number of committed crimes with elements of violence performed by using firearms that the perpetrators illegally possess, determines the readiness and political will to mobilise all control mechanisms and increase their efficiency in preventing and fighting crime. In the legislation of the Republic of Macedonia, the acquisition, possession and carrying of weapons was regulated with the Law on Acquisition, Possession and Carrying Weapons (Official Gazette of SRM 25/72, 30/72, 18/76, 25/76, 15/83, 51/88, and Official Gazette of RM 26/93 and 49/03). The provisions of the existing law were not sufficiently accurate and they did not correspond to the contents of international instruments and legislation in EU member states and their implementation in practise caused difficulties in the work of the competent state authorities. For those reasons the need was imposed to upgrade and improve national legislation by adopting a Law on Weapons, in which international standards are implemented, as well as the comparative experiences from the West European countries. The Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia on its session held on 25.01.2005 adopted the new Law on Weapons.  Content-wise, the Law on Weapons is divided into 14 thematic units (chapters): general provisions; acquisition and possession of weapons and ammunition; handling weapons and ammunition; annulment and revocation of the weapon license, the license for possession and the license for carrying; manufacture and repair of weapons and ammunition; trading of weapons, ammunition and weapon parts; transport of weapons and ammunition; civil shooting grounds; transporting weapons and ammunition across the state border; EU citizens; records; supervision; penal provisions and transitory and final provisions. The new Law on Weapons establishes the subject and scope of its application, excluding application of its provisions to armament and military equipment, as well as weapons and ammunition procured and used for the needs of the Ministry of Defence, the Army of the Republic of Macedonia, the Ministry of Interior, penitentiary and correctional facilities and other state authorities and legal entities as provided with special regulations. The expression “weapon” has been defined and the provisions for the classification of firearms contained in international instruments (short, long, automatic, semi-automatic, bolt action firearms and single shot firearms) have been implemented. In order to ensure a high degree of efficiency in the implementation of the law, the meaning of certain expression used in this legal text has been established.    In accordance with Directive 91/477/EEC classification has been carried out of weapons prohibited for acquisition (category A), weapons that can be acquired on the basis of an approval (category B), weapons that can be acquired for hunting or sports, on the basis of an approval issued under alleviating circumstances (category C) and weapons that need to be reported and for which a certificate is issued (category D). Category B and C weapons, weapon parts and ammunition for rifled bore barrels, as well as equipment for hunting and sports weapons may be acquired on the basis of an approval, while ammunition for smooth bore barrels is acquired on the basis of a permit issued for that weapon. The approval is issued by the Ministry of Interior, according to the residence of the person, i.e. the residence of the foreigner in the Republic of Macedonia, i.e. according to the head office of the legal entity, person who has applied, and is valid for six months from the day of issuing the approval. Up to 100 bullets of ammunition for smooth-bore barrels may be possessed, while for non-smooth and pneumatic bore barrels there is not a limitation. Legal entities registered for securing persons and property or who carry out securing persons and property for their own needs, may possess ammunition for weapons up to 50 bullets for each weapon stated in the license for possession. One of the essential issues in the legal regulation of control of acquisition of weapons are the requirements that a natural person must meet for issuing a weapons acquisition approval. In accordance with these provisions, a weapons acquisition approval is issued to a natural person on the basis of such personally submitted application if the natural person: is 18 years of age; their contractual capacity has not been revoked or restricted; they physically capable to possess and carry a weapon; they do not present a threat to public order; there is justified reason for acquiring a weapon; they have the technical knowledge for proper use, storage and maintenance of the weapon, are familiar with weapon regulations, have a residence on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia and, if they are foreigners and they have regulated residence on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia, unless otherwise provided with an international agreement. An acquisition approval for a category C weapon is issued to a natural person who, in addition to certain requirements provided by the Law, must be an active member of a hunting or sports association and have passed a hunting examination, i.e. has confirmation that they are an active member of a target-shooting association. The Law on weapons establishes the conditions under which a weapon acquisition approval is issued to a legal entity on the basis of a previously submitted application. The following conditions have been stipulated: the legal entity must have justified reasons for acquiring weapons for securing persons and property, as well as premises for safe keeping of the weapons, while legal entities acquiring weapons for the protection of persons and property or carry out security of persons and property, must employ full-time persons who satisfy the conditions related to natural persons, provided in this law. The natural person or legal entity to whom a weapon acquisition approval has been issued is obliged within eight days from the acquisition of the weapon to submit an application to the competent authority for registration of the weapon and issuing a weapon license (for a natural person), i.e. a license for possession (for a legal entity). The weapons license and the license for possession are issued for a term of validity of five years, and for persons older than 65 for a term of validity of three years, with a possibility for extension.  Starting from the generally dangerous nature of weapons, the obligations for the owner or the user of the weapon have been established with respect to handling the same, as well as the prohibition for carrying the weapon in public places, where the places where the use of a weapon may jeopardize people’s safety, and pursuant to this law are considered public places, have been defined. The places that are not considered a public place within the meaning of this law have also been designated. The prohibition for carrying and using hunting and sports weapons outside of hunting or shooting grounds has also been laid down. The new Law stipulates the way of storing weapons and ammunition, actions in the event of missing, losing or theft of the weapon and ammunition, compulsory reporting of found weapons, an obligation to report change of residence, i.e. head office of the holder of the weapon license, i.e. license for possession. The cases when the weapon license, i.e. license for possession is revoked and annulled are explicitly established, and provisions are contained on the manner of handling weapons and ammunition seized in a criminal or misdemeanour procedure. The issues of manufacture repair and trading in weapons, ammunition and weapon parts are systematised in special chapters of the Law. The new Law on weapons stipulates that the manufacture of weapons and ammunition and the repair of weapons, i.e. trading in weapons, ammunition and weapon parts may be carried out by trade companies with a head office on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia, who obtain approval for carrying out such activity prior to registration in the Trade Registry. The approval for manufacture of weapons and ammunition and repair of ammunition is issued by the Ministry of Interior following the opinion of the Ministry of Defence and the previous consent of the Ministry of Economy. The approval for trading in weapons, ammunition and weapon parts is issued by the competent authority (the Ministry of Interior) following previous consent of the Ministry of Economy. The law also stipulates requirements that the applicant, the founders and the responsible person in the company must satisfy. As regards weapons and ammunition transport, there are requirements according to which trade companies that carry out activities for transport of persons and goods may also carry out transport of weapons, as well as a provision that the regulations for transport of explosive materials shall respectively apply to transport of ammunition. The new Law on weapons introduces civil shooting grounds as facilities intended for sports and recreation in target-shooting, as well as for training for correct and safe use of weapons and the conditions under which the same may be established. Starting from the complexity of the weapons related matter, special provisions regulate the manner and conditions under which weapons are transported across the state border of the Republic of Macedonia. The new Law on weapons has provisions for acquisition, possession and carrying of weapons by the citizens of the EU countries that possess European document on weapons. These provisions will apply after the Republic of Macedonia becomes a member of the European Union. In order to eliminate the possibilities for abuse of authorisations on the part of the persons to whom certain approvals have been issued, the Law establishes an obligation for the Ministry of Interior to maintain records of all issued approvals. Furthermore, it has been established succinctly that the supervision of the provisions of this law shall be carried out by the aforementioned state authority. In order to efficiently enforce the law, violation, i.e. failure to act pursuant to the provisions of this law is sanctioned, and appropriate sanctions have been established for the perpetrators of established violations. The transitory and final provisions provide an obligation for companies carrying out manufacture of weapons and ammunition, repair of weapons and trading in weapons, ammunition and weapon parts for which no approval was required until its entry into force, to submit, within thirty days from the date of entry into force of the law, an application for issuing the provided approval. Licenses for possession and carrying of weapons and licenses for possession issued according to previous regulations must be replaced within one year from the date of entry into force of the secondary legislation regulation on the form of the weapon license, license for possession and license for carrying, and the same shall be replaced if the natural persons, i.e. legal entities satisfy the Law requirements.         
D. Checks for conformity with the rules on product safety in the case of products imported from third countries 

1. Do you have legislation providing for conformity with the rules on product safety in the case of imported products? If so: a) Since when has it been in force? b) Please describe its broad outlines (which service is responsible for border controls and co-ordination regarding imported products, what is the procedure provided for, etc.?) 
There is no legislation in the Republic of Macedonia fully in compliance with the rules on product safety.  Namely, the Directive 92/59/EEC on general product safety, revised by 95/01/EC is transposed in part in the Consumer Protection Law (“Official Gazette of RM” 38/04). This law incorporates entirely the definitions of "safe product" and “hazardous product", as well as the commitments to provide information and releasing into circulation safe products under these Directives, where domestic and imported products are subject to equal treatment. The Directive on general product safety must be completely transposed into a new Law on General Product Safety, planned for adoption by the end of 2005. Furthermore, the Minister of Health must prescribe the Law on Safety of Foodstuffs and Products and Materials in Contact with Foodstuffs (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 54/04).   general requirements on foodstuff safety, as well as special requirements for the safety of separate types of foodstuffs in accordance with the general requirements for foodstuff safety, and   general requirements for the safety of products and materials used for packaging or coming into contact with foodstuffs. The preparation of secondary legislation is underway. The Minister of agriculture, forestry and water management must prescribe, in accordance with the general safety requirements from the Law on Safety of Foodstuffs and Products and Materials in Contact with Foodstuffs (“Official Gazette of RM” 54/02), the general requirements for foodstuffs of animal-origin. 

)  
The Consumer Protection Law is in force since 25 June 2004. The Law on Safety of Foodstuffs and Products and Materials in Contact with Foodstuffs (“Official Gazette of RM” 54/02 is in force since 23 July 2002. 
b)  The competent services for border control of imported products are the following:  1.  The State Market Inspectorate, based on the Trade Law (“Official Gazette of RM” 16/04) and the Law on Quality Control of Agricultural Products and Foodstuffs in Foreign Trade (“Official Gazette of RM” 5/98 and 13/99). Prior to commencing the customs procedure the State Market Inspectorate carries out inspection supervision of goods with respect to the declaration and the instructions for use, and it completes a document (minutes) on the basis of which the competent customs authority clears the goods. 2.  The State Sanitary and Health Inspectorate is competent for border control of foodstuffs, toys, beauty products, tobacco and tobacco products and general consumption goods.  All importers are obliged to submit an application for health inspection at import to the State Sanitary and Health Inspectorate. Health supervision encompasses: establishing the hygiene conditions in which the shipment has arrived, the hygiene of the vehicles, the micro-climate conditions, time of transport from loading to arrival at the border terminal, organoleptic examination and taking samples for laboratory examination. Following organoleptic examination and taking samples, the State Sanitary and Health Inspectorate issues consent for customs clearance. 1.  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy, through the Plants Protection Directorate and the State Agricultural Inspectorate, carries out control of shipments at import of plants and plant protection chemicals. The procedures applied are standard according to IPPC and EPPO. The examination system at border terminals is comparable to the acquis and the same consists of inspection of paperwork, identification, sanitary examination of plants (organoleptic examination, taking samples for laboratory analysis, taking measures for plant protection) and document registration. 2.  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy, through the Veterinary Directorate, carries out veterinary and sanitary check-up and control at the border terminal. Veterinary and sanitary inspection and control of shipments importer, exported and in transit is carried out by a veterinary inspector. Shipments of animals, products, raw material of animal origin and offal, shipments containing ingredients of animal origin, artificial insemination seeds, fertilised ovule and embryos, and cattle feed, stable manure, animal urine, compost and other items that may transmit a contagious disease shall be subject to control in circulation. The procedure consists of filing in an application, inspection of documentation, identification, taking samples for laboratory examination, taking quarantine measures, if necessary, and document registration following the completed inspection. 3.  The Customs Administration plays a part in applying regulations in the procedure for importing goods on the basis of the competence established with Article 10 of the  Customs Administration Law  (“Official Gazette of RM” 46/04). The customs authorities carry out the customs clearance procedure if they are assured that the necessary controls have been carried out by the aforementioned competent services, i.e. if the necessary permits, consents, approvals or attestations from other competent services are attached to the customs declarations. There is no service in the Republic of Macedonia in charge of border control and coordination of imported products.

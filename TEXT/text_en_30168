SKOPJE, Macedonia -- As expected, parliament voted on Thursday (April 14th) for its dissolution. The motion was backed by 79 of the 120 lawmakers, as the main opposition party SDSM boycotted the session. Parliament Speaker Trajko Veljanoski signed a decision Friday calling for snap elections on June 5th. The last parliamentary elections were in June 2008.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliament began debating the draft law on transferring powers to Vojvodina on Tuesday (November 24th). Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic defended the bill, saying it is constitutional and consistently implements decentralisation and the concept of provincial autonomy without elements of statehood. He explained the law would give Vojvodina jurisdiction in 20 areas, including regional development, agriculture, tourism, industry, transportation, health care, the economy, privatisation, mining and energy. But the opposition parties severely criticise the legislation, insisting it will federalise Serbia. On Wednesday, lawmakers will discuss the draft statute of the province.

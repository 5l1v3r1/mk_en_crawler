BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The massacre of more than 7,000 Bosniaks is the darkest episode of all the wars in the former Yugoslavia from a moral, human and political viewpoint, noted EU security chief Javier Solana, in an editorial published by local media Monday (11 July). According to Solana, the crime is even bigger since the UN failed to protect the innocent from being executed. Looking ahead to the future, Solana pledged that the EU is ready to help to build a stable and functioning state in BiH. However, that commitment must be met with a readiness to implement reforms, he said.
In a separate interview published Sunday, British Ambassador to BiH Mathew Raycroft is quoted as saying negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement could begin, if an agreement on police reforms is reached by mid-September. Republika Srpska recently indicated a willingness to resume talks on police restructuring. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 11/07/05; NTV Hayat, RTRS, Nezavisne Novine - 10/07/05)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary General George Robertson and Albanian Ambassador to NATO Ilir Bocka signed the third implementation agreement on a project for arms destruction on Thursday (31 July). It aims to destroy 11.6 million tonnes of small arms and light weapons ammunition in Albania, and will be financed by the United States and Canada.
In other news, the EU has donated 2m euros to Albania in support of mining clearing efforts. The money would go for an UN-led project in the northeast part of the country to clear devices strewn during the war in neighbouring Kosovo. (NATO press release, Kathimerini - 31/07/03)

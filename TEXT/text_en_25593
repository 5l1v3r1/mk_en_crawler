BUCHAREST, Romania -- The National Liberal Party (PNL) introduced a bill Thursday (October 22nd) designed to downsize parliament to a total of 316 representatives -- 99 senators and 217 deputies. That is compared to the current 471 representatives, including 137 senators and 334 deputies. Unlike President Traian Basescu, who wants to turn the bicameral legislature into a unicameral one, the PNL wants to maintain the bicameral model, but have each member represent more people. Each senator would represent 221,000 citizens instead of 160,000, while each deputy would represent 110,000 people, rather than the current 70,000 currently. The downsizing is aimed at streamlining the legislative process and saving money. (Curierul National, Evenimentul Zilei, Gandul - 23/10/09; Deutsche Welle, DPA, AP, Mediafax - 22/10/09)

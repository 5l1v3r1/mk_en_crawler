PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The International Civilian Office (ICO) is telling the Serb community in Kosovo that the decentralisation process is its chance of the year. "The offer is on the table. It is up to the Kosovo Serbs alone to judge and take this offer," ICO spokesperson Kai Mueller-Berner said on Tuesday (April 14th). The decentralisation plan envisions the creation of five plus one municipalities with Serb majorities. But Kosovo Serb leaders have said their community will not support this process because the Kosovo government and the ICO are leading it. They have demanded neutrality under the guidance of the European Council.
In other news Tuesday, EULEX asked the government to accelerate the adoption of legislation that would strengthen witness protection mechanisms. The request, from EULEX spokesperson Karin Limdal, came as EULEX beefs up its review of war crimes files. The witness protection mechanism is considered a key element of judicial reforms related to war crimes and organised crime.

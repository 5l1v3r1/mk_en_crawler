ZAGREB, Croatia â Although preparations for EU membership are on the right track, Croatia has not yet faced the most complex issues in its accession bid, Vincent Degert, the European Commission's envoy in Zagreb, told Reuters on Thursday (July 19th). Croatia already has opened 12 chapters of the acquis. However, Degert noted, more difficult topics such as shipbuilding still lie ahead and might take a longer time to complete. The most immediate challenges are reforming public administration and the judiciary, the envoy said. (Reuters, HRT, HINA - 19/07/07)

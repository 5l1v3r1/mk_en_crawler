NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The prime minister of the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), Ferdi Soyer, has filed a request with the country's chief prosecutor, demanding an investigation into an alleged link between Turkish Cypriot politicians and Turkey's controversial Ergenekon case, media reported on Thursday (April 9th). Soyer insisted prosecutors should look into whether right-wing opposition National Unity Party (UBP) leader Dervis Eroglu and former Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash were involved with the shadowy secularist group that allegedly plotted to topple the government in Turkey. Denktash says he does not take the allegation seriously and suggested his political foes were trying to score points before the April 19th parliamentary elections in the TRNC. Eroglu dismissed Soyer's move as "an ugly political game" and insisted the UBP has not participated in any illegal activity. The latest polls put the UBP in the lead, ahead of the ruling Republican Turkish Party. (Anadolu news agency, Hurriyet, Zaman, Famagusta Gazette, Cyprus Mail - 09/04/09)

NEW YORK, United States -- In his first report to the UN Security Council, High Representative Valentin Inzko said Thursday (May 28th) that he will seek a change in the political paradigm in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Noting divisive rhetoric persists, he blamed Republika Srpska's leaders for attacking and undermining the legitimacy of state institutions. "This campaign has blocked the passage of state legislation required to complete the EU's 'road map' for the elimination of visas for BiH citizens travelling to EU states, and it has blocked other state legislation that will fulfil BiH's obligations under the Stabilisation and Association process," Inzko said. He stressed that he will not tolerate any challenges to the sovereignty of the state and the competencies of its institutions. In his speech to the Security Council, BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric said the main challenge facing BiH this year will be constitutional reform, based on compromise.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Police arrested a woman Sunday (April 12th) suspected of involvement in the kidnapping of former BiH presidency member Ante Jelavic. Media in Sarajevo said she was arrested in Prozor-Rama and that police are looking for two more people in the same area. Jelavic says kidnappers seized him in Zagreb on Wednesday but that he managed to escape on Thursday. He insists the BiH mafia was behind his abduction. BiH has issued an international arrest warrant for Jelavic, who had received a ten-year prison sentence for abuse of office. Before his incarceration could begin, however, he managed to escape to Croatia, where he currently lives. Dual Croatian-BiH citizenship protects him from extradition to BiH.

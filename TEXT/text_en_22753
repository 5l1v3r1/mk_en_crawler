ANKARA, Turkey/NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkey has rejected a set of proposals by the EU to unblock planned co-operation with NATO, media reported on Friday (November 7th). The EU tried to find a solution to a long-lasting row with Turkey over Cyprus's participation in NATO-led operations, but Ankara did not accept any of Brussels' proposals, said Gerard Araud, political director of the French Foreign Ministry, whose country currently holds the EU rotating presidency. Turkey objects to the participation of Cyprus in NATO operations, as this would mean recognising the Republic of Cyprus. 
In other news, Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat expressed hope the election of Barack Obama to the US presidency would have a positive impact on the Cyprus issue. "I believe the US, which we hope will follow a policy to solve world problems through peaceful means, will also contribute to settling the Cyprus issue," he said on Thursday. 
Meanwhile, Turkish police arrested a man in Izmir on Saturday, alleging he was preparing a bombing. Police have detained another two people for allegedly aiding the suspected member of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Police also seized 10kg of explosives near the southeastern town of Mardin. They suspect PKK militants of hiding the explosives.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The head of the European Parliament's (EP) Committee for Southeast Europe, Doris Pack, said on Sunday (July 6th) that if BiH wants to enter the EU, it should have efficient institutions. "The problem is that neither entity, especially the Federation of BiH (FBiH), functions," Pack said in an interview with Dnevni Avaz. Pack said that the functioning of FBiH could change and expressed readiness to facilitate the process. She suggested that the number of cantons in the federation could decrease and that the 150 ministers in the Federation "eat up" huge amounts of the budget that could otherwise fund education and infrastructure.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgarian police and the US Secret Service have shut down seven major money-forging operations, Interior Ministry Chief Secretary Boyko Borisov said Tuesday (22 October). Raids in Plovdiv last month located four printing presses that turned out false banknotes, alcohol tax stamps and travellers' cheques. Nearly one million forged dollars were found in a raid in Varna in March. Borisov acknowledged that millions of dollars had been printed in Bulgaria during the past six years, but says the situation has been brought under control through close co-operation between local law enforcement agencies and the Secret Service. Large quantities of Bulgarian-made forged dollars have been seized in the United States since 1996. Bulgaria has been described as one of the world's leading producers of forged dollars.

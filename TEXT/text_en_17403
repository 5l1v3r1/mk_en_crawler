SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The High Judicial Council on Wednesday (June 27th) accepted the resignation of Angel Alexandrov, chief of the National Investigation Service. He offered to step down amid a major corruption scandal implicating senior government and investigative officials and two state companies, Bulgartabac tobacco holding and the Sofia district heating distributor, Toplofikatsia. Alexandrov and former Economy Minister Rumen Ovcharov have accused each other of blackmail and abuse of office. (Dnevnik, Sega - 28/06/07; BNR, Darik - 27/06/07)

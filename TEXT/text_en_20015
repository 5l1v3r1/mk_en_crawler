ATHENS, Greece -- Defence Minister Evangelos Meimarakis announced two days of mourning in the armed forces Tuesday (March 18th) after three officers died in a helicopter crash earlier in the day. Preliminary information suggests a mechanical problem may have occurred during the training flight near Thessaloniki.
Meanwhile, the public on Wednesday struggled through another day of nationwide strikes, involving journalists, engineers, doctors, bankers, teachers, as well as the state railway and civil aviation staff. The protest, organised by the two biggest trade unions in the country, the GSEE and ADEDY, is against proposed reforms to the pension system. (ANA-MPA, Sky, Makfax, ERT - 18/03/08)

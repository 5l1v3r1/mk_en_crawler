SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Attorney Dragomir Dumic was appointed by BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic to the newly established post of defence minister of BiH on Monday (1 March). The move came as part of efforts to bring the armed forces of the country's two entities under a single command. Dumic, an ethnic Serb, told a local TV station that his main goal would be to make sure that BiH meets the criteria for joining NATO's Partnership for Peace programme. His appointment must now be confirmed by the central parliament in Sarajevo. Terzic also appointed Marina Pendes and Enes Becierbasic -- a Croat and Bosniak, respectively -- as deputy defence ministers.
In other news, the main board of the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) announced Monday that it has turned down the collective resignation of the SDS presidency, which was submitted in February following High Representative Paddy Ashdown's removal of Mirko Sarovic from the post of SDS deputy leader. Party spokesman Dusan Stojinic said the issue should be discussed after the local elections, due to take place this autumn. (OHR Sources - 02/03/04; PBS BiH, NTV Hayat, Srna, BBC, AFP - 01/03/04)

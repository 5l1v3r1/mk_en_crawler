ATHENS, Greece -- Public servants in Greece staged a 24-hour general strike Thursday (10 November), demanding higher wages. Domestic and international flights were cancelled, schools were closed and only emergency cases were accepted in hospitals. Public schools are closed Friday as well, due to a 48-hour strike by teachers. 
In other news, parliament's social affairs commission has invited senior officials and journalists to a luncheon next week featuring poultry products. The move is meant to reassure the public in the wake of an October avian flu scare, which proved false. Sales of poultry remain low, however. (Kathimerini, MPA, ANA, AFP - 10/11/05)

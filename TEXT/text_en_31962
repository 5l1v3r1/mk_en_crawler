SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The foreign ministry formed a crisis group Wednesday night (23 October) immediately after Chechen separatists took some 700 hostages in the Moscow Palace of Culture. The ministry advised Bulgaria's diplomatic representatives in Moscow to launch active measures for the release of Bulgarian hostage Veselin Nedkov. The rebels reportedly have peppered the theatre with explosives and are demanding an immediate cease-fire in Chechnya and the withdrawal of Russian troops. (Novinite, Interfax - 24/10/02)

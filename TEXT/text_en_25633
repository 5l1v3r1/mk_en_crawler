BUCHAREST, Romania -- Police in Bucharest announced on Thursday (August 20th) that they have busted a paedophile network in a regional child protection directorate. Misu Nicolae, 41, a former officer at the 3rd sector of the directorate in Bucharest, was arrested for allegedly recruiting children in government-run institutions and "marketing" them. He is also accused of having sexual relations with the children. Two other people are suspected in the case. Police began investigations after a series of social workers in the directorate reported children missing from the institutions. Investigators found that between December 2008 and June 2009, the paedophile network trafficked five minors, aged 14 and 15, who were offered money, mobile phones and other items.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas met on Sunday (11 January), declaring afterwards that they were "in perfect harmony" over the issue of reunifying Cyprus. Denktas had been opposed to the UN plan on reunification, arguing it would give Greek Cypriots a dominant role. Erdogan, however, has signaled that he would like to see talks on the future of Cyprus restarted before 1 May, when the Greek part of the island joins the EU.
In Northern Cyprus, meanwhile, Mehmet Ali Talat's pro-EU Republican Turkish Party agreed with the centre-right Democrat Party, led by Serdar Denktash, Rauf's son, on forming a coalition cabinet. Talat, who supports the UN plan, will serve as prime minister. (AFP, Anadolu Agency, TRT 2, NTV - 11/01/04)

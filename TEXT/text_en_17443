ANKARA, Turkey -- State Minister Abdullatif Sener confirmed on Monday (May 21st) that the government has decided to dismiss Turkey's special envoy for countering terrorism, retired General Edip Baser. The decision follows a recent remark to the press in which Baser implied that the United States has sheltered some of the main leaders of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). He also openly questioned the efficiency of trilateral co-operation efforts by Turkey, Iraq and the US. (Zaman, Sabah, - 22/05/07;Turkishpress.com, Xinhua, Focus, Reuters - 21/05/07)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The UN tribunal's spokesperson in Belgrade, Alexandra Milenov, said on Tuesday (21 March) that the tribunal is looking into the presence of three indictees -- Nikola Sainovic, Dragoljub Ojdanic and Nebojsa Pavkovic -- at Slobodan Milosevic's funeral in Pozarevac Saturday. At issue is whether they complied with tribunal rules for their provisional release until trial. They are supposed to remain in Belgrade. The Serbian government says they left with the permission of the justice ministry to attend a specific occasion. (Danas, Politika - 22/03/06; RTS - 21/03/06)

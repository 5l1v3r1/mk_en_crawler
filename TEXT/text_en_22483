ZAGREB, Croatia -- Fighting organised crime and corruption while reforming the judiciary should be Croatia's "first and foremost" priorities on its road to EU membership, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn concluded after meeting in Zagreb on Wednesday (November 12th). Referring to a pair of high-profile murders in Zagreb recently, Rehn said, "We expect decisive measures. The police, the state institutions and the courts should demonstrate concrete results. We expect those guilty to be arrested and brought to justice." The victims were prominent journalist Ivo Pukanic and Ivana Hodak, the daughter of an influential lawyer. Rehn reiterated that Zagreb could wrap up its accession talks by the end of 2009 if it meets all the criteria. (Vecernji List, HRT, Makfax, Xinhua, DPA, HINA - 12/11/08)

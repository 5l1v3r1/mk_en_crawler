ATHENS, Greece -- Late Monday (March 31st), parliament narrowly approved a controversial pension system reform bill that had triggered a wave of strikes throughout the country. Trade unions predict the bill will result in lower pension benefits, while raising the retirement age. This was the second vote on the bill, as requested by the opposition. All 151 lawmakers from the ruling New Democracy party supported it, and 146 lawmakers voted against it. On Tuesday, lawmakers are to debate a proposal by the SIRIZA opposition coalition to organise a referendum on the pension bill. Trade unions are planning a new protest this evening, outside of parliament. (Radio Athens - 01/04/08; RIA-Novosti, ANA-MPA - 31/03/08)

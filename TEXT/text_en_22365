ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Justice Ministry on Friday (August 8th) asked the special war crimes court in Belgrade to question two retired members of the Yugoslav National Army (JNA) in relation to a case against Ernest Radjen, a former military police commander. He is suspected of failing to prevent war crimes against Croatian civilians near Zadar in 1991. Twenty-seven people were killed, mostly members of the so-called People's Guard Unit, but also a number of civilians. Eighty-five suspects have been indicted in the case. (Tanjug, B92 - 09/08/08)

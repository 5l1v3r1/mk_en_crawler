ANKARA, Turkey -- On Thursday (17 July), parliament approved an IMF-required amendment to the bankruptcy act. It aims to help companies in financially difficult positions make their loan payments, while simultaneously facilitating collection of loans in case of bankruptcy. Adoption of this regulation was a benchmark criterion in the Letter of Intent which Turkey submitted to the IMF.
Also on Thursday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, who said his country would provide full support to Turkey's EU membership bid. Ireland assumes the rotating EU presidency in January. (Milliyet - 18/07/03; Anadolu Agency, NTV, TRT 2, AFP - 17/07/03)

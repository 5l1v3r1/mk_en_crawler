MADRID, Spain -- Serbia on Sunday (25 September) extradited a key suspect in the March 2004 Madrid train bombings. Moroccan national Abdelmajid Bouchar, 22, was arrested in Serbia earlier in the summer for travelling inside the country on false Iraqi papers. His true identity was established with help from Interpol. He is thought to have played an important role in co-ordinating the deadly attacks. (AP, Reuters, Beta, Tanjug - 25/09/05)

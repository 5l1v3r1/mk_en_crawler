ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign ministry spokesman Namik Tan said on Wednesday (2 August) that an effort involving Turkey, Iraq and the United States to combat the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has been implemented. At a news conference, Tan said Ankara expects concrete results against PKK activities in northern Iraq shortly. Iraqi authorities, meanwhile, say they are preparing to close PKK offices in the country, including one in Baghdad, as well as PKK-linked organisations in Erbil and Suleymaniye. Ankara has been pressing for more decisive action by Iraq and the United States against the outlawed organisation.

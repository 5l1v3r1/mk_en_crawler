BELGRADE, Serbia -- Ruling coalition member G17 Plus is not looking to replace Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic but is asking for substantial changes in the way the government is functioning, the party said in a statement Sunday (February 13th). "The Democratic Party (DS) is responsible for the government's functioning, being the party with the greatest number of lawmakers," the statement said, noting that the DS has been controlling all finances in Serbia for five years. G17 Plus also said that the cabinet should be more responsible and determined in order to resolve people's problems. Parliament Speaker Slavica Djukic Dejanovic says that personnel changes are more likely than merging cabinet ministries. In a statement, she urged lawmakers to confirm the resignation tendered by Health Minister Tomica Milosavljevic, but did not rule out discussing the resignation of another minister.

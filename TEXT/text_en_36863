IRAKLION, Greece -- The Olympic flame returned to Greece Friday (9 July) for the final leg of its global journey. A chartered jumbo jet flying a Greek flag landed in the southern island of Crete and was welcomed in the city of Iraklion, one of four sites outside Athens that will host football matches. Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, chief organiser of next month's Games, carried the flame in a lantern down the steps of the plane to light the torch held by Panagiotis Yiannakis, Greece's Olympic basketball coach.
The flame was first lit on 25 March in a traditional ceremony at Ancient Olympia. Its international voyage began in Australia and went on to cover 78,000km and 26 countries. For the first time, the relay included stops in Africa and South America. Torchbearers also ran along China's Great Wall and around the base of Egypt's Giza Pyramids. The torch is to arrive at the main Olympic Stadium in Athens on 13 August, signalling the start of the Games. (CNN, Macedonian Press Review - 09/07/04)

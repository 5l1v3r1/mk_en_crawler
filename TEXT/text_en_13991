BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu confirmed on Monday (15 August) that a government re-organisation would occur in the autumn. Talking to reporters, Tariceanu said the changes would affect both personnel and the government structure. He said he is particularly dissatisfied with the work of Health Minister Mircea Cinteza and suggested that EU Integration Minister Ene Dinga might also step down. Tariceanu also indicated that he agrees with those who want to split some "giant" ministries, such as the ministry of transport, construction and tourism. 
Also Monday, Central Bank Governor Mugur Isarescu said Romania's economy is developing at a steady rate. He also said inflation is expected to drop to 7.5 per cent in 2005 and to 5 per cent in 2006, down from 9.3 per cent in 2004. (Rompres, Nine o'clock - 16/08/05; AP - 15/08/05)

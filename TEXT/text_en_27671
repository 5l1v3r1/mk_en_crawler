TIRANA, Albania -- Thousands of Cham Albanians marked the killing of hundreds in their community 66 years ago. A memorial ceremony was held on Sunday (June 27th) in the southern village of Xarra, bordering Greece, where 2,900 Chams were buried. After World War II, thousands of Muslim Chams in Greece were expelled to Albania. Historians there say hundreds of men, women and children were massacred by Greek troops.

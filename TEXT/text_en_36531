AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands -- Local media reported on Friday (7 May) that The Netherlands has completed the process of ratifying the Croatia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement. Concerns over Zagreb's level of war crimes co-operation had delayed ratification. The government now says Croatia can count on its full support for EU integration.
In other news Friday, former Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic was arrested along with former diplomat Darinko Bago on bribery charges. A man says he was told he could return to his job at a local energy company in exchange for a bribe of 60,000-euros. (B92, HINA - 08/05/04; HINA - 07/05/04)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Turkey's EU accession process has been delayed due to anti-Muslim prejudice and xenophobia in Western Europe, State Minister and chief negotiator with the EU, Egemen Bagis, said on Friday (July 10th). "The fact that most Turks are Muslims creates baseless suspicions. ... People tend to fear what they do not know," he told Reuters on the sidelines of a regional summit in Dubrovnik, Croatia. He added that some might fear that after joining the EU, Turkey will become more influential than founding countries themselves. "It is not easy for some countries to accept this," he said. Bagis also warned that rejecting Turkey's bid would send a negative message to Muslims worldwide. (Reuters, Anadolu news agency, Haber Turk - 10/07/09)

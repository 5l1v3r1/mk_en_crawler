PRISTINA, Kosovo -- An activist of the Vetevendosje movement filed a slander case on Wednesday (November 17th) against outgoing Prime Minister Hashim Thaci. After filing the lawsuit at the District Court of Pristina, Florin Krasniqi explained to journalists that it stems from a press release issued earlier this month by Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK). It accused Krasniqi of involvement in the suspicious privatisation of publicly-owned enterprises. The accusations also targeted his private life. He dismissed the allegations as untrue, offensive to his family and damaging to his business reputation. "I have decided to file a lawsuit against [Thaci] to see whether he is above the law or not," Krasniqi said. Thaci says the accusations are ridiculous, and a deliberate campaign ploy ahead of the December 12th snap elections. (Express, Kosova Sot, Bota Sot, Zeri - 18/11/10)

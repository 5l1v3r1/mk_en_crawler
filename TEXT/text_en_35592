WASHINGTON, United States -- A report by Carla del Ponte, the chief prosecutor of the UN war crimes tribunal, says Croatia is making every effort to locate retired General Ante Gotovina. The report was submitted to the UN Security Council on 31 May. The media embargo was lifted on Monday (7 June). The report also said Croatia has made significant progress in co-operating with the ICTY since the previous report in October 2003. Del Ponte criticised Serbia-Montenegro however, for virtually ceasing all co-operation. As for Bosnia and Herzegovina, she said the Office of the High Representative and SFOR had worked to find and detain fugitive indictees, but with no real success.

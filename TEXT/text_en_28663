STRASBOURG, France -- The Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) says that the prison conditions of Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan have improved. In a report on Turkish prisons released on Friday (July 9th), the panel says that its delegation visited Ocalan on January 26-27th to assess the conditions under which he was held on the small prison island of Imrali. Ocalan was the sole inmate on the island until November of last year, but several other convicts have since been transferred there and he now has contact with them. The CPT delegation concluded that the conditions are better than those found during a 2007 visit. "His mental state has also improved since 2007 and can now be described as satisfactory," the report reads. (Hurriyet, Radio Free Europe, Anadolu news agency - 09/07/10)

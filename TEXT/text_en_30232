ATHENS, Greece -- Former Transport Minister Anastasios Mantelis was given a suspended sentence Wednesday (April 13th) of three years in prison for providing incorrect information on his wealth statement and being unable to explain the sources of his income. Mantelis, 66, also faces separate charges of money laundering after he was accused of accepting a bribe from German industrial giant Siemens in 1998. Mantelis has admitted that he had received the equivalent of 100,000 euros from the Greek branch of the German company, in the form of a "campaign donation". Mantelis, formerly a senior PASOK official, was transport minister between 1997 and 2000. (Kathimerini - 14/04/11; ANA-MPA - 13/04/11)

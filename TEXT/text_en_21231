PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Lawmakers adopted a statement Tuesday (April 29th) opposing Serbia's plans to hold local elections in Kosovo. Belgrade intends to hold both parliamentary and municipal elections on May 11th despite objections from UNMIK, which says they would violate the UN's mandate in Kosovo. Opposition parties there criticised Tuesday's statement by parliament as too soft and urged the government to block the elections. (Express, Koha Ditore, Telegrafi - 30/04/08)

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal announced Wednesday (5 May) that it would delay the start of the defence phase of Slobodan Milosevic's trial by two weeks. The hearings are scheduled to start on 22 June instead of 8 June because of the defendant's poor health.
In other news, the tribunal unveiled prosecutors' arguments against a motion by Milosevic's court-appointed lawyers. The so-called Friends of the Court asked the tribunal to throw out the genocide charges against Milosevic. But UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte argued that there was enough evidence to prove the former Yugoslav leader intended "to destroy . a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group".

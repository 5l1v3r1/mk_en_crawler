ANKARA, Turkey -- Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, implied on Thursday (6 July) that as a Muslim country and neighbour, Turkey could play a significant role in hammering out a compromise with Iran regarding its nuclear programme. ElBaradei cited Turkey's traditionally good relations with Middle Eastern countries, the EU and the United States, and suggested Ankara could be a suitable mediator.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The benefits from a recent meeting between Turkish and Greek Cypriot officials are clearly evident, according to a statement Wednesday (14 May) from Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos. He reiterated the readiness of the Greek Cypriot government to resume negotiations, under UN auspices, aimed at finding a solution to the Cyprus issue. Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, in turn, said he was very optimistic, given the recently opened border passages between the Greek and Turkish sections of the divided island.

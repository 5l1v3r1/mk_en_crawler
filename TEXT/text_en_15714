SKOPJE, Macedonia -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer praised Macedonia for passing a key democracy test by conducting the 5 July parliamentary elections largely in compliance with the international standards. In a letter sent to Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski, de Hoop Scheffer expressed hope that implementation of reforms would continue and that the forthcoming NATO summit in Riga would convey a clear signal regarding Skopje's membership in the Alliance.

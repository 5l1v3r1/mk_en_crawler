SKOPJE, Macedonia -- US Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg on Thursday (May 28th) called on Greece and Macedonia to find a "creative solution" to their name dispute. In an interview with the VoA's Macedonian language service, he said Washington stood ready to help find a solution. "We shall work hard with both sides to determine their national interests, as both Greece and Macedonia wish for the negotiations process to move forward," he said. Washington wants to see the issue resolved so that Skopje can "take the place it deserves" in the EU and NATO, Steinberg said. (MIA, Makfax, Mina, Balkan Insight - 29/05/09, VoA - 28/05/09)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown said Sunday (7 November) that he has closed a bank owned by a supporter of Radovan Karadzic. "For the past three years the bank been little more than a thinly disguised mechanism for its managing director Momcilo Mandic and his associates to divert public funds into their pockets," he told reporters. Ashdown said some of this money might have been used to help war crimes suspects evade justice. Privredna Banka was declared insolvent last week after months of financial problems. An arrest warrant has been issued for Mandic. 
In other news, Karadzic's brother Luka was ordered detained for 30 days by a local Montenegrin court on Friday. He was arrested after a shootout during a wedding that left one man wounded.

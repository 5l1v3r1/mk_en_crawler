SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- International community envoy Christian Schwarz-Schilling said on Tuesday (January 23rd) that he will leave his post in late June but plans to propose an extension of the Office of High Representative's (OHR) mandate. "I have increasingly come to the conclusion that the situation in the region and in BiH means that the Bonn Powers [to impose and revoke legislation and to decide on administrative appointments and dismissals] and OHR should continue in some form", the German diplomat told reporters in Sarajevo. The Peace Implementation Council for BiH meets in late February to decide the OHR's future. 
Republika Srpska's (RS) Parliament Speaker Igor Radojcic disagreed with any extension, however. He said on Tuesday that Banja Luka feels it is high time for BiH institutions to assume all responsibilities for managing the state. (Dnevni avaz - 24/01/07; OHR Sources, PBS BiH, RTRS - 23/01/07)

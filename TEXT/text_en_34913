THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Judges at the UN war crimes tribunal handed a 23-year prison sentence to the former commander of a Bosnian Serb prison camp on Thursday (18 December). Dragan Nikolic, who headed the Susice facility in 1992, pleaded guilty to four general charges of crimes against humanity, including nine specific counts of murder and five of torture. He also admitted facilitating and encouraging the rape and sexual abuse of several women and girls held at the camp. Nikolic was the first person to be charged by the UN tribunal shortly after it was established. The judges refused to respect the terms of a plea bargain deal under which prosecutors had sought a 15-year sentence. Nikolic did however receive credit for nearly four years served in detention.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a resolution sending officials to the EU police mission in BiH. The decision, announced Saturday (5 July), follows an EU request to that effect. Several weeks ago, Russia withdrew its military staff from the peacekeeping mission.
Also Saturday, SFOR and local police confiscated large quantities of arms and ammunition in the suburbs of Kamenica. BiH Federation TV reports the weapons belonged to a former police chief. (BiH Federation TV, ITAR-TASS, BBC - 05/07/03)

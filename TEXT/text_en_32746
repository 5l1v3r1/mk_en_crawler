PODGORICA, Montenegro, Yugoslavia -- The OSCE and the Council of Europe will organise a joint effort Friday (13 December) aimed at convincing the public to vote in the 22 December presidential election. In a statement released Thursday, the two international groups urged eligible voters to exercise their right, amid widespread fears that turnout would fall short of the required 50 per cent.

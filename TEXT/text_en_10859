BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's Parliament on Tuesday (2 November) rejected the ultranationalist Serb Radical Party's bid to launch impeachment proceedings against President Boris Tadic. The Radicals claim he violated the Serbian Constitution by urging Kosovo Serbs to participate in the province's 23 October parliamentary elections. 
Meanwhile, UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen is scheduled to visit Belgrade this week to discuss human rights and protection of minorities in Kosovo. Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica is also summoning leaders of the major political parties for talks aimed at developing a national strategy for Kosovo. (Tanjug, B92, Beta - 02/11/04)

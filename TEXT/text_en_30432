NEW YORK, United States -- Members of the UN Security Council agreed on Thursday (May 12th) that a thorough investigation should be made into allegations of human organ trafficking in Kosovo, mentioned in a report by Council of Europe (CoE) rapporteur Dick Marty late last year. However, they fell short of specifying who should lead this investigation. UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier reiterated that EULEX has said it is capable of conducting the investigation and offered UNMIK's co-operation. Kosovo Foreign Minister Enver Hoxhaj also attended the session and said that EULEX is able to independently investigate Marty's report. He urged everyone to hand over any evidence to EULEX prosecutors. Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic, whose country has insisted the UN should lead the investigation, demanded the full truth about events in Kosovo during the 1999 conflict.

WASHINGTON, United States -- In an interview with the Washington Post on Sunday (10 November) Turkish Justice and Development Party (AKP) leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan dismissed concerns over the Islamic roots of his party, saying he regarded secularism as "an important segment of democracy." He insisted that the AKP has no secret agenda to turn Turkey into an Islamic state and pledged to continue its pro-Western orientation. The AKP leader signalled that his party, which enjoys an absolute majority in parliament, might move to amend the constitution to allow him to serve as prime minister. Deniz Baykal, chairman of the only other party that succeeded in entering parliament, the Republican People's Party, says he supports the idea, given AKP's landslide victory. President Ahmet Necdet Sezer opposes such amendments, and warned separately that that the state would fight any attempts to "overthrow the democratic and secular republic", sentiments echoed by Turkish Army Chief of Staff Gen Hilmi Ozkok.

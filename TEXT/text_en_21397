BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Slovenia on Thursday (October 30th) refused to back the opening of three new chapters in EU accession talks with Croatia, media reported. Current EU presidency holder France hoped to open at least four of the 35 policy chapters at a meeting with Croatian officials Thursday. Slovenia, however, vetoed the opening of chapters covering regional policy, justice, freedom and security issues, the environment and free circulation of capital. Participants were able to close only an already-negotiated chapter on external relations. Chief Croatian negotiator with the EU Vladimir Drobnjak voiced regret over Slovenia's decision and urged the exclusion of bilateral issues from negotiations. Relations between the two neighbours have been strained over unresolved territorial disputes.
Separately Thursday, media reported the European Commission's (EC) annual report on Croatia due next week will praise the country's progress towards EU membership. The EC will say that Zagreb could conclude accession talks by the end of 2009 if it fulfils the remaining conditions: crack down on corruption and organised crime and reform its shipyards and steelworks.

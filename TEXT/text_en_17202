TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu says the ongoing pre-election political crisis is harming Albania and undermines the country's international image, especially as regards its EU and NATO integration efforts. In an interview Thursday (December 28th) with Voice of America, Moisiu said that the crisis is "unnecessary, senseless and harmful", and that the various parties had sufficient time to hammer out changes to the electoral code before next month's local elections. 
Also Thursday, OSCE Ambassador to Albania Pavel Vacek reportedly met with Prime Minister Sali Berisha and Edi Rama, leader of the main opposition Socialist Party, in an attempt to mediate the remaining issues. (Albanian News - 29/12/06)

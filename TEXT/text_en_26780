NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot Leader Mehmet Ali Talat said on Sunday (December 6th) that reunification of the divided island could occur by April 2010. "I hope that we will reach an agreement by April at the latest and then we will be able to work out a plan on a referendum," Talat told the Cypriot daily Politis. He stressed that reaching a solution by this deadline is crucial, in view of the April presidential elections in the northern part of the island. (Politis, MIA - 06/12/09)

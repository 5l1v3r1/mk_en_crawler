SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria will send a peacekeeping contingent to Iraq, Deputy Chief of General Staff Vice Adm Petar Petrov said Friday (18 April). The troops, numbering between 150 and 170, will depart 26 May at the earliest and remain in Iraq for six months. Earlier this week, the defence ministry said the United States requested Bulgarian participation in the post-war rehabilitation of Iraq. US European Command Deputy Commander Gen Charles Wald is currently in Bulgaria to work out the details.
Washington has also asked Romania to participate in rebuilding Iraq. George Cristian Maior, secretary of state with the Romanian Defence Ministry, said Saturday that his country could send engineering units, military police and a military medical team. Government officials are negotiating with the US-led coalition on the forms of support Romania could provide. The final decision needs government approval, Maior said.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Parliament Speaker Ranko Krivokapic has scheduled a session of the legislature on March 26th to focus on the proposed new constitution. He said on Friday (March 9th) that lawmakers will be expected to vote on the bill, adopted earlier this month by Parliament's committee for constitutional matters, which offers several alternatives as regards the definitions of state, language, state symbols and religions, based on input from the various parties. Montenegro's independence last year prompted the need for the new constitution. (Dan, Pobjeda - 10/03/07; Mina, RTCG - 09/03/07)

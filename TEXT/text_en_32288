COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller told his Croatian counterpart, Tonino Picula, that the EU insists on Zagreb's co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. Denmark currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU. At issue is Croatia's refusal to extradite former Army Chief of Staff Janko Bobetko. Zagreb argues that the indictment of the 83-year-old general is unconstitutional. Moeller told Picula that Croatia is expected, like any other country, to hand over its war crimes suspects to the UN tribunal. Picula indicated that he did not want the Bobetko case viewed as a litmus test of Croatia's co-operation.
Croatia's Parliament meanwhile began discussing a draft economic development strategy Thursday. The government prepared the document in a bid to speed up economic growth and job creation. The unemployment rate tops 20 per cent. (HINA - 03/10/02; AFP - 02/10/02

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- EU security chief Javier Solana delivered a stern message to Kosovo's ethnic Albanian politicians on Friday (24 October), telling them they have a responsibility to rebuild trust with Serbia. He singled out Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi, who refused to attend the first round of direct talks with Belgrade on 15 October. Solana said he did not expect Rexhapi to block the next round, which is to be held at expert level.
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan weighed in as well. In a report Saturday to the Security Council on UN activities in Kosovo over the past thee months, he urged both Belgrade and Kosovo authorities to continue the dialogue that began in Vienna. (B92, BBC, Tanjug, Beta - 25/10/03; AFP - 24/10/03)

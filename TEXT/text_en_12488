SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Bosnian Serb police on Tuesday (5 July) discovered two large explosive devices close to the site where dignitaries and thousands of mourners will gather on 11 July to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre. A total of 35kg of plastic explosives and fuses were removed from a factory in Potocari. Police experts said the bombs could have caused enormous damage. A spokesman said Bosnian authorities had acted on a tip provided to EU peacekeepers. He also suggested that Bosnian Serb police have some leads regarding the perpetrators, but did not elaborate. The Office of the High Representative called for a thorough investigation Tuesday. (Nezavisne novine - 06/07/05; CNN, VOA, AP, AFP, Fena, RTRS, OHR Sources - 05/07/05)

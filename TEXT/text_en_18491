BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) commented on Friday (March 9th) that despite recent oppostion, it would continue its assessment of Cyprus' application to join the euro. EC spokeswoman Amelia Torres explained the EU experts are assessing data provided by the European Central Bank and will release a report in May on the country's readiness to introduce the euro. The final decision is expected by the end of June. The minority government ally, the left wing AKEL party, opposes the euro-adoption, in contrast to Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos, who wants it introduced on January 1st 2008.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Mehmet Ali Agca, the gunman who wounded Pope John Paul II in 1981, was again arrested in Istanbul on Friday (20 January), following a ruling by the Turkish Court of Cassation. The government had appealed Agca's early release from an Istanbul prison two weeks ago. The supreme judicial body overturned a lower court decision and ruled that Agca had served less time than required. He will likely remain in prison until 2014.

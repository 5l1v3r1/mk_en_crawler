NEW YORK, United States -- Chief UN Prosecutor Carla del Ponte told the UN Security Council on Monday (13 June) that there were "dramatic improvements" in the co-operation she has been receiving from Balkan countries in the prosecution of war criminals. She noted, however, that this co-operation is incomplete and said more needs to be done to arrest and bring to justice seven top suspects, including Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Ante Gotovina. Del Ponte said that the Serbian government remains reluctant to arrest fugitives and relies instead on voluntary surrenders. This policy, she said, is no longer fruitful. The tribunal, del Ponte added, would be unable to complete all proceedings by 2010 if all fugitives are not arrested soon. UN tribunal president Theodor Meron echoed those concerns to the Security Council. (AP, UN Web site, Beta, HINA - 13/06/05)

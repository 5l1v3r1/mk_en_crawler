Republika Srpska (RS) special police forces say they mounted a search for fugitive war crimes indictees Wednesday (18 January) but made no arrests. Media reports, meanwhile, suggested the police were looking for former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic. 
 RS Police Director Dragomir Andan, who led the operation, said his forces had spent 12 hours searching civilian and military locations in Veliki Zepa and surrounding mountainous areas. While the search did not lead to any indictees, it did provide information that could prove valuable in future investigations, Andan said. 
The action also demonstrates the RS Interior Ministry's readiness to apprehend those indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague, he added. 
During the action, every road to Zepa was blocked with police control points. Journalists were barred from covering the operation directly, and only local residents could go in and out of the surrounded area. Police confirmed they received information from a state agency suggesting that one of the tribunal's three most-wanted indictees -- former RS President Radovan Karadzic, Mladic or Banja Luka's wartime police chief, Stojan Zupljanin -- was in the area at the weekend. 
The spokeswoman for UN prosecutors, Florence Hartmann, said the tribunal had not been informed of the RS police operation. The tribunal says its latest information suggests Mladic is in Serbia, not BiH. 
The indictment against Mladic charges him with genocide, crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war. It holds him responsible for the 1995 mass execution of over 7,000 Bosniak prisoners captured after the fall of Srebrenica, as well as for shelling and sniping that targeted civilian areas in Sarajevo.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopolous has invited Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat for talks, in a letter sent via the UN. Greek Cypriot government spokesman Christodoulos Pasiardis said on Wednesday (2 August) that Talat has accepted the invitation. Turkish Cypriot media reports suggest it will be on 10 August. Pasiardis says the meeting would focus on lists of issues for discussion by technical committees, which were exchanged earlier this week. Reunification negotiations have been stalled for more than two years. (CNA - 03/08/06; Phileftheros, Eleftherotypia, Politis - 02/08/06)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian government on Thursday (28 October) invited the international community to talks on Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's decentralisation plan for Kosovo. According to an official statement, the purpose of the negotiations would be to find a "compromise solution that would provide protection to the Serbs". The plan envisions Serb self-governance in the province, which has a majority population of Albanians. (AFP, B92 - 28/10/04)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The general secretary of the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), Gezim Ostreni, was formally elected deputy parliament speaker on Monday (24 January). The opposition had harshly criticised his appointment. Ostreni replaces Hisni Shaqiri, who resigned from all administrative and party duties earlier this month amid internal DUI disputes.

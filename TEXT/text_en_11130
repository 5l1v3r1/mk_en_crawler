SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The twice-postponed local elections in Macedonia will be held on 13 March, Assembly Speaker Ljubco Jordanovski announced on Monday (27 December). The vote was cancelled in October and November because of an opposition-backed referendum on the country's new decentralisation laws, which granted more powers to local governments and redrew the boundaries of some municipalities.
In other news Monday, Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva met with members of the country's diplomatic corps. They agreed to pursue a more aggressive foreign policy next year in three areas: EU integration, NATO membership and recognition of Macedonia's constitutional name.

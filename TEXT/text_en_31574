INCIRLIK, Turkey -- Air Force Gen Richard Myers, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, met Turkish military chief Gen Hilmi Ozkok on Monday (20 January) after a brief visit Sunday to Turkey's southern Incirlik air base, where US warplanes that patrol a northern no-fly zone over northern Iraq are stationed. A US team has been inspecting the base in view of its use in possible air strikes against Iraq. Myers says his visit was previously planned and was not related to possible military intervention in Iraq. In addition to Ozkok, he is to meet with Prime Minister Abdullah Gul. According to the <I>Milliyet</I> daily, the Turkish government is going to insist on a second UN resolution before strikes against Iraq are carried out.

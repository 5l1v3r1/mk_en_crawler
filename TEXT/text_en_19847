BERLIN, Germany -- EU newcomers Bulgaria and Romania have been included in the group of "advanced transformation" democracies in the latest Bertelsmann Transformation Index 2008, published by the German newspaper Die Welt on Monday (February 18th), a day before its official release by the Berlin-based Bertelsmann Foundation. According to the study, Bucharest and Sofia's progress is largely due to their EU membership, which has boosted political change in both. "Advanced transformation" is the second best group on the list, after "consolidated democracies". Turkey, on the other hand, is at the bottom of the chart due to insufficient efforts to embrace democratic institutions, the foundation said. Bertelsmann has been drafting its annual reports on economic and political changes in 125 countries since 2003. (Rompres, Deutsche Welle, Die Welt - 18/02/08)

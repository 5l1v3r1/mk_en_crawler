ANKARA, Turkey -- A court on Tuesday (April 21st) sentenced two mayors from the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) to ten months in jail for spreading propaganda about the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The court ruled that Osman Baydemir, mayor of Diyarbakir, the largest city in the predominantly Kurdish southeastern region of the same name, and Nejdet Atalay, mayor of the nearby town of Batman, had praised PKK militants by referring to them as "guerrillas". The defendants made the remarks at a rally in Diyarbakir in February 2008. 
In other news, a gunman opened fire in the office of the mayor of Birecik, in the southeastern province of Sanliurfa, injuring several people Tuesday before turning himself in. The man is reportedly a former municipal employee who lost his job after last month's local elections.
Also Tuesday, police arrested at least 37 suspected al-Qaeda members during simultaneous raids in four provinces in central and southern Turkey. Police also seized guns and computers from suspected al-Qaeda cell houses. They detained most of the suspects in the southern province of Gaziantep.

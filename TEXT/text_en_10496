BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- US Ambassador to Belgrade Michael Polt warned on Sunday (17 October) that insufficient co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal is deterring US investors from Serbia-Montenegro. In an interview with Novi Sad's Apolo TV, Polt noted that the United States heads the list of foreign investors in the country, but said the rate is less than expected. "When Hague co-operation happens, the floodgates will open," he said. 
In other news, Sasa Petrovic, a member of the Zemun crime gang, on Friday admitted responsibility for several murders, mostly of rival mafia bosses in the 1990s and early 2000. Local media said the confession could be a breakthrough in the Zoran Djindjic assassination case, since other Zemun members might also start talking in an attempt to cut a deal with prosecutors.

TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition parties collected 10,000 signatures by Sunday (October 11th), half the number needed to warrant a review of what they describe as "manipulated ballot boxes" during the June 28th general elections. The initiative by the main opposition Socialist Party (SP) requires 20,000 signatures before submitting the petition to parliament. SP leader Edi Rama insists that his party members will continue their boycott of parliament until their demands are met. Thousands of opposition supporters participated in a rally Saturday against the elections process. (Koha Jone, Panorama, Gazeta Shqiptare - 12/10/09; Shekulli, Ora News - 11/10/09)

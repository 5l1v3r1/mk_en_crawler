ATHENS, Greece -- Parliament passed a bill early Wednesday (February 16th) that reforms the debt-laden public transport system in Athens, despite continuing protests against the legislation. Workers fear that the bill, which envisions restructuring the sector to cut costs, will result in job losses and lower pay. The legislation was supported by all 156 PASOK members in the 300-seat parliament. While lawmakers debated the legislation, all public transport in Athens was subject to a 24-hour strike, creating gridlock across the capital. (ANA-MPA, Imerisia, Express, SKAI - 16/02/11)

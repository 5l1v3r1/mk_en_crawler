BUCHAREST, Romania -- French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin and his Romanian counterpart Adrian Nastase signed an agreement in Paris on Friday (4 October) aimed at curbing the illegal traffic of Romanian child beggars and underage prostitutes in France. In line with the document, French authorities could aid Romanian minors in distress on French territory and then repatriate them. The document is the result of several cases involving organised networks of Romanian beggars and underage prostitutes in France.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) said in a statement Monday (June 2nd) that, although it is aware that campaigning for the October 5th local elections has begun, using nationalist rhetoric could be detrimental to the political atmosphere in BiH. At the weekend, Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik told a congress of the Serb minority in Zagreb that RS considers itself a state and that the BiH state was imposed on it. Bosniak politicians reacted strongly to his words, as did Croatian President Stipe Mesic, who was attending the congress. He said he would expect the Belgrade government to send a clear message to RS that it should accept -- rather than question -- the Dayton Accords. In its statement, the OHR said politicians who truly care about the public should abandon nationalist speeches and instead address issues that really matter to the public.
Separately Monday, the BiH Central Election Commission said it has verified 64 political parties and 183 independent candidates who plan to participate in the October elections. (Fena, RTRS, PBS - 02/06/08)

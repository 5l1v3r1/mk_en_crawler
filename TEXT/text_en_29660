SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The EU is ready to help find a way out of the situation created when Republika Srpska's (RS) parliament decided recently to call a referendum on High Representative-imposed laws, particularly on the BiH Court and Prosecutor's Office, Renzo Daviddi, acting head of EU delegation to Sarajevo, told the Dnevni Avaz daily on Saturday (April 23rd). He said that the referendum is not a solution, rather, problems should be resolved through dialogue within institutions. The Bosnian Serb parliament decided on April 13th to call a referendum on the judicial institutions, saying BiH's Court and Prosecutor's Office are biased with regards to war crimes cases involving Serbs.

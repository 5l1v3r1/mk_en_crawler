SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The upper house of BiH's parliament adopted two police reform laws, establishing a Directorate for Co-ordination of Police Bodies and Agencies and the supervisory panels for police structures, while maintaining entity police. Last week, the European Commission refused to comment on the draft reform laws, saying they needed more time to analyse the bills to ensure they meet EU requirements. BiH initialled the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU on December 4th after the six-party ruling coalition made a commitment to quickly approve police reform legislation.

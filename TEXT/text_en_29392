PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Transport and Telecommunications Minister Fatmir Limaj, who is being investigated by EULEX for alleged corruption, on Thursday (July 1st) hailed "successful investments and the positive result of the auditor's report" of his ministry. "In democratic countries, successful ministers receive awards for their job. In this case, the auditor's report is an award for our work," Limaj told a news conference. Asked by journalists about reports of future arrests in relation to the scandal, Limaj reiterated that he will not resign, adding "my actions were and are to the benefit of this country, for the welfare of Kosovo." In late April, EULEX police raided the offices of the Transport and Telecommunications ministry and Limaj's house, reportedly in connection with questionable road construction tenders.

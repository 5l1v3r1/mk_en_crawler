BRUSSELS, Belgium -- In separate statements Monday (22 May), NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, EU security chief Javier Solana and the OSCE chairman-in-office, Belgian Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht, urged Belgrade and Podgorica to continue dialogue in the wake of Sunday's independence referendum in Montenegro. They cited the conclusions of the OSCE and the Council of Europe monitoring missions in Podgorica, which found the poll was generally carried out in line with democratic standards and was free, fair and orderly. The international officials called on all parties to respect the outcome of the referendum and voiced continued support for democratic reforms in both republics.

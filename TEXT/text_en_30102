ANKARA, Turkey -- A website that spurred a scandal after publishing compromising sex videos involving opposition politicians threatened on Wednesday (May 18th) to publish more. Video releases by the "Different Nationalists" group led to four resignations among the Nationalist Action Party (MHP). On Wednesday, the group announced it has six new videos. MHP leader Devlet Bahceli insisted his party will "not bow to threats and blackmail", once again accusing the ruling Justice and Development Party of running a dirty campaign less than a month before the June 12th general elections. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan reiterated on Wednesday that his party has nothing to do with the scandal. (Milliyet - 19/05/11; Zaman, Hurriyet, Aksam - 18/05/11)

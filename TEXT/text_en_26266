ATHENS, Greece -- Opposition PASOK leader George Papandreou said on Sunday (September 13th) that should his party win the October 4th snap parliamentary elections, it may veto Turkey's EU bid unless Ankara meets "its commitments". Latest polls suggest that PASOK leads the ruling New Democracy party by around 5%. "We hope that Turkey, which has a European perspective, will fulfil its commitments to the EU and observe international law," Papandreou told a press conference in Thessaloniki. "I do not rule out imposing a veto on Turkey's EU bid, if this country fails to observe the norms of good neighbourly relations and does not co-operate to reach a solution to the Cypriot issue," he added.

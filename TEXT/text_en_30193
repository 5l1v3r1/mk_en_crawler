ANKARA, Turkey -- Five active duty Turkish officers and two civilians were arrested on Monday (March 21st) as part of an investigation into the killing of three Christians in 2007. They will await their trial under arrest, although it is not clear yet what specific charges will be brought. Five civilians were arrested previously and charged with murder stemming from the killings in the central Anatolian city of Malatya. Prosecutors have broadened their investigation amid suspicions it is part of an alleged plot to topple the government by creating chaos and destabilisation.

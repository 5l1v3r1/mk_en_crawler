PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The two ruling parties in Kosovo have discussed replacing some ministers in the government instead of breaking their coalition agreement, local media reported on Monday (November 23rd), quoting unnamed sources. Senior officials from the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) and its partner, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), met on Thursday, triggering rumours that the coalition was breaking up. 
The PDK quickly issued a denial, but has reportedly made several demands of its junior partner. The first reportedly is that the LDK abandon plans to form an alliance with opposition parties for the second round of local elections in December. The second stems from the PDK's request to include other parties in the central-level coalition. The third reportedly concerns the replacement of ministers. The LDK reportedly agreed only to consider the last request. 
The PDK and the LDK also differ over which of them should run the Ministry of European Integration, which is to be established soon. (Koha Ditore, Kohavision, RTK, Telegrafi - 23/11/09)

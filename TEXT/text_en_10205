ANKARA, Turkey -- The government reacted sharply on Monday (29 November) to press speculation about an EU draft statement said to link setting a date for starting accession talks with Ankara to Turkey's recognition of Cyprus. While Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul adopted a wait and see attitude, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan dismissed the possibility of conditioning negotiations on the Cyprus issue. He also declared that it is the Greek Cypriots' turn to take steps towards a solution, since they rejected a UN-sponsored reunification plan earlier this year. (NTV, Turks.US - 30/11/04)

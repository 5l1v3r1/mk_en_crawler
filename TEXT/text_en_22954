SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The district court in Sarajevo ruled on Sunday (October 5th) that former Bosniak military commander Naser Oric and his wife Zahidi should remain in custody for one month. They face charges of involvement in organised crime groups, racketeering and illegal possession of weapons. Police arrested four other suspects besides Oric. He returned to BiH only recently after being acquitted of war crimes charges by The Hague tribunal in July. (Politika - 06/10/08; RTS, ITAR-TASS, 24 Sata, Dnevni Avaz, Vesti, B92, RTRS - 05/10/08)

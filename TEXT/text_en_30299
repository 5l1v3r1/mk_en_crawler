ZAGREB, Croatia -- About 1,000 people protested on Sunday (February 20th) in the eastern town of Grubisno Polje in support of war veterans charged by Serbia. They urged the government, the parliament and the president to intervene on behalf of the veterans. A larger demonstration is planned for next weekend in Zagreb. The protest followed Friday's decision by a Bosnian court allowing the extradition of veteran Tihomir Purda to Serbia. He was arrested in early January at the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina based on a Serbian arrest warrant. Belgrade suspects him of involvement in war crimes committed in 1991 against Serbs in Vukovar. (HRT, Hina, Radio Free Europe, RTS - 20/02/11)

ROME, Italy -- Foreign Minister Franco Frattini met with Albanian counterpart Ilir Meta in Rome on Wednesday (October 21st) and predicted the EU will lift visa requirements for Albanians in 2010. "Albania has achieved progress on the visa issue," Frattini said. He noted that ten years ago, Italy was alarmed over the influx of illegal immigrants from its Adriatic neighbour, while now Italy has peacekeeping troops alongside Albania in Afghanistan. He promised to raise the issue of Albania's EU integration at next week's meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg. (Ora News, Top Channel, Shekulli, Alsat - 21/10/09)

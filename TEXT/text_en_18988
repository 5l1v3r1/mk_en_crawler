SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Another regional magistrate, the former Razgrad regional prosecutor Elena Hadzhidimitrova, has been charged with abuse of office and deliberately delaying proceedings, according to Sofia City prosecutors Wednesday (January 3rd). The charges stem from delays in nearly 40 cases, between 1992 and June 2006, allegedly to help defendants. If convicted, she faces up to six years in prison. This was the seventh indictment filed against a regional magistrate, following an internal audit ordered by Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev last year. (Sega - 04/01/07; Mediapool - 03/01/07)

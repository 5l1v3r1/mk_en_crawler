BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Wednesday (September 24th) he hopes Serbia can obtain EU candidate status in 2009, the goal of both the Union and the Serbian government. After meeting with Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic, Rehn stressed that the European Commission (EC) will "fully support Serbia's efforts" to gain such status next year. He added the option to grant Serbia candidate status is "the best-case scenario". He also advised Serbia to unilaterally implement some provisions of the interim trade agreement with the EU that Brussels refused to green-light earlier this month. Dacic said the government will speed up EU-related legislative activities in the next couple of months. (Tanjug, B92, Beta - 24/09/08)

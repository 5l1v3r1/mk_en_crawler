THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Last-ditch marathon peace talks to reunify Cyprus have failed, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan announced Tuesday (11 March). "Regrettably these efforts were not a success. We have reached the end of the road," said Annan. If a UN plan had been approved, Cyprus could have signed an accession treaty -- a prelude to joining the EU -- on 16 April, as a united country. The Greek Cypriot side of the island will join the 15-nation bloc, with or without the peace agreement, in May 2004. The two sides have said they would continue talking until 28 March and hold a referendum on 6 April. (CNN - 11/03/03; Anadolu Agency, NTV, CNA, Reuters, CyBC TV - 10/03/03)

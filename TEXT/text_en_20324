BELGRADE, Serbia -- The election commission voted on Friday (January 11th) to ban British and US representatives from monitoring the January 20th presidential election. A commission member from the extreme nationalist Radical Party said the decision was made because of the two countries' support for Kosovo's independence. His party abstained from the vote, but Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia joined with the Socialists to keep the British and US observers away from the polls. The commission did approve, the presence of monitors from Russia and the OSCE. (AP, AFP, Reuters, UPI, BBC - 11/01/08)

NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced on Monday (May 3rd) that Croatian Justice Minister Ivan Simonovic has been appointed as the organisation's assistant secretary-general for human rights, edging out 130 other candidates. That makes Simonovic the highest-ranking Croatian official in an international organisation. In an interview with the local daily Vecernji List, Simonovic said he would like to remain in the cabinet until the end of June to ensure the judiciary chapter of Zagreb's EU accession talks opens.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana told reporters Monday (22 November) that Ramush Haradinaj may not be the most appropriate candidate for prime minister of Kosovo. "Whoever the prime minister, he has to work on the standards issue â€¦ And if in the end the prime minister is somebody who has to go to The Hague, he may not be the most appropriate person to work towards those standards," Solana said. Haradinaj, a former KLA commander, has been interviewed by the UN war crimes tribunal. (AP, AFP, Reuters, Danas - 23/11/04; AFP, Tanjug, KosovaLive, Beta, B92 - 22/11/04)

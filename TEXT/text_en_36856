PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- A report presented by the OSCE mission in Kosovo on Saturday (10 July) partly blames UNMIK for the deadly mid-March ethnic riots. The report particularly criticises UNMIK for being unable to contain the degree of violence, citing certain "operational problems" that might have affected KFOR's response. The document adds that UNMIK must take greater care to protect the rights of all minorities in the province. (B92 - 10/07/04)

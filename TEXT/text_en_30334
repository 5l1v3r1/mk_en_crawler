TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition Socialist Party leader Edi Rama said on Saturday (May 14th) he has won re-election as mayor of Tirana following the May 8th local elections. His comment came as the Central Election Commission (CEC) continued to validate the results in the close race between Rama and former Interior Minister Lulzim Basha, candidate of the ruling Democratic Party. According to the preliminary results, Rama leads by just ten votes. The CEC says the result is too close and it must continue to check for human errors before announcing the final results.

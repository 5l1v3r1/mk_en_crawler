TIRANA, Albania -- Edi Rama, the mayor of Tirana who was re-elected in the 12 October local elections, joined the ranks of the ruling Socialist Party on Wednesday (29 October). Noting that the party twice supported him even though he wasn't a member, Rama says he is morally obligated to commit himself publicly. (Albanian Daily News, ATA - 29/10/03)

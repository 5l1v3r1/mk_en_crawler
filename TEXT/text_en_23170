SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Citizens of the EU member states and countries that have signed the Schengen Agreement can enter Macedonia's territory showing only their ID cards as of Wednesday (October 1st). The interior ministry also announced that all citizens of countries on the EU's white list will be able to enter Macedonia without visas. This includes around 20 countries such as Andorra, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, El Salvador, Singapore, South Korea, Uruguay and Hong Kong. Visitors from other parts of the world that already have Schengen visas can also enter the country without additional visa requirements. The government decided last month to abolish passport and visa requirements for these categories of travellers. (Makfax, MIA, A1, MINA - 01/10/08)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Kosovo Albanian wanted by the United States on terrorism charges has been identified as Bajram Asllani, 29. Arrested in Mitrovica on Thursday (June 17th), he has been charged in the US with providing support to terrorists and conspiracy to kill, kidnap and damage property in a foreign country. The US justice department identifies him as "Ebu Hatab", and says he conspired with eight other people arrested in the US last year and indicted in North Carolina. All of them are US citizens, except for Hysen Sherifi, a Kosovo native with permanent residence status in the US. Asllani allegedly offered Sherifi videos of Jihad in order to persuade others to join the cause. Asllani's family says he is innocent. (Express, Zeri - 18/06/10; Kohavision, RTK, TV 21 - 17/06/10)

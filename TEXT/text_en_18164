THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- As expected, former Bosnian Serb policeman and paramilitary soldier Dragan Zelenovic pleaded guilty to seven counts of torture and rape of Bosniak women, during his appearance before the UN war crimes tribunal on Wednesday (January 17th). Zelenovic entered the plea as part of a deal struck with prosecutors, who agreed to drop seven other counts against him, stemming from crimes committed against Bosniak civilians in Foca in 1992. 
Zelenovic also agreed to testify for prosecutors in other trials. Still unclear is the prison sentence he will receive. His lawyers are seeking a maximum of ten years. (ICTY web site, PBS BiH - 17/01/07)

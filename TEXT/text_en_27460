PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A notorious fugitive wanted by Kosovo authorities for years is now in the hands of Irish police, local media reported on Sunday (November 28th). Enver Sekiraqa is wanted for a number of crimes, including the murder of a police officer in Pristina. The head of the Kosovo police, Reshat Maliqi, confirmed that police in Ireland are holding a man by that name and that all documents required for his extradition have been sent. Kosovo has no agreement that regulates the procedure between Kosovo and Ireland, while the mechanism that includes the European arrest warrant does not cover Kosovo. Police have been after Sekiraqa since 2007. He is suspected of organised crime, sex crimes, racketeering, and thefts. (Koha, Telegrafi, Klan Kosova, TV 21 - 28/11/10)

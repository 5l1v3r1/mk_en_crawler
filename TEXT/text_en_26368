PRISTINA, Kosovo -- US Ambassador Christopher Dell urged the public Monday (March 15th) to become more engaged in fighting corruption, rather than waiting for the international community to do it. He was speaking in Pristina at the start of a two-week US-sponsored training session for task forces established to fight human trafficking, drugs and corruption. No one should be above the law, said Dell, adding that the rule of law should guarantee everyone access to justice. (Kohavision, Telegrafi, Kosova Press, Zeri, RTK - 15/03/10)

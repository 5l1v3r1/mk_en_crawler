ZAGREB, Croatia -- The foreign ministry reacted strongly on Tuesday (23 August) to news that a Croatian ship was confiscated by Indonesian authorities and all 25 Croatian crewmembers taken prisoner. Croatian Ambassador to Jakarta Alexander Broz says Indonesian Navy troops surrounded the private cargo ship "Mirna Rijeka" and arrested the crew Tuesday morning. He added that the captain was asked to sign documents in Indonesian but refused to do so without a lawyer. Zagreb media noted that the action followed a yearlong legal dispute between the two countries. (Novi list - 24/08/05; HRT, HINA, BBC News - 23/08/05)

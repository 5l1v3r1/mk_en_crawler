ATHENS, Greece -- Police in Thessaloniki on Saturday (April 16th) used tear gas to disperse anarchists who gathered for a march in support of jailed colleagues. Tensions escalated when demonstrators used fire extinguishers against police officers, prompting several arrests. Some of the demonstrators headed to the campus of Aristotle University, which by law is off limits to police. (Elefterotipia, Athens News, RTS -16/04/11)

WASHINGTON, United States -- A top US State Department official said Friday (September 7th) that Washington would extend recognition to Kosovo if it makes a unilateral declaration of independence. "We would recognise Kosovo independence as, we assume, a number of others would as well because that is the only stable way forward in the Balkans," the AFP quoted Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Volker as saying. He went on to insist that "everyone must take responsibility for maintaining peace and stability in the Balkans".
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica reacted harshly, saying his country "is faced with a direct US threat". He called on the UN Security Council to protect Serbia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Kosovo leadership in Pristina, however, welcomed Volker's remarks and said they were consistent with previous statements from the US administration, including from President George W. Bush.
In other news, the EU is demanding that Serbia explain a statement by Serbia's secretary of state for Kosovo, Dusan Prorokovic, who said his government could send troops to the province. "It is not comprehensible that a country that is pleading for a negotiated settlement on the one hand, makes such threats of violence on the other hand which question its commitment to serious negotiations," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said. He called on Kostunica to clarify the statement before he arrives on a visit to Brussels on Wednesday. (AFP, B92, International Herald Tribune, Reuters, AP, BBC - 07/09/07)

"The US government continues to support the UN-sponsored negotiation process and wishes the issue to be solved as soon as possible. All allegations that the United States is following different policies are groundless," an embassy statement said. On Tuesday, Macedonian media claimed Rice would present a plan to resolve the name dispute on September 23rd in New York.

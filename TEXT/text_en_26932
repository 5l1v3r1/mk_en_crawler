SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme visited Skopje on Monday (March 8th) to reiterate that his country will not be granting political asylum to Macedonians who cite economic reasons. His talks with Macedonian counterpart Nikola Gruevski followed reports of an influx of ethnic Albanian asylum seekers after EU visa requirements were scrapped for Macedonia. The two leaders vowed to co-operate closely on the issue. They also discussed Macedonia's EU bid. Leterme, whose country takes over the rotating EU presidency in July, reiterated Belgium's support for the integration of countries in the Western Balkans. (MIA, MRT, Alsat, A1 - 08/03/10)

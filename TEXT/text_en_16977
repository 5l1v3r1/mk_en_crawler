BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) President Dragan Cavic warned on Wednesday (3 May) that RS must take seriously the message from Brussels freezing Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with Belgrade for failing to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal. Cavic urged the RS government to step up activities to fulfil Hague-related obligations, to avoid a similar outcome for BiH. 
In other news Wednesday, the BiH police reform directorate's board met in Sarajevo but again failed to decide on the future structure of the police forces. According to Board Chairman Vinko Dumancic, despite ten hours of debate, members were unable to reach a consensus. During a visit to Banja Luka on Wednesday, Senior Deputy High Representative Peter Bas-Backer warned that failing to enact crucial police reforms could have considerable consequences, as it is a major condition for EU integration.

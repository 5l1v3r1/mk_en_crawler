PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- A rocket-propelled grenade hit the district court building in Pristina late Sunday (20 July) in what local officials described as an attempt to intimidate the international judiciary and the UN police force in Kosovo. A minute later, a hand grenade exploded in front of a nearby police station, damaging a patrol car. UN Police Commissioner Stefan Feller told reporters that police vehicles in other areas have been vandalised. The attacks came days after an international jury sentenced several former KLA members to prison for war crimes.

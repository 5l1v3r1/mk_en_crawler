SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Sarajevo's City Council decided on Tuesday (February 1st) to declare former French President Jacques Chirac an honourary citizen of the city, for helping to end the 1992-1995 conflict. A committee on the nomination says that during his presidential mandates from 1995 to 2007, Chirac demonstrated understanding of the problems confronting BiH and the need for its integration into European and international structures. The vote by city councillors was 21-1. (Fena, FoNet, RTS, Tanjug, B92 - 01/02/11)

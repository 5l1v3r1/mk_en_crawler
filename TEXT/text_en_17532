VIENNA, Austria -- Talks on UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for resolving the Kosovo status issue continued on Friday (February 23rd) but lacked progress, according to reports after the third day of negotiations between the Serbian and Kosovo teams in Vienna ended. The focus was economic issues. Talks resume on Monday.
In other news Friday, the Serb Radical Party (SRS), which controls the most seats in the Serbian Parliament, said that if Kosovo becomes independent, Serbia should reconsider its membership in the UN. SRS deputy leader Tomislav Nikolic added that Serbia should call off efforts to join the EU, if the Union recognises Kosovo's independence. (RTS - 25/02/07; Beta - 24/02/07; B92, AP - 23/02/07)

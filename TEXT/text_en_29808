BELGRADE, Serbia -- The parliamentary committee on Kosovo urged on Monday (March 28th) that Kosovo Serbs boycott the upcoming population census unless it is conducted by the UN across all of Kosovo. Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic reiterated Belgrade's stance that the census could be conducted only by the UN, not by Kosovo institutions. Kosovo officials have said that the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) will be in charge of running the headcount in Serb-dominated northern Kosovo, starting Friday.

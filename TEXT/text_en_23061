MITROVICA, Kosovo -- Demonstrations continued in the divided town of Mitrovica on Wednesday (April 2nd). About 20 ethnic Albanian women resumed their protest in front of the UNMIK office in southern Mitrovica, demanding that UNMIK regional representative Gerard Gallucci leave town for criticising UNMIK's decision to restore order around a courthouse in the north last month. The women have threatened to protest every morning until he leaves. Gallucci's resignation has been rejected.
Meanwhile, Serb judiciary workers continued their daily protest in front of the Municipal and Regional Court in northern Mitrovica, demanding to get their old jobs back after nearly a decade. They say they were forced to leave them when personnel from UNMIK and KFOR arrived in 1999. (Koha Ditore, Express - 03/04/08; RTS, Tanjug, B92 - 02/03/08)

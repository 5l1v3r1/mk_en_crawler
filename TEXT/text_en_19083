WASHINGTON, United States -- State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said on Tuesday (May 1st) that the process of resolving Kosovo's future status would take another month or two. McCormack added that significant political pressure from all sides could be expected in the days and weeks ahead. "We have to find a solution â¦ in the near future, unless we want the region to experience further violence," McCormack stressed. He repeated US support for UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan to resolve the status issue, saying that granting supervised independence to the province is the best way forward.

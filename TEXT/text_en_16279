SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The number of Bulgarians who want to emigrate to the West has declined, according to the results of a Gallup poll commissioned by the labour ministry. Only 11% of those aged 15 to 60 considered the option of emigrating abroad long-term after the country joins the EU, perhaps as early as 1 January. In 2001, 15% of Bulgarians wanted to move to other countries. Most of those who are considering emigration want to live in Spain or Germany. (Reuters - 12/09/06)

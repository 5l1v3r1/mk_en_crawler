ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic said Wednesday (13 April) that authorities could provide new evidence proving that fugitive retired General Ante Gotovina is not in the country. Mesic added he is convinced that the war crimes indictee is not in neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina either. The president said this information should satisfy the EU working group formed to assess Croatia's level of co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.

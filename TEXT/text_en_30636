ANKARA, Turkey -- Police raided the office of an online news portal Monday (February 14th) over its suspected links with a terror network accused in the so-called Ergenekon plot to create chaos and topple the government. The homes of the media's owner, Soner Yalcin, and three of his colleagues were searched as well, with all four detained for questioning. Local media reported that the arrests came hours after Oda TV posted on its website a video that allegedly discredited the police. Access to the channel's internet site was blocked. 
In other news Monday, retired Army General Cetin Dogan, the suspected mastermind of separate alleged plot to oust the government, surrendered to police after a court issued a warrant for him and 162 other people on Friday. Dogan, a former commander of Turkey's First Army, will face trial along with 195 other suspects in the so-called Sledgehammer coup plot trial.

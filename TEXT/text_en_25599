LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- The Constitutional Court decided on Tuesday (March 23rd) that a maritime border agreement reached via arbitration to resolve the long-standing dispute with Croatia conforms to the constitution. This effectively gives parliament the green light to ratify the deal. Parliament Speaker Pavel Gantar said that the deal could be included in a session next month. Croatia ratified the agreement last year, under which the maritime border dispute will go to international arbitration, with the decision binding. 
Meanwhile, Slovenian Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar expressed doubt that the foreign policy negotiation chapter of Croatia's EU accession talks could be opened during the next inter-governmental conference in April, local media reported on Tuesday. (HRT, STA, Vecernji List, Reuters - 23/03/10)

TIRANA, Albania -- Albanian and Greek officials met on Tuesday (5 August) to discuss border issues, particularly the flow of illegal immigrants from Albania to Greece. Local media has reported that the number of Albanians wanting to cross the border has increased recently, with the opening of an additional border checkpoint as a likely cause.

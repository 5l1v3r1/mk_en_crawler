STRASBOURG, France -- The top European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg held the first session of a trial Tuesday (November 27th) that pits the Greek Orthodox Church against Turkey for discrimination and violation of property rights. The Greek Patriarchate decided to sue after Ankara deprived it of control of an orphanage on Turkish soil. The Patriarchate claims it has owned the facility since 1902, when the country was part of the Ottoman Empire. The property, on Buyukada Island in the Marmara Sea, was taken over by Turkey in 1997.

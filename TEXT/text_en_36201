BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The new Serbian cabinet is to come up with a draft of a new Serbian Constitution in 100 days, Parliament Speaker Predrag Markovic said Sunday (7 March). "We expect the formation of an expert commission soon, to help draft the document because it is this legislature that has to adopt it and then leave it up to a referendum," he said. He added that he would discuss the issue with Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, as he had already talked to the chairmen of groups in parliament. (Beta - 07/03/04)

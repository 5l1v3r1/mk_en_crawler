BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said in an interview published on Saturday (September 22nd) that the world should prepare for "devastating consequences" if Kosovo becomes independent in what he described as violation of international law. Vecernje novosti newspaper quotes him as saying it is still possible to find a negotiated solution to the Kosovo issue, but he accused the ethnic Albanian side of merely waiting for the 120 days of talks to end before declaring independence. If the province gains independence, he said, Serbia would at least try to maintain ties with the Serb minority. 
Also Saturday, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic told the BBC that Belgrade is offering Kosovo virtual self-governance within Serbia. If a solution is forced onto the region from the outside, if there is a clear winner and loser, this will affect stability in the Western Balkans, Jeremic said.
In an interview with the daily Blic, Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac ruled out military action by Serbia, saying the army will follow the government policy of resolving Kosovo's final status through diplomatic means.

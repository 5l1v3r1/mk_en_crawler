SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) announced on Wednesday (10 September) that it would return to parliament in view of recent events, particularly the increased tension in the country's northwest. DPA said it wants to take part in proceedings concerning the security situation. The party had been staging a boycott for months over what it sees as the slow implementation of the Ohrid Peace Accord.
Also Wednesday, the government approved draft changes to the law on prevention of money laundering. The amendments aim to strengthen measures against financing of terrorism in accordance with international practices. (Utrinski Vesnik - 11/09/03; MIA, Makfax - 10/09/03)

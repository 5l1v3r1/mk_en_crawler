THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN tribunal announced on Thursday (May 1st) it granted a provisional release to Bruno Stojic, who faces charges of war crimes against Bosnian Muslims and other non-Croats during the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Stojic obtained his release on Tuesday and is due to return to The Hague early next week, when his lawyers begin their defence. The former high-level leader of the Bosnian Croat wartime entity Herceg-Bosna is on trial with five other co-defendants for war crimes committed in 1992 and 1993 in southwestern and central BiH. The trial began two years ago. Prosecutors completed their arguments in February. (RTRS, SRNA, UN website - 01/05/08)

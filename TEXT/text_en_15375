SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Security was tight in the Bulgarian capital ahead of an informal meeting of NATO's foreign ministers that was due to begin late Thursday (27 April). NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer says several issues will be discussed, including future enlargement, support for an African-led operation in Darfur, Iran's nuclear programme, co-operation against terrorism and the fall summit in Riga. De Hoop Scheffer said the Sofia meeting would send a signal to aspiring members Croatia, Macedonia, Albania, Ukraine and Georgia, but did not elaborate. He reiterated the Alliance's position that NATO's doors remain open. (DW, Darik - 27/04/06; UPI - 26/04/06)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Troops have been deployed at the Turkish-Iraqi border, according to a senior military official quoted Monday (16 December) by the Turkish Daily News. The official, who wished to remain anonymous, confirmed that the Turkish Army had relocated its troops along the border over the last few days. According to government sources, Ankara is expected to determine by 22 December what assistance it could provide in any eventual military operation against Iraq. Thus far, the government has made no firm commitment to the United States, but according to local media, plans to establish a buffer zone at the border to prevent a massive refugee inflow from Iraq.

TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu has sent a letter to new UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, lobbying in favour of Kosovo's independence. His office said on Tuesday (January 30th) that Moisiu voiced his belief that the UN proposal for resolving the future status of the province must reflect the wish of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority, as well as the international community's commitment to ensure peace and stability in the Balkans.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Interior Minister Neoklis Sylikiotis says Cyprus and Malta will be the two EU member states to receive priority support from the Union in matters concerning asylum. On Friday (February 27th), Sylikiotis said European Commission Vice-President Jacques Barrot had assured him that the two countries would be the first considered by the soon-to-be-established European Asylum Support Office. "This is very important to us, because we are countries that feel most the strain of asylum applications," Sylikiotis said. He described Cyprus as the first stop along illegal immigrant routes in an area that he described as "the most politically unstable on the planet". (CNA, Famagusta Gazette, Cyprus Mail - 28/02/09)

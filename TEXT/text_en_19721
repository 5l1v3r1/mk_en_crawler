SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Bulgarian government took an official decision on Friday (March 21st) to recognise Kosovo and exchange diplomatic representatives with the former Serbian province. . It had already pledged to do so on Wednesday, together with Croatia and Hungary. Serbia immediately withdrew its ambassador to Bulgaria, as it has for each country that has recognised Kosovo. Danilo Vucetic was to leave Bulgaria within 48 hours from Friday, when his country's foreign ministry sent a protest note to the Bulgarian government.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt -- Turkish Prime Minister Abdullah Gul wrapped up a visit to Egypt on Sunday (5 January), urging the nations of the Middle East to avert the threat of war in the Gulf. He also called on the government in Baghdad to co-operate with UN weapons inspectors and prove that the country no longer has weapons of mass destruction. A Turkish minister will visit Baghdad on Monday, seeking a peaceful solution. Gul's next stop is Jordan, where he will hold talks with King Abdullah. This is the first Middle East tour by a senior member of the new Turkish government. It began Saturday in Syria and will include a later stop in Saudi Arabia.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- A donor conference held in Brussels on Friday (31 March) resulted in pledges of 7.7m euros in assistance for BiH judicial reforms. The event, co-organised by the BiH government and the European Commission, drew 70 representatives from more than 40 countries. BiH has achieved much progress in restructuring the judicial sector, and the transfer of judicial competences and responsibilities to the BiH authorities must be fully completed by the end of 2009, participants said.

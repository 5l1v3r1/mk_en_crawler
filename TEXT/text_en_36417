The event was attended by Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Queen Sophia of Spain, Crown Prince Albert of Monaco, German President Horst Koehler and the leaders of Bulgaria, Poland, Romania and Albania.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The opposition ethnic Albanian party New Democracy (ND) said on Sunday (December 12th) that it will not call for a boycott of the population census scheduled for April, but rather will conduct its own headcount of Macedonian Albanians living in Europe and the United States. ND leader Imer Selmani stressed that the party will conduct its count with the support of several NGOs and associations. The party has long insisted the census should be postponed until July in order to include Albanians working abroad who would return home on summer holiday. The population census is scheduled for April 1st-15th. (A1, Alsat M, Kirilica - 12/12/10)

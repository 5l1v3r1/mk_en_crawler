TIRANA, Albania -- The main opposition Socialist Party (SP) wants to call a referendum on the government's plan to build a nuclear power plant. Lawmaker Besnik Baraj said on Monday (March 29th) that such sensitive initiatives need input from residents before they are launched. The SP also reminded the government that a strategy for energy development adopted a few years ago did not include nuclear energy. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusoni confirmed earlier this month that Italy will support the construction of a nuclear plant in Albania, in part so Italy can import electricity.

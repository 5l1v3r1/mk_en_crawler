ATHENS, Greece -- Police announced on Friday (August 28th) the arrest of notorious Albanian criminal Arben Kendezi, one of the most influential people in the Saranda armed rebellion of 1997-1998. Kendezi was detained in the town of Lutraki, about 70km northwest of Athens, where he has been living for the past ten years after escaping Albania. Photos from the spring 1997 unrest in Albania, where Kendezi is shown holding a Kalashnikov rifle, as well as finger printing, proved his identity. Kendezi had been sentenced in Albania to six years in prison for robbing a bank in Saranda. (Shekulli - 29/08/09; Lajme, Koha Jone, Balkan Web, MIA, Makfax - 28/08/09)

YEREVAN, Armenia -- Armenian Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan on Friday (February 12th) submitted to parliament two protocols aimed to normalise ties with Turkey. The documents, signed in October last year, will be discussed by lawmakers for ratification. However, Sargsyan said that Armenia's parliament will first wait for Turkey to ratify them before doing the same. Parliament's press office head Goar Pogosian said the protocols were received and announced a commission would be set up within two days to study them.

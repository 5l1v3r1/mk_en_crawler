PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Three Bulgarian citizens and one Kosovo businessman were arrested on Tuesday (May 27th) for allegedly transporting hazardous material into Kosovo. Police say three truck trailers entered Kosovo from Macedonia and, after a routine check, headed to the Vermica border crossing for additional verification. Material leaked from them there, injuring six border officials and closing the crossing for about ten hours. Forged documents said the trucks were hauling hydraulic oil, but customs officials tested it and found higher-than-normal sulphur levels.

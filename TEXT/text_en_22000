BUCHAREST, Romania -- Main opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) leader Mircea Geoana promised on Thursday (November 20th) that if the PSD's coalition with the Conservative Party (PC) wins the November 30th elections, it will govern alone, "without compromises with other right-wing parties". Moreover, Geoana said he believes the transition between the current administration and the next should take place as quickly as possible, immediately after the elections, in order to address the effects of the ongoing economic crisis. According to PSD deputy leader Cristian Diaconescu, if the PSD-PC wins the vote, Geoana would become prime minister. (Cotidianul - 21/11/08; Mediafax, Rompres - 20/11/08)

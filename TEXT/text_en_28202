NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council decided on Thursday (November 18th) to extend the mandate of EUFOR, its stabilisation force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH), for another year, until November 18th 2011. Calling on all political leaders in BiH to refrain from divisive rhetoric and to take additional measures to ensure progress towards EU integration, the Council said extending the mission would ensure continued compliance with the Dayton Peace Accord. At the same time, it stressed that BiH officials are mainly responsible for implementing the Accord. (UN news centre, Xinhua - 18/11/10)

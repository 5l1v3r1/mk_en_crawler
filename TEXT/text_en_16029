ANKARA, Turkey -- President Ahmet Necdet Sezer approved the new anti-terror law on Monday (17 July), while voicing reservations about some of its texts. Sezer suggested that until he decides whether to approach the Constitutional Court about his concerns, the new legislation would be in force. It significantly tightens the fight against terrorism, particularly in dealing with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The EU says the law threatens press freedoms and human rights.
Also Monday, top government and military officials convened in Ankara, to discuss the security situation and intensified PKK activities. More than 12 members of the Turkish security forces have been killed in recent clashes in southeastern Turkey. (Radikal, Milliyet, Zaman, Aksam, NTV - 18/07/06; AP, AFP - 17/07/06)

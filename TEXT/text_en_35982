ZAGREB, Croatia -- A court in Vukovar started legal proceedings against eight Croatian Serbs who are accused of the murder and torture of Croat civilians in the village of Borovo Selo in 1991. The defendants were members of a Serb militia at the time when the atrocities took place. Three of them will be tried in absentia. The other five suspects were detained in March 2003, and pleaded not guilty.
In another Croatian trial, the Sisak county court has dropped investigations against three former members of the Croatian Army -- Sinisa Mazuran, Vlado Josic and Vlado Buzuka. (HINA, AFP, BBC - 09/01/04)

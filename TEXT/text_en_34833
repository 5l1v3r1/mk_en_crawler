BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Constitutional Commission of Romania's Senate announced on Monday (4 August) that it has received 233 proposals for amending the country's constitution. The amendments were passed by parliament's lower house earlier this year and were submitted to the Senate for discussions and approval. A special senatorial commission will review the texts, which refer to guaranteeing private property, introducing a 5-year presidential term, removing mandatory military service, minorities' rights and changes related to EU and NATO membership aspirations.
In other news, the head of the Romanian police, Florin Sandu, will depart on a two-day visit to Ljubljana on Wednesday (6 August) at the invitation of his Slovene counterpart, Marko Pogorevc. The two officials will discuss common efforts for combating organised crime -- particularly drug and stolen car trafficking. (Rompres - 04/08/03)

NEW YORK, United States -- Greece's response to UN mediator Matthew Nimetz's latest proposal to resolve the long-standing name dispute between Athens and Skopje was not positive, local media reported on Wednesday (August 19th). Nimetz met on Tuesday in New York with Greek representative Adamantios Vassilakis. According to Greece's Mega TV, Vassilakis said Athens would not accept the proposed name "Republic of Northern Macedonia" even if it is to be used only in bilateral Greek-Macedonian relations. He reportedly insisted instead that the name should refer to a geographical location and should be used internationally. On Thursday, Macedonian negotiator Zoran Jolevski presents his country's position on the proposal in New York. (Makfax, A1, MRT, Sitel, Mina - 19/08/09)

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Authorities organised a series of events to mark Statehood Day on Wednesday (13 July). Both Prime Minster Milo Djukanovic and President Filip Vujanovic emphasised that Montenegro will soon become an independent state. In a newspaper interview, Serbian-Montenegrin President Svetozar Marovic was quoted as saying 2006 would be a year of referendum. The opposition in Montenegro ignored pro-independence celebrations organised by the government. (Republika, Politika, Pobjeda - 14/07/05; B92, Tanjug, VOA, RTCG - 13/07/05)

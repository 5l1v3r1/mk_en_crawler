ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on parliament Thursday (2 October) to move quickly with a vote on sending peacekeeping troops to neighbouring Iraq. He made the comment after Turkish and US officials agreed to work jointly to remove the threat of Kurdish extremists based in northern Iraq. Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, just back from talks in Washington and other capitals, said it would be unthinkable of the United States not to act against organisations on its own list of terrorist movements.
Also Thursday, Erdogan met in Ankara with his Czech counterpart, Vladimir Spidla. They issued a joint statement declaring their determination to achieve peace and stability in Southeast Europe and in the Middle East. (Milliyet - 03/10/03; Reuters, AFP, Anadolu Agency, NTV, TRT 2 - 02/10/03)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- NATO has decided to "lend a helping hand" to Serbia by offering it Intensified Dialogue status, even though Belgrade has not applied for it. Romanian President Traian Basescu, whose country this week hosted the largest summit in the organisation's history, said on Thursday (April 3rd) that "NATO decided to raise the level of co-operation with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro -- as well as with Serbia -- by inviting them to move on from the Partnership for Peace programme to Intensified Dialogue status." BiH and Montenegro had applied for the upgraded relationship with the Alliance.
In other news Thursday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said the outcome of Serbia's parliamentary elections on May 11th will determine whether the country will accept conditions for a free visa regime with the Union. Rehn predicted the vote will be a battle between President Boris Tadic's pro-Western Democratic Party and the nationalist Radical Party.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Doris Pack, head of the European Parliament's committee for Southeast Europe, praised the conduct of the 5 July parliamentary elections in Macedonia, in an interview broadcast on Deutsche Welle's Macedonian-language programme Thursday (13 July). She suggested that the lack of serious incidents, particularly among ethnic Albanian groups, signals their willingness to restore dialogue. Pack also expressed optimism as regards prospects for forming a new multiethnic government and for co-operation between VMRO-DPMNE -- winner of the vote -- and ethnic Albanian parties. Negotiations aimed at forming a new ruling coalition continue in Skopje. (Vecer, Makfax - 14/07/06; A1 TV - 13/07/06)

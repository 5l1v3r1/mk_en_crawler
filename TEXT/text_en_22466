SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The lower house of parliament adopted a key police reform package Thursday (April 10th) that was four years in the making and is considered the main requirement for signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU. During the session, lawmakers rejected all three proposals submitted by the ruling coalition parties. They held an emergency session in the evening to discuss a fourth draft prepared with the help of High Representative Miroslav Lajcak. In the end, it passed by a vote of 22 to 19, with one abstention. The measure moves next to the upper house, where approval is expected. 
The new draft does not envision the merger of Republika Srpska and Federation of BiH police but stipulates the establishment of seven panels to co-ordinate and supervise police work. In addition, some activities such as training or forensics would be integrated. The Dnevni Avaz newspaper reports that the SAA signing may occur in late May, to provide time to translate documents.

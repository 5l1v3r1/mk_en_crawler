SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Ramiz Delalic, a mob figure and former commander of the ninth motorised brigade of the Bosnian Muslim army, was shot to death Wednesday night (June 27th) in Sarajevo. Delalic was often referred to as the man who started the BiH conflict. In March 1992, he shot at a Serbian wedding party in Sarajevo, killing one of the guests, Nikola Gardovic. Delalic's own murder reportedly stemmed from his mob connections. 
In other news Wednesday, representatives of the Serbian and BiH military intelligence services met in Sarajevo for the first time. The aim is to strengthen co-operation between the two institutions. (Nezavisne Novine, Dnevni Avaz - 29/06/07; RTRS, NTV Hayat, PBS, AKI - 28/06/07)

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday (9 May) that a UN plan on the reunification of Cyprus could continue to serve as the basis for negotiations, but that any future solution should be based on keeping the island's two ethnic groups apart. "In Cyprus, there are two peoples which are in every way equal, with separate language and religion, two separate democracies and two separate states. Peace efforts on Cyprus should be based on these realities," he said. He went on to express his government's willingness to lift restrictions on trade with the Greek part of Cyprus, and called on Greece to do the same in respect to northern Cyprus.
As a gesture of goodwill, Erdogan went to greet Greek Cypriots waiting on a line to get into the Turkish part of the island. About 300,000 people have crossed the UN-patrolled line since the Turkish Cypriot leadership lifted travel restrictions last month. The leadership decided on Friday to open two more border checkpoints and to allow visitors to use their cellular phones in the north. It also pledged to create scholarships for Greek Cypriot students in Turkish Cypriot universities. Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos rejected the new measures, saying they were designed to perpetuate the division of the island. (AP, Reuters, NTV, Anadolu Agency, AFP - 09/05/03)

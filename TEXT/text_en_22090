SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Negotiations on personnel and structural changes in the cabinet begin officially Wednesday (April 16th). On Tuesday, Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev met with leaders of his ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and announced that outgoing Interior Minister Rumen Petkov will head up the BSP team in talks. Petkov resigned on Sunday over a major scandal involving ministry officials, including himself. 
Consultations among the ruling coalition partners, the BSP, the National Movement for Stability and Progress and the Movement for Rights and Freedom, are expected to end sometime next week. (Dnevnik, Sega, Trud - 16/04/08; Actualno, BGNES - 15/04/08)

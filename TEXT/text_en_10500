SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) on Sunday (17 October) welcomed the submission of the Srebrenica Commission's final report to the Republika Srpska (RS) government last week. In a statement, the OHR said the document, which is to be endorsed by the RS cabinet and forwarded to the BiH Constitutional Court's Commission for Human Rights, should complement a report issued in June. The OHR, however, noted that premature comments on the report's contents would violate the confidentiality of the judicial process and might jeopardise progress achieved thus far. 
In other news, local media reported that RS police searched on Saturday for former Bosnian Serb commander Ljubomir Borovcanin but failed to find him. The UN war crimes tribunal has indicted him for crimes stemming from the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. (Nezavisne novine - 18/10/04; Fena, PBS BiH - 17/10/04; PBS BiH, RTRS - 16/10/04)

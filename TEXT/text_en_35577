SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- French football legend Michel Platini opened a football centre in the northern Bosnian town of Orasje on Tuesday (8 June). It was built with a 327,000-euro grant from football's governing body, FIFA, as part of its "Goal" project. The programme started in 1999 and is aimed at helping financially strapped football associations build headquarters, lay grass pitches and establish technical training centres. (AFP - 08/06/04)

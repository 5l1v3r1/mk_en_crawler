BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Nebojsa Covic urged caution in responding to recent attacks in the southern part of the country. His remarks came after gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons on a police patrol near the village of Konculj on Friday (15 August). It was the third shooting incident on the Kosovo border in the past week. Covic warned that the authorities should not be drawn into retaliation.
Across the border in Kosovo, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic joined 1,000 mourners at the funeral of Pantelija Dakic, 11, and Ivan Jovovic, 19, who were slain by gunmen last week. After his meeting with UNMIK's new chief, Harri Holkeri, Zivkovic expressed hope that the UN administration would end violence in the province. Holkeri has vowed to bring the killers to justice.
On Saturday, Zivkovic told Prague-based Radio Free Europe that the return of Serbia-Montenegro's security forces to Kosovo would be no solution to the problems in the area. He said many alternative options are available. (AFP, Tanjug, B92 - 16/08/03; ATA - 15/08/03)

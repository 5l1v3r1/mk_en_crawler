PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- NATO's peacekeeping force in Kosovo said Saturday (20 March) that there had been no new reports of violence in the past 24 hours. As NATO poured more forces into Kosovo, KFOR troops sealed off the town of Mitrovica and set up checkpoints on all roads leading into Pristina to prevent the resumption of interethnic fighting. Last week, at least 28 people were killed in clashes, and over 600 injured, including 61 KFOR soldiers. The peacekeepers have reopened the road between Pristina and Skopje. Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova declared Monday a day of mourning for the victims, as Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi expressed "profound disturbance" over the number of dead and injured and the destruction of property. Serbia has declared Sunday a day of mourning. On Saturday, Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Boris Tadic warned that the threat of unrest persists in Kosovo and Metohija. The Pristina and Uzice Corps are at the highest level of combat readiness. (AFP, CBC, AP, Reuters, CNN, BBC, Beta, Tanjug - 20/03/04)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- A visit to the Pentagon last week focused on ways to boost bilateral co-operation and exchanges of expertise, General Zdravko Ponos, deputy chief of the Serbian Army's General Staff, said Friday (30 June). He was the institution's first representative to visit the Pentagon in 20 years. Ponos said US officials confirmed their readiness for partnership as well as their support for reforms in the Serbian defence system.
In other news, Miroslav Lajcak, the EU's mediator during Montenegro's recent independence referendum, says the Union is considering measures to assist Serbia in the wake of the split. He told International Radio Serbia that the assistance would be aimed at improving the situation in Serbia and boosting its European integration prospects. He denied reports by some Belgrade media that the aid would in any way attempt to influence Serbia's position on Kosovo's future status. (Danas, RTS, Beta - 01/07/06)

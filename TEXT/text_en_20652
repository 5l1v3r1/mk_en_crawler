BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian Orthodox Bishop Filaret will be allowed to enter Montenegro supervised for the purpose of conducting religious ceremonies. The announcement came after a surprise meeting between Montenegrin Foreign Minister Milan Rocan and his Serbian counterpart, Vuk Jeremic, in Podgorica on Saturday (September 8th). Previously, Filaret had been banned from Montenegro due to allegations that he has helped war criminals evade justice. The issue had led to increased tensions between Serbia and Montenegro.

BUCHAREST. Romania -- Social Democratic Party (PSD) Deputy President Mihai Tanasescu urged Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu on Thursday (March 8th) to present a new cabinet structure by next week. Tanasescu said that if the prime minister does not act, PSD would introduce a vote of no-confidence in the cabinet. Administration and Internal Affairs Minister Vasile Blaga said that the prime minister needs to propose the new cabinet, and only after that, the governing coalition partners will debate the proposal. Earlier this week, Tariceanu said that cabinet restructuring project was no longer a priority because the country has other issues to focus on. (Nine O'clock - 09/03/07; Mediafax - 08/03/07)

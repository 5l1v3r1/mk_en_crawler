SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgarian Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev submitted an official request Friday (7 April) to the Parliament to lift the immunity of seven deputies, on various charges. Five of the cases involve representatives of the ruling coalition parties -- NMS II deputy Yordan Kostadinov, Socialist Party members Ivan Dakov and Stoyan Ivanov, and Movement for Rights and Freedoms members Yuxel Hatib and Fidel Beev. In the sixth case, Vladimir Kouzov of the ultranationalist Attack party is accused of paedophilia. The seventh involves alleged misuse of powers by the former head of the National Investigation Service, Atanas Atanasov, an incumbent MP from the Democrats for Strong Bulgaria. Later on Friday, Kouzov and Atanasov separately announced that they would give up their immunity themselves. (24 Chasa, Sega - 08/04/06; Nova TV, Mediapool - 07/04/06)

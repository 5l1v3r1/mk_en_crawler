SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnia and Herzegovina became the third Balkan country after Romania and Albania to sign an agreement with the United States that would prevent it from extraditing US nationals to the newly established International Criminal Court. US Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz attended the signing ceremony on Friday (16 May). US Ambassador Clifford Bond told reporters that the treaty would make it possible for military co-operation between the two countries to continue so that BiH could be admitted to NATO's Partnership for Peace programme. The European Commission in Sarajevo voiced regret over the decision by the BiH government. (BiH Radio - 17/05/03; AP, Reuters, AFP, BBC - 16/05/03)

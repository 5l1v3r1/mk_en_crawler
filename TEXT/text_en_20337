SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The largest private companies on Monday (February 11th) opposed the government's plans to establish a new energy holding that would unite all current energy assets under state ownership. The decision to merge five state-owned utilities by year's end was announced by Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev after a weekend meeting of the ruling coalition. The future holding will include Mini Maritca Iztok, the Maritca Iztok II thermal power plant, the Kozloduy nuclear power plant, the National Electricity Company, and Bulgargaz Holding. Stanishev explained that energy-sector consolidation is a trend in the EU and Bulgaria should embrace it to remain competitive. (BTA, BGNES, Dir.bg - 11/02/08; Klasa - 10/02/08)

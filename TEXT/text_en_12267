BUCHAREST, Romania -- Luxembourg's representative to Romania, Fernand Kartheiser, said Wednesday (12 January) that Bulgaria and Romania would probably seal the EU Accession Treaty on 25 April, if all goes as scheduled. Karteiser, who was discussing the priorities of Luxembourg's ongoing EU presidency, added that the EU would seek to ensure that Sofia and Bucharest were provided a fair share of EU funding in the first six years after accession.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian Parliament decided on Thursday (13 April) to lift immunity for Goran Kljajevic, president of the Belgrade commercial court, and Delinka Djurdjevic, a judge at that court, so they can remain in custody. The pair and seven other people, including lawyers, bank executives and a police inspector, were arrested Wednesday on suspicion of membership in an organised crime group. Police are providing no other details.
In other news Thursday, Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic announced that his cabinet had adopted a declaration affording Serbian citizens the same rights they currently enjoy, apart from the right to vote, if Montenegro becomes an independent state. A referendum on independence is to be held next month. (Danas, Politika - 14/04/06; B92, RTS, Beta - 13/04/06)

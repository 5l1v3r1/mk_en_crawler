BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica criticised EU plans to send a mission to Pristina, accusing the Union on Thursday (January 3rd) of complicity in an attempt to grab Serbian territory. Belgrade, he warned, would not sign a long-awaited Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Brussels later this month, if the EU mission is dispatched to Kosovo to replace UNMIK. According to Kostunica, "We have come to the point where the EU must make a choice whether it wants the entire and internationally recognised Serbia as its partner, or if it wants to create a quasi-state on Serbia's territory."
Separately Thursday, in an interview with Pristina daily Koha Ditore Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu said that if the international community allows a partition of the province, it would open a Pandora's box in the Balkans, with repercussions in Macedonia, Montenegro and in some southern Serbian municipalities.

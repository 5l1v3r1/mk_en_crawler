PARIS, France -- Ten Romanian police officers are arriving in Paris on Monday (September 20th) as part of a programme to strengthen police co-operation amid France's decision to repatriate Romanian and Bulgarian Roma back to their homelands. The police mission will last three months and may be extended, according to the foreign ministry in Bucharest, which added that France requested the deployment. Romania and France agreed on September 9th to put an end to polemics stemming from the deportations and to boost co-operation in efforts to integrate the Roma. (AFP, Mediafax, Novinite - - 19/09/10)

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Four people died Sunday (2 April) in separate incidents in Turkey. According to media reports, a group of 15 masked men -- believed to be Kurds -- attacked a bus in Istanbul's Bagcilar district, breaking its windows and throwing Molotov cocktails inside. Three people died and two were seriously injured. Elsewhere in Istanbul, a group of about 200 protesters torched a truck and scuffled with police and local residents.
In the southeastern town of Kizilteppe, meanwhile, a 22-year-old Kurdish man was killed by gunfire. The violence took place amid continued clashes between supporters of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party and Turkish security forces across the country. The riots have claimed nine lives to date.

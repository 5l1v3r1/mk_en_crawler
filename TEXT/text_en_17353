STRASBOURG, France -- Romanian lawmakers walked out of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly on Thursday (June 28th) to protest a report that the CIA had operated secret prisons in Romania with the consent of some local leaders. The ten-member Romanian delegation said it would not participate in any Assembly sessions until the official who prepared the report, Switzerland's Dick Marty, visits Romania to check his evidence on-site. They say the report undermines the Assembly's credibility. (epa, FRE/RE, AP - 28/06/07)

OSLO, Norway -- A court in Norway on Wednesday (August 27th) began hearing the trial of Bosnian Muslim Mirsad Repak who is charged with war crimes. Repak, a former member of the Croatian defence forces, allegedly committed crimes against humanity, war crimes, rape, imprisonment and torture against 18 Serb civilians in a prison camp in Dretelj, southern Bosnia, between May and October 1992. The defendant pleaded not guilty, saying he had been only following orders. This is the first war crimes case conducted in Norway since World War II. (Tanjug, B92, AFP, Reuters, BBC - 27/08/08)

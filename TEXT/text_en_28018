TIRANA, Albania -- The government is launching an effort to block the use of mobile phones in prisons across the country. At the suggestion of the interior ministry, the cabinet decided on Wednesday (April 21st) to earmark funds for a system that would prevent mobile networks from reaching prison cells. The government believes that over the years, gang leaders serving time have continued to direct illegal activities from behind bars. (Lajmifundit, Shekulli, Ora News, Top Channel - 21/04/10)

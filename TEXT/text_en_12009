BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The OSCE Ambassador to Serbia-Montenegro, Maurizio Massari, is urging Serbian authorities to resolve the problem of non co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, warning the issue can no longer be delayed. His statement Saturday (15 January) followed word that Washington was imposing new sanctions against Belgrade because of its failure to co-operate with the tribunal. 
In other news, Serbia's chief prosecutor for war crimes, Vladimir Vukcevic, announced Sunday that his office plans to launch a special probe this year into crimes committed in Kosovo. The investigation would be related to mass graves discovered in Batajnica, Perucac and Petrovo Selo. Nearly 900 bodies have been exhumed from the sites.

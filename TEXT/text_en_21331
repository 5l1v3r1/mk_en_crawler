THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Tuesday (August 26th) postponed the trial of Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj until the appeals chamber rules on a prosecution motion. Prosecutors insist that Seselj, who has demanded the right to conduct his own defence, should have an official attorney representing him. Seselj reiterated on Tuesday that if this happens, he will not participate in the trial. Prosecutor Darryl Mandis said on Tuesday that the trial cannot continue until "the questions of witness intimidation have been answered and until the question of a defender is solved". The postponement occurred despite an earlier decision by the trial chamber not to delay the proceedings, which were due to continue Tuesday. (Beta, B92, RTS - 26/08/08)

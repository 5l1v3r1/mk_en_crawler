ATHENS, Greece -- European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Thursday (April 29th) that talks among the EU, IMF and the Greek government on a 45 billion euro aid package would be concluded within days. He added that all eurozone members are working on procedures to allow them to provide Greece with assistance. EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said the funding will be conditioned on Greece "implementing decisions required to meet conditions of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms". 
Meanwhile, Vassilis Papadimitriou, a spokesman for Greek Prime Minister Papandreou, said on Thursday that Greece may need as much as 120 billion euros in aid over a period of three years. (CNN, Xinhua, AFP, Wall Street Journal, AP - 29/04/10)

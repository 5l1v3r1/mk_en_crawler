BUCHAREST, Romania -- An appeals court in Bucharest decided on Wednesday (September 8th) to release Craiova Mayor Antonie Solomon, who was arrested six months ago, ahead of his corruption trial. Solomon must remain in Craiova pending the start of legal proceedings against him later this month. He was arrested on March 3rd on suspicion of forgery and accepting bribes. According to local media reports, he took a 50,000-euro bribe from a local businessman in exchange for a permit to build a supermarket. After Solomon's arrest, he was suspended from the mayoral post, which he'd held for six years. (Evenimentul Zilei, Jurnalul National, Adevarul - 09/09/10; Hotnews.ro, AP - 08/09/10)

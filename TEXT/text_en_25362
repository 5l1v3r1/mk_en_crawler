ATHENS, Greece -- One person died and another is missing after torrential rains flooded roads, towns and rural land throughout the country Sunday (October 25th). The body of a 41-year-old man was pulled from the Aegean Sea near the central city of Volos. He drowned after his boat capsized. Rescue teams, fire-fighters and police officers are searching for a 46-year-old taxi driver whose cab was found in the Pieria region, which was hardest hit by the floods. Ten people were rescued from cars washed into the river. Heavy rains will continue through Monday. (Reuters, ANA-MPA - 25/10/09)

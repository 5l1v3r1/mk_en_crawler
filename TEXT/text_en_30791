PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Representatives of the European Parliament say Kosovo should exert more efforts to build democracy, a recommendation that follows the need for a partial revote of the December 12th general snap elections. European Parliament members Ulrike Lunacek and Jutta Steinruck said on Monday (January 10th) that both votes -- on December 12th and January 9th -- were marred by manipulations and that the elections seriously damaged Kosovo's image. "These elections were not in line with international standards," Lunacek said. 
The MEPs expressed concern over what they saw in Skenderaj/Srbica and Drenas/Gllogovac, including voter intimidation. At a Pristina press conference, they called for urgent and serious election reform and the prosecution of all identified as fraud perpetrators.
Outgoing Prime Minister Hashim Thaci has a different view, saying on Monday the process was peaceful and in compliance with free and democratic elections. (Koha Ditore, Zeri, Kosova Sot, Express, Lajm - 11/01/11)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- A team of World Health Organisation (WHO) experts was scheduled to meet on Friday (26 May) with representatives of the Romanian National Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Agency. The talks follow an earlier teleconference that focused on ways to inform the public about bird flu prevention. According to Victor Olsavszky, the WHO Office representative in Romania, the experts "deem the re-emergence of the second avian flu outbreak in Romania a unique case since it has spread very fast, faster than in the endemic areas".
On Thursday, 11 new cases were discovered among birds, including one in Bucharest, raising the number to 56 in 12 days. On Friday, neighbouring Bulgaria began banning the import of live domestic and exotic birds, eggs and bird meat produced in Romania.
In other news, the Romanian government decided on Thursday to establish a permanent group to administer EU funds. The group will include representatives of the public, political parties, academic organisations and the media. Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said the success of EU accession depends on the proper administration of billions in European funds. (Rompres, Mediafax, BTA - 25/05/06)

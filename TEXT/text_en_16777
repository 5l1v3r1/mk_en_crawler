ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia will most probably be the next country to join the EU after Bulgaria and Romania, but accession will not take place before the end of this decade, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Tuesday (6 June). Croatian authorities have cited EU entry in 2009 as the country's official target. 
In other news Tuesday, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader denounced calls by the opposition for the resignation of Parliament Speaker Vladimir Seks. He was asked to step down by Social Democratic Party (SDP) leader Ivica Racan and Croatian Peasants' Party (HSS) leader Josip Friscic after being implicated in an investigation into alleged war crimes against Serbian civilians in Osijek in 1991. Sanader repeated his support for Seks, adding the opposition is only trying to reap political gains. (Vecernji List - 07/06/06, HINA, Focus, Index - 06/06/06)

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The prosecutor's office in the city of Arnhem plans to launch an investigation into the actions of Dutch peacekeeping forces in Srebrenica during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict, media reported on Friday (August 20th). The catalyst was a complaint filed by relatives of Srebrenica massacre victims. The relatives seek responsibility from former Commander Thom Karremans, his deputy Rob Franken and second-in-command Berend Oosterveen for failing to protect the civilians. Dutch soldiers serving within the UN peacekeeping mission failed to prevent the killings of an estimated 8,000 Bosniak men and boys by Bosnian Serb forces. The enclave was a UN-declared safe haven at the time. (Radio Netherlands, DutchNews, MIA - 20/08/10)

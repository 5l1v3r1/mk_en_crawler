BUCHAREST, Romania -- Meeting with prefects Wednesday (9 February), Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu urged continued restructuring, reduction of bureaucracy and other EU-related reforms. He also declared that he would not tolerate any new local tycoons, adding that these were prevalent during the preceding administration. 
Meanwhile, the director of Romania's public TV channel SRTV, Valentin Nicolau, tendered his resignation to parliament Wednesday. A probe by the state television ethics board confirmed there had been bias towards the former administration over the past few years. (Nine o'clock - 10/02/05; Rompres - 09/02/05)

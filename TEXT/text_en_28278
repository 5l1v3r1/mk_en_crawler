TIRANA, Albania -- The main opposition Socialist Party (SP) says it plans to hold more protests against the government and in support of "revealing the truth about the 2009 general elections". The decision, backed on Sunday (April 18th) at the party's congress, came less than two months after the SP ended a complete boycott of parliament staged for months over the government's refusal to open ballot boxes and investigate the June 2009 elections. "We will continue to protests to give freedom to the people, not tyranny," SP leader Edi Rama said on Sunday. They will start on April 30th. The SP also presented a strategy to strengthen the economy. (Shekulli, BBC, Lajmifundit, Top Channel - 18/04/10)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police arrested ten alleged members of a human trafficking group Wednesday (April 8th). The operation against the international ring, which police launched last October, involved simultaneous raids at several locations around the country. Investigators say the group smuggled Chinese citizens to EU countries by way of Serbia, Macedonia and Greece. Criminal groups from these countries reportedly had links with each other. Depending on their role and type of work, members of the group allegedly made between 100 and 1,700 euros for each illegal immigrant. (B92, Studio B - 08/04/09)

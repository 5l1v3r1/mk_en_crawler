BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania will enforce a new policy on transit visas starting Friday (July 11th), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced. Authorities will introduce a simplified legal framework for foreigners crossing Romania. Third-country citizens will be able to cross Romania without a transit visa within five days, if they have one of the three types of visas described by the Schengen Agreement -- a uniform visa, a long-stay visa or a stay permit.

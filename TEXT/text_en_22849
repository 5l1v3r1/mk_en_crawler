PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Any future dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade should be held at an inter-state level, the Kosovo government reiterated on Sunday (July 6th). "Neither UNMIK nor Serbia has a say on Kosovo -- only the citizens," Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said. Kuci's remarks came just ahead of UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier's visit to northern Kosovo and Belgrade. Zannier is expected to visit Belgrade this week to talk about reconfiguring UNMIK. 
In other news, no dualism will exist between EULEX and UNMIK in Kosovo, EU security chief Javier Solana's spokeswoman, Christina Gallach, said Sunday. The responsibilities of EULEX will become evident upon its full deployment, and policymakers will co-ordinate the missions based on UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's proposal, she said.

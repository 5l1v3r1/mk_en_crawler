SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Security Minister Barisa Colak says BiH authorities are checking into media reports of terrorist recruiting in the country. A number of reports have said that terrorist organisations are attempting to lure young Bosniaks, who could potentially blend into Western societies more easily than Middle Eastern counterparts. On Tuesday (25 April), the daily Dnevni avaz quoted Colak as saying efforts are also under way to revise decisions that granted citizenship to foreigners during and after the BiH conflict. 
Also Tuesday, an elite unit of the BiH State Information and Protection Agency (SIPA) held a drill in Lukavica simulating the capture of dangerous criminals. During a ceremony afterwards, the United States donated $200,000 worth of equipment to SIPA. (Dnevni avaz - 26/04/06; RTRS, Dnevni avaz - 25/04/06)

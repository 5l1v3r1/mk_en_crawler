PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Torrential rains have driven the River Drina to its highest level in 100 years, prompting officials in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro to declare flood emergencies in areas near the river. The Montenegrin Defence Ministry has asked NATO and the EU for help. "We are a young system and we don't have sufficient means to deal with such catastrophes," the chief of the army's General Staff, Dragan Samardzic, said on Saturday (December 4th). More than 2,000 people have been evacuated from their homes so far, with the situation being worst in Ulcinj, Zeta and around Lake Skadar. 
Albania, battling its own worst floods in a century, sought NATO's assistance as well. Defence Minister Arben Imami said on Saturday the country needs helicopters and trucks to help evacuate people from the Skadar region and other parts of the country. According to the latest information, over 10,000 people have been evacuated and thousands of houses and other buildings have been flooded.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- In a radio interview Monday (December 21st), Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said Transport Minister Bozidar Kalmeta may be dismissed over a railway incident earlier in the day that left nearly 60 passengers injured. Kalmeta has said he may submit his resignation because of the incident, in which a train failed to stop and hit a buffer at Zagreb's main railway station. The minister recently survived a no-confidence motion filed by the biggest opposition Social Democratic Party, over alleged fraud at Croatian Motorways (HAC), the biggest highway operator.

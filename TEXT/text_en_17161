SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The US Ambassador to Sarajevo, Douglas McElhaney, has ruled out the possibility of any referendum talks in BiH, stressing that the country must focus on reforms and preparations for the October general elections. In separate press interviews published in Thursday's (1 June) editions of Dnevni avaz and Nezavisne novine, he said that Washington has a clear stance on the issue: that BiH is a sovereign state, whose status already has been determined. Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik recently suggested an independence referendum for RS, similar to the one held in Montenegro. 
Principal Deputy High Representative Lawrence Butler also excluded any independence referendum for RS, stressing it would run counter to the Dayton Peace Accords and the BiH Constitution. During a visit to Banja Luka, he warned that any attempt to hold such a poll would be sanctioned by the Office of the High Representative.

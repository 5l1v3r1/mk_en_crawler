BUCHAREST, Romania -- Varujan Vosganian, a senator nominated to serve as Romania's European commissioner after accession in January, has withdrawn his candidacy. He decided to pull out after EU top officials declined to back him amid allegations that he once served as a Securitate informer. Though he rejected the accusations as "baseless", Vosganian said he did not want to damage Romania's image. Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu has accepted that decision and appears ready to consult with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso before naming a new candidate.

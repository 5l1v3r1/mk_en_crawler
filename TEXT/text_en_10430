ATHENS, Greece -- Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis said in an interview published Wednesday (20 October) that his country did not alter its budget figures to get admitted into the Eurozone. He explained that while errors in reporting pension fund revenues and military spending had resulted in deflated budget deficit figures, the government was confident that the shortfall did not exceed the EU's three per cent ceiling during the pre-2000 period. "Greece didn't cheat," he said. "Our view is that there were statistical weaknesses which have now been corrected. We want to start over with a clean slate." (FT - 20/10/04)

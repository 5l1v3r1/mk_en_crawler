SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown says he will decide on measures against Republika Srpska (RS) after a four-day session of the Police Restructuring Commission ends on Wednesday (15 December). Ashdown said on Friday that he would take into account confirmation from both NATO and the UN war crimes tribunal that RS has failed to co-operate with Hague prosecutors. As the police reform panel's final session opened in Sarajevo on Sunday, Ashdown again urged the establishment of a single police structure in BiH.

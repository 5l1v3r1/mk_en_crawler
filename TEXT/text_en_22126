SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski said on Wednesday (September 17th) that talks aimed at resolving the long-standing name dispute between Macedonia and Greece might undergo a yearlong freeze if the countries fail to reach a compromise within weeks. Crvenkovski said this in turn could hinder Macedonia's NATO and EU membership bids. Talks are in a crucial phase, he warned in an interview with Reuters. Both countries will have elections during the first half of 2009 and the election atmosphere will not be suitable for overcoming disagreements on the issue, he added. (Reuters, Netpress - 17/09/08)

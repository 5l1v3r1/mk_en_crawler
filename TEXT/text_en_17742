SOFIA, Bulgaria -- European Parliament (EP) President Hans-Gert Poettering said Friday (June 22nd) that the EU remains committed to resolving the case of six medics â five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor who has been granted Bulgarian citizenship â who face death sentences in Libya for allegedly infecting hundreds of children with HIV. Poettering spoke on Bulgarian National Radio following reports -- denied by both Brussels and Sofia -- that an agreement had been struck between the EU and the families of the children. Poettering said efforts are continuing. 
On Friday, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin acknowledged the talks had taken on a certain "dynamics" lately, but a deal remains elusive. The Libyan Supreme Court is expected to rule on a final appeal next month. (Monitor, Sega - 23/06/07; BNR - 22/06/07)

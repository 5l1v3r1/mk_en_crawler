THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The defence phase of Slobodan Milosevic's trial was due to start in The Hague on Monday (5 July), but a lawyer who advises the former Yugoslav leader has indicated that Milosevic's ongoing health problems -- particularly high blood pressure -- will prompt a delay. Milosevic plans to call more than 1,000 witnesses, but the judges are likely to reduce that number, as they did with the prosecution during the first phase.

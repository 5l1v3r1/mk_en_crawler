SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government has until June 9th to respond to Greece, regarding the complaint Skopje filed with The Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ) for Greece allegedly violating a bilateral agreement, local media reported on Wednesday (March 17th). Macedonia filed its complaint in November 2008, accusing Greece of breaching a 1995 interim agreement by blocking Skopje's NATO entry bid during the Alliance's Bucharest summit. Under the accord, Athens "agrees not to object" to Macedonia's application for membership in international organisations and institutions that refer to it as the Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia. Greece filed its counter-arguments on January 19th. (MIA, Makfax, A1, MRT - 17/03/10)

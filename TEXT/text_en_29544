PRISTINA, Kosovo -- An independent commission reviewing school textbooks concludes that Serb students in Kosovo learn only one side of history, which does not promote peace and tolerance. The commission announced on Thursday (September 30th) that the students, despite living in Kosovo, are taught that Kosovo is part of Serbia. They also are taught that Albanians committed genocide against Serbs but learn nothing about the 1999 conflict, and are taught songs and poetry that contain hateful language. The commission concluded that such textbooks are incompatible with the Kosovo Constitution and should be replaced with ones that promote tolerance and emphasise a European future for the Balkans.

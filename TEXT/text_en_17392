TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament failed again on Wednesday (June 27th) to elect a successor to President Alfred Moisiu, again due to a lack of officially submitted candidates. The ruling and opposition parties have been unable to agree on a consensus nominee, despite several days of talks in Tirana. (Kohajone, Shekulli, Shqip - 28/06/07; Top-Channel, Balkanweb - 27/06/07)

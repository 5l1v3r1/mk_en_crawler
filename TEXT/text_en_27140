BELGRADE, Serbia -- The IMF is allowing Serbia to expand its budget deficit to 4.5% of GDP this year, up from the initial target of 3%, IMF team head Albert Jaeger told a press conference in Belgrade on Tuesday (September 1st). He added that the IMF expects Serbia's economy to contract by 4% this year, compared to the initial forecast of a 2% decline, but to rebound to a growth of 1.5% in 2010. Jaeger also announced that an IMF team will visit again in October to decide on the disbursement of the second and third tranches, under the 2.9 billion-euro loan.

TIRANA, Albania -- The Greek Defence Ministry, the Greek army's general staff and the Greek Embassy in Tirana condemned on Monday (March 5th) a video that surfaced on the internet late last week, showing Greek soldiers singing a song with offensive references to Albanians and Turks. Officials in Tirana describe it as "unacceptable, condemnable and scandalous" behaviour, while Greek authorities insist that it does not reflect "the feelings of Greek people" towards their neighbour. The issue triggered an incident Monday, with two people detained by police in the Albanian town of Fier for allegedly setting a Greek flag on fire.
In other news Monday, Albania's ruling Democratic Party officially named one of its senior officials, Bamir Topi, as its presidential candidate. Incumbent Alfred Moisiu's term ends in June. (Albanian News, Naftemporiki - 06/03/07; Focus, Makfax - 05/03/07)

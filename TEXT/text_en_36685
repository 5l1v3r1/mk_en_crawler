SALZBURG, Austria -- Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel says he thinks the countries of Southeast Europe could join the EU within ten years. His comment, reported in Thursday's (29 July) EU Observer, followed meetings in Salzburg with the prime ministers of seven Balkan countries. Schuessel's prediction was supported by Erhard Busek, the special co-ordinator of the Stability Pact, who said the Union has no alternative but to expand in Southeast Europe. While Romania and Bulgaria are set to join the EU in 2007, accession prospects for the other EU aspirants in the region are less clear. (EU Observer - 29/07/04)

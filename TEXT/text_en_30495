PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Numerous irregularities that marred the December 12th snap elections are expected to prompt another round of voting in three municipalities, local media reported on Thursday (December 16th). The Central Election Commission (CEC) said the decision will be announced after the complaints and alleged violations are thoroughly investigated. Sources inside the CEC say voting in about 70% of the polling stations in three municipalities -- Skenderaj/Srbica, Drenas/Glogovac and Decan/Decane -- will have to be repeated in January. In a press release Wednesday, Pieter Feith, head of the International Civilian Office, congratulated the public for participating in a calm and orderly manner, but added that serious allegations of fraud are cause for concern. 
Meanwhile, the party that came in second Sunday -- the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) -- wants voting repeated throughout Kosovo, claiming serious irregularities occurred in at least seven municipalities. LDK leader Isa Mustafa also criticised international representatives for failing to react appropriately. He is calling for the establishment of a provisional technical government.

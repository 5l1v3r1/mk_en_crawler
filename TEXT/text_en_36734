BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski met on Sunday (25 July) with EU security chief Javier Solana to discuss the power decentralisation package, which parliament is scheduled to begin debating Monday. Under the planned decentralisation, some municipality boundaries would be redrawn to make Albanians within them a majority. This would give them greater control over local affairs. But opponents of the plan say it will divide the country along ethnic lines and give too much power to Albanians. Solana praised Crvenkovski's efforts to unite parties around the decentralisation laws and stressed their passage and implementation would mean a serious step forward in Macedonia's EU integration efforts. Crvenkovski will next meet with NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer; their talks will focus on the conclusions drawn at last month's Alliance summit in Istanbul.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- US Ambassador to Kosovo Christopher Dell condemned an election- related incident on Wednesday (November 11th) in Decan/Decani, western Kosovo, where vehicles escorting Prime Minister Hashim Thaci were pelted with rocks. The area is considered solidly in favour of Ramush Haradinaj of the opposition Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK). Dell urged both Thaci's Democratic Party and the AAK to refrain from violence. "Neither ... can justify violence in the name of democracy," he said. Police have arrested three suspects in connection with the incident.

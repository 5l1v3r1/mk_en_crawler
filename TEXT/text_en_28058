ATHENS, Greece -- The Supreme Court on Wednesday (October 20th) reversed the guilty verdicts of six top politicians and soldiers who were executed in 1922 for their alleged role in Greece's loss of the 1919-1922 war against Turkey. Former Prime Minister Petros Protopapadakis, Dimitrios Gounaris, George Baltatzis, Nikolaos Stratos, Nikolaos Theotokis, and General Georgios Hatzianestis were convicted of high treason in 1922 for the so-called Asia Minor defeat of the Greek Army. On Wednesday, the court cleared their names, following an appeal by Protopapadakis' grandson. (AP, CNN Turk, NTV - 20/10/10)

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica and his Romanian counterpart Ion Iliescu pledged Monday (4 November) to develop political and economic co-operation, while the foreign ministers of the two nations, Goran Svilanovic and Mircea Geoana, signed an agreement on minorities. The deal was designed to protect the rights of Serbs living in southwest Romania and of Romanians and Vlachs in Serbia. Iliescu characterised the agreement as reflecting "the democratic attitude, tolerance and European spirit" of the two countries.
Meanwhile, Albania and Croatia have implemented steps in their respective visa regimes to enhance free movement. The measures, which went into effect on 1 November, include the issuance of one-year multiple-entry visas for 1,000 prominent representatives of culture, science, politics and business.

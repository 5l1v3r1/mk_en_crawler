ANKARA, Turkey -- The Supreme Court of Appeals on Tuesday (13 July) overturned a 15-year prison sentence against four former Kurdish members of parliament, including award-winning rights activist Leyla Zana. A state security court ruled in April that the four former Democracy Party deputies had collaborated with Kurdish militants. However, the appeals court found there were procedural violations, and ordered a retrial. The four were originally convicted in 1994 and have already served 10 years of their sentences. No date has been set for the new trial. (Anadolu Agency, BBC News - 14/07/04)

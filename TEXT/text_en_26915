SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Doctors in two towns went out on strike Monday (March 8th), after the health ministry failed to pay them for work in January. The action spread to other towns and cities, including Sofia, on Tuesday. The protestors also insist on health care reforms, particularly the process of referring patients for follow-up treatment. In an effort to address the issue, Prime Minister Boyko Borisov announced on Monday that the cabinet intends to raise health insurance contributions by 2% to 10% as soon as possible, rather than next year, as scheduled. The health care budget had been reduced by about 14% this year, compared to last. (Focus - 09/03/10; BNT, Standart - 08/03/10)

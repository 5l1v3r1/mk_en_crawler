ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is working to restructure and create new cabinet ministries by March 2008, to meet EU standards. Turkish media reported on Monday (November 26th) that the plan includes splitting the environment and forestry ministry and changing the name of the agriculture and rural affairs ministry to the agriculture and food ministry. The plan would also split the culture and tourism ministry, while establishing a local administration and science and technology ministries. Some of the legal groundwork reportedly has been completed, while the rest should be completed by January. The restructuring requires parliamentary approval.

TIRANA, Albania -- The European Commission (EC) expects more improvement from Albania in the rule of law and functioning of state institutions, EC spokesperson Amadeu Altafaj said on Thursday (October 15th), a day after the EU's progress report on the Western Balkans was published. Altafaj confirmed that the EC expects better results in these fields, beyond the positive steps involved in organising the June 28th elections. He added that all Western Balkan countries will join the EU when the conditions are met. 
Separately Thursday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn presented the progress report to the European Parliament. In his speech, Rehn pointed out that freedom of speech has emerged as an urgent problem this year. (Shqip, Shekulli - 16/10/09; BBC, Top Channel, Alsat - 15/10/09)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX marks its first anniversary of assisting local institutions in implementing the rule of law on Wednesday (December 9th). EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon says the mission has had a positive impact on the activities of the police, judicial and customs authorities. According to him, strengthening the rule of law is a challenging and long term process, in which the majority of work must be done by the Kosovo institutions themselves.
In other news Wednesday, the remains of five people killed during the 1999 conflict were located at a grave in the village of Bresnik, Vushtrri municipality, about 20km from Pristina. Residents had alerted UNMIK to the possibility of the grave, but it took EULEX's Office on Missing Persons and Forensics to follow up. (Kohavision, RTK, Arta, TV 21 - 08/12/09)

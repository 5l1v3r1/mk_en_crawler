TIRANA, Albania -- Council of Europe (CoE) rapporteurs David Wilshire and Jaakko Laakso presented a report to the Council on Saturday (March 28th) regarding the latest reforms in Albania. Laakso and Wilshire prepared their report after a fact-finding mission in February. The document criticised the adoption of the country's controversial new lustration law last December without broad political consensus but welcomed the government's decision to delay its implementation. The law requires all officials to undergo investigation to determine whether they co-operated with the communist-era secret services. 
In other news, the head of the European Commission delegation in Tirana, Helmut Lohan, said on Sunday that the government must guarantee more stability in public administration. He noted that the Union has provided 200m euros in aid for this. (Balkan Web, Telegrafi, BBC, News 24, Shekulli, Klan - 29/03/09)

TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu signed a bill Wednesday (11 August) providing compensation for individuals who have been persecuted politically. He did so despite protests by the opposition, as well as by groups representing people who suffered persecution under the former communist regime. The victims' groups say the measure provides insufficient compensation. Moisiu's office, however, said the president found no irregularities in the bill and saw no reason to return it to parliament.

Radovanovic has been Serbia's organised crime prosecutor and will be succeeded by Miljko Radisavljevic, Krushevatz's deputy municipal prosecutor. Addressing parliament, Justice Minister Dusan Petrovic stressed the new appointments would be crucial to the success of judicial reforms slated to begin in 2008.

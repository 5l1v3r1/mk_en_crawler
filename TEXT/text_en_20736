ZAGREB, Croatia -- Speaking after talks with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader acknowledged Friday (March 7th) that Croatia may have to give up its protected environmental fishing zone (ZERP) in order to move ahead with its EU bid. "We really have to review whether we can have both (the fishing zone and EU membership talks) and, if not, which is more important for Croatia," he told reporters. 
EU members Italy and Slovenia are directly affected by the zone and oppose it. While in Zagreb, Rehn told government leaders that the issue is "urgent" and could lead to serious delays in Croatia's accession. Sanader held a meeting on the issue Friday with Croatian Peasant Party leader Josip Friscic, and plans to meet with leaders of other parliamentary parties on Tuesday. Parliament will hold a session dedicated to the issue on Wednesday. (Vecernji List, Makfax, Javno.com - 08/03/08)

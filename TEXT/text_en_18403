NEW YORK, United States -- In a letter published Monday (April 9th) by the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity, 53 Nobel Prize winners called on Armenia and Turkey to reconcile and overcome differences stemming from the mass killings of Armenians by Turks in the early 20th century. The Nobel laureates said the Genocide Convention has never been applied retroactively and therefore cannot be used as the basis for reparations or territorial claims. They urged both governments to re-open borders and establish full diplomatic relations. 
In other news, an objection by Turkey has prompted the UN to postpone an exhibition on genocide in Rwanda that was to open on Monday. Turkey reportedly objected to text saying the Armenian killings in Turkey's predecessor state, the Ottoman Empire, contributed to the creation of the term genocide.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The Kosovo Trust Agency, the UN-administered body in charge of privatisation in Kosovo, announced on Thursday (December 28th) that it has started privatisation procedures for 23 firms. Among the inventory put up for sale are a brick manufacturing plant, 20 other plants, warehouses, a veterinary business and plots of land throughout the province. The Agency said it would aim to establish 28 new companies once the sales are finalised. Higher bids, appropriateness of investment plans, and commitments to preserve current staff levels will be the main criteria for the new owners. (Albanian News - 29/12/06; AP, Makfax - 28/12/06)

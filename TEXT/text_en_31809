BUCHAREST, Romania -- The finance ministry says foreign debt liabilities to the country totalled $2.244 billion by the end of last year. Reportedly, Iraq owes the lion's share: $1.689 billion. Sources said Monday (6 January) that the government had drafted a debt collection programme. In the case of Iraq, Washington might be tapped to support collection efforts. The government reportedly is also planning to write off nearly 90 per cent of the debt owed by developing countries under the IMF and World Bank programme for debt relief. (ACT Media - 06/01/03)

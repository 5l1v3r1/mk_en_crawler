ANKARA, Turkey -- The foreign ministry on Tuesday (June 3rd) sharply criticised France's planned referendum on the membership bids of EU candidates. Such an initiative aims to place new obstacles before Ankara's desire to join the bloc, the ministry said in a statement. Last week, French lawmakers approved an institutional reform draft bill that mandates a referendum on the EU bid of any country whose population exceeds 5% of the total population of the bloc. With its population of 70 million, Turkey would be subject to the bill. French President Nicolas Sarkozy opposes full membership for Turkey, proposing instead "privileged partner" status.

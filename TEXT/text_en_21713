ATHENS, Greece -- A court in Crete on Monday (September 22nd) issued a one-year suspended prison sentence to former government minister Yiannis Kefaloyiannis, who has been serving as an informal adviser to Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis. Kefaloyiannis was charged with attempting to obstruct a criminal investigation against a local hashish grower and of trying to persuade witnesses to commit perjury. He denies the charges and vows to appeal the verdict. Co-defendant Arkadios Spanoudakis received a six-month suspended sentence. (Vima, Makfax, Ethnos, ANA-MPA, AP - 23/09/08)

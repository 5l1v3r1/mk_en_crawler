ANKARA, Turkey -- Economy Minister and chief negotiator with the EU Ali Babacan welcomed on Friday (29 September) word of a new initiative by the Finnish EU Presidency, intended to resolve the deadlock over the Cyprus issue. The plan aims to lift the current economic sanctions against the Turkish Cypriots in exchange for Ankara opening its ports and seaports to Cypriot traffic. 
Babacan, who met with Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja in Helsinki, reiterated that Turkey would open its ports and harbours to Greek Cypriot traffic as soon as the economic isolation of the northern Turkish-occupied part of the island is lifted, as pledged by the EU.

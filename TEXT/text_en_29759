ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday (December 28th) criticised an attack on a Turkish basketball team in Cyprus. He described it as a sign of growing racism among Greek Cypriots, a trend which he said could harm efforts to settle the long-standing Cypriot issue. "Even this single incident demonstrates who favours peace and who does not want to give peace a chance on the island," Erdogan said in his weekly address to parliament. 
During the December 21st game between hosts Apoel Nicosia and Turkey's Pinar Karsiyaka, local fans threw objects at the Turkish team, came onto the court and clashed with police who were trying to restore order. Five police officers and the spokesperson for the Turkish team were injured. The International Basketball Federation slapped a 40,000 euro fine on Apoel and ordered them to play their next game behind closed doors. Erdogan criticised the penalty as insufficient.

ANKARA, Turkey -- "We want the ruling in the closure case to come as soon as possible, so that it does not harm Turkey," Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told a group of reporters on his way to Lebanon on Tuesday (May 27th). He explained that the ongoing case is taking a toll on Foreign Direct Investment, which is expected to fall to $13 billion this year, roughly half the previous estimates, due to increased political uncertainty. In February, the top prosecutor at the Court of Appeals demanded a ban on the ruling Justice and Development Party for allegedly threatening secularism. Normally, the Constitutional Court would deliver its verdict by the end of the year. However, Erdogan said the government is doing all it can to expedite the process. (Hurriyet, Zaman - 28/05/08)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Theodor Stolojan, Democratic Liberal Party (PDL) deputy leader, said on Sunday (September 20th) that the agriculture portfolio in the European Commission (EC) continues to be the country's priority, but with Austria and Ireland as competitors, Romania needs other options. Plan B would be the enlargement or research portfolios, he said. "We view enlargement as an important portfolio, politically speaking, especially in regards to Southeast Europe. Romania has great interest to support the accession of its regional peers." Similar views were voiced by Foreign Minister Cristian Diaconescu and by Leonard Orban, Romania's current EC commissioner in charge of multilingualism. (Nine o'clock - 21/09/09; Mediafax - 20/09/09)

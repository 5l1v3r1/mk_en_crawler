ANKARA, Turkey -- Constitutional Court chief Tulay Tugcu said on Wednesday (May 30th) that a criminal complaint might be filed against Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan for offending the court. At issue is a TV interview Erdogan gave on Tuesday, in which he criticised a court ruling that effectively halted presidential elections earlier this month. He called the ruling "a disgrace to the justice system". 
Tugcu fired back saying Erdogan exceeded the "boundaries of respect". The main opposition party CHP agreed, saying Erdogan deserves a harsh response. He enjoys immunity from prosecution, however, and his ruling AKP party has enough seats in Parliament to block any effort to lift that immunity.

ROME, Italy -- Foreign Minister Franco Frattini says the EU should scrap visa requirements for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) as it did for other Balkan countries. Addressing an international forum in Gorizia, on the development of the Adriatic-Balkan region Monday (March 8th), Frattini described BiH as a priority for Italy and the EU. He stressed that 15 years after the Dayton Peace Agreement, the country should be closer to the bloc. (Tanjug, Dnevni Avaz, ANSA - 08/03/10)

ANKARA, Turkey -- By a margin of about 60%, Parliament approved in the first reading Thursday (May 3rd) a constitutional amendment that lowers the minimum age for members of parliament from 30 to 25 years. After the second reading on Sunday, the amendment would be forwarded to the president for final approval. The ruling Justice and Development Party submitted another constitutional amendment to Parliament, which would allow voters to elect the president, rather than Parliament. Still unclear is when Parliament will vote on the amendment. 
Meanwhile, President Ahmet Necdet Sezer says he plans to remain in office after May 16th, when his term ends, until his successor is elected. Sezer, a former member of the Constitutional Court, said by law he must continue to fulfil presidential functions via an interim mandate.

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) wrapped up public hearings on the legality of Kosovo's independence on Friday (December 11th), clearing the way for deliberations. 
Kosovo argued that its February 2008 independence declaration did not violate UN Resolution 1244, a claim Serbia hotly disputes. 
Countries such as the United States, Bulgaria, Croatia, Albania and Saudi Arabia gave speeches in support of Kosovo's stance while countries such as Russia, China and Romania argued that independence violated international law. 
Out of the 15 judges at the court, eight are from countries that have recognised Kosovo, and seven are from those that have not. 
 "It is a fact that Kosovo is here. It is a reality", Marko Prelec, director of the International Crisis Group for the Balkans, told the Kosovo daily Koha Ditore. 
"[The] ICJ decision on Kosovo will have no meaning if Belgrade does not know what it wants to achieve with it," former Serbian Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic told the Belgrade-based daily Blic. 
"It is up to Serbia to prepare a proposal on what it wants, and in which direction to move forward," Svilanovic told Blic, as quoted by B92 RTV. "Talks on the highest levels can already begin on this topic, first and foremost with EU officials, and then with Russia and the United States." 
"The court can analyse the circumstances of the proclamation of independence, it can state its opinion about those circumstances but it cannot prescribe the policy of recognition to the countries. That is why we cannot expect too much from the advisory opinion of the court in The Hague," Slovenian President Danillo Turk, a professor of international law, told Belgrade daily Politika, as quoted by B92 RTV. 
A decision from the court is expected by mid-2010.

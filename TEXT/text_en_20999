SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak reprimanded the leader of the Party of Democratic Action (SDA), Sulejman Tihic, for deciding to pull out of police reform talks. In a statement Sunday (February 3rd), Lajcak insisted such behaviour pushes BiH backwards and threatens the country's chance of sealing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU before the end of Slovenia's EU presidency in July. Lajcak agreed with the Serb parties that blame the SDA's decision on a squabble within the Federation of BiH's ruling coalition with the other main Bosniak party, the Party for BiH.
Tihic insists the changes being drafted by the police reform taskforce are only cosmetic. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 04/02/08; RTRS - 03/02/08)

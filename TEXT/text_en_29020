STRASBOURG, France -- Macedonia is committed to resolving its longstanding name dispute with Greece, Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said in a speech to the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) in Strasbourg on Thursday (October 7th). He stressed that NATO and EU integration are the public's highest priorities, regardless of their background and ethnicity, but also stressed that this integration is hindered by the name dispute. He added that the country is dedicated to fulfilling all goals set during its 2010 chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers. Gruevski also emphasised the importance of intercultural dialogue and peaceful inter-ethnic co-existence, describing his country as "an example in Europe of how a great number of various ethnic groups live peacefully".

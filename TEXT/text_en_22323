BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Democratic Party's (DS) and the Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) parliamentary groups signed a co-operation agreement Wednesday (July 16th) to provide support for Serbia's EU integration policies and legislation. The agreement will apply particularly to judicial reforms and the bill on communications, as well as to the national security bill. The LDP announced that this would not necessarily mean closer inter-party ties since it still resents the DS for agreeing to co-operate with the Serbian Socialist Party. The LDP, though, might extend support to some legal initiatives, maybe even to the country's position on Kosovo. 
In other news Wednesday, Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic met in Paris with French counterpart Bernard Kouchner. They expressed differing opinions on Kosovo but said both want to see Serbia as part of the EU family. Kouchner described the talks as "long, clear and sincere".

TIRANA, Albania -- OSCE experts in Tirana on Wednesday (4 August) presented a report on possible measures to guarantee the independence of the Central Elections Committee (CEC). The OSCE is proposing two formulas, the first of which envisions the selection of new CEC members from scratch. The second option requires a constitutional amendment, and aims to secure a balanced representation of all political parties. Next month, the OSCE will present another report, this time focusing on preparations for the 2005 parliamentary elections. (Albanian Daily News - 05/08/04)

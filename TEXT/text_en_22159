PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The EU and Serbia are "not very far" from an agreement on the deployment of the EULEX mission in Kosovo, EULEX commander Yves de Kermabon said on Friday (October 17th). He expressed hope EULEX will deploy throughout Kosovo by the end of the winter. "We hope it will be possible to overcome the Kosovar Serb community's dislike of the idea of deploying the EU's judicial and police mission in northern Kosovo," he noted, calling the source of such opposition "a number of fanatics".
Meanwhile on Saturday, UNMIK Regional Administrator for Mitrovica Gerard Gallucci announced the UN is transferring him to its mission in East Timor. He stated, however, UNMIK's work "might not be finished for a long time to come". 
On Friday, UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier announced UNMIK has handed over its head office in Pristina to the EULEX mission. (Tanjug, Kontakt Plus - 18/10/08, AFP, Beta, B92, Makfax - 17/10/08)

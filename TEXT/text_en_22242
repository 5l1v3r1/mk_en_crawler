NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias said on Sunday (April 13th) that he is not ruling out another meeting with the leader of the Turkish community on the divided island, Mehmet Ali Talat, before Orthodox Easter on April 27th. During a speech on the sidelines of a memorial service for two members of his AKEL party who were assassinated in 1965, Christofias said he expects technical committees established between the two communities to start work this week. If this happens, he suggested open talks on the Cypriot issue could begin at the end of June. (CNA, Financial Mirror, Famagusta Gazette - 13/04/08)

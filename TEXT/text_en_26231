ZAGREB, Croatia -- Representatives of the ruling and opposition parties reached an agreement Monday (October 12th) to initiate constitutional amendments. At a meeting called by Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor, opposition leaders agreed to back the government's initiative for amendments crucial to Croatia's EU integration process. The opposition will submit its proposals for constitutional changes and a working group composed of experts from the two sides will come up with the final version. Passage requires a two-thirds majority in parliament. (HRT, HINA, Poslovni, Vjesnik - 12/10/09)

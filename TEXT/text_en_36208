SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A fire blazed late Saturday (6 March) at the Bulgarian government building, seriously injuring one fireman. Deputy Prime Minister Plamen Panayotov said authorities had launched an investigation into the causes of the fire, but added there was no reason to suspect it had been started deliberately.
Also on Saturday, Bulgarian Defence Minister Nikolay Svinarov said Bulgarian troops would be trained at a special training ground in Jordan during the last stage of their preparation for international peacekeeping operations. Svinarov made the statement on his return from a three-day visit to Jordan, where he met with Prime Minister Faisal al-Fayez, who is also the country's defence minister.

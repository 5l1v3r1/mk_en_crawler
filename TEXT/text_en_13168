ZAGREB, Croatia -- Members of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) have eased the criteria for membership, in order to expand the free trade area to other Southeast European countries, Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said Tuesday (29 November) after the CEFTA conference in Zagreb ended. Sanader explained that under the new rules, countries wishing to join CEFTA must conclude agreements on free trade with CEFTA members, must have institutionalised relations with the EU, and must have full membership in the WTO or commit themselves to respect all WTO regulations. Until now, new CEFTA aspirants were required to be WTO members and have Stabilisation and Association Agreements with the EU. (HINA, Mediapool, MIA, Makfax - 29/11/05)

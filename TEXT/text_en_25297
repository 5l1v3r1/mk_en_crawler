BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Turkey's chief negotiator with the EU, Egemen Bagis, has rejected Germany's idea of privileged partnership for Turkey, instead of full membership. After talks with EU officials in Brussels on Friday (March 26th), he told reporters that there is no such term in the EU acquis. "The privileged partnership just does not exist ... This does not have any legal basis in the EU," Bagis said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel visits Turkey on Monday and Tuesday. (Worldbulletin, AFP - 27/03/10; Anadolu news agency, Zaman - 26/03/10)

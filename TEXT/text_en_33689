SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Sulejman Tihic, a member of the BiH presidency, told BHTV 1 on Thursday (4 September) that he would continue to insist on investigations into the intelligence services and other security institutions. His statement followed allegations that resulted in Ivan Vuksic, acting director of the BiH Federation Intelligence Service, asking to be suspended from his post until the end of his trial on charges of kidnapping. Vuksic is accused of taking hostages during riots by Croat nationalists in 2001, when he served as a police officer in Mostar. Tihic says he fears some people or institutions are attempting to destabilise the country and establish a state of emergency, provoking a crisis in the national security services.

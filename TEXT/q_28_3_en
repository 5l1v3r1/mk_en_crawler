III. BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATIES 

With which countries has the Republic of Macedonia concluded bilateral investment agreements? Please provide for each agreement the following information: nature of the agreement (e. g. bilateral investment treaties, commercial co-operation agreements, other types of agreements ...), date of ratification, date of entry into force, initial term of agreement, automatic renewal procedure, period for which acquired rights exist? Please provide copies (in one of the official EU languages) and indicate clearly what are the modalities foreseen in those agreements for their amendment or termination, to bring them in line with the Community acquis. Do such agreements include a regional economic integration organisation clause (possibility to grant privileged access to investors or investments of other countries, which belong to the same regional integration organisation as the contracting party)? Which sectors are normally excluded (e.g. aviation, maritime transport, fishing, audiovisual, etc.) from such agreements? 
The Republic of Macedonia, so far has concluded 26 bilateral agreements on promotion and reciprocal protection of investments that have entered into force, 3 agreements that have been ratified by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, but still have not entered into force and 5 agreements which have been initialled by the expert teams, but have not been signed by the official state representatives.  In terms of the validity periods of the agreements, the periods vary from 10 to 20 years, which offers the opportunity for automatic renewal of the application of the agreements for another 10 to 20 years, unless a year or in some agreements six months prior to the expiry of the validity of the agreement one of the contracting parties informs the other party of its intention to cancel the agreement. The communication on the cancellation of the agreement enters into force and the agreement shall be considered cancelled upon expiry of a year and in some cases six months, from the day the other contracting party has received the communication on the cancellation of the agreement, via diplomatic channels.  In accordance with the agreements, each contracting party must provide for fair and equal treatment of investments of the investors from the other contracting party coming to its territory.  Bilateral agreements on promotion and reciprocal protection of investments in terms of their contents do not list the sectors in which there is a prohibition for non-resident entities to invest. Namely, the agreements refer to the national legislations, i.e. respect the legal restrictions applicable for certain sectors in the respective countries. The legislation of the Republic of Macedonia excludes certain sectors/activities from such agreements, such as for example the military industry, transfer and trade in arms, movement and trade in narcotics, protection of historical monuments and cultural treasures, protection of the health of people, protection of forests and waters. For more details on the existing restrictions on investments by non-resident entities, see the Table contained in 04_I_1The Agreements do not contain a clause on regional economic integration, i.e. they do not provide a possibility for granting privileged access to investors or investments of other countries, which belong to the same regional integration organization.

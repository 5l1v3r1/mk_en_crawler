PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Border police barred a Serbian delegation bound for Kamenica from entering Kosovo for failing to follow procedures, local media reported on Monday (March 23rd). Belgrade Mayor Dragan Djilas led the delegation, along with Mladen Djordjevic, Serbian President Boris Tadic's adviser. The two officials held an improvised press conference at the Konculj border checkpoint, where police barred them from entering. They told reporters that they will notify the UN Security Council, UNMIK and EULEX and will ask for an explanation of the local police's action.

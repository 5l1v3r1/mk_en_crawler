ATHENS, Greece -- The International Olympic Committee (IOC) handed Greece a tight deadline for several projects which have been plagued by delays, including completion of the Olympic stadium roof. Speaking after two days of inspections, chief IOC inspector Denis Oswald said Athens has until the end of June to complete work on the roof. The contractor had promised to finish the roof by 20 July, but will now have to change its schedule or leave the stadium unfinished. The IOC is also concerned about delays in laying the last 200 km of optic network needed to carry the television signal from the venues.
In other news, a fire broke out in a church at the historic Mt Athos Monastery southeast of Thessaloniki. The blaze was put out before it could cause serious damage to the 15th century church. The authorities said the fire might have been caused by improperly lit candles. (AP - 27/03/04; Macedonian Press Agency - 26/03/04)

DURRES, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu reiterated on Sunday (14 November) that the 2005 general elections would represent a crucial test for the country and its people. He recalled his statement last year in which he said successful and fair elections would be Albania's "passport to Europe". Speaking on the occasion of the Muslim holiday Eid al-Fitr, he called on politicians to learn more from religious tolerance, which he described as the country's biggest asset. (ATA - 14/11/04)

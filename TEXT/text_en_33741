BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic said on Friday (29 August) that dialogue is the only option for resolving the problems facing Kosovo. In that light, he stressed that new issues should not be explored; rather efforts should be made to keep the situation peaceful. He said he hoped dialogue would be started soon, focusing on specific issues that affect the daily lives of Kosovo residents.
In other news, Serbian Privatisation Minister Aleksandar Vlahovic is facing accusations of corruption. Zuzul Jelavic, an adviser to the chairman of the Zagreb-based oil corporation INA, says Vlahovic was paid to preclude a meeting that would have helped resolve property disputes between INA and the Serbian government, prior to the privatisation of Serbian oil retailer Beopetrol. Vlahovic denies any wrongdoing. (Tanjug, BBC - 31/08/03; B92 - 30/08/03)

ATHENS, Greece -- A Eurostat delegation arrived in Athens on Tuesday (12 October) to look into Greece's budget disclosures for the 1997-1999 period. They will attempt to determine whether the country actually met the relevant criteria when it was allowed to adopt the euro. Greece has made dramatic upward revisions to its budget deficit figures since 2000, admitting that it had failed to observe the EU's three-per cent mandatory deficit ceiling. 
In other news, the Greek Parliament decided Wednesday to establish a commission to investigate procurement procedures in the defence sector over the past few years. The ruling New Democracy party insists on checking deals signed by the previous PASOK-led administration. (ANA, MPA - 13/10/04; AFP - 12/10/04)

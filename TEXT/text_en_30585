LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- President Danilo Turk on Tuesday (February 15th) urged Macedonia and Greece to resolve their long-standing name dispute. After talks with Macedonian counterpart Gjorge Ivanov in Ljubljana, Turk said a solution should be found before The Hague-based International Court of Justice rules on Skopje's complaint against Greece for breaching a 1995 interim agreement. Turk also said that Macedonia's membership in the EU and NATO is in the interest of all. (MIA, Kanal 5, STA - 15/02/11)

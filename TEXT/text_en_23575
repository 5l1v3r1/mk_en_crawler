BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn voiced optimism on Monday (July 27th) that Macedonia and Greece can still resolve their long-standing name dispute. He said both countries are working to move the issue forward. The stalemate has affected Macedonia's bid to get an official start date for EU accession talks. Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said in Brussels that Skopje will not start EU negotiations as long as the name row persists. (Dnevnik - 28/07/09; A1, Makfax, Sitel - 27/07/09)

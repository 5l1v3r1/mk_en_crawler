SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Some 500 journalists gathered in front of the Macedonian Interior Ministry on Monday (30 September) to protest last week's beating of one of their colleagues, allegedly by members of a special police squad. Four purported members of the so-called Lions unit beat up Zoran Bozinovski while he was anchoring a programme for Kumanovo's Radio Tumba. The journalist had to undergo surgery following the attack and is still in hospital. The protesters blew whistles and called on outgoing Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski to release the results of the investigation. The Macedonian Journalists Association issued a statement, saying that 40 of its members have been assaulted over the past three years. (AP - 30/09/02)

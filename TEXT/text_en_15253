BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- In his first official visit to Belgrade, Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling discussed issues concerning war crimes co-operation, bilateral relations and regional co-operation with Serbian President Boris Tadic, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic. The officials agreed that all unresolved issues must be resolved through dialogue. Concerning co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Schwarz-Schilling stressed that there is no link between Serbia's lack of co-operation and BiH's progress in negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.

TIRANA, Albania -- The government will work with The Hague war crimes tribunal to investigate claims that Kosovo Albanians were complicit in the trafficking of prisoners' organs during the 1990s. According to a statement Thursday (May 15th), "Albanian prosecutors are ready to co-operate with the (tribunal) and to help its judges, who can arrive in Albania, to collect additional information that might lead to further investigations." Former chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte said in her book that Kosovo Albanians kidnapped around 300 Serb prisoners of war and transported them from Kosovo to Albania. According to her, the abductors removed their organs for sale abroad before killing them.
In other news Thursday, police arrested six people, including a fellow officer, for suspected human trafficking. The Kosovo Police Service detained them in Pristina and southeastern Kosovo, seizing fake passports, ID cards, official seals and drivers' licenses.

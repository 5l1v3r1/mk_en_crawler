BELGRADE, Serbia -- About 1,000 grain and raspberry farmers from different parts of the country gathered in Belgrade on Wednesday (August 12th) to protest difficulties in the agriculture sector and to demand higher prices for their crops. Deputy Agriculture Minister Milos Milovanovic said the ministry understands the farmers' frustration but cannot intervene because prices are set by the market, not by the state. Dragisa Terzic, president of the Association of Berry Fruit Farmers, said that because no one from the ministry came to negotiate with protesters, they decided to spend the night outside the government building. Five farmers went on a hunger strike. (Tanjug, B92, RTS, Beta - 12/08/09)

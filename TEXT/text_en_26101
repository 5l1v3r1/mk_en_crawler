ANKARA, Turkey -- A court ordered the expulsion of a young British tourist Sunday (August 16th) for offending the founder of the Turkish republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. The 19-year old tourist climbed on a statue of Ataturk in the Marmaris resort, took off his clothes and made offensive gestures. The court also banned him from visiting Turkey for five years. Turkish laws envision prison sentences for people who offend Ataturk. (AFP, Anadolu news agency - 16/08/09)

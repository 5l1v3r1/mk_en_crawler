PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Public Health Institute has requested all schools in Kosovo be disinfected to help prevent the spread of swine flu. The institute also recommended on Saturday (November 7th) that schools keep track of students who miss classes in order to have a better picture of the situation. These measures come after reports last week of three new swine flu cases among Kosovo Serb children who had visited Serbia. Kosovo has registered nine cases of swine flu so far.

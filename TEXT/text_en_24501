ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament member Branimir Glavas received a ten-year prison sentence on Friday (May 8th) for war crimes committed against Serb civilians during Croatia's war of independence in the early 1990s. The court said that in 1991 Glavas ordered a paramilitary unit under his command to abduct and murder ten Serbs in the city of Osijek. After parliament partially lifted the former general's immunity from prosecution, authorities charged him last year. Glavas insists the trial was politically motivated. He blames the ruling Croatian Democratic Union, which expelled him three years ago after he clashed with Prime Minister Ivo Sanader. (BBC-08/05/09)

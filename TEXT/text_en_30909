SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Slovenia will continue back to Macedonia's efforts to join the EU and NATO, Slovenian Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar said on Wednesday (March 9th) after meeting with Macedonian counterpart Antonio Milososki in Skopje. He voiced hope that the long-standing name dispute between Skopje and Athens will be resolved soon and said the priority now should be resuming political dialogue with the opposition and getting them to end their parliamentary boycott.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Defence Minister Nikolay Svinarov told a private television station on Sunday (6 March) that Bulgaria should maintain a military presence in Iraq until Baghdad has succeeded in building its own armed forces and police. Bulgaria is expected to maintain its battalion of 450 soldiers in Iraq in 2005 and modify its presence there next year.
In other news, the International Atomic Energy Agency has backed Bulgaria's plans to build a new nuclear power plant at Belene. Mohamed El-Baradei, the director of the UN agency, expressed support for the project during a meeting with Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy in Vienna late last week.

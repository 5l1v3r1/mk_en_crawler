ZAGREB, Croatia -- Finance Minister Ivan Suker announced that the cabinet has decided to amend Article 262 of the labour law, regulating the application of workers' rights after collective agreements expire, local media reported on Thursday (May 27th). Suker explained that the proposal is to set a six-month deadline to reach a new agreement, after which the rights would be cancelled and it would be up to individual employers to regulate them. Union leader Spomenka Avbersek says a general strike is possible if the cabinet goes through with the amendment. (Vecernji List, HRT - 27/05/10)

TIRANA, Albania -- The OSCE and the Council of Europe's (CoE) Venice Commission approve of Albania's newly adopted election code, media reported on Tuesday (March 17th). After evaluating it, the two organisations said the new code was a good legal basis for holding free and fair elections in June. Adopted in December, it triggered harsh criticisms from the small parties in parliament, which argued the new legislation adversely affected their chances.

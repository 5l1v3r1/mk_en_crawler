SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak initiated talks with BiH party leaders on a number of issues, such as Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) implementation, in an attempt to reach consensus and ensure progress in the months ahead. He met on Thursday (July 24th) with Sulejman Tihic, leader of the Bosniak Party of Democratic Action, with whom he discussed the appointment of a BiH ombudsman and a number of other projects. Tihic reportedly agreed that a meeting of leaders from parties in the governing state-level coalition would secure faster progress on the road to EU accession. (OHR website, Fena - 24/07/08)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Following a meeting with Serbian President Boris Tadic in Belgrade, Czech Foreign Minister Cyril Svoboda said Wednesday (8 June) that the EU enlargement process would continue. Svoboda arrived on a two-day visit to Serbia-Montenegro earlier in the day. He voiced Czech support for the efforts of the federal union to join the EU and NATO. Later, Svoboda and Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic discussed an agreement on bilateral economic co-operation, which will be sealed in the coming months. On Thursday, Svoboda was scheduled to visit Pristina and Podgorica. 
In other news, Tadic travels to Macedonia Thursday to discuss border demarcation issues. He told the daily Dnevnik that UNMIK is not authorised to deal with the border demarcation process, which has stalled because of objections from Pristina regarding the Kosovo section of the border.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian media was highly suspicious Monday (3 May) of the official story of the surrender of Milorad Lukovic Legija, the accused mastermind of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's assassination. Media reports suggest Legija struck a deal with the cabinet: in exchange for his surrender, he might testify as a protected witness about involvement by Djindjic's Democratic Party in organised crime and corruption. Interior Minister Dragan Jocic and Legija's lawyers deny any talk of a deal.
In other news Monday, Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic met with Estonian counterpart Kristiina Ojuland. They discussed Serbia-Montenegro's place in Europe and co-operation between the two countries in resolving the Kosovo-Metohija situation. Estonia is one of ten countries that joined the EU Saturday.

THESSALONIKI, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou said in his annual speech on economic policy Saturday (September 11th) that the government is fighting for Greece's survival. "Either we win or we sink together," Papandreou told a commercial fair in Thessaloniki. Papandreou stressed that the government will proceed with reforms and will liberalise economic sectors, such as electricity production and transport. During his speech, an angry man, later identified as a respected cancer specialist, threw his shoe at the prime minister. Immediately arrested, he was later released.
Meanwhile, about 20,000 people attended protest marches held in Thessaloniki against the government's austerity measures. Several hundred youths tried to break a cordon of police, who used tear gas to disperse them after clashes that lasted several minutes near the fair. Lorry drivers also joined the protest, announcing the launch of a new strike Monday against proposed changed to the transport sector.

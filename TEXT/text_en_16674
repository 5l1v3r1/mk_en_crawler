SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Major General Richard Wightman took over the duties of NATO HQ Commander in BiH from US Brigadier General Louis Weber on Friday (October 6th), at a ceremony near Sarajevo. Speaking to reporters later, Wightman said his priorities would be the arrest of the six remaining fugitives wanted by the UN war crimes tribunal and the continuation of defence reforms. The Commander of NATO's Allied Joint Force Command Naples, Admiral Harry Ulrich, also attended the ceremony. He said that while capturing the fugitives remains a top priority for the Alliance, it is also the obligation of the entire international community, BiH authorities and even ordinary citizens.

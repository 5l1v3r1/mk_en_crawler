PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prime Minister and Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) leader Milo Djukanovic expressed confidence on Thursday (April 3rd) that incumbent president and government coalition candidate Filip Vujanovic will win Sundayâs presidential election in the first round. However, recent polls have suggested it may take two rounds to decide between Vujanovic and Serb List candidate Andrija Mandic. The other two candidates are Nebojsa Medojevic from the Movement for Changes and Srdjan Milic from the Socialistic People's Party. (Blic - 04/04/08; RTCG - 03/04/08)

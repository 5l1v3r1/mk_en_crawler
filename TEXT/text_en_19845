ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Two public buses were attacked with Molotov cocktails on Sunday (August 19th) after two similar incidents last week. The bus drivers took evasive action, and no injuries were reported. Witnesses say a group of 35-40 people blocked the road with trash cans and burning tires, while chanting slogans in support of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
Separately Monday, a Turkish military officer was killed by PKK militants in the Osmaniye province. (Zaman - 21/08/07; Hurriyet - 20/08/07)

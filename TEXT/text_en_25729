ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police detained 34 people on Saturday (February 20th), preventing them from organising a concert by a neo-Nazi German band and two local bands. In the end, only six remained in custody on charges of disturbing the public order by displaying Nazi insignias. The concert was supposed to be held on Saturday in Krizevci.

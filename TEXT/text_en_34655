BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- One person was injured in the three explosions at a community centre in Presevo in southern Serbia on Saturday (23 August). The predominantly ethnic Albanian city was a centre of unrest before a US-brokered peace agreement resulted in the disbanding of a local militant group. The local government issued a statement saying a police station adjacent to the community centre may have been the real target of the rocket-propelled grenades. (AP - 24/08/03; AFP - 23/08/03)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Three people have been detained in connection with a suspected case of illegal human eggs trafficking, organised crime prosecutors said on Monday (July 20th). The three -- a Romanian national and two Israeli doctors -- ran a private clinic in Bucharest that performed in vitro fertilisation without a license. The clinic allegedly paid young Romanian women to produce eggs that were later sold to foreign couples, mainly Israelis. The clinic operated illegally for three years before receiving authorisation last week, prosecutors said. (Mediafax, Ziare, Channel 10, Reuters, AKI - 20/07/09)

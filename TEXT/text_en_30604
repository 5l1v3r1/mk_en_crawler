ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused the foreign press on Monday (March 14th) of contributing to a "defamation campaign" against Turkey over what he described as inaccurate coverage of a recent debate on media freedom. Speaking at the opening of the Leaders of Change Summit in Istanbul, Erdogan said this campaign was carried out through "unrealistic news and comments". He urged foreign journalists to analyse events properly and reflect these analyses in their writing. He also slammed a report on Turkey's EU progress adopted by the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee last week, which included criticism of press freedom in Turkey. Debate on media freedom in Turkey has grown since seven journalists were arrested recently for suspected involvement in the so-called Ergenekon plot to topple the government.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The trial of two Bosnian Serb cousins charged with the murder of 150 Muslims in Visegrad during the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) began on Wednesday (July 9th) at The Hague war crimes tribunal. Milan Lukic, 40, and Sredoje Lukic, 47, face charges of committing war crimes, crimes against humanity and violations of the rule of law. Milan commanded a Serb paramilitary group known as the Avengers, or the White Eagles, that was active in the town of Visegrad. His cousin, Sredoje, was a member. The prosecution claims that the actions against non-Serbs in Visegrad constituted one of the most violent ethnic-cleansing campaigns on the territory of the former Yugoslavia.

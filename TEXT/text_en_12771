ZAGREB, Croatia -- Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik suggested on Saturday (4 June) that the EU Ministerial Council would discuss issues related to Croatia's EU membership bid, particularly co-operation with The Hague tribunal, during its 13 June meeting in Luxembourg. The discussions would probably focus on implementation of the government's action plan to detain and extradite fugitive indictee Ante Gotovina to The Hague. Plassnik repeated that as soon as progress in Zagreb's co-operation is acknowledged, accession talks would be launched. (HINA - 04/06/05)

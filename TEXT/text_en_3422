On December 1st, Croatia adopted its budget for 2007, with parliament endorsing all government-sponsored amendments. Social needs are a priority area, along with education, science and infrastructure. 
In all, 3m euros have been earmarked for facilitating use of public roads by the disabled. The new budget also includes provisions benefiting homeland defenders, people with special needs, children and youth, and retirees. 
Investments have been boosted in education and science, including funds for the construction of student centres and for providing free textbooks. State administration salaries will increase by up to 5%, and retirement salaries by up to 6%. Funds also have been increased for the Council for National Minorities. 
Along with Croatia's economic development has come an increase in tax revenues, enabling regional administrations greater capacity for self-government and facilitating decentralisation, analysts say. Decentralisation of economic and political power has been an ongoing issue since the mid-1990s. 
The new budget should help balance out the development of Croatia's regions, allowing greater planning and implementation at the local level, according to the government. 
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader says his administration remains committed to developing Croatia's highways and roads, helping spur growth across the country. The budget also provides for continued investment in gasification technology. 
While the main focus of the new budget is on citizen's needs, the government also endeavours to show progress in achieving national strategic goals -- particularly membership in the EU and NATO. Modernisation of the state administration and judicial systems, the fight against organised crime, and the establishment of acceptable work environment conditions are all receiving funding.

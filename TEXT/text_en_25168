BELGRADE, Serbia -- After 13 hours of heated debate, parliament adopted a landmark declaration early Wednesday (March 31st) condemning crimes committed against Bosniaks in the UN safe haven of Srebrenica in July 1995. In part, it sends "condolences and an apology to the families of the victims because not everything was done to prevent the tragedy". Out of 149 present, 127 lawmakers supported the resolution, which does not mention the word "genocide", a concession to the junior government ally -- the Socialist Party of Serbia. Parliament Speaker Slavica Dukic-Dejanovic said members will soon debate a similar resolution denouncing war crimes committed against Serbs in the former Yugoslav republics. 
In other news, Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic says the ruling coalition has reached agreement on the successor to National Bank of Serbia Governor Radovan Jelasic, though it will be a couple days before the choice is announced. Jelasic stepped down last week citing personal reasons. (Tanjug, RTS, Radio Free Europe - 31/03/10; Beta, Blic, Tanjug - 30/03/10)

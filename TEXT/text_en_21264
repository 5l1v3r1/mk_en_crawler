THE HAGUE, the Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic on Friday (August 29th) refused to enter a plea at the UN war crimes tribunal, where he faces charges stemming from the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia. In accordance with court rules, judges entered a not guilty plea on his behalf.
It was Karadzic's second appearance in court. At his first hearing, on July 31st, he also refused to enter a plea, instead challenging the court's legitimacy. He faces 11 counts, including genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, though the court is waiting to hear whether prosecutors will amend the indictment. His trial is expected to start next year.
Last week, ICTY President Fausto Pocar shifted the Karadzic case from Trial Chamber One to Trial Chamber Three, which is presided over by Jamaican judge Patrick Robinson. The move came two days after Karadzic sent a letter to Pocar requesting a change of judges. He claimed that Dutch judge Alphonse Orie, who leads Trial Chamber One, is biased and cannot guarantee a fair trial. The three judges who heard the Karadzic case on Friday are Robinson, British judge Ian Bonomy and French judge Michele Picard. Bonomy was assigned to oversee the pre-trial proceedings.

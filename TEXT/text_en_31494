PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- KFOR arrested two people in the Gnjilane region Sunday (20 April), reportedly for suspected links to the Albanian National Army (ANA). Late last week, UNMIK head Michael Steiner declared the ANA a terrorist organisation. Tanjug reports there have been other such arrests in Kosovo, though there has been no official confirmation.

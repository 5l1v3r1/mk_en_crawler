TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Democratic Party (DP) and the opposition Socialist Party (SP) have returned to the negotiating table to try to resolve their longstanding political stalemate. Both parties said on Tuesday (July 13th) that negotiations will be based on implementing proposals in a European Parliament (EP) resolution on Albania's EU progress, adopted earlier this month. As for the June 2009 general elections, the DP said the SP should address the Constitutional Court and the Strasbourg-based European Court for Human Rights regarding their request to open the ballot boxes. The SP wants a parliamentary panel to investigate the elections as soon as possible, insisting SP members should have the majority of seats on the committee, as well as its chairmanship.

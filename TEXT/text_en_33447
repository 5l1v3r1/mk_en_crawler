ANKARA, Turkey -- Wednesday's (30 April) meeting of the National Security Council reportedly went smoothly, defusing speculation about the military's dissatisfaction with government policies that it sees as violating secularism. President Ahmet Sezer and military officials reportedly cautioned the government about its policies, however, and especially about recent appointments to public offices. They also insisted that secularism be preserved. Afterwards, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul described the nearly eight-hour session as an ordinary meeting and said there was no tension.

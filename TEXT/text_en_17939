PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Relatives of two ethnic Albanian cousins arrested in Montenegro rallied in front of the US Embassy in Podgorica on Sunday (December 17th). Rok and Kolja Dedvukaj, who are US citizens, were among 18 persons arrested in September. Montenegrin authorities say they were planning terror attacks with the aim of establishing an autonomous ethnic Albanian area on Montenegrin territory. But the relatives say the indictment was politically motivated and not supported by evidence. (Vijesti, Pobjeda, Albanian News - 18/12/06)

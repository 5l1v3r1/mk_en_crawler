THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The trial of Serbian Radical Party (SRS) leader Vojislav Seselj at The Hague war crimes tribunal will continue next Tuesday, according to an announcement Wednesday (September 17th). Seselj allegedly helped plot the murder, torture and illegal imprisonment of non-Serbs during the 1990s conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. Judges delayed the trial late last month, pending a decision on Seselj's request to handle his own defence. (AFP, RTS - 17/09/08)

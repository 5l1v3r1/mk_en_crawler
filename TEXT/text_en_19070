SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Hague-based UN war crimes tribunal has again postponed the transfer of cases to Macedonia's judiciary, Kanal 5 TV reported on Tuesday (May 1st). Sources say the tribunal believes the country could not sufficiently train prosecutors and judges to handle the task in a timely manner. According to an agreement reached in January between the Macedonian government and tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte, the transfer of the four war crimes cases was to take place in July. It has already been delayed two years. (A1 TV, Kanal 5 - 01/05/07)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The head of the European Parliament's (EP) panel for Southeast Europe, Doris Pack, says the arrest of top fugitive Ratko Mladic has been and will remain a condition for resuming Stabilisation and Association (SAA) talks with Serbia. In an interview in Thursday's (February 1st) edition of the Sarajevo daily Dnevni avaz, Pack stressed that reconciliation in the region is impossible until Mladic and fellow fugitive Radovan Karadzic are in The Hague. She also announced that the EP External Relations Committee has adopted a new resolution on BiH, calling on the EU Council to exert pressure on BiH authorities -- especially Republika Srpska -- to fulfil key requirements in another area, police reform.
On Wednesday, UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte met with EU security chief Javier Solana in Brussels. She urged the EU not to resume Serbia's SAA talks until Belgrade arrests Mladic. (Dnevni avaz - 01/02/07; EU Observer - 31/01/07)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The cabinet forwarded its draft election law amendment to parliament on Thursday (August 30th). It would boost the number of seats in parliament from 120 to 133, to better harmonise laws with those of the EU. Among other provisions, additional seats would be earmarked for the Macedonian diaspora living in three major election districts abroad -- North-South America, Europe-Africa, and Australia-Asia. The rules would apply to presidential and parliamentary elections only. 
In neighbouring Kosovo on Thursday, UNMIK head Joachim Ruecker issued a directive regulating the conduct of local and parliamentary elections this autumn. In part, it sets a 5% parliament entry threshold, applicable to Albanian parties only. (MIA, Makfax, MRT, Focus - 30/08/07)

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's special representative to Cyprus, Lisa Buttenheim stressed on Friday (May 6th) the importance of the civil society and the public in achieving progress in ongoing efforts to reconcile the Greek and Turkish communities on the island. "While Cyprus remains divided today, it is an island whose inhabitants are bound together by a common culture and history," Buttenheim said at the opening of an inter-communal centre aimed to promote research and dialogue in Cyprus. 
The so-called Home for Co-operation will provide institutional support to civil society organisations by offering a common space for Greek and Turkish Cypriot researchers and artists. (UN website, World Bulletin, Cyprus Mail, Anadolu news agency - 06/05/11)

ANKARA, Turkey -- A 15-year-old boy died after he was hit in the head with a stone during a demonstration on Friday (February 15th) in the Sirnak province in southeast Turkey. The demonstration was held to mark the 9th anniversary of the arrest of Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan. Protesters threw stones at the police and broke shop windows of those who did not close their stores in protest. 
Demonstrations were held in many parts of southeast Turkey, as well as in Strasbourg, the headquarters of the European Court for Human Rights. (Hurriyet, AFP - 16/02/08; AP, RIA Novosti - 15/02/08)

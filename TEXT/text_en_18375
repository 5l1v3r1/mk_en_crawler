BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Dragan Jocic announced on Monday (June 11th) that anti-terror police troops found over 10,000 pieces of munitions and over 15kg of explosive material -- allegedly originating in Kosovo and designated for terror activities in the Novi Pazar, Tutin and Sjenica municipalities. Jocic said police discovered this information in the process of detaining members of a suspected Wahhabi extremist group in Novi Pazar last week. In March, police smashed an alleged training camp of Wahhabi extremists in that area and seized explosives, maps and terrorist propaganda material. Over a dozen suspects have been detained since then. (Danas, Politika - 12/06/07; Beta, B92, RTS, BBC News - 11/06/07)

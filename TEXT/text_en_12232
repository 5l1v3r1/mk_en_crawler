SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Defence Reform Commission co-chairman Raffi Gregorian warned on Saturday (11 June) against setbacks in the process and said he would meet with BiH political parties this week, seeking to ensure that reforms are back on track. Speaking at a seminar in Sarajevo, Gregorian hinted that deadlines set for the restructuring of the military might be missed due to the recent crisis within the BiH Council of Ministers, as well as attempts by some parties to delay implementation of a political agreement already reached within the commission.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Seven EU members -- Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Slovakia and Sweden -- plan to open their labour markets to workers from Bulgaria and Romania after the two countries' entry in the EU next month, the Romanian Foreign Ministry announced on Wednesday (December 20th). Several other EU members -- Hungary, Spain, France and Greece -- plan to partially open their markets in certain sectors until about 2009. Austria, Denmark, Germany, Great Britain and Ireland formally decided to impose a transitional period of several years, after which restrictions potentially would be lifted.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Incumbent Traian Basescu and challenger Mircea Geoana, frontrunners in the upcoming November 22nd presidential election, formally launched their respective campaigns on Wednesday (October 21st). Geoana said he could be a unifying force in these difficult times, while Basescu said he is confident he will be re-elected, as he has more to do for the country. The third strongest candidate, Crin Antonescu of the National Liberal Party, launched his campaign last week.
In other news Wednesday, parliament rejected Basescu's proposal to hold a referendum on Election Day about turning the bicameral legislature into a unicameral one. Parliament's vote was only advisory, so Basescu may still proceed if he wants. Earlier this week, he said he would, regardless of how lawmakers voted. The opposition accuses him of trying to dilute the presidential election by introducing another topic, thus diverting attention from current problems. Under the unicameral system, the number of parliament members would drop from 471 to 300. (Evenimentul Zilei, Gandul, Romania Libera, Gardianul, Jurnalul National - 22/10/09)

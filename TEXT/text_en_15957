SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev announced on Wednesday (16 August) that an investigation has been launched against the management of the Sofia district heating company Toplofikatsia Sofia, as well as several bank officials in relation to an embezzlement affair involving over 15m euros. Velchev said the management of the municipally run firm failed to exert sufficient control over former director Valentin Dimitrov, while bank officials allegedly hid information about his bank accounts. Dimitrov was arrested earlier this month. (BNR, Mediapool, Darik - 16/08/06)

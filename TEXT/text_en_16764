TIRANA, Albania -- The level of corruption in Albania remains high, according to a poll by USAID. Marcie Ries, US ambassador to Tirana, presented the findings Tuesday (6 June), which suggest that the public views parliament members, judges, doctors and customs officers as most corrupt state officials. The president, religious leaders and the military were viewed as the most honest and trustworthy. Overall, respondents noted general improvement in terms of transparency of the state administration. Ries reiterated that Albania's future depends on the successful eradication of corruption, and urged every available means be directed towards this. (Albanian News - 07/06/06)

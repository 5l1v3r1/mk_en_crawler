BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Croatia could wrap up its EU accession negotiations by mid-2011 provided no unexpected impediments occur, Alexandra Cas Granje, director in the Directorate General Enlargement, said on Monday (November 29th) during a meeting of the EU-Croatia joint parliamentary committee. This marks the first time a European Commission (EC) official has suggested a possible date for ending accession talks. According to Cas Granje, the EC will prepare an interim report on Zagreb's progress in the judiciary chapter in March 2011, which should make it clear when the chapter will be closed. It will likely be the last one, at that point. (Hina, tportal.hr, HRT - 29/11/10)

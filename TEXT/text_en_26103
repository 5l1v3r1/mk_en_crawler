BUCHAREST, Romania -- Teachers will stage a 24-hour strike on April 22nd to voice their dissatisfaction with planned salary cuts and lay-offs, trade union leader Marius Nistor told a press conference Thursday (March 18th). As of Monday, teachers will stop registering students' scores in school documents and will begin boycotting national tests. The decision came a day after the government approved a new education draft law and allowed two weeks for public debate before final approval. The union says that's not enough time.

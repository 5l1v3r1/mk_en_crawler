TRIPOLI, Libya -- A government source has denied statements by leader Muammar Gaddafi's son, Seif al Islam, who told Al Jazeera television Friday (August 10th) that the Bulgarian medics jailed for eight years in Libya were tortured while in custody. According to al-Islam, the prisoners were given electric shocks and told their families would be targeted. However, an anonymous Libyan official who contacted the television after the interview disputed his statements. "That opinion belongs to the author and does not present the position of the whole country," the source said. (BNR, Sofia news agency, DPA, Darik - 11/08/07)

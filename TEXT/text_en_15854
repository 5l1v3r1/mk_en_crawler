ATHENS, Greece -- Prosecutors are investigating whether bribery played a role in the award of a high-profile contract during the 2004 Athens Olympics to the German company Siemens. Media reports Tuesday (November 21st) suggest the decision to investigate followed a spate of stories by German media over the last few days, which suggested several Siemens officials may have paid bribes in exchange for contracts. One reportedly involved the 250m-euro contract for the high-tech Olympic security system, which the previous government awarded to Siemens and the US-based company SAIC.

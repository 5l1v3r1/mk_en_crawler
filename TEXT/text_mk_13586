SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The commander of EUFOR, Major General David Leakey, said on Tuesday (23 August) that EUFOR has no information about the existence of terrorist training camps in BiH. Talking to reporters in Sarajevo, Leakey stressed that if they had any indications about such activities, EUFOR personnel -- together with the local police and NATO forces -- would immediately respond. Recently, the Cybercast News agency published an article claiming that Islamic terrorists linked with previous attacks on the United States are now at training camps in BiH.

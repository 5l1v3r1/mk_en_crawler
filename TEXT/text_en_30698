BUCHAREST, Romania -- The newly formed opposition alliance Social-Liberal Union (USL) will submit a no-confidence motion in March, Victor Ponta, the Social Democratic Party (PSD) leader, told a press conference Saturday (February 12th). The specific date is to be established with the alliance partner, the National Liberal Party (PNL). The opposition can file only one no-confidence motion per six month parliamentary session, except in cases in which the prime minister decides to initiate accountability procedures on certain bills, in order to speed up the adoption process and avoid parliamentary votes, as often happened in the second half of 2010. The opposition will be closely watching the congress of the junior ruling Democratic Alliance of Hungarians (UDMR) on February 26th, when the ethnic Hungarians will choose a leader and establish the group's strategy. Should the UDMR leave the government, the cabinet will lose its parliamentary majority, making a no-confidence vote very likely to succeed. (Mediafax, Hotnews.ro, Ziare - 12/02/11)

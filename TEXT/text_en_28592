PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX has advised two officials from the party of outgoing Prime Minister Hashim Thaci not to run in the December 12th snap elections, as they are under investigation for corruption and organised crime, media reported on Friday (November 12th). EULEX deputy head Andy Sparks said that including Fatmir Limaj and Azem Syla in the Democratic Party of Kosovo's lists could harm Kosovo's reputation. The two responded by reiterating their innocence. Limaj, transport and telecommunications minister in the outgoing cabinet, is suspected of corruption in connection with road construction tenders. Syla, a former Kosovo Liberation Army commander, is a suspect in the so-called Bllaca case. Nazim Bllaca, who faces accusations of murder and other crimes, claims he was operating under the orders of Syla at the Kosovo Intelligence Service. (RTS, Radio Free Europe - 12/11/10)

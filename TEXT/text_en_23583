PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Senior Montenegrin officials asked Kosovo leaders on Wednesday (January 28th) to recognise the status of Montenegrin citizens and offer them the same rights as other minorities. During a visit to Kosovo, Deputy Montenegrin Parliament Speaker Rifat Rastoder said his focus was the issue of displaced persons and conditions for their return. At the same time, Rastoder stressed that Montenegro does not consider this a condition for enhancing diplomatic ties between the two countries. Kosovo Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi said institutions in his country will make every effort to ensure Montenegrins living in Kosovo enjoy representation in the next elections.
In other news, Kosovo Security Force (KSF) Minister Fehmi Mujota admitted on Wednesday there have been mistakes in selecting former Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC) members to join the KSF. Mujota said that in co-operation with KFOR, the KSF will review all applications, including those of KPC members already recruited for the new force.

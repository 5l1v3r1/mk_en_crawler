ATHENS, Greece -- Hundreds of firefighters are battling gale-whipped blazes near Athens that killed at least one person, burned more than a dozen homes and threatened two northern suburbs -- including one that is home to the Olympic Village. Officials said the charred body of a man was found at the foot of Mt Parnis, site of a thickly forested national park. Strong winds swept the blaze towards the suburbs of Acharnes and Thrakomakedones, about 15km north of central Athens. Police have ordered widespread evacuations. (AP, CNN - 07/07/04)

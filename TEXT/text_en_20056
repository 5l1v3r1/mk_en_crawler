BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu announced on Wednesday (January 16th) that he had authorised a corruption probe against seven former ministers and a former prime minister. To refuse prosecutors' request for the investigation would have blocked the course of justice, Basescu explained. Those investigated are former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase, former Transportation Minister Miron Mitrea, former Justice Minister Tudor Chiuariu, former Communications Minister Zsolt Nagy, former Defence Minister Victor Babiuc, current Labour Minister Paul Pacuraru, former Economy Minister Codrut Seres and former Agriculture Minister Decebal Traian Remes. They are suspected of a variety of offenses such as accepting bribes, using their influence to benefit relatives, and engaging in deals that damaged the interests of the state. Critics say Basescu will use the investigations as future campaign fodder. (Nine o'clock - 17/01/08; Euronews, Nine O'clock, Hotnews.ro - 16/01/08)

NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina regarding Kosovo's 2008 unilaterally declared independence, during talks with Serbian President Boris Tadic on Tuesday (September 21st). He added that the EU might facilitate such talks and confirmed that UN Resolution 1244 remains in effect. Ban also called for compromises from both sides in order to achieve a mutually acceptable solution. Tadic agreed that a compromise is needed and said talks should address all remaining issues. He reiterated that Serbia will never recognise Kosovo's independence. (RTS, B92, FoNet - 21/09/10)

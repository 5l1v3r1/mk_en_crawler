This year's Eurovision Song Contest, held in Istanbul, ended in victory for Ruslana Lyzichko of the Ukraine. However, it could be argued that the real winner was Southeast Europe. Countries from the region chose to set aside old conflicts and quarrels and support each other during the annual extravaganza.
Though the Ukraine came in first -- thus automatically becoming the host of next year's event -- contestants from the Balkans took the other top spots. Second place went to Serbia-Montenegro's Zeljko Joksimovic and the Ad Hoc Orchestra. Greece's Sakis Rouvas took third. The youthful Turkish ska-punk band Athena came in fourth, while Cyprus placed fifth.
In addition, Albania (seventh place) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (ninth place) both finished in the top half, while Croatia, Macedonia and Romania all turned in impressive performances.
Since its inception in 1956, the annual contest has become a pop music institution. This year, 36 countries took part -- the largest number ever. Twelve countries were eliminated in a semifinal held on 12 May.
Attendance figures also set a new record.
Serbia-Montenegro, participating for the first time since the break-up of Yugoslavia, earned the hearts of millions with their song"Lane Moje" (My Sweetheart), which featured authentic instruments, solos on reed flute and violin, and a strong Balkan flavour.
Turkey's solid result this year, after winning the 2003 contest, helped further erase the disappointments of the past.For years, Turkish viewers would crowd in front of their TVs, praying simply that their country would not come in last. Now they have witnessed a championship, followed by another strong finish.
Along with flamboyant outfits and campy performances, political voting has always been a feature of Eurovision contests. This year was no different. Countries typically vote for their neighbours, or for those with which they share a deeply-rooted cultural affinity. As expected, Portugal gave its top score to Spain, Latvia and Estonia gave high points to Russia, Cyprus gave 12 points to Greece, and the Scandinavian nations rewarded each other.
What was more surprising was that Balkan countries which had quarreled and fought each other in the past now joined together in a demonstration of solidarity. Turkey gave points to its historic rival, Greece. Croatia awarded its top marks to Serbia-Montenegro.
"There is a message here," says Balkan expert Haluk Gunugur. He believes the votes were a way of saying "we left all that behind, and even if we still have problems, we can support each other."
"This is a remarkable approach," Gunugur added.
The contest was held under tight security because of the four devastating bomb blasts in Istanbul last November, in which 61 people were killed. The event was seen as a major test of security as the city prepares to host the NATO summit in June.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A suicide bomber and a restaurant employee died in a terrorist attack on the freemasons' building in Istanbul on Tuesday (9 March). Officials say two suicide bombers entered the restaurant on the ground floor of the building and fired several shots before detonating explosives strapped to their bodies. One of the bombers and a waiter died instantly. Several other people were injured, including the second bomber. There were at least 40 people in the restaurant. No one has claimed responsibility for the incident. In November, more than 60 people died in a series of terrorist strikes in Istanbul, attributed to al-Qaeda.

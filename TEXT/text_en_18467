ANKARA, Turkey -- The ruling majority in Parliament rejected a no-confidence motion filed by the opposition against Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu on Tuesday (February 13th). The opposition blames him for the failure of local security services to prevent the January 19th murder of the prominent Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink -- despite tips police had received well in advance. In his speech to Parliament, Aksu dismissed the accusations as groundless.
In other news Tuesday, Turkish authorities announced that new bird flu outbreaks had been detected in the country's southeast. The virus turned up in domestic poultry in another village in the Batman province, Esentepe, as well as near the town of Silvan, in the neighbouring province of Diyarbakir.

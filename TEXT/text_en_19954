PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said on Wednesday (March 19th) he is happy that neighbours Croatia, Hungary and Bulgaria decided this week to recognise Kosovo's independence. Croatia and Hungary made it official on Wednesday. Bulgaria is expected to follow suit Thursday. "This is a good decision, taken at the right moment," Thaci said. 
Not everyone agrees. In Croatia, Slobodan Uzelac, deputy prime minister from the Independent Serb Democratic Party (SDSS), resigned on Wednesday in protest. The SDSS represents ethnic Serbs in Croatia. Belgrade, meanwhile, is recalling its ambassadors to Croatia and Hungary for consultations. The ambassador to Sofia will follow soon after submitting a protest note to the Bulgarian government. (AFP, RIA-Novosti, HRT, RTS, BNR, Index.hr - 19/03/08)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- No investigation will be launched against anyone mentioned in Council of Europe Rapporteur Dick Marty's report unless evidence is available, EU officials in Brussels said on Wednesday (January 26th), referring to organ trafficking allegations. "Every prosecutor will base investigations on evidence when addressing cases to the court. For example, regarding Marty's report, we need evidence," said Maja Kocijancic, spokesperson for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton. 
EULEX spokesperson Blerim Krasniqi struck a similar note. "EULEX takes such accusations very seriously; therefore, we have sent two letters to Mr. Marty, asking him to provide evidence, proof, and information So far we have not received any evidence," he said.
Authorities in both Kosovo and Albania have asked the EU Rule of Law mission to handle a possible investigation. On Tuesday, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted Marty's report and called for an immediate, full and independent investigation into the allegations.

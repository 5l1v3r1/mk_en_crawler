BELGRADE, Serbia -- A draft resolution condemning crimes committed in Srebrenica in July 1995 moved to parliament's docket Saturday (March 27th), submitted by 114 lawmakers from the ruling coalition. According to its text, parliament strongly condemns the 1995 Srebrenica crimes against Bosniaks, as confirmed by the International Court of Justice, and expects other former Yugoslav republics to condemn crimes committed against Serbs. Serbian lawmakers can amend that text. Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) leader Ivica Dacic, for one, says his party, which is part of the ruling coalition, has insisted that the term genocide be stripped from the resolution. The socialists, however, believe that the crimes committed in the Bosnian enclave should be condemned. They also want a separate declaration, regarding crimes against Serbs.

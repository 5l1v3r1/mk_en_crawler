BUCHAREST, Romania -- Around 5,000 police officers are expected to stage a demonstration in Bucharest on Tuesday (August 11th), calling for a bigger share of the budget to guarantee normal police functions. The protest started symbolically Monday when police officers built a cardboard house in downtown Bucharest to symbolise their dissatisfaction with a government measure to cut their rental allowances.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Cyprus will be the focus of a meeting Wednesday (18 December) between Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, Prime Minister Abdullah Gul, Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis and Chief of General Staff Hilmi Ozkok. Reportedly, Turkey will exert pressure on Turkish Cypriots to accept the UN-sponsored plan for reunification of the island. Yakis expressed concern Tuesday that if the Greek part of the divided island became a member of the EU, Turkish troops currently deployed in Cyprus might be considered an "occupation force".

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government reportedly will promise to make sizeable cuts in public administration personnel over the course of the next 12 months, when an IMF delegation visits later this month. The Belgrade-based daily Blic reported on Tuesday (August 11th) that the cuts will include the administration, education and health sectors, as well as judiciaries. 
Blic says this would be the guarantee offered in order for the IMF to concede to a higher general government deficit of 4.5% of GDP, rather than the current target of 3%. The government would also promise to freeze all pensions and public sector wages until 2011, and there would also be no increase in the VAT. 
The IMF mission arrives in Belgrade on August 24th for talks on the first review of a nearly 3 billion-euro stand-by arrangement. (Blic, FoNet, B92, Focus - 11/08/09)

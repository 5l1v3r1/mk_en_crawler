NICOSIA, Cyprus -- No threat can overshadow the survival of Cyprus as long as its independence and international recognition are secure, Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos said on Monday (October 1st), in a speech marking the 47th anniversary of the island's independence. Papadopoulos said Cypriots can be "cautiously" optimistic about efforts to reach a settlement on the island's reunification. He stressed his commitment to a "bi-zonal, bi-communal federal solution" with the Turkish north.
Also Monday, Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat told the Greek newspaper To Vima that there is hope for reunification. "I must be an optimist, because, otherwise, I am afraid we are on the path to lasting division," Talat said. (CNA - 02/10/07; To Vima, Focus - 01/10/07)

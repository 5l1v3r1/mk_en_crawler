LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- The European Commission (EC) has declined to comment on the agreement among Slovenian political leaders concerning EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn's proposal for resolving the border dispute with Croatia. Local media quoted EC spokeswoman Krisztina Nagy as saying on Wednesday (May 13th) that the EC will make no comment before receiving Ljubljana's formal reply. On Tuesday, a majority of the parties in parliament decided Rehn's proposal for international arbitration would be acceptable only if it includes some of the amendments offered by Slovenia. Croatia's parliament agreed to it last week.
Meanwhile, a survey Wednesday by the Ljubljana-based International Institute for Middle-East and Balkan Studies suggests nearly 80% of Slovenians support the way their government has been handling the border issue. The survey lasted from April 20th to May 7th. (BTA, HINA, HRT, Jutarnji list, STA, Tanjug - 13/05/09)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Defence Minister Berislav Roncevic says Croatia may start gradually suspending compulsory military service as of next year, if Parliament passes a new amendment to the law on defence. It was forwarded to lawmakers Thursday (March 22nd). Roncevic explained that while the measure does not envision a full transition to a professional army, it would effectively waive the draft if the security situation were calm. If serious threats arise, the president would have the right to reintroduce compulsory military service. (Vecernji List - 23/03/07; HINA, HRT - 22/03/07)

ANKARA, Turkey -- One of the two suspects who attempted to hijack a Turkish airliner had ties to al-Qaeda, Turkish security officials said Sunday (August 19th). Mommen Abdul Aziz Talikh, a 33-year-old Palestinian with an Egyptian passport, served a prison term in Saudi Arabia together with a senior operative of the terrorist network, and also underwent training in an al-Qaeda camp, they said.
According to police, Talikh and his accomplice, Turkish national Mehmet Resat Ozlu, attempted to hijack the airliner so they could travel to Iran and then join the Taliban in Afghanistan. The two met in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus a year ago. As for the hijackers' claims of explosives onboard, police say the supposed bomb consisted of modeling clay with wires attached.

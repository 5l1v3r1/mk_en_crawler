ATHENS, Greece -- The UN envoy in the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece, Matthew Nimetz, said on Friday (April 18th) that an urgent compromise is necessary to settle the issue as soon as possible. "We are not ready to offer a solution, but I think that events in the past month have put a different cast on the whole situation and have underlined the importance and urgency of the continuation of talks to reach a final compromise," Nimetz said after a meeting with Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis in Athens. He, however, did not indicate any deadline for resolving the issue. 
Bakoyannis said talks will be stepped up after Macedonia's June 1st snap elections. They were called after Skopje failed to receive an invitation to join NATO at the Alliance's recent summit in Bucharest. Before arriving in Athens, Nimetz was in Skopje where he met with senior government officials about the name dispute. (Dnevnik, ANA-MPA - 19/04/08; AFP, DPA - 18/04/08)

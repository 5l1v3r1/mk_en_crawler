SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) and the European Commission reportedly spoke to leaders of the largest political parties on Monday (March 19th) in an attempt to organise a new round of negotiations on police reforms. In its Tuesday edition, Dnevni Avaz newspaper suggests new talks might be held by the end of this week, with the parties possibly choosing new negotiators to jumpstart the effort. Principal Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian said on Monday that it is still not too late to reach an agreement. 
Gregorian also discussed the issue of war crimes fugitives, insisting the OHR and the international community have not backed off efforts to smash their support networks. He added that the UN war crimes tribunal, NATO and EUFOR are co-operating closely to arrest indictees still at large. 
In other news Monday, BiH Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj kicked off a two-day visit to London. In addition to meeting with British officials, he will hold talks with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in a bid to promote BiH investment opportunities.

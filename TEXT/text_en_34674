SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The interior ministry's Criminal Investigation Office suspects an unidentified organised crime group is behind the recent series of explosions in Sarajevo. Sefik Halilovic, chief of the investigation office, said Wednesday (20 August) that members of the group are most likely BiH citizens. He met with colleagues from Republika Srpska to take joint measures aimed at identifying suspects, but did not promise quick arrests. In the course of investigation, Sarajevo Canton Prosecutor Mustafa Bisic ordered about 40 people questioned. (Nezavisne Novine, BH Radio One, BBC - 20/08/03)

TIRANA, Albania -- The privatisation process and the 125m-euro bid by a US consortium to buy the only oil refiner in Albania indicates the value of public assets, Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on Thursday (May 22nd). "This privatisation process is transparent and honest," Berisha said. "The high bid came as a result of investors' trust in the government and the prime minister," he added. Berisha promised that the government will pursue transparency in privatising other strategic assets, including the INSIG insurance company and energy distributor KESH.

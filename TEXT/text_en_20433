SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) is leaving Macedonia's ruling coalition, DPA leader Menduh Thaci announced on Wednesday (March 12th), saying it is "a matter of hours, not of days". The party says Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski has ignored key demands by the DPA, including recognition of Kosovo's independence, social benefits for ethnic Albanians who fought in the 2001 insurgency, and recognising Albanian as the second official language in Macedonia. The DPA holds 11 of 120 seats in parliament.
While government spokesman Ivica Bocevski says the cabinet continues to function normally, the opposition Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia accuses the coalition partners of being frivolous and caring more about their own interests than the state's.
EU Ambassador to Macedonia Erwan Fouere held a regular meeting with Thaci on Wednesday and said he would like to see the leaders of all parties work together on the country's NATO accession bid. Skopje hopes to receive an invitation to join early next month. (Dnevnik, Makfax, A1 - 13/03/08; Focus, Makfax, ERT, AP - 12/03/08)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A key witness in the Djindjic assassination trial, Zoran "Vuk" Vukojevic, was murdered, according to a police report Saturday (3 June). Vukojevic's handcuffed, partially burnt body was discovered on the Belgrade-Zagreb highway and was identified by relatives on the basis of a tattoo, the report said. A member of the "Zemun Clan" mafia group, Vukojevic was a witness in two trials being held before the Belgrade Special Court -- one for the March 2003 killing of Djindjic, and another relating to organised crime. A spokeswoman for the court said his murder could intimidate other witnesses who are due to testify in the Djindjic trial. 
Earlier on Saturday, police discovered the body of another Zemun Clan member, Zoran Povic, in central Belgrade. They believe that there is a link between the two killings. (B92 - 04/06/06; AP, Beta - 03/06/06)

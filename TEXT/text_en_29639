SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko says the international community will not allow the BiH Court and Prosecutor's Office to be dismantled or have its activity challenged by either entity. In an interview with the Belgrade-based daily Vecernje Novosti on Monday (April 25th), Inzko warned that challenging the two judicial institutions would mean undermining the Dayton Peace Agreement and the state. Inzko added that Republika Srpska's leadership still has a small window of opportunity to reconsider whether a proposed referendum on the two institutions is in the public's interest.

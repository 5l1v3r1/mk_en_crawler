YEREVAN, Armenia -- US Assistant Secretary of State Philip Gordon urged Armenia and Turkey on Tuesday (June 9th) to make progress in ongoing talks aimed at normalising relations and re-opening their border. Reconciliation negotiations should be concluded within "a reasonable time frame," he told reporters during a visit to Yerevan. Ankara and Yerevan have had no diplomatic relations since Turkey closed its border with Armenia in 1993, to protest Armenia's occupation of the Nagorno-Karabakh region. In April, both countries agreed on a road map to normalise ties and reopen the border. (Hurriyet, Anadolu news agency, AFP - 09/06/09)

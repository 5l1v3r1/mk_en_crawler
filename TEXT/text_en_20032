TIRANA, Albania -- Three people were arrested on Tuesday (March 18th) amid an investigation into a series of deadly blasts at a munitions depot near Tirana on Saturday. The three are charged with negligence. The head of the state-owned company MEICO, Ylli Pinari; the head of the company Alba Demil, Mihal Delijorgji; and Dritan Minxholi, director of the Gerdec depot, were detained. Tuesday was also a day of national mourning in Albania following the blasts that killed at least 17 people and injured more than 300. The public observed a moment of silence at noon and flags flew at half-staff as the search for five missing people continues.

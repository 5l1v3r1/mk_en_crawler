ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister-designate Abdullah Gul told Hurriyet on Sunday (17 November) that his government would work for democracy and economic reform, and that starting talks on EU membership would be a priority. "We want to show that a Muslim country can be democratic, transparent and modern and be together with the world," he said. Appointed over the weekend, Gul is expected to present his cabinet soon. The government would consist of 23 ministries, excluding the prime minister, down from the current 35.
Also Sunday, Justice and Development Party (AKP) head Recep Tayyip Erdogan unveiled a plan to improve Turkey's economy. He said the party, which won the recent parliamentary elections, would seek to liberalise the energy sector, sell state assets and raise revenue through tax reform. Erdogan travels to Greece on Monday to discuss a plan for Cyprus. (Turkish Daily News, Turkishpress.com - 18/11/02; AP, Reuters, AFP - 17/11/02)

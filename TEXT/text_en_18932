BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament approved on Tuesday (April 3rd) the new minority government proposed by Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, which consists of representatives of Tariceanu's National Liberal Party (PNL) and the ethnic Hungarian UDMR. Deputies from the Democratic Party, PNL's previous coalition ally, and the Liberal Democratic Party (PLD), a new formation of defectors from PNL, did not take part in the vote. 
The major opposition Social Democratic Party confirmed after the session that it backed Tariceanu's reshuffled government, but stressed that it would continue acting as an opposition party. (Ziarul Financiar, Ziua - 04/04/07; Rompres, Mediafax - 03/04/07)

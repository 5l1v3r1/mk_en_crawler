BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu on Monday (December 18th) denounced the country's former communist system as "criminal" and responsible for "crimes against humanity", and suggested a national memorial day and museum be established to commemorate the victims. At a joint session of the two chambers of parliament, he presented a 650-page report prepared by a presidential commission that analysed the communist regime's rule, which lasted from 1945-1989. According to the document, some 2 million people were killed or persecuted by the system. The left-wing opposition has dismissed the president's statements as partisan politics.

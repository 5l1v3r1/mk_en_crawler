BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia is investigating notorious Zemun clan member Sretko Kalinic for three murders in 2004, Maja Kovacevic, spokeswoman for the Special Court, said on Friday (August 27th). Kalinic, nicknamed "the Beast", was extradited to Belgrade from Croatia on August 25th more than three years after he was convicted in the March 2003 assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. He was tried in absentia and sentenced in May 2007 to 30 years in prison for his role in the plot to kill Serbia's first democratically-elected prime minister. The fresh investigations involve the 2004 murders of Branko Jevtovic Jorge, Zoran Nedovic Sok and Andrija Draskovic. (Blic, B92, Vecernje Novosti - 27/08/10)

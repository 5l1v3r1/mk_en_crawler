BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government reopened the Sculeni checkpoint at the border with Moldova early Sunday (August 3rd), following a joint Romanian-Moldovan decision. The very high level of the Prut River had forced its closure. Traffic through the Stanca checkpoint resumed on Saturday.
In other news, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said on Sunday the reconstruction of homes affected by recent floods is the government's top priority. An estimated 800 houses collapsed due to flooding.
Meanwhile, another heat wave is hitting southern Romania on Monday and Tuesday. Temperatures are expected to reach 36 degrees Celsius in the southern counties of Oltenia and Muntenia.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn cautioned on Wednesday (July 4th) that Europe would pay the price of any failure in the Kosovo status issue, not Russia or the United States. According to a statement from Rehn's office, it is crucial that the matter be resolved via an effective and sustained multilateral solution, rather than unilateral declarations and veto threats. 
Separately, the foreign ministers of Austria and Serbia, Ursula Plassnik and Vuk Jeremic, respectively, agreed during talks in Vienna on Wednesday that threats of unilateral action are not in the spirit of the search for a European compromise. Russia has indicated it might veto a new UN resolution paving the way for Kosovo's independence, while leaders in Pristina have been warning that they might seek alternative scenarios for independence, if the UN-based process is further delayed. 
Serbian political party chiefs met in Belgrade on Wednesday and agreed to hold a special session of parliament by the end of the month to adopt a new resolution rejecting independence for Kosovo. (Blic, Vecernje novosti - 05/07/07; Tanjug, RTS, RTK, Telegrafi, Balkanweb, RFE - 04/07/07)

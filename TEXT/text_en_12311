SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Paddy Ashdown, the international community's top representative in BiH, said Thursday (10 February) that Bosnian authorities should take over full responsibility before the election in 2006. He added that this would become possible if the country dramatically improves its co-operation with the UN tribunal. Extradition of fugitives coupled with consolidation of the two Bosnian entities' armed forces and police could lead to Euro-Atlantic integration, Ashdown said.
However, he also reproached Republika Srpska (RS) on Thursday, saying RS must stop behaving as if it were a state and not an entity. Officials in RS had criticised BiH Council of Ministers' Chairman Adnan Terzic's visit to Brussels earlier this week.
Also Thursday, BiH Presidency member Sulejman Tihic discussed defence sector reforms with Brigadier General Steven Schook, the commander of NATO Headquarters in Sarajevo. They focused on what must be done to join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme. (Reuters, FENA, OHR press release - 10/02/05)

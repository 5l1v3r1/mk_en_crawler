THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The former head of Serbia's secret service, Jovica Stanisic, was declared fit for trial Wednesday (April 9th), clearing the way for proceedings on Monday. The trial against Stanisic, 57, who is charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Balkan conflicts, was delayed on April 2nd for the third time. The delays were based on his medical conditions: he suffers from pouchitis and kidney stones and is being treated for depression. He and co-defendant Franko Simatovic will be tried on charges of murder and the deportation of Croats, Bosnian Muslims, Bosnian Croats, and other non-Serb civilians in Croatia and Bosnia between 1991 and 1995.

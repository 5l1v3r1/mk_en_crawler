ZAGREB, Croatia -- British Minister for Europe Dennis MacShane said in an interview published in <I>Jutarnji List</I> on Saturday (10 April) that London would continue to block the start of Croatia's accession talks with the EU until Zagreb improves its co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. He was referring in particular to the international community's demands for the arrest of fugitive retired General Ante Gotovina. "Many European countries, not only Britain, consider the present level of co-operation . an obstacle in the process of Croatia's accession," MacShane said. Gotovina is charged with the murders of at least 150 Serb civilians during an operation at the end of the 1991-1995 conflict. MacShane dismissed the idea that Croatia cannot locate Gotovina and deliver him to The Hague. (AFP, HINA, B92 - 10/04/04)

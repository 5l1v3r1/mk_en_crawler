SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) is urging the Federation of BiH (FBiH) House of Representatives to withhold the election of a new entity cabinet until the OHR completes the vetting process for ministerial candidates. OHR spokesman Oleg Milisic stressed on Wednesday (March 21st) that the verification of nominees' backgrounds is crucial in preventing potential conflict of interests or incompetence. The OHR received the list of candidates on March 9th, more than five months after the BiH general elections. (Dnevni avaz, Nezavisne novine - 22/03/07)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Parliament voted on Tuesday (1 July) to set up a special prosecutor's office to investigate war crimes committed in Serbia and to improve co-operation with the UN tribunal in The Hague. The law also provides a legislative basis for holding war crimes trials in the country.
In other news Tuesday, the UN tribunal announced that Belgrade has extradited Veselin Sljivancanin, a former Yugoslav Army colonel accused of complicity in the 1991 murders of 200 civilians in Vukovar, Croatia. He was the last member of the so-called "Vukovar Three" at large. (Reuters, AFP, B92, BBC, FoNet, Tanjug - 01/07/03)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The war crimes court on Friday (July 3rd) sentenced former Bosnian Serb army commander Momir Savic to 18 years in prison for crimes against Muslims committed early in the 1992-1995 conflict, media reported. Savic was found guilty of persecution, murder, imprisonment, rape and other inhumane acts. The atrocities were committed in the eastern towns of Visegrad and Rudo between April and September 1992, when Savic was a member of a Bosnian Serb paramilitary unit.
Also Friday, a court in Banja Luka found two Bosnian Serbs guilty of killing a Muslim couple in the northwestern town of Prijedor in March 1994. The two defendants, Dusan Gagic and Mladen Popovic, were sentenced to ten years each. (Nezavisne Novine, Reuters, AFP, Radio 202 - 03/07/09)

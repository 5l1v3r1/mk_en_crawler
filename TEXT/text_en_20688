BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Constitutional Court approved on Wednesday (November 7th) the proposal to organise a referendum on the majority voting system on the same day as the European Parliament elections. The court ruled that a complaint filed by the Greater Romania Party (PRM) against President Traian Basescu's decision on the issue was ungrounded. The PRM said Basescu had breached his constitutional obligation to consult with parliament on a referendum before calling for it. Moreover, according to the PRM, the president's decree violated the referendum laws by not clearly stipulating a date for the referendum. The Constitutional Court's decision is final.

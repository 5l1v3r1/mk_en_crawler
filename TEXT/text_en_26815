ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in Istanbul on Tuesday (March 9th) convicted a British artist of publishing a caricature deemed insulting to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Michael Dickinson, 59, who has been living in Turkey for the past 20 years, depicted Erdogan as a dog with a US flag as his leash. The court sentenced him to pay a fine of $4,500 rather than serve jail time. (AFP, BBC - 09/03/10)

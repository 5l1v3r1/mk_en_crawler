THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Slobodan Milosevic questioned his first defence witness at the UN tribunal on Tuesday (16 November). Professor Mihajlo Markovic, an expert on the ideology of the Serbian Socialist Party, took the stand to deliver a long lecture on the history of Yugoslavia. Before the hearing, Presiding Judge Patrick Robinson laid down the ground rules for Milosevic's defence, stressing that the defendant is not to make speeches but confine himself to questioning witnesses.

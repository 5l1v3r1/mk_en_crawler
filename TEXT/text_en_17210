ANKARA, Turkey -- The National Security Council (MGK) met in Ankara on Thursday (December 28th), for talks focused on the country's EU accession bid and terrorism. Afterwards, the top civilian and military leaders issued a statement reiterating Turkey's commitment to EU integration and the reform agenda. The MGK maintained, however, that Turkey is correct regarding Cyprus. It accused the EU of imposing criteria on Turkey that were not applied to previous candidate countries. A dispute over opening Turkish airports and ports to Cyprus has led the EU to suspend some chapters of Turkey's accession talks.
In other news, Turkey will borrow $5.5 billion in international markets in 2007 compared with $5.9 billion this year, according to an announcement Thursday. Economy Minister Ali Babacan said that fighting inflation would remain the government's top goal, despite the fact that both parliamentary and presidential elections are scheduled for next year.

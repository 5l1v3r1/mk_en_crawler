SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A spokesman for Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in BiH, said on Friday (18 April) that the EU will soon announce a visa ban on 100 individuals who are suspected of helping war crime suspects evade justice. The spokesman said 25 of these people are from BiH. "A visa ban list is part of a wider spectrum that includes financial sanctions and the ability of authorities to detain and arrest suspects," he explained. The only known people on the black list so far are Milovan Bjelica and Momcilo Mandic, Bosnian Serb businessmen suspected of financing Radovan Karadzic. Washington has placed a visa ban on them and has ordered their assets be frozen in the United States. Mandic was arrested in Serbia last week on charges of involvement in organised crime.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A local police chief and an ethnic Albanian gunman were killed in a shootout near the border with Kosovo on Monday (September 10th). Two police officers and two gunmen were also injured. The incident occurred in the village of Vaksinci, where an ethnic Albanian insurgency began in 2001. The gunfight started when several men opened fire at a police patrol and officers returned fire. One wounded gunman crossed into Kosovo where he was arrested and hospitalised in Pristina. Macedonian authorities identified him as Zaim Halili, nephew of a former guerrilla who was captured recently after escaping from prison in Macedonia. 
On Monday, parliament met in emergency session to discuss the security situation. Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska downplayed the shootout, describing it as a clash with criminals. (Dnevnik, Vecer, Utrinski Vesnik, Reuters, AFP, AKI, UPI, BBC - 10/09/07; MIA, Makfax, A1 TV - 09/09/07)

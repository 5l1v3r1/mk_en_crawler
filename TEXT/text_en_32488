TETOVO, Macedonia -- Social Affairs Minister Jovan Manasievski says that conditions are in place which would allow displaced persons from Tearce, Lesok and Neprosteno to return home. A total of 160 displaced persons from the three Tetovo villages live at so-called collective centres, having fled their homes during the 2001 military conflict. Manasievski, who visited the former crisis area Thursday (13 March), stressed that all security and social conditions needed for return have been implemented and that reconstruction activities are nearly complete.

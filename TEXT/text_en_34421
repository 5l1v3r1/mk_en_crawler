BUCHAREST, Romania -- The National Control Authority (ANC) and the General Prosecutor's Office have started scrutinising 7,100 corruption, tax evasion and fraud files, according to an ANC press release Thursday (16 October). The files were logged between 2001 and 2003 by the financial guard authority, the customs directorate, the anti-money laundering office and the privatisation authority.
In other news, government Secretary General Serban Mihailescu said Thursday that he has dismissed government adviser Virgil Teodorescu amid allegations of corruption. A Swiss businessman of Romanian origin claims he had to bribe both Mihailescu and Teodorescu to win an investment project. The ANC has launched an investigation.
Also Thursday, it was announced that Romanian President Ion Iliescu would travel to Washington later this month to meet with his US counterpart, George W Bush, and senior cabinet members. (BBC, Mediafax, AFP - 16/10/03)

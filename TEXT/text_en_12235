BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic said Sunday (12 June) that he is willing to attend ceremonies next month marking the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Tadic said Serbia must face the consequences of a recent broadcast of a 1995 tape showing the executions of Srebrenica Bosniaks by the Scorpions paramilitary unit. 
On Friday, the Serbian Orthodox Church issued a statement condemning those involved in the murders of Bosniaks in Srebrenica and offered "sincere condolences for the suffering of innocent civilians". (Tanjug, Beta, Fena - 12/06/05)

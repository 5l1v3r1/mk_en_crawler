SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Court of BiH on Friday (February 18th) approved the extradition of Croatian war veteran Tihomir Purda to Serbia, a ruling that is subject to appeal. Purda was arrested in early January at the border between Croatia and BiH based on a Serbian arrest warrant. Belgrade suspects him of involvement in 1991 war crimes committed against Serbs in Vukovar. (RTRS, Nezavisne Novine, Hina, RTS, Tanjug - 18/02/11)

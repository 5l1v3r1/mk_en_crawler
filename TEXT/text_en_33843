BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Adrian Nastase proposed Tuesday (18 November) that the next parliamentary elections be held on 6 June, the same day local elections are planned, and that the presidential election be held six months later, in December. The opposition National Liberal Party and Democratic Party had suggested November rather than December, but Nastase says that would violate the recently amended constitution. President Ion Iliescu says he will consult with the parliamentary powers next week about the election timetable. (ACT Media, Rompres - 19/11/03; Mediafax, BBC - 18/11/03)

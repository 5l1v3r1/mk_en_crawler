BELGRADE, Serbia -- The condition of hunger-striking opposition leader Tomislav Nikolic is deteriorating, his doctors said on Monday (April 18th). The Serbian Progressive Party head stopped taking food and liquids on Saturday in order to push for early elections. On the second day of his strike, he was admitted to hospital. President Boris Tadic, leader of the senior ruling Democratic Party, has said he won't set a date for early elections before the European Commission decides on Serbia's EU candidate status.

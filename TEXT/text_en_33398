THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Four Bosnian Serb officers are due to appear before the UN tribunal on Tuesday (6 May) to stand trial for their alleged roles in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. Vidoje Blagojevic, Dragan Obrenovic, Momir Nikolic and Dragan Jokic are charged with participating in a "joint criminal enterprise" aimed at executing Muslim men and boys after the area was overrun by Serb rebel forces.

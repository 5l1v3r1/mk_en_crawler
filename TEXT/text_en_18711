NEW YORK, United States -- After meeting with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari said on Thursday (February 8th) that he hoped the Kosovo status issue would be resolved by the end of June -- that is, by the end of Germany's six-month EU presidency. He also indicated he could postpone the start of new negotiations on Kosovo by a week or ten days, but stressed that he intends to present his final plan to the UN Security Council in March. Ahtisaari said he expects "constructive amendment proposals" from Belgrade and Pristina during meetings later this month in Vienna. 
Meanwhile on Friday, Russia's Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that international efforts to resolve Kosovo's status must respect political realities inside Serbia and not set artificial deadlines. Separately, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov cautioned that Kosovo's independence could provoke a chain reaction. In talks Friday with German counterpart Franz Josef Jung during the NATO defence ministers' meeting in Seville, Spain, Ivanov said Kosovo independence could prompt similar demands from areas within the former Soviet region.

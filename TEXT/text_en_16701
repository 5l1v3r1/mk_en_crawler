They discussed future ties with Montenegro and the Kosovo isssue, particularly security concerns facing Serbs in the province.

In an interview with AP, meanwhile, Tadic announced that Serbia would make a proposal regarding Kosovo in a few days, offering "something between autonomy and independence". He added he was optimistic that a "very creative solution" could be achieved. (Blic, Politika - 09/06/06; AP, Reuters, Tanjug, AP - 08/06/06)

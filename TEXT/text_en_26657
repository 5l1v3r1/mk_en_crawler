BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister-designate Liviu Negoita announced his cabinet nominations Monday (November 9th), including 11 people Lucian Croitoru had tapped for posts before being rejected last week by parliament. Negoita proposed 14 ministers, just as Croitoru had. The ministries for SMEs, youth and sports, communications, liaison with parliament, and tourism have been merged into other ministries. "I hope that [parliament] will approve the government to give it full power and to be able to negotiate with international financial institutions," Negoita told a press conference. Opposition parties in parliament still back Klaus Johannis for prime minister, but President Traian Basescu refuses to nominate him. (AFP, Mediafax, Agerpres, Hotnews.ro - 09/11/09)

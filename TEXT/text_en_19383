ANKARA, Turkey -- The Constitutional Court on Tuesday (November 27th) rejected appeals from the main opposition parties seeking to overturn changes approved during the October 21st referendum. Tuesday's ruling paves the way for the election of the next president by a popular vote, instead of by parliament. Other reforms include reducing the presidential term from seven to five years, allowing the president to run for a second term, holding general elections every four years instead of five, and reducing the quorum of lawmakers needed for parliamentary decisions from 367 to 184.

A team of international biologists said it has discovered how a bacterium that can exist in extreme conditions is able to regenerate its damaged genome and survive. Four Croatian scientists formed the core of the team, whose results were published in Nature magazine. Deinococcus radiodurans, discovered 50 years ago, can outlast extremely high exposures to heat ionising radiation. Understanding how it does this could lead to insights about how to treat human diseases, develop regenerative medicines and rejuvenate dead cells.

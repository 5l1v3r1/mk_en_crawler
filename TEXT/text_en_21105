TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi said on Thursday (November 1st) that Albania will not be the first country to recognise Kosovo's independence if the province unilaterally declares it after negotiations on final status end next month. Topi added that he doubts all EU-member states would recognise Kosovo, and said Albania would support any status definition backed by the international community.
In other news Thursday, Kosovo negotiating team member Veton Surroi predicted the province would gain independence within the next 100 days. "We are tired of negotiations ... by Christmas our parliament should make a decision on a date for independence," Surroi told a forum in Berlin titled "Crisis of Governance" and organised by the German intelligence services.

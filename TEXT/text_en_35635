THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- SFOR personnel in BiH nearly captured Bosnian Serb war crimes fugitive Radovan Karadzic after a three-day operation last month, chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte said Wednesday (4 February). She says Karadzic had been in Pale seeking medical assistance two hours before SFOR troops arrived.
In other news, the former head of the Yugoslav Armed Forces, Momcilo Perisic, denied he had been summoned to testify against Slobodan Milosevic at The Hague. Perisic, the current leader of the Movement for a Democratic Serbia, says he would co-operate with the tribunal but has not been asked to. (B92 - 04/02/04)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prosecutors in Ankara started an investigation Tuesday (December 22nd) against Ahmet Turk, leader of the recently outlawed pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP). The move came after Turk announced that the leader of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), Abdullah Ocalan, who is serving a life sentence in prison, has advised DTP's lawmakers to stay in parliament despite a ruling by the Constitutional Court that bans the party for ties to the PKK. That December 11th ruling was criticised by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the European Commission, and spurred a series of protest, some of them violent, in Kurd-dominated regions of Turkey. Last Friday, the DTP announced its lawmakers will stay in parliament, joining the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party. (Reuters, Turkish Press, Turkish Daily News - 22/12/09)

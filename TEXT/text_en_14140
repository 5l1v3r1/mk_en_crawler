BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said on Tuesday (14 February) that he expects more discipline among the ruling coalition to ensure parliamentary passage of a crucial anti-corruption bill. Last week the upper house unexpectedly rejected a government decree on restructuring the state anti-corruption body DNA. He urged coalition partners to co-ordinate efforts and muster the majority needed to pass the measure when the senate takes it up again. An EU monitoring mission arrives in Romania early next month.
In other news Tuesday, the lower house of parliament approved the government's agreement with the United States on the joint use of military facilities. It allows the Pentagon to deploy troops at the Mihail Kogalniceanu airbase and two other facilities. (Nine o'clock - 15/02/06; Romanian Government Web site - 14/02/06)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic said on Tuesday (April 10th) that his country would never accept an independent Kosovo. He reiterated Belgrade's proposal for new talks on the future of the province and its objections to the blueprint drawn up by former UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari. "The Ahtisaari plan is not the holy Bible," he said. "Serbia is open for a compromise ... but we are not ready to give up part of our integrity and identity." At the same time, however, he said Serbia must avoid a conflict with the EU. "I will do all in my power to secure a European future for Serbia. That would secure progress and prevent long-term stagnation," he said. 
In other news Tuesday, a spokesman for the Kosovo government said there is no need for the UN Security Council to send a fact-finding mission to Pristina and Belgrade, as Russia requests. He argued that all such a mission could possibly accomplish is to witness the progress made in the province. (Blic, Danas, Glas javnosti - 11/04/07; AP, Ria Novosti, AFP, Beta, Tanjug - 10/04/07)

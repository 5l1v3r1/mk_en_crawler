ATHENS, Greece -- The prosecution on Wednesday (January 26th) ordered an investigation to determine how more than 200 illegal immigrants were allowed to occupy an Athens University building, where they launched a hunger strike Tuesday. They had come from the island of Crete to the Athens University's Law School, which by law, is off limits to police. The protestors seek legal residence and work status, but the government has rejected their demands. University authorities and police have been exchanging accusations over the incident. On Wednesday, the opposition urged parliament to change the law preventing police from entering university facilities without special permission. (AP, CNA - 26/01/11)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliament approved on Friday (December 11th) a law that sets a limit on the maximum number of employees in local administration as part of the government's public sector downsizing plan. Overall, the bill envisions the dismissal of 5,648 of 37,789 local administration employees. Under the draft, local administration staff cannot exceed 10% of the number of citizens in one municipality. Layoffs will affect 110 municipalities, while 35 municipalities will be safe. The parliament has already approved a bill on the maximum number of employees in state administration that would lead to cuts of 2,784, or less than 10% of the jobs there. 
The two laws along with a pension and salary freeze are the main tools the government will use in order to constrain the 2010 public finance deficit to 4% of GDP, down from 4.5% in 2009 as agreed with the IMF. (Kurir - 12/12/09; B92, Vecernje Novosti - 11/12/09)

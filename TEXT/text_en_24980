SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Most of Bulgaria's opposition parties filed suit at the country's Constitutional Court on Thursday (April 30th), seeking to overturn controversial changes to election law. They were joined by the National Movement for Stability and Progress (NDSV), a ruling coalition member. 
The parties object to three aspects of the amended law. It raises the threshold for coalitions to enter parliament from 4% to 8%, does not stipulate what happens to the seat of an independent MP if he or she joins the cabinet and introduces 31 seats that are elected through direct popular vote, rather than via party lists.

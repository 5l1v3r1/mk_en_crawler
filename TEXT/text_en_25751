ATHENS, Greece -- The trial against a police officer charged with killing a 15-year-old boy in December 2008 was adjourned immediately after it opened on Wednesday (January 20th), amid strong security measures in Amfissa. More than 400 police officers have been dispatched to the small mountain town, about 200km west of Athens, where officer Epaminondas Korkoneas, 38, is charged with killing Alexis Grigoropoulos. The boy's death spurred a wave of protests and violence throughout the country more than a year ago. Korkoneas has been in custody ever since. A second police officer, Vassilios Saraliotis, 32, is charged with being an accomplice. The trial is being held in Amfissa due to "security concerns". (AP, BBC, ANA-MPA, AFP, Madata - 20/01/10)

ATHENS, Greece -- Greece will not accept any attempts to block the accession of Cyprus to the EU, said Prime Minister Costas Simitis on Friday (29 November) in a speech to leaders of the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement. He added that Athens would oppose any procedural tactic that might delay Cyprus' entry in the Union. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has submitted a proposal to reunify the divided island, which Simitis says is more advantageous to the Greek side. (ANA - 30/11/02; ANA - 29/11/02)

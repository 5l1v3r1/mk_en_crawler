SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Serb presidency member Nebojsa Radmanovic on Friday (March 12th) threatened that he and other Serbs might quit the government due to Bosniak support for former presidency member Ejup Ganic. Ganic was arrested on March 1st at London's Heathrow Airport, based on a warrant issued by Belgrade. He was later released on bail, pending an extradition hearing next month. Serbia wants to prosecute Ganic in connection with a May 1992 attack in Sarajevo against a Yugoslav National Army convoy, which left more than 40 soldiers dead. Bosniak presidency member Haris Silajdzic openly criticised the United Kingdom for allegedly mistreating Ganic while he was under arrest, then flew to London to show his support for the ex-president. While there, Silajdzic met with British Foreign Secretary David Miliband and asked him to apologise for the way Ganic was treated. Radmanovic said on Friday that Silajdzic had not consulted the other two members of the tripartite presidency before flying to London. (AP, B92, Beta, SRNA, AFP - 12/03/10)

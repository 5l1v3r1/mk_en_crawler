BUCHAREST, Romania -- At least eight people have died and some 2,500 have been infected with measles in Romania, Health Minister Eugen Nicolaescu said Monday (28 November). The government has shut down the Centre for Disease Control for failing to inform authorities of the epidemic earlier. Nicolaescu says his ministry learned of the outbreak from the media.
Also Monday, Romanian teachers finally ended their general strike. The government and the teachers' union struck a deal on a pay raise, allowing schools to reopen Tuesday. (Nine o'clock, Rompres - 29/11/05; AP - 28/11/05)

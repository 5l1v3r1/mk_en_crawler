PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prime Minister-designate Igor Luksic told parliament Tuesday (December 28th) that his government will work to continue the economic policies of Milo Djukanovic's cabinet and achieve the twin goals of EU and NATO membership. He said his team will also stress neighbourly relations and regional co-operation, while ramping up the fight against organised crime and corruption and implementing judicial reforms. He also presented a more streamlined cabinet, featuring 17 ministers compared to the previous 19.

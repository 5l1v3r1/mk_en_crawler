ZAGREB, Croatia -- A law regulating the seizure of illegally gained assets entered into force on Saturday (January 1st). The legislation, adopted by parliament on December 15th, is seen as essential to fighting organised crime and corruption. It regulates the confiscation of unlawfully gained property and its transfer into state ownership based on final court decisions. A request for confiscation of such property could be filed before, during or after criminal proceedings against suspects. The law also requires banks to provide data about the financial assets of those accused of crimes. (Hina, tportal.hr, Radio Free Europe - 01/01/11)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- US President George Bush wrapped up his visit to Croatia on Saturday (April 5th). In Zagreb's St. Marko Square, he gave an address to around 3,500 people, including state and government leaders of Croatia, Albania and Macedonia. Bush said he hoped Macedonia, which saw its bid blocked because of a name dispute with Greece, would be able to join NATO as soon as possible. He also backed eventual NATO membership for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia.
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, who spoke before Bush's address, said his country was ready to help its neighbours on the path towards NATO and EU integration. "Our friends in Macedonia can rely on our support," Sanader said, pledging to help find a solution to the name dispute. (Jutarnij List, Makfax, AFP, ITAR-TASS - 05/04/08)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government signed an agreement Thursday (July 17th) to buy two used naval frigates from the Finnish company Patria. The total value of the deal is 10m euros. The order is part of Croatia's efforts to modernise its fleet and bring it in compliance with NATO standards. The country received an invitation to join NATO in April during the Alliance's Bucharest summit. As part of Thursday's agreement, Patria agreed to train Croatian sailors and provide technology and spare parts for the next ten years. (AFP, HRT - 17/07/08)

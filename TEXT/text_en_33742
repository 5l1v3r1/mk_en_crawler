BUCHAREST, Romania -- The small Humanitarian Party (PUR) decided on Saturday (30 August) to withdraw from the ruling coalition led by the Social Democratic Party (PSD), citing "arrogance" and PSD's alleged failure to meet its obligations under the collaboration agreement. PUR leader Dan Voiculescu said his party would run independently in future general elections.
In other news, the leaders of the major opposition parties -- Traian Basescu of the Democratic Party and Theodor Stolojan of the National Liberal Party -- agreed at the end of last week to co-operate in elections.
On Friday, meanwhile, US Ambassador to NATO Nicholas Burns visited Romania and praised the achievements made in its accession effort. He added that Romania has become one of the most serious partners of the United States and NATO in Europe and is turning into a regional leader in the Balkans.

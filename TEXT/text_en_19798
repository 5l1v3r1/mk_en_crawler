TIRANA, Albania -- OSCE experts presented five proposals Tuesday (November 20th) that could be used to reform the country's electoral system. The plans, based loosely on the German, Greek, Spanish and Bulgarian models, would boost the number of lawmakers in parliament and change the threshold required to win seats. The Commission for Electoral Reforms will discuss the issue Thursday. (Koha Jone, Shqip, Standard, Tema - 21/11/07)

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Wrapping up a three-day visit to Turkey Tuesday (8 March), EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn called for continuation of the reform process, repeating his belief that EU membership is an attainable goal for the country. During a meeting with local business leaders, Rehn said a radical change of mindset is an essential part of the process and it is in everyone's interest for reforms to continue. He added that the months ahead would involve extensive preparations on both sides for the planned start of EU membership talks with Turkey on 3 October. Rehn, who also visited a rehabilitation centre Tuesday for victims of torture, again urged decisive measures to halt the practice. (EU Web site, AFP, TurkishPress.com, NTV - 08/03/05)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said on Saturday (12 April) that his government sees no need to send troops into Iraq at this time. Turkey has been opposed to allowing Kurdish forces to occupy the cities of Kirkuk and Mosul. Gul's statement followed reports that Kurdish fighters were moving out of both cities, as agreed upon with the United States. He signaled, however, that intervention was still possible if Turkey's concerns about northern Iraq were not addressed. The international media reports that Central Command was sending reinforcements to tighten US control over the two cities. Turkey sent 15 military observers to northern Iraq on Friday to monitor developments on the ground. (AFP, CNN - 12/04/03; Anadolu Agency, NTV, AFP - 11/04/03)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- Wrapping up a two-day visit to Pristina on Saturday (18 January), a World Bank delegation said it would continue to support projects in Kosovo. The funds extended to the province are administered through UNMIK rather than the government. Bank officials assert that while they cannot lend money directly to Kosovo, due to its undefined status, the Bank remains committed to assisting in the development of the province.

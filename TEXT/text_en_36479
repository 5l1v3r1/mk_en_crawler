SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown has appointed BiH Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic as a co-chairman of the Defence Reform Commission (DRC). Chairman James R. Locher said Tuesday (11 May) that the appointment was motivated by the belief that the ultimate responsibility for implementing DRC's recommendations for reforms lies with BiH authorities, monitored by the international community.

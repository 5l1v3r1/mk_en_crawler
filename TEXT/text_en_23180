TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi sent a controversial bill back to parliament for review on Wednesday (April 30th). The measure, stipulating changes to the law on property legalisation, is aimed at curbing pervasive illegal construction. Opposition lawmakers criticised the amendments, as had members of the Republican Party, which is part of the ruling coalition. The main objection stems from the planned transfer of competencies from the local authority to a legalisation agency and the passage of the amendments even though fewer than half of all parliament members voted. This marks the first time Topi returned a bill approved by the majority that elected him. (VOA, BBC, Tema, BallkanWeb - 30/04/08)

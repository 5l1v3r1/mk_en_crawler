TIRANA, Albania -- By the end of June, the government will forward a proposal for supplemental spending to Parliament, Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on Thursday (June 7th). The extra money would allow for a substantial hike in the wages of those working in the education and health sectors, as well as for police and army personnel. Berisha says the raises are proof of successful reforms. (Balkanweb, Shekulli - 07/06/07)

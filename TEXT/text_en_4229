After almost ten years, the bombed-out former Serbian interior ministry (MUP) building in central Pristina still reminds passersby of the 1990s conflict and the NATO action in the former Serbian province. NATO bombers struck Pristina in March 1999. 
Nehat Islami, a journalist and a Kosovo minister of information in the former Yugoslavia, remained in Pristina with his family during the conflict. He reflected on the past as he gazed over the ruins of the old MUP building. 
"The night we heard that NATO bombed MUP was one of the happiest in my life. This building was a symbol of horror, torture and suffering," said Islami. "We did not dare to turn the lights on in our apartment in case [the paramilitaries] saw the lights and came." 
The government's latest decision signifies someday the ruins of the MUP building will no longer be an eyesore with painful associations. 
At the end of August, senior Kosovo officials visited the location and decided to reconstruct the building to serve as the headquarters of their new interior ministry. Assembled European Commission and Kosovo officials laid the foundation stone. The project is a joint undertaking of the EC and the Kosovo government 
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said the plan reflects the return of dignity to Kosovo institutions. According to him, it will mark a "separation from the sites and the mentality of the past". 
EC liaison office head Renzo Daviddi said the EC would contribute 1.5m euros to the project. 
The new headquarters are scheduled to open in September 2009. The Kosovo Information Centre says it will be a 4,700-square-metre, five-storey building.

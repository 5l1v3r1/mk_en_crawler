BELGRADE, Serbia -- Leaders of the opposition Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), Tomislav Nikolic and Vojislav Kostunica, confirmed at a joint press conference Monday (September 20th) that their parties have common goals which include protecting Serbia's territorial integrity and calling snap elections. They also agreed on the need to abandon policies aimed at EU membership at any cost. However, Nikolic insisted his SNS supports Serbia's EU integration. He also denied rumours of a possible coalition between the two parties before the next elections, in 2012. (Tanjug, B92 - 20/09/10)

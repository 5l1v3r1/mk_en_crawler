PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen visited Serb minority-populated areas in Kosovo on Saturday (9 October) and found mixed progress in the returns process, according to a statement on the UN Web site. During the trip, KFOR Commander Lieutenant General Yves de Kermabon, accompanied Jessen-Petersen. While finding measurable progress in the village of Vidanje, Jessen-Petersen was disturbed with the situation confronting the Serb population in Bica. "In Kosovo in October 2004, a Kosovo that is determined to move towards review of standards and status talks, there â€¦ must be no places where people are forced to live behind barbed wires and protected by KFOR," he said. He vowed to intensify efforts for sustainable solutions. (UN Web site - 09/10/04)

Croatian President-elect Ivo Josipovic will take office in the midst of rising political tension between Zagreb and Belgrade. The situation has worsened with the refusal of Serbian President Boris Tadic to attend Josipovic's swearing in, if Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu is present. 
 Josipovic has said that he will invite the heads of all countries in the region to the ceremony. While Sejdiu confirmed that he will be there, Tadic announced, "It's either Sejdiu or me." 
Current problems between Serbia and Croatia began in the wake of Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia in February of 2008. Croatia recognised the new country a month later. 
Serbia and Croatia have filed mutual claims of genocide against another with the UN's International Court of Justice, and outgoing Croatian President Stipe Mesic recently made inflammatory statements about sending troops to Republika Srpska (RS) if the entity tries to secede from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
Belgrade officials termed Mesic's statement "another obvious provocation attempt". 
Before serving a day in office, Josipovic is trying to stay out of it, saying he will work for good relations with all of Croatia's neighbours, while noting that, "sending Croatian troops to a neighbouring country is not an option for me."

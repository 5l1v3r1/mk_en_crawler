PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The deputy leader of the opposition nationalist Democratic Party of Kosovo Bajram Rexhepi suggested that parliament might unilaterally declare independence, if delays continue in resolving the status issue. "We will wait two or three months at maximum, and if Russia decides to use its veto against [UN envoy Martti] Ahtisaari's proposal, the Kosovo parliament will announce independence," Rexhepi told the Serbian TV station Palma Plus on Sunday (June 24th). The former prime minister said he would expect Western countries to recognise any independence declaration. (Kohajone - 25/06/07; Telegrafi, RTK, RFE - 24/06/07)

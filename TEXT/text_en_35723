BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Nine people accused in the murder of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic will stand trial later this month, according to local media reports Monday (2 February). Stambolic, once considered Slobodan Milosevic's mentor, disappeared while jogging in a Belgrade park in August 2000. His body was found last year, during the police crackdown that followed the assassination of Zoran Djindjic. Milorad Lukovic Legija, a police special operations commander, will be tried in absentia when the proceedings open on 23 February.
Milosevic is accused of ordering Stambolic's murder, but his case has been separated from the others because he is currently standing trial in The Hague. A spokesman there says his war crimes trial has been delayed again, this time because Milosevic has the flu.
On Tuesday, the war crimes trial of the former speaker of the Bosnian Serb Parliament, Momcilo Krajisnik, opens. He is charged with genocide and masterminding a campaign of ethnic cleansing against non-Serbs during the Bosnian conflict from 1992 to 1995. (BBC World - 03/02/04; AFP, Reuters - 02/02/04)

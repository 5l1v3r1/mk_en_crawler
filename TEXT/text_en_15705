THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- UN war crimes tribunal prosecutors are satisfied with the level of co-operation shown by Montenegro over the years, said prosecution spokesman Anton Nikiforov at a news conference Wednesday (24 May). He specified that co-operation with Podgorica was direct and separate from "everything that was going on with or through Belgrade". As soon as the results of the Montenegrin independence referendum are officially confirmed, the tribunal will make separate assessments of co-operation for Serbia and Montenegro, the spokesman added. The EU is also preparing to split the Stabilisation and Association Agreement negotiation mandates for Belgrade and Podgorica. (ICTY Web site, Tanjug, B92 - 24/05/06)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The foreign ministry announced on Tuesday (August 17th) it has declared a Russian diplomat a persona non grata and has told him to leave Romania within 48 hours. According to the statement, the official is a first secretary-level diplomat at the Russian Embassy in Bucharest. The move came a day after the Federal Security Service in Moscow announced the arrest of a Romanian diplomat suspected of spying. Gabriel Grecu, first secretary in the political department of Romania's Embassy in Russia, was arrested as he allegedly tried to obtain secret military information from a Russian citizen. Romania's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday condemned what it called the "grave violation" by Russian authorities of the provisions of the Vienna Convention during Grecu's arrest. The ministry also expressed firm disagreement with the way Russia made the issue public. (CNN, Xinhua, Mediafax - 17/08/10)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo village of Mala Krusa stoned a UN convoy carrying Serbian defence lawyers accredited by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on Thursday (25 May). Three police officers and one translator were injured, as well as several protestors. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowd of mostly women. According to a local official, the incident occurred because "the villagers thought the UN police were trying to ensure the return of Serbs to the village". The area, where Serbian forces killed more than 100 ethnic Albanian men during the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict, is mentioned in several indictments before the ICTY. 
UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen condemned Thursday's attack, saying he was outraged and disappointed. "There should be respect for the rule of law," he added. (UNMIK Web site, Reuters - 25/05/06)

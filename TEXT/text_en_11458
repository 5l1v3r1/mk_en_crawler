SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The ethnic Albanian opposition Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) threatened on Wednesday (20 April) to boycott parliament sessions, after the parliamentary majority rejected as groundless a move by DPA to have some local election results declared invalid. DPA, which did not participate in the recent run-offs, refuses to recognise the results of the first round in 16 mainly ethnic Albanian-populated municipalities. DPA accuses junior government partner Democratic Union of Integration of vote manipulation. 
In other news Wednesday, parliament started debating an opposition proposal for a no-confidence vote against Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva. Critics blame her, in part, for scandals at the ministry. (Makfax - 21/04/05; Telma TV, A1 TV - 20/04/05)

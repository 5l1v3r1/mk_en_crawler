STRASBOURG, France -- The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) rejected on Thursday (March 8th) a request by lawyers for Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned leader of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party. They had sought a preliminary ruling on claims that their client was being poisoned. The ECHR denied it without comment. Earlier this month, the PKK said hair samples indicated Ocalan was being systematically poisoned, claims that sparked a series of protests by PKK supporters in Turkey and abroad. The government denies the allegations. (Zaman - 10/03/07; NTV - 09/03/07)

ATHENS, Greece -- Police used tear gas on Wednesday (March 19th) to disperse protesters in a nationwide strike against the government's planned pension reforms, which are due to be voted on by parliament Thursday. Around 100,000 people gathered in downtown Athens to rally against proposals that critics say will cut retirement benefits while raising the age of retirement. A group of self-proclaimed anarchists threw stones and petrol bombs at police after the rally, and police used tear gas to disperse them. Millions of employees from both the private and public sectors joined the strike. 
In other news, an earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale shook northern Greece early Thursday. The epicentre was in the sea off Skyros island, about 115km northwest of Athens. No injuries or damage were reported. (AP, RBC - 20/03/08; RIA Novosti, BBC, Famagusta Gazette, AP, AFP - 19/03/08)

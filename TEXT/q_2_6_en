V. ECONOMIC AND STRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENTS AND REFORMS 

1. How has domestic consensus on the fundamentals of economic policies been secured? To what extent are social partners involved in the decision-making process? Are there consultative bodies involved in the co-ordination of economic policies? 
The consensus on fundamentals of the economic policy is achieved at several levels, one being the political consensus among participants in the Government, supplemented by the social consensus at a tri-partite level between the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, the Association of Trade Unions and the Chamber of Commerce. In the process of formulating the fundamentals of the economic policy the Government of the Republic of Macedonia ensures social consensus trough the Economic and Social Council. The Economic and Social Council was established by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, the Association of Trade Unions of Macedonia and the Chamber of Commerce of Macedonia, with the purpose of achieving the basic values of the Constitution with respect to the democratic and social state, more harmonious development of social processes, promotion of social dialogue, tri-partite system and implementation of international conventions and recommendations. The Council has an advisory role in the social dialogue, but it also has a negotiating role for the economic and social issues of interest to the Republic of Macedonia. In addition, the Council elaborates certain issues and provides opinions, proposals and recommendations on certain issues in the areas of:    Economic policy and measures for economic and social stability and development;   Prices and salaries policy;   Labour and social security;   Collective bargaining and collective agreements;  Living standard;  Employment;   Working conditions and protection at work;   Education, culture and professional training;   Financial, credit and tax policy;   Pension and disability insurance etc. In addition to the members nominated from Government, Trade Union Association and the Chamber of Commerce, the Council itself nominates several experts as its members. Experts or representatives of other institutions (depending on the topic of discussion) can be also invited to attend Councils sessions. For certain issues the Council constitutes permanent or ad-hoc working bodies. Pursuant to Article 28 of its Rules of Procedure (“Official Gazette of RM” No.38/2001, 98/2002, 9/2003, 47/2003, 64/2003 and 67/2003), the Government of the Republic of Macedonia has also set up a special Economic Council as a consultative body which, upon request from the Government, or on its own initiative, considers issues from the domain of economic policy. The Economic Council consists of members of the Government, as well as experts and prominent businessmen. The role of the Council is to provide consensus on the fundaments of the economic policy, thus contributing to its successful implementation. 
2. How has the co-ordination between line ministries, the Ministry of Finance and/or the central bank for the formulation of economic policy (including the macroeconomic policy-mix) and its implementation been carried out? 
The coordination of activities between line ministries is provided in the Government of the Republic of Macedonia i.e. on the State Secretaries Collegium (General Collegium) sessions. This Collegium consists of the State Secretaries of all ministries. All papers and documents prepared by line ministries, which should be reviewed and adopted by the Government, are, at initial instance, reviewed and coordinated by services in the Government. Final coordination is made on the General Collegium sessions, as last instance in the harmonisation process.  The cooperation between the ministries proceeds in process of preparation of the Macroeconomic policy of the Government. This document outlines the short term economic program of the Government stating the main priorities of its activity in the economy. The Macroeconomic policy includes a consistent macroeconomic framework and defined set of macroeconomic policies. By October each year, the line ministries are obligated to submit to the Ministry of Finance an overview of their planned policies, measures and activities. In next two months the process progresses towards harmonisation and coordination of the activities and the priorities among the line ministries, with a final document completed by the end of the year.   Fiscal and Monetary Policy Coordination Committee facilitates the coordination among the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (the Ministry of Finance) and the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia. This Committee has been established to provide efficient implementation of Government’s Macroeconomic policy and the NBRM Decision on the Goals of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Policy. It comprises of 6 members, three of which are representatives from the Ministry of Finance (the Deputy Minister, the State Secretary and the Head of the Treasury), and three Vice-Governors of NBRM. The Committee meets at least once a month to analyse and discuss the main economic trends in the country.  The coordination between the Ministry of Finance and NBRM proceeds also at lower level in (1) the Budget Liquidity Commission of the Republic of Macedonia (established in Ministry of Finance) which comprises of representatives from the Ministry of Finance, NBRM, Public Revenue Office and Customs Administration and (2) NBRM’s Commissions - Denar Liquidity Planning Commission and Foreign Exchange Liquidity Planning Commission, both including representatives from the Ministry of Finance
3. How is co-ordination of the main producers of statistical data (Statistical office, Central bank, Ministry of Finance) carried out? What are the plans to enhance the reliability and mutual compliance of statistical data? (see also chapter 12 – Statistics) 
PRESENT SITUATION 
Pursuant to the Law on State Statistics (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 54/1997) the implementation of the statistical system of the Republic of Macedonia involves:   The State Statistical Office as a coordinator of the production of the official statistics in Republic of Macedonia;    The authorised providers which, within their competences, conduct statistical research surveys determined by the Statistical Research Programme;    The Statistical Council of Republic of Macedonia, established as an expert advisory body for state statistics.   The State Statistical Office is a coordinator of the official statistics in the Republic of Macedonia and conducts most of the research determined by the Programme. The currently effective Statistical Research Programme (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 69/2003) refers to the 2003 - 2007 period. The authorised data providers in the state statistical system of Republic of Macedonia are presented below and they conduct statistical research specified in the five-year Statistical Research Programme.   Authorised data providers in line with the Statistical Research Programme are:   National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia;   State Health Protection Institute;   Ministry of Interior;  Hydro-Meteorological Directorate;   Pension and Disablement Insurance Fund of the Republic of Macedonia;   Employment Agency of the Republic of Macedonia; and   Ministry of Justice.  The State Statistical Office (SSO)cooperates with the authorised providers in order to provide unified and harmonised statistical production system trough:   Preparation of a five year Statistical Research Programme;   Preparation of the Programme Implementation Annual Report;   Preparation of statistical standards of common interest;   Preparation of statistical regulations; This cooperation is coordinated by the SSO. In the process of preparation of programmes, data providers and data users, as well as line ministries (Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economy) are invited to participate on various round tables.  When certain statistical issues are of interest to a number of institutions joint inter-institutional groups are established with the purpose of exchanging ideas and resolving open issues. This model has been especially proven useful when discussing application of uniform standards in foreign trade, industry classifications and macroeconomic indicators between State Statistical Office, Ministry of Finance, National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia and other institutions (Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Labour and Social Policy etc.) Depending on the needs and (in certain cases) financial resources, joint projects are launched involving SSO and other institutions - e.g. SSO, MI and MoLSP for migrations, SSO and MoLSP for improvement of poverty monitoring, measuring and analysis, where the WB is also involved, etc. The specific projects are currently being implemented and the results are in line with expectations. In order to reduce the workload of the reporting units and to have cost efficient approach in the official statistics, SSO and authorised data providers enable mutual access to data collected for statistical purposes and specified in the Statistical Research Programme. For data exchange, State Statistical Office signs agreements with the authorised providers, which specify the data to be exchanged or provided, the purposes of use of the data and the protection requirements (such agreements are concluded with the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, the Pension and Disablement Insurance Fund of the Republic of Macedonia, the Ministry of Interior). Competent bodies, possessing administrative data bases, allow SSO to access the data, which they collect on the basis of other regulations, for the purpose of implementation of the Programme for Maintaining Statistical Registries. SSO signs contracts with the data providers for the use of the data. These contracts specify the data being provided, the purposes of use and requirements for protection. SSO may compile these data with other data collected for statistical purposes and store them in separate data bases.   In order to provide integrated approach in production of results, authorised data providers submit their results to SSO for publishing in integral publications (such as the Statistical Yearbook etc.). 
Statistical Council of the Republic of Macedonia 
The Statistical Council of the Republic of Macedonia is an expert advisory body in the area of the state statistics. The Council comprises of president and 12 members appointed by the Assembly the Republic of Macedonia with four-year term, selected from distinguished experts in the areas of statistics, economy, social sciences and political system. The director of the State Statistical Office attends the sessions of the Council ex officio, without membership status. The Council submits an annual report on its activities to the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia. The experiences from Council’s work as an advisory body in state statistics have been positive. The Council has provided essential contribution to the development and promotion of the state statistics in the Republic of Macedonia, by discussions and amendments to Statistical Research Programmes and other strategic documents prepared by the State Statistical Office, as well as by providing various proposals, guidelines and opinions. 
Working groups/commissions 
The Director of the State Statistical Office establishes expert working groups for providing opinions on the statistical system e.g. when preparing legislative projects, provision of expert assistance in the development of statistical methodologies, classifications, standards etc. 
Steps taken for compliance with the requirements 
Inter-Institutional cooperation will be intensified by establishing joint committees and other forms of cooperation in function of providing a transparent statistical production system of good quality, fully compliant with the EU requirements. See the more detailed description in 11HChapter 12 - Statistics
4. Public finances: How has the system of public finances been developed including extra-budgetary funds? How have government revenue and expenditure developed over time in terms of categories as well as total? What were the main sources for the expenditure growth and ensuing budget deficits? 
The system of public finances in the years after independence Since the Republic of Macedonia gained its independence, the system of public finances underwent significant reforms that reflected the political and the economic changes – the sovereignty of the country and the introduction of market economy. The outline of the system of public finances was initially set with the 1991 Law on the System of Financing General and Common Needs (“Official Gazette of RM”. No. 36/1991, 55/1991, 21/1992, 1/1993 and 19/1993), by which the system of financing the so-called general social needs in Republic of Macedonia and the common needs in the municipalities was regulated. The system of financing the Funds (the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund, the Health Insurance Fund of the Republic of Macedonia, the Employment Bureau of the Republic of Macedonia and the Road Fund) was regulated by separate laws in the respective areas.  The Law stipulates that the term general social needs - financed on state level – understands: functions of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and national bodies; defence; education, science and research activities, culture; physical and technical education, health care, social protection, nature and environment protection; investments in infrastructure and development etc. The common needs financed at municipal level were, basically, the following: financing the operations of the municipal assembly and the other municipal bodies, as well as other responsibilities of the municipality, i.e. the City, stipulated by law. Revenues for carrying out the listed functions of state and municipalities were provided from the following sources: A. Taxes: Income tax, i.e. profit tax, personal income tax of the employees, tax on revenues from international transport, tax on revenues from lottery prizes, products and services sales tax, tax on revenues from agricultural activity, tax on revenues from copyrights, patents and technical innovations, inheritance and gift tax and tax for environmental protection. B. Fees: Administrative and court fees. C. Other revenues set under the law. D. Customs fees and other import duties. Municipalities were entitled to the following revenues: tax on transfer of real estate and rights, property tax, property revenue tax and utility fees. The Law on the System of Financing General and Common Needs regulated, inter alia, the issues of preparation, adoption and execution of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia and the municipal budgets.  Public finance system reforms since 1994 As a result of the existing need for adjustment and harmonization of the system of public finances to existing in EU countries, in 1993, the Ministry of Finance, in cooperation with the IMF technical mission, began preparing new Budget Law, which was adopted in December 1993 and came into force on 01.01.1994. The Budget Law (“Official Gazette of RM”. No. 79/1993, 3/1994, 71/1996, 46/2000, 11/2001, 35/2001, 93/2001, 46/2002, 61/2002, 24/2003, 85/2003 and 96/2004) regulates the procedure of preparation, adoption and execution of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, the budgets of local self-government units and the budgets of the Funds. According to this Law, the Budget is an annual plan for financing the functions and responsibilities of the Republic of Macedonia, of the local self-government units and the Funds, and consists of an annual projection of revenues and expenditures classified by their purpose.  The annual projection refers to a 12-month fiscal year, beginning on 01.01 and ending on 31.12 of each calendar year, and applies only for the fiscal year for which it was adopted.  The Budget of the Republic of Macedonia comprises of funds of the budget beneficiaries, as well as the budgets of the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund; the Health Insurance Fund; the Road Fund and the Employment Agency of the Republic of Macedonia.  In terms of this Law, the budget beneficiaries are those recipients of funds from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia that are a part of the legislative, executive and judicial authorities. On the other hand, the institutions in the area of education and science, culture, child care, social protection, judiciary and prosecution, financed through the budget beneficiary in the respective area are called expenditure units.  According to the provisions of the Law, all revenues of the budget beneficiaries and their expenditure units, the local government units and the Funds are presented in their budgets. Liabilities and expenditures are executed in accordance with the regulations governing their execution, and within the projected expenditures presented in their budgets.  The budgets of the local self-government units and of the Funds cannot present budget deficit. Budget document in terms of this Law means: the Balance of revenues and expenditures; Functional classification of expenditures and Balance by organizational classification codes. The budget separately lists beneficiaries and purposes for use of the funds (economic and program classification), explanation on the budgets and sources for covering the budget deficit, the funds necessary for the next 2 years and regulations for budget execution.  The Ministry of Finance opens and keeps a treasury account with the holder of payment operations in the Republic of Macedonia for the financial resources of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, for the financial resources of the budget beneficiaries and the expenditure units (agency-collected revenues, revenues from self-financing activities, from donations and credits) and for all other financial resources.  The revenues of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia are provided from the following sources: A. Taxes (profit tax, personal income tax, value added tax and excise and other taxes set by law) B. Customs and other duties (taxes in international trade and transactions) C. Fees (administrative and court fees) D. Non-tax revenues (revenues from dividends of state-owned companies, fines, interest revenues from granted loans, interest revenues on bank deposits, revenues on surplus above the expenditures of National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia and other public levies stipulated by law) E. Revenues from domestic and foreign donations (in kind and money)  F. Other revenues to the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia from various sources in accordance with the law.     Key features of 1994 reform and afterwards: 1. The radical reform in the area of direct taxes, through the adoption of the Personal Income Tax Law (“Official Gazette of RM”  No. 30/1993, 3/1994, 70/1994, 71/1996, 28/1997, 8/2001, 2/2002, 44/2002 and 96/2004) and the Profit Tax Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 30/1993, 33/1995, 43/1995, 71/1996, 5/1997, 28/1998, 11/2001, 2/2002, 44/2002, 51/2003). Major reform was carried out in these two types of taxes in 2001, when, by redefining these forms of tax, the profit tax was fully distinguished from the personal income tax. These changes included a definition of the taxpayers under both grounds and in this manner, profit tax was introduced for all legal entities established or headquartered on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia, for the profit they earn in the country or abroad.  2. On 01.04.2000 Republic of Macedonia introduced the value added tax, thus building tax structure in accordance with the European legal model. The Value Added Tax Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 44/1999, 59/1999, 86/1999, 11/2000, 8/2001, 21/2003 and 19/2004) is in accordance with the Sixth Directive of the European Union and is compatible with the European model of this Law. 3. The new Law on Excises (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 32/2001, 50/2001, 52/2001, 45/2002, 98/2002, 24/2003 and 96/2004), in force as of 01.07.2001, is harmonized with the Directive 92/12/C of the European Union on excises, as well as with its accompanying structural directives for each type of goods subject to excise i.e. on mineral oils, tobacco products, vehicles and alcohol and alcoholic beverages. 
4. An important element in the regulation of the overall public revenue system is the introduction of the new customs tariff in 1996. Thus, this system could be considered as compatible with the public revenue systems of the developed countries. 
As of 2000, the Ministry of Finance started implementing significant reforms with the aim of improving the state budget execution process, strengthening the control over the use of budget funds and enhancing the transparency in the utilization of public revenues via introduction of the so-called public finance treasury system. The reforms were implemented in two phases.  
The first steps were made in 2000, when the Treasury Department was established within the Ministry of Finance. The second phase of the reform was carried out in 2001 and 2002, when the concept of “Single Treasury Account” was fully implemented, in accordance with the treasury system models of the developed countries.  In 2002 Treasury Department fully overtook the function of holder of payment operations for the Budget and the budget beneficiaries.  Treasury operation reforms continued in 2003 and 2004 and the main changes introduced include:   Introduction of accounting for commitment;    Issuance of treasury bills;    Further improvement of cash management.  In 2004, the extra-budgetary funds were fully integrated within the single treasury system. According to the plan, in second half of 2005, the local government units will have their own accounts within the Single Treasury Account.   
Extra-budgetary funds  
By the end of 2003, seven extra-budgetary funds operated in the Republic of Macedonia: The Pension and Disability Insurance Fund, the Employment Bureau (later Employment Agency), the Health Insurance Fund; the National and Regional Road Fund, the Water Fund, the Environment Fund and the Agriculture Fund. The modifications and amendments to the Budget Law in 2000 (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 46/2000) introduced a provision according to which the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia incorporates the funds of the budget beneficiaries, as well as the budgets of the Funds established by law. As of 2001, the budgets of the aforementioned Funds are contained in the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, as its integral parts. On the basis of legal regulations (adopted in 2003 and 2004), the Agriculture Fund, the Water Fund and the Environment Fund ceased operating, whereby their revenues were transformed into revenues of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia and their activities were merged into the existing programs of the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management. 
The Agriculture Fund was established in 2002, with the aim of supporting the development of agriculture by granting financial assistance, enabling the development and improvement of the production structure in agriculture, proposing new technologies, improving the quality of agricultural products, supporting the development of the domestic market and searching for external markets for agricultural products . In 2003, the utilization of the Fund’s sources of financing was limited, in order to ensure rational and purposeful utilization of the resources, thereby becoming Budget revenues, and the Fund was financed by transfers from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. The Fund ceased operating on 31.12.2003. 
The Environment Fund commenced operating in 1997 as a body within the Ministry of Environment, having status of legal entity with the purpose of providing financial resources for promotion of preventive and rehabilitation measures for environmental protection and promotion and preservation of the nature. In 2000, the Fund lost its status of a body within the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning and continued operating as an independent Environment Fund, the organization and operations of which were to be regulated with special law. Due to the negative implications on the Fund’s financial operations deriving from the unresolved status of the Fund (financial transfers with the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning), with the legislation amendments and modifications from 2004, the Fund’s revenues were incorporated into the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, the Fund ceased to exist as an independent entity, and its program activities were merged into the existing programs of the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning. In 2003, according to annual statement, Fund’s total revenues amounted MKD 67,3 million and expenditures MKD 51,4 million.  
The Water Fund was established in 1998 for the purpose of performing activities in the area of water protection, participation in the construction and maintenance of water management facilities, staff training in the area of water management, preparation of studies and plans, etc. To provide a more rational and purposeful utilization of resources, the 2004 Budget of the Republic of Macedonia incorporated the Fund’s revenues as Budget revenues, and the Fund’s activities were merged into the existing programs of the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning. 
The Employment Agency of the Republic of Macedonia (former Employment Bureau) is a public institution established by the Labour Relations Law and Insurance in case of unemployment (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 37/1997). This Law regulates the issues related to labour exchange, the rights and obligations of the employers, the unemployed and the state with regard to employment and unemployment insurance and other issues related to employment. During the last decade, the Agency began full modernization of the employment service and reorganization of departments, with the purpose of promoting activities for intermediation in employment, activities for training and re-qualification of the unemployed, as well as activities related to research, statistical monitoring and information support to the pro-active labour market policies. Main source of financing the activities of Employment Agency of the Republic of Macedonia is employment contribution amounting to 1.6% of the gross salary of each employed person. The Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia adopts the budget of the Employment Agency, as an integral part of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. Total revenues of the Employment Agency of the Republic of Macedonia for 2004 were set at the level of MKD 7.806.879.000 - 16,26% of which were revenues from employment contribution, 80,93% were transfers from the Budget, 2,48% were surplus revenues from previous fiscal year and 0,32% were other revenues. The resources for provision of assistance during unemployment, including financing of pro-active employment policies in 2004 were set at MKD 7.566.494.000 i.e. 96.92% of total expenditures. 




The current system of pension and disability insurance of the Republic of Macedonia is based on the Law on Pension and Disability Insurance (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 80/1993, 3/1994, 14/1995, 71/1996, 32/1997, 49/1997, 24/2000, 96/2000, 50/2001, 85/2003, 50/2004 and 4/2005). According to this Law, the pension and disability insurance is mandatory and it includes all the employed people and persons individually performing economic activities. It is a system of defined pensions paid under the pay-as-you-go principle, according to which current pensions are financed from the current contributions from the salaries of the employed persons. The Pension and Disability Insurance Fund of the Republic of Macedonia, established with this Law, performs the activities related to pension and disability insurance. The transition period and the reforms the Republic of Macedonia underwent during the past decade resulted in dramatic deterioration of the ratio between the number of active insurees and pension beneficiaries. This led to deficit in the Fund’s financing and this difference is covered with transfer of funds from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. 

Although the parametric reforms in the pensions system i.e. its rationalization, as well as all the other measures undertaken in the period 1993 - 2002 resulted in positive effects with regard to the Fund’s financial consolidation, the share of Budget transfers in its financing continuously increased from 17,5% in 1997 to 27,9% in 2003.  In order to ensure long-term sustainability of the pensions system in the country, the ongoing reform should lead to creation of a new pensions system based on three pillars:    compulsory pension and disability insurance on the basis of generational solidarity - first pillar;    mandatory capital funded pension insurance - second pillar, and     voluntary capital funded pension insurance - third pillar. Pursuant to the Health Insurance Law (“Official Gazette of R” No. 25/2000, 34/2000, 96/2000, 50/2001, 11/2002 and 31/2003), the mandatory health insurance in the Republic of Macedonia is implemented by the Health Insurance Fund of the Republic of Macedonia. The resources for financing the mandatory health insurance are provided from contributions on gross salaries of the employed persons, from pensions and other employment-related personal income, co-payment by insurees, from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, dividends, donations and other sources. Individual participation of the insured persons in the price of the health services and pharmaceuticals (co-payment) accounts for 3% to 4% in the total financing of the health care system. Funding from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia is allocated to the health care for implementation of special programs for preventive health care, protection from special diseases considered as social problem, treatment of persons not covered by the mandatory health insurance and health care of special population groups. These funds account for less than 1% in the total health care revenues.  The health care institutions acquire additional revenues directly from the individual uninsured beneficiaries of health services, from insured persons using health care services not included in the basic package of services or higher-standard health services, from contracts with enterprises for the provision of special health services to their employees, as well as other health services not covered by the Fund.  On the expenditure side, the major part of the Health Insurance Fund expenditures are made for hospital health care, followed by expenditures for specialist and consultative health care, primary health care, pharmaceuticals, etc. 
The National and Regional Road Fund was established in 1996 for the purpose of performing activities of planning, financing, construction, reconstruction, maintenance and protection of the national and regional roads in the Republic of Macedonia. The operations of the Road Fund in the field of the development and maintenance of the national and regional roads are defined in its Programs.  The financial resources for construction, reconstruction, maintenance and protection of public roads are provided from transfers from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia (share of excise on oil derivatives), road tolls, loans and other revenues. By 1993, the so-called road contribution, being an integral part of the fuel retail price was paid directly to Fund’s account. As of 01.01.1994, an excise tax on oil derivatives was introduced as budget revenue and later transferred from the Budget to the Fund. The Fund’s resources are allocated to finance the Program for construction, reconstruction, maintenance and protection of roads, for repayment of foreign credits, studies and projects, as well as maintenance of local roads and streets.  As of 2001, the National and Regional Road Fund prepare its own budget, adopted together with the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, as its integral part. As of 05.07.2004, the Road Fund transferred its bank account to the Single Treasury Account. 
Trends in the budget revenues and expenditures by years In the period 1997-2003, the total budget revenues grew by 34%, while the expenditure grew by approximately 35%, in nominal terms. Expressed in EUR, their amount in this period grew by approximately 23%. However, in relation to the GDP, their share is almost unaltered and remains on the level of around 34%; this also applies to their value expressed in USD. A. Budget revenues by category Indirect taxes are traditionally most significant source of budget revenues. Their share during the observed period ranges between 40% and 45% of the total budget revenues in the consolidated budget. Within this group, the value added tax gains increasing importance. The revenues from this tax almost doubled in its initial year (2000) in relation to previous revenues from sales tax. In 2003, its share in the total budget revenues was 24,4%.  On the other hand, the share of revenues based on excise taxes and customs duties shows continuous decline, from 26,7% (for both) to 20%, as a result of abolishing and reduction of some of these taxes, especially after the accession in the World Trade Organization.  Direct taxes are traditionaly weak source of revenues in the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. Regarding the profit tax, this is a result of, on one hand, low rate of 15%, and on the other, of low level of profitability of companies. As a result, the share of this tax in the total budget revenues is only 3,77%. As a result of the reduction of tax rates, revenues from personal income tax declined by 33% in 2001 compared to the previous year. In the period that followed, they were almost constant, so that expectations for reduction of evasion and increase of revenues after lowering tax rates have still not been met. The share of social insurance contributions declines continuously, and from 35% in 1997, it dropped to 31,4% in 2003.  From the remaining revenues, one should mention the tax on financial transactions, introduced in 2001 (internal conflict), intended to cover portion of the budget deficit in 2001 and 2002. The evidence of its effectiveness could be found in the fact that revenues generated in 2001 from this tax were equal to aggregate revenues from customs and import duties, and almost triple the amount of revenues from profit tax. In 1999 and 2000, the level of foreign donations, mostly from the European Union, increased, intended for cover the expenses related to the refugee crisis caused by the war in FR Yugoslavia. Non-tax revenues usually are at the level of 7% of the total revenues, while the share of capital revenues is negligible. B. Budget expenditures by category On the expenditure side, total budget expenditures, after undergoing a stable trend, experienced a significant growth in the year 2001 and the subsequent year as a result of the conflict and the rehabilitation of its consequences. In 2003 already, stabilization in this area can be noted. By category, the current expenditures of the government administration prevailed (salaries, procurements and reserves), accounting for about 1/3 of the total budget expenditures.  In aggregate terms, the transfers from the Budget (for extra-budgetary funds, structural reforms, public administration reforms and refugees-related costs) represented an even larger portion than the aforementioned one. Their amount almost doubled in 2003 in relation to 1997. After 2000, as a result of the implemented reforms and the introduction of the treasury system, the accounting records became more accurate, resulting with complete removal of unclassified current expenditures from the Budget. In 1999 and 2000, as a result of the NATO military campaign in FR Yugoslavia and the subsequent refugee crisis, the item covering refugee-related costs increased the expenditure side,. In recent years, capital expenditures continue to decline, and in 2003, it was reduced by 30% in relation to 2001.  More detailed data on the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia are shown in the tables Macroeconomic data, attached to II_I_1. . 
The fiscal policy in the observed period The Republic of Macedonia fully adheres to the arrangements concluded with the IMF and the World Bank, which have been defining the framework for monetary and fiscal policy in the country for longer period. Such discipline has resulted in low levels of budget deficit, as well as a surplus (1,8 % of GDP in 1999 and 2000). An exception to this trend is 2001, when a budget deficit of 7% of GDP incurred, as a result of higher expenditures caused by the internal conflict. Because of that, current procurements expenditures was an budget item with significant increase, whose growth almost equaling total growth in budget expenditures. It is also the year when the revenues from the personal income tax declined, thus additionally contributing to occurrence of budget deficit. The deficit in 2002 declined to 5,5% of GDP, and in 2003 a balanced budget was re-established. Initially, the deficit was covered mainly by borrowing in the country and abroad. In 2001 (during the internal crisis) significant portion of the proceeds from the privatization of JSC Macedonian Telecommunications were used for this purpose, as well as a more intensive domestic borrowing that continued during the next few years. During the years with the highest budget deficit (2001 and 2002), the tax on financial transactions was introduced, as an instrument used for deficit reduction. The fiscal balance achieved in 2003 and 2004 is expected to be maintained in the future, so that the problem of covering budget deficits is not expected to be as notable as in previous years.  5. Fiscal decentralisation (current): What is the relationship between central government and local municipalities? What is the current situation as regards revenues and expenditures of local municipalities?  
Pursuant to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and the Law on Local Self-Government (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 5/2002) the units of local self-government have the right to local self-governance through direct participation of citizens in decisions about common matters. Units of local self-government can perform the rights determined by the Constitution and by law independently. In order to do that the units of local self-government have the right to use funds from own sources of revenues determined by law, as well funds provided by the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. The revenues of the units of local self-government are provided from: a) taxes -property tax, -inheritance and gift tax; -sales tax on real estate and rights; b)   fees -communal fees c)  additional revenues from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia determined by special laws; d) revenues from domestic and foreign grants (monetary or in kind);  e) other revenues transferred on various bases to the budgets of units of local self-government, in accordance with the law; and f) revenues in form of loans from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. The revenues shall be administered and collected by the Public Revenue Office. The revenues from taxes and fees shall be allocated to municipalities by using the following ratios:   80% by share in total number of inhabitants at the level of municipalities from which they have been obtained;   10% by share in total number of settlements at the level of municipalities from which they have been obtained; and   10% by share in total area at the level of municipalities from which they have been obtained. An exemption from the above criteria is the distribution of revenues for the City of Skopje and the units of the local self-government within its administrative boundaries, which will be allocated as follows:   The genuine revenues of the City of Skopje, as a separate unit of local self-government, shall amount to 38,5% from the revenues from taxes and fees collected within the City administrative boundaries.   The genuine revenues of the units of the local self-government in the City administrative boundaries shall be determined on the basis of the share in the total number of inhabitants at the level of municipalities from which they have been obtained. The expenditures of the budgets of the units of local self-government shall comprise:   Current expenditures (salaries and employees' benefits, procurement of goods and services, current transfers and interest payments);   Capital expenditures (purchasing of capital assets and capital transfers);   Re-payments of loans In the annual budget circular, the minister of finance provides guidelines for preparation of municipal’s budgets, stating the main parameters for flow of revenues and the limitations to expenditures. The units of the local self-government prepare a single budget, containing the funds allocated to the Council, the Mayor and the administrative bodies, the communal regulation programme, street illumination programme, road programme, green areas programme, forestation programme and other programmes. The single budget and programmed planning principles will provide better monitoring and proper use of municipal revenues and expenditures.  Pursuant to the Law on Limiting the Original Revenues for Financing Public Works (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 85/2003) the limits on genuine revenues (taxes and fees) for each municipality are specified. Excess revenues are allocated in a special account within the treasury account of the Republic of Macedonia. The funds collected on this account are allocated to municipalities by decision of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (usually, twice a year), on the basis of the Methodology for Allocation of Excess Revenues above the Allowed Level of Expenditures in the Units of Local Self-government, where funds are returned to municipalities. The annual flow of municipal revenues and expenditures is as follows:

Based on the questionnaires sent to the municipalities and providers of goods and services. It has been estimated that the debts in this sector amount to around MKD 2,6 billion. With public invitation to all creditors (October 2004 – Mac Decentralisation Work Project/USAID), the registered claims amounted to about MKD 3,2 billion In order to resolve the debt, a Debt Resolution Plan is currently being prepared, as a precondition for the fiscal decentralisation. 
6. Fiscal decentralisation (reform): What is the status of the reform on fiscal decentralisation? Please provide a short summary concerning the main features of this reform. Which fiscal competencies and powers are expected to be transferred from the central to local government? Is there an estimate of overall revenue and expenditure of local municipalities once the reform is fully implemented? Is the forthcoming reform ensuring an adequate flow of revenue for local municipalities in order to finance their competencies? Is there a mechanism of redistribution of resources among the municipalities? Is the central budget expected to finance local municipalities? If so, according to which criteria?  
The fiscal decentralisation reform, from a legislative point of view, was finalized with the adoption of all laws providing for changes in the system of local financing. The Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia adopted the Law on Financing the Units of Local Self-Government (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 61/2004 and 96/2004) (see 12HII_Annex_02), Law on Property Tax (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 61/2004), Law on Utility Fees (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 61/2004), Law on Modifications and Amendments to the Law on Administrative Fees (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 61/2004), Law on the City of Skopje (“Official Gazette of RM, No. 55/2004) regulating the financing of the City of Skopje and the municipalities within the City, as well as a number of special laws pertaining to the transfer of competencies to the municipalities. For the purpose of realization of the set of laws related to the financing, a number of bylaws will be adopted, arising from and aimed at determining the procedures for implementation of mentioned laws. These bylaws will be adopted by the time the laws begin implementation, i.e. by the time the municipal councils are constituted and the mayors are elected at the next local elections (13.03.2005). The Ministry of Finance will propose to the Government of the Republic of Macedonia to adopt seven bylaws, which are in preparatory stage. The Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy and the Ministry of Education and Science will propose to the Government of the Republic of Macedonia a Decree on Methodology for Allocation of Earmarked Grants. The Ministry of Transport and Communications, the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning, the Bureau for Economically Underdeveloped Regions and the Regional and National Road Fund will propose to the Government of the Republic of Macedonia a Decree on Methodology for Allocation of Capital Grants. Main features of the local self-government reform: 1.  Defined scope of competencies, distinguished from the ones of the state and new type of mutual relations between the local authorities and the state bodies; 2.  New system of financing, assuring financial independence and quality performance of the competencies of the local self-government units;  3.  Legal guarantees for non-interference by other authorities when performing the competencies; 4.  Clear determination of the status, property and relations of the local self-government units and public institutions; 5.  Establishment of new system of local public property, corresponding to the new competencies and responsibilities of the local self-government units;  6.  Freedom of association of local authorities;  7.  Establishment of mechanisms for monitoring and control of operations of the bodies of local self-government units;  8.  Small, professional and efficient local administration. Municipalities are financed from their own revenue sources, stipulated by law, including local taxes and fees. New fiscal competencies of the municipalities include adoption of decisions about the level of property tax rates and utility fees. Thus, the local authority acquire significantly higher level of independence from the central government, from a financial point of view, with precisely determined own sources of financing and their management. The Law regulates the intervals within which the rates, i.e. the amounts should range, while the particular rates and amounts are determined with a decision by the municipal council, the Council of the municipalities within City of Skopje, i.e. the Council of the City of Skopje. Within these frames, current rates are considered as bottom level. The independence of the municipalities is also manifested by granted right to determine higher level of rates, i.e. amounts for particular revenues, within the limits stipulated by law. Thus, the municipality determines the amount of its own revenues. Activities related to determining and collecting of municipalities’ genuine revenues are carried out by municipal administration. The transfer of competence from the public revenue authority to the municipal administration, the administration of the municipalities within the City of Skopje, i.e. administration of the City of Skopje, refers to collection of taxes or fees in the administrative boundary of the municipality where the property or the tax/fee payer is located, while if the property is located within administrative boundaries of two or more municipalities, the tax or fee is determined by the municipal administration for the value of the property located or the fee collected within the administrative boundary of the respective municipality. When movable property is inherited, i.e. received as a gift, the tax is determined by the municipal administration in the place of residence of the taxpayer. The decision for determine the tax liability is adopted by the Mayor of the municipality, the Mayor of the municipalities within the City of Skopje i.e. the Mayor of the City of Skopje. For the purpose of full monitoring of the situation with the real estate, the municipal administration, administration of the municipalities within the City of Skopje, i.e. the administration of the City of Skopje, keeps real estate registry and regularly reconciles its records in with the real estate registry of State Authority for Geodetic Works.  With the purpose of implementation and application of the regulations related to property taxes and utility fees by the taxpayers, the municipality performs inspection supervision, including inspection of condition and value of the real estate and movable property subject to taxation.  The municipality carries out the procedure of enforced collection, procedure and method of securing tax arrears payment, complaint procedure, overdue tax default interest payment, refunds paid excess tax or incorrectly paid tax, and implements expiry and guarantee and penalty provisions. At taxpayer’s request, the Mayor may allow for deferred payment of overdue liabilities or payment in instalments. This, up to the moment when a decision upon the complaint is reached, which is to be approved only if the taxpayer secures the payment of the tax arrears by a bank guarantee or cash deposit. The former should be appropriate to the amount of the tax arrears, i.e. the tax liability and latter to amount of ½ of the tax arrears, i.e. tax liability. 
The complaint can be filed against the decision by the Mayor to the Ministry of Finance within 15 days from the day of receipt of the decision.  Regarding the taxpayer who failed to pay the due tax arrears, fines and interest within the stipulated period, an enforced collection will be carried out, by appraisal and sale of his property via public auction. Provisions from the Property Tax Law apply when determining and collecting utility fees, carrying out inspection supervision, postponing the execution, charging interest, undertaking a complaint procedure, enforced collection and refund of fee paid in excess or incorrectly paid fee. In order to ensure regular payment of property taxes and utility fees, deadlines for payment have been stipulated, as well as appropriate charges for the legal entity or individual that avoids paying the determined fee amount, failed to submit application for the incurred fee liability, etc.  Projections of the total revenues and expenditures have been prepared pursuant to the expenditure execution transferred within the competence of the municipality in 2002. Projections of total revenues and expenditures are presented in Table 1. Table 1. PROJECTION OF REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES PURSUANT TO THE LAW ON LOCAL FINANCING

260,7   -7.615,7   210,0  OR* - own revenues; EG** - earmarked grants; CG*** - capital grants; BG**** - block grants; Source: Ministry of Finance The reforms, determined by the Law on Local Financing, ensure appropriate flow of municipal revenues. Municipalities are financed from own revenue sources, government grants and other sources of revenues pursuant to the Law.  
Own types of revenues: (1) local taxes, (2) local fees, (3) local charges, (4) ownership revenues (rent, interest, sale of nonessential property), (5) revenues from donations, (6) revenues from fines stipulated by law, (7) revenues from self-contribution and (8) other revenues stipulated by law. 
Revenues from personal income tax: 
  3 % of the personal income tax on the salaries of employed people, collected in the municipality in which they are registered as having permanent place of residence, and    100% of the personal income tax from individuals dealing with craftsmanship, registered pursuant to the Law on Craftsmanship (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 62/2004), on the territory of the municipality in which they are registered to perform activity.  
Various subsidies (grants) from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia and the budgets of the Funds, through which the central government provides additional revenues for proper implementation of competences stipulated by law, are regarded as additional source of revenues.  The following types of grants are allocated from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia and the budgets of the Funds:   revenues from value added tax (general grant),  block grants,   earmarked grants,   capital grants,   grants for delegated competencies. The provisions on type, amount and allocation of grants per municipality are an integral part of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia and the budgets of the Funds. The competent ministries and Funds announce the determined criteria, procedures and deadlines for allocation of earmarked and capital grants by 30.04 in the current year, at the latest.  
Revenues from the value added tax (in a form of general grant) are provided in the amount of 3 % of the total collected value added tax realized in the previous fiscal year. The allocation of the revenues from value added tax is done at least 50% by the per capita criterion and other criteria provided with the Decree on Methodology for Allocation of Revenues from Value Added Tax that is adopted by the Government. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia adopts the Decree upon proposal by the Minister of Finance and upon a prior consent by the Commission for Monitoring the Development of the System of Local Financing, by 30.06 in the current year at the latest, for the next year. With this methodology, special criteria are determined for the City of Skopje in order to level significant differences between the City and other municipalities. The municipality decides autonomously about the utilization of revenues from the value added tax. 
Block grants are used for financing the competencies in the area of culture, social welfare and child protection, education and health protection through concrete programs. Competent ministries and Funds prepare methodology for determining the criteria for allocation of block grants, based on a formula with appropriate indicators of the needs for each program. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia, upon a proposal by the competent Ministry, and upon a prior consent by the Ministry of Finance and the Commission for Monitoring the Development of Local Financing System, adopts the Decree on the Methodology for Determining the Criteria for Allocation of Block Grants. 
Earmarked grants are used for financing concrete activity. The competent ministries and Funds submit to the Ministry of Finance a proposal concerning allocation of earmarked grants per municipality, project and institution and/or programme with a budget calculation for the next fiscal year, in compliance with the Decree on Methodology for Allocation of Earmarked Grants that is adopted by the Government. The competent ministries and Funds monitor the utilization of the earmarked grants. When irregularities in utilization of grants are detected, the competent ministries and Funds halt the payment of funds and inform the Ministry of Finance thereof.  
Capital grants are used for financing investment projects on the basis of a program determined by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. When allocating capital grants, the competent ministries and Funds assign priority to projects with completed financial frame. The competent ministries and Funds allocate the resources pursuant to the Decree on Methodology for Allocation of Capital Grants that is adopted by the Government and monitor the utilization of capital grants. When irregularities in utilization of grants are detected, competent ministries and Funds halt the payment of funds and inform the Ministry of Finance thereof. When non-earmarked spending of funds is ascertained, financing of capital investments can be stopped. 
Grants for delegated competencies are used for financing the competencies delegated by state administration body to the Mayor of the municipality. Funds for delegated competences are provided from the allocated amount for the competent state administration body in the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. Grants for delegated competences are transferred in a manner which provides a timely realization of the delegated duties. The Minister in charge of the state administration body and the Mayor of the municipality conclude an agreement for regulation of the mutual relations pertaining to the grants for delegated competencies. If the Mayor of the municipality fails to carry out the delegated competence, he/she is obliged to return the funds allocated for financing the respective competence into the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia within 30 days from the day the performing of delegated competence was supposed to commence, in line with the agreement, except in cases when objective impediments emerge.  There is no existing mechanism for redistribution of resources among the municipalities at state level. There is a mechanism for redistribution of resources among municipalities within the City of Skopje where Joint Fund for the City of Skopje and the municipalities within the City of Skopje will be established for the purpose of ensuring equal conditions for functioning of municipalities in the City of Skopje. The Fund is to be established with the revenues collected from the personal income tax, utility fees for placing company signs and utility fees for utilization of streets with passenger, cargo and trailer vehicles. The allocation is carried out pursuant to the Methodology for Distribution of Funds from the Joint Fund, adopted on 17.11.2004 (Official Gazette of RM No. 83/04).  
7. Budgetary policy: Please describe the features of the planning, programming and execution process of the government budget. Please indicate main policy objectives, developments and achievements as regards budgetary policy. 
Planning, programming and adoption of the state Budget The methodology for preparation, adoption and execution of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia (including the budgets of the extra-budgetary funds) and the budgets of the local self-government units is regulated by the Budget Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 79/1993, 3/1994, 71/1996, 46/2000, 11/2001, 93/2001, 46/2002, 24/2003, 85/2003 and 96/2004).  Pursuant to the Law, the budget process starts with the preparation of medium-term fiscal strategy, based on the planned macroeconomic policy and the determined strategic priorities of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia for the following year. The Fiscal strategy, as a medium-term document, defines the fiscal framework for a period of three years, i.e. the preliminary projections of budget revenues and expenditures, as well as pre-conditions and risks determined thereof. On the basis of the adopted fiscal strategy, the Ministry of Finance prepares guidelines for preparation of a draft budget request – Circular. It contains the main guidelines and the methodology for preparation of a draft budget (including the basic parameters, the procedure and the deadline for preparation) and it is submitted to the budget beneficiaries, the Funds and the local self-government units.  The Ministry of Finance determines the maximum level of expenditures for the next year. Starting from 2004, the maximum levels of expenditure are being determined under the functional principle, ensuring larger independence of the budget beneficiaries when determining the funds necessary for the realization of planned activities. It actually means that the Ministry, i.e. the holder of the particular function is responsible for the process of harmonization of planned amounts of separate budget beneficiaries within the respective function. The budget beneficiary, within the determined maximum amounts of expenditure, prepares its draft budget request, and submits it to the Ministry of Finance. The 2005 draft budget request contains the:    integrated strategic plans of budget beneficiaries within the functional analysis of particular budget beneficiary;   introduction of on-going government programs, as a reflection of the government policy;    on-going activities that the budget beneficiary will implement in the course of the fiscal year, presented by programs and sub-programs;   estimates of the expenditures for the fiscal year (by expenditure items and sub-items) and projections for the next two years (by categories and items), according to the new economic classification in line with the international standards;   estimates of capital expenditures, presented by individual projects, and    definition of performance indicators and evaluation of the program results. The Ministry of Finance evaluates the received draft budget requests from the perspective of their efficiency, priority and rationality, and reconciles them with the budget beneficiaries. On the basis of the reconciliations with the budget beneficiaries, the Ministry of Finance prepares Draft Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, and submits it to the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. The Government adopts the Draft Budget and submits it to the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia for its adoption.  Deadlines for preparation and adoption of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia are determined by the Budget Law as follows: Activity Deadline Preparation of the Fiscal Strategy of the Republic of Macedonia for the next medium term   April Guidelines for preparation of Draft Budget Request – Budget Circular, to be submitted to the budget beneficiaries End-April Draft Budget Request prepared by the budget beneficiary and submitted to the Ministry of Finance  June Ministry of Finance submits the Draft Budget to the Government of the Republic of Macedonia Beginning of October The Government adopts the Draft Budget and submits it to the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia for its adoption  mid-November The Assembly debates on the Draft Budget Not prior to 20 days from the day of its submission 
Reforms in the field of execution of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia As of 2000, the Ministry of Finance commenced implementing significant reforms aimed at improvement of the process of Budget execution, strengthening the control over utilization of budget funds, increasing transparency when using public revenues, which led to a more efficient management of state finances. For this purpose, in 2000, the Treasury Department was established within the Ministry of Finance to implement and perform these functions.  In terms of its organizational structure, the Treasury Department consists of 7 units:  Budget Execution   Revenue Collection Monitoring  Budget Accounting   Reports and Analysis  Public Debt Management   Planning and Cash Management   Regional Treasury Operations The implemented reforms can be structured in two stages.  
The first steps were taken in 2000, with the adoption of a Decision on Establishment of the Treasury Department within the Ministry of Finance, followed by the adoption of a strategic development plan for the Treasury Department and recruitment and training of its stuff.  The main changes in 2001 included:   Change in structure of the accounts of budget beneficiaries, ensuring greater transparency and control over all types of revenues the budget beneficiaries realize   Inclusion of donations and loans in the treasury system   More detailed analytical monitoring of budget revenues and expenditures   Changes in the procedures for execution of payments    Greater flexibility for the budget beneficiaries in spending the approved budget (three-digit account)   Elimination of idle cash balances on the operating accounts   Providing records for the actual expenditures The legal framework for all these reforms consists of several laws, such as the Budget Law, the Law on Budget Execution for 2001 and 2002, the Law on Transformation of the Payment Operations Bureau, the Law on Payment Operations, as well as number of instructions and rulebooks in the area of treasury operations.  
The second step in implementing the reforms commenced at the beginning of 2001 and was fully implemented on 01.01.2002. The main objective of the changes was to completely implement the concept of “Single Treasury Account”, following the treasury system model of the developed countries. 
In 2002, the Treasury Department fully undertook the function of holder of payment operations for the Budget and the budget beneficiaries from the Payment Operations Bureau. As a result, a Single Treasury Account (STA) was opened in the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia and previous accounts of the budget beneficiaries were closed, as well as all other special accounts of the state and the accounts for collecting public revenues. Due to closing of accounts where some of the genuine revenues of the local self-government units were paid, the Treasury Department has also undertaken the function of collecting, recording and allocating the revenues to those local government units. The Treasury Department actually acts as “quasi bank” with approximately 3.000 accounts (in the Ledger) of the budget beneficiaries, accounts for collecting public revenues and other earmarked accounts of the state, providing for direct collection of public revenues and centralized execution of expenditures. Treasury operations reforms continued in 2003 and 2004 as well with main changes being the following:   Introduction of accounting for the assumed liabilities;    Issuance of treasury bills;   Further improvement of the cash management;  The project for inclusion of extra-budgetary funds within the STA, was completed at the end of 2004. In addition, in the second half of 2005, local self-government units will have their own accounts within the STA. Another ongoing activity is the one for e-connection of the budget beneficiaries with the Treasury, i.e. WEB Treasury Project which is under preparation, with the purpose of enabling access to the Treasury via Internet. 
Budget Execution Process (after the reforms) 
The budget execution is carried out pursuant to the Budget Law, the Law on Budget Execution for the current year (2005 – “Official Gazette of RM No. 96/2004) (see 13HII_Annex_01) and the bylaws for budget execution. The budget execution process encompasses the following steps: 1. Following the adoption of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia for the current year, the budget beneficiaries, within 25 days, are supposed to submit to the Ministry of Finance, an annual financial plan by quarters, for utilization of funds by accounts, programs and expenditure items, except for the items pertaining to salaries and allowances. The budget beneficiaries having expenditure units, within 5 days from the adoption of the Budget, submit a statement of the annual financial plan to each expenditure unit, containing information on the funds earmarked for the particular expenditure unit. On the basis of the statement, the expenditure units prepare their annual financial plans and submit them to the line ministry, while the line ministry submits the consolidated annual financial plan to the Ministry of Finance within 25 days following the adoption of the Budget.  The amount of projected funds for current needs within the annual financial plan, for one quarter, should be ¼ of the annual Budget, with exception of specific cases.  2. Throughout the year, the budget beneficiaries, on the basis of the annual financial plan, prepare draft quarterly financial plans (by months) for utilization of funds per accounts, programs and items (except for the items pertaining to salaries and allowances) and submit it to the Ministry of Finance for approval, at least 5 days prior to beginning of respective quarter. The quarterly financial plan by months is an estimate of the expenditures of the budget beneficiary for a given period and its adoption denotes an approval of the right to execute the funds for the given months of the corresponding quarter i.e. the subsequent period if the right to execute is not exercised. 3. Following the approval of the financial plans, the Ministry of Finance informs the budget beneficiaries and, budget beneficiaries that have own spending units, inform them thereof. In the course of the year and during a given quarter, the budget beneficiary can submit a request for a change of the annual or quarterly financial plan, only for expenditures that could not be projected on time. In that sense, it is necessary for the budget user to submit explanation, along with revised annual financial plan and a quarterly financial plan. If there is re-allocation of funds among budget beneficiaries, i.e. re-allocation among items and programs within the budget of one budget beneficiary, request for change of both annual financial plan and quarterly financial plan should be submitted. In certain cases, when the projected dynamics of expenditure performance in the central government budget significantly deviates from the collection of budget revenues, the Ministry of Finance can revise and approve such annual and quarterly financial plans of the budget beneficiaries that will follow the projected dynamics of collection of budget revenues. 4. Budget beneficiaries report their assumed liabilities Budget beneficiaries report their assumed liabilities based on concluded contracts, orders, business trip orders and other documents that can lead to occurrence of payment liability in a given future period, when exceeding EUR 3.000 in MKD equivalent for precisely determined types of expenditures. Reporting of assumed liabilities is made within 10 working days from the day of their incurrence, by submitting the standard O1-form to the treasury offices, thereby assigning a number to the liability. According to the territorial distribution of the budget beneficiaries, there are 16 treasury offices, receiving and, from a formal point of view (filling all the necessary elements) processing all payment requests 5. Budget beneficiaries submit payment requests. Budget beneficiaries submit payment requests one day prior to the execution of payment for the purpose of carrying out control by the Treasury, except in the cases of foreign currency payments, where requests are submitted and executed the same day, with the purpose of applying the same exchange rate.  6. After carrying out all the controls by the Treasury Department, the payment is executed. When approving the payment request, the Treasury Department checks the following: the approved annual budget (the appropriations), the remaining right to spend (monthly financial plan), whether the liability has been previously declared, as well as the balance on the appropriate account in the case of a special revenue account). If all the requirements are met, the payment request is executed. Payments are executed through MIPS i.e. RTGS system, managed by the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia. 7. Following the payment execution, the transaction is recorded in the treasury ledger. The cycle ends with the execution of the payment and the recording of the expenditures in the treasury ledger i.e. in all registers such as expenditure specification, analytical cards, registers of executed transactions, etc. Regarding the Budget execution, account statements are prepared on a daily, monthly, semi-annual and annual basis. The right of the budget beneficiaries to spend the budget funds is terminated on 31.12 in the current calendar year. They are obliged to return all remaining (not utilized) funds in the Budget by 05.01 of following year, at the latest. 
Objectives, outcomes and future development of the budget policy 
The main feature of the fiscal policy in the past period is the restrictive budget spending, for the purpose of maintaining the macroeconomic stability and promotion of economic growth in the medium term. Such defined fiscal policy will continue in the next medium-term period, and its objective is to ensure:   Fiscal consolidation in the medium term, loosening of monetary policy and reduction of the bank interest rates;    Maintaining of low level budget deficit and provision of full, timely and non-inflationary financing of public expenditures and servicing of liabilities arising from both domestic and foreign debt;   Support to the development and development programs;   Transparency in spending per programs;    Relation between the spending by budget funds and monitoring of results from the set tasks of the budget beneficiaries, in line with the priorities of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia.   Rationalization of expenditures and their earmarked utilization and consistent planning in line with the commitment to reduce public expenditures;   Efficient and responsible public debt management, i.e. achieving a sustainable level of debt (maintaining at 37% of GDP). Central government budget was basically stabilization-, social- and reform-oriented, underpinning the objectives of the monetary policy for maintaining exchange rate and price stability in high trade deficit environment. Following the modern developments in the fiscal sphere, a new Budget Law in being prepared (adoption in 2005) that will provide for programmed planning of the public expenditures. This method of planning ensures proper information flow to legislative and executive authorities, as well as to the public, on operative plans of individual state institutions, reflecting planned utilization of budget funds and implementation of programs. The new Budget Law stipulates specific rules, procedures and control of the overall budget relations among the central government, the extra-budgetary funds, the local self-government and the public sector. This Law will fully regulate the budget process in accordance with the international standards in the field of public finance and the international statistical standards.  
8. Budget management: How has the relation and interaction between the central and the sub-central government levels evolved? How far is the fiscal management integrated (e.g. state play of the Single Treasury Account)?  
With the abolishment of the Payment Operations Bureau in 2002, pursuant to the Law on Transformation of the Payment Operations Bureau, a Single Treasury Account was opened with the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM), thus fully implementing the treasury system model from the developed countries.  This way, a progress was achieved in the process of Budget execution in the part pertaining to the collection of revenues, execution of payments, as well as an increased level of control over the funds of the budget beneficiaries was attained. The treasury account structure includes the account of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, the accounts of the budget beneficiaries, the accounts for recording and collecting public revenues in the Budget and the genuine revenues of the local self-government units, and other earmarked accounts of the state. The inflow of funds as public revenues into the Budget and the genuine revenues of the local government units in the Single treasury Account is carried out pursuant to the Guidelines on the Manner of Recording and Allocating Public Revenues (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 3/2004 and 74/2004) (see 14HII_Annex_03) thus ensuring a fully centralized collection of the stated revenues.  The centralized collection of the public revenues through Treasury Account meant overcoming the time discrepancies that existed in the previous period between the moment of payment of public revenues and the moment of their transfer to the Budget account.  With the introduction of this concept, the collection of genuine revenues of the local self-government units became centralized and all their revenues realized on that basis are transferred from the Treasury Account to the accounts of the local self-government units, which, pursuant to the legal regulations, are opened with the commercial banks. The allocation of the collected genuine revenues per local government unit is made on the basis of the defined criteria for allocation, pursuant to the legal regulations (Law on Limitation of Genuine Revenues for Financing Public Needs – “Official Gazette of RM” No. 96/2004). For more details, see 15HII_V_5In addition, the stated Law regulates the limitations on the genuine revenues of the local self-government units, i.e. the revenues at disposal of each local self-government unit in the current year. Revenues exceeding these limits are paid onto special account, from which they are allocated to local self-government units, upon decision of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. In addition to the own revenues, the Law on Financing the Local Self-Government Units (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 61/2004 and 96/2004) envisages following grants, that are provided from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonian to the municipal budgets:   revenues from value added tax (general grants),  block grants,  earmarked grants,  capital grants,   grants for delegated competencies. The execution of payments from the accounts of the budget beneficiaries to the final beneficiaries is also centralized, and all payments are made through the Single Treasury Accounts, in accordance with the type of expenditure.    The fact that the financial resources of all budget institutions, including the second-line budget beneficiaries are held within the treasury account, rather than on separate accounts with the commercial banks, as well as the fact that the payment operations for the budget institutions are fully performed through the treasury account, confirms that all pre-conditions are successfully met and strengthened control on public expenditures is already exercised.  The central treasury carries out all controls of the budget and treasury operations of all the institutions. This control is performed over all the revenues these institutions realize, regardless of whether they come from the Budget, from self-financing activities, donations, credits, etc. Thus, higher level of transparency was provided with regard to utilization of all funds of the budget institutions. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia established a Commission for monitoring of the development of the system of financing the municipalities, with the following competencies:   monitoring the application of criteria for allocation of grants,   proposing measures for improvement of the system,   monitoring the transparency of the procedures, etc. The Mayor of the municipality submits quarterly reports to the Minister of Finance about the execution of the municipal budget, and annual statement at the end of the fiscal year. In addition, in cases of borrowing from abroad, the municipality should provide prior consent of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. The Government can also guarantee for liabilities arising from long-term loans utilized by the municipality. 
9. Extra-budgetary Funds: Please list and provide information on extra-budgetary funds. What is the relationship between the budget and the extra-budgetary funds? Which steps are being taken to integrate the extra-budgetary funds in the government budget? Please describe major activities to improve the management of extra-budgetary funds and, in particular, the Health Insurance Fund. 
At present, there are four extra-budgetary funds in the Republic of Macedonia: Pension and Disability Insurance Fund, Health Insurance Fund, Employment Agency and Regional and National Road Fund. These funds are established as institutions performing activities of public interest and publicly authorised institutions determined by law. The main reason for the existence of the first three extra-budgetary funds is the relationship between the allowances the beneficiaries pay for the services into the accounts of the extra-budgetary funds and the benefits they receive, i.e. clear definition of the social function of the extra-budgetary funds. The reason for the existence of the Regional and National Road Fund is the need to provide funds for construction and maintenance of public roads, since the same could not be ensured under market principles.  In addition to the above-mentioned funds, during the last decade, the Environment Fund, the Agricultural Fund and the Water Fund were established and have been operating for a certain period of time. Since 2004, as a result of implemented reforms, these funds were abolished and their budgets were included in the state budget. Revenues in the extra-budgetary funds are provided from various sources: contributions, fees, budget transfers (from central and budgets of other extra-budgetary funds), revenues from donations, other revenues pursuant to law, as well as foreign loans (Regional and National Road Fund). The total revenues of the extra-budgetary funds are determined by the economic situation in the country, the defined macroeconomic policy and its priorities, the effective collection of genuine revenues, as well as the obligations arising from the legal regulations in the respective areas. Financing of the extra-budgetary funds with transfers from the central government budget is aimed at covering the legal obligations the state is committed to, including covering of current account deficit, in order to maintain fiscal balance between the revenues they collect and the funds required to cover the obligations fixed by law. The Law on Limitation of Genuine Revenues for Financing Public Needs (adopted as a mandatory document with the annual budget of the Republic of Macedonia) limits the public spending, including the spending by extra-budgetary funds, maintaining it within the available financial possibilities.   Pension and Disability Insurance Fund of Macedonia 
Following the independence of the country, in January 1994, the application of new Law on Pension and Disability Insurance (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 80/1993, 3/1994, 14/1995, 71/1996, 32/1997, 49/1997, 24/2000, 96/2000, 50/2001, 85/2003, 50/2004 and 4/2005) began, pursuant to which, the relations with and the rights to pension and disability insurance have been regulated, for the first time, in an autonomous manner for the first time. Pursuant to the Law, pension and disability insurance is mandatory and it covers all employees and individuals performing an economic activity. It is a system with defined pensions paid under the pay-as-you-go principle, according to which current pensions are financed, i.e. provided from the current contributions. The activities related to pension and disability insurance is performed by the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund of Macedonia, established pursuant to the same Law. In the last ten years, Republic of Macedonia is undergoing a process of social, economic and structural reforms. The unfavourable trends in the economy and the transitional changes towards market economy led to an increase in the number of loss-making enterprises, bankruptcy procedures and redundant workers. These conditions caused a reduction in the number of active insurees on one hand and increase of the number of pension beneficiaries on the other, leading to a decrease in the ratio between the insurees and pension beneficiaries. This is an important factor for maintaining the solvency of the pay-as-you-go pension system, based upon the intergenerational solidarity. In fact, in 1991, the ratio between the number of employees per a pension beneficiary was 3:1, while the same, at the end of 2003, was only 1,3. Positive effects were achieved with respect to the financial consolidation of the Fund with the implemented parametric reforms of the pension system, i.e. its rationalization, as well as all the other measures undertaken in the period 1993 – 2002.  The number of pension beneficiaries in 1991 amounted to 180.794, while at the end of 2003 - 254.267 beneficiaries, which is an increase of 40,6%. In the last decade, there was a stabilized inflow of new pension beneficiaries, as a result of a series of restrictive measures implemented in the past period, thus the annual rate of increase of 7,5% before 1993, was reduced to around 2%. Pension and disability insurance contribution rate has not been changed since 1994. The increase from 20% to 21% made in 2001 was only an accounting change as a result of the reduction of the personal income tax, i.e. the gross base and it did not lead to an increase in the contributors’ commitments.  The total revenues of the Fund in 2003 amounted to MKD 28.191 million and compared to the total revenues in 1996, they increased by 51,3%. The total expenditures (MKD 27.740 million in 2003) increased by 46,7%, i.e. in the period from 1996 to 2003, a balance was achieved between the total revenues and the total expenditures. The share of the total expenditures of the Fund in the gross domestic product in 2003 amounted 10,9% and it remained almost unchanged compared to 1996.  Most of the revenues of the Fund consist of revenues from the employees’ contributions. In absolute figures, these revenues increased from MKD 12.877 million in 1996 to MKD 16.879 million in 2003. However, in relative terms, their share in the total Fund’s revenues decreased from 70,3% to 60,9%. This drop is mainly a result of the reduction in the number of employees that pay contributions, the difficult financial situation of the contributors, payment of contributions on (very often) minimum basis, which amounts to 65% of the average salary in the country, as well as lack of discipline in payment of contributions. The decrease in the share of the contribution from the salaries in the total revenues was offset by increase in the share of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia in the financing of the pension and disability insurance. In fact, the share of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia in the total financing of the Fund in 1997 amounted MKD 3.516 million (17,5%), and in 2003, it amounted MKD 7.741 million (27,9%). Most of the transfers from the Budget to Pension and Disability Insurance Fund (87,8%), are used to cover the expenditures based on more favourable rights (veteran pensions, pensions for personnel of Ministry of Interior, military pensions, agricultural pensions, 8% retroactive pension payment pursuant to the Decision by the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia, pensions under the two laws for early retirement of employees in the public administration). Remaining portion is intended to cover Fund’s deficit. In 2003, Law on Pension and Disability Insurance was modified and amended in the part regarding pension indexation. According to latest amendments, pension indexation is carried out in a combined manner, i.e. taking into account the changes in the consumer price index and the changes in the average net salary paid to all employees in the country. The application of this indexation began as of 01.07.2004 and it has contributed to cut the costs related to the payment of pensions compared to the previous solution for more than 70%. The budget of the Fund is determined by the Management Board of the Fund, and it is adopted by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, as an integral part of the state Budget.  As a result of the perceived conditions of volatility in the pension system in the long run, legislation on a new three-pillar pension system was adopted, supported by actuarial projections for the future revenues and expenditures, on the basis of the demographic and economic trends. For more detail please see 16HII_VI_E_4.  
Health Insurance Fund of Macedonia Pursuant to the Law on Health Insurance (“Official Gazette of R” No. 25/2000, 34/2000, 96/2000, 50/2001, 11/2002 and 31/2003), mandatory health insurance in the Republic of Macedonia is managed by the Health Insurance Fund of Macedonia. Funds to finance mandatory health insurance are provided from the following sources: 1) contributions from: - gross salaries and compensations of the employees, - pensions and pension and disability insurance contributions,  - income of persons performing independent activity;  - unemployment benefits and - funds from other contributors;  2) additional contribution in case of injury at work and occupational disease; 3) participation by insurees; 4) the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia; 5) interest and dividends; 6) presents, endowments and   7) other revenues. Contribution rates per categories of insurees are stipulated in the Decree on Rates, Bases and Amount of Contributions for Mandatory Health Insurance (“Official Gazette of R“, No. 4/2001 and 50/2001). Thereby, common rate of 9,2% of the gross salary is applied for employed persons, persons appointed to public functions, individuals performing economic activity, while in the case of people engaged in agriculture, the same rate is applied on the net salary. For pension beneficiaries, the rate is 14,694% of the amount of the pension, while for other categories of beneficiaries, different contribution rates are applied. The participation of insurees in the price of health services and pharmaceuticals (co-payment) accounts for 3% to 4% of the total financing of the health care in Republic of Macedonia. With respect to health care, funds are also provided from the Budget for the implementation of special programs for preventive health care, protection against special diseases treated as social problems, health care of uninsured persons and health care for special population groups. The share of these funds in the total revenues of the health care protection is less than 1%. Revenues in health care also include funds paid by the enterprises and other organisations based on contracts for provision of health services not covered by primary health care to their workers, specific health care of workers working under special conditions, performing strenuous jobs and duties or in the cases when health institutions are requested to offer health care services under favourable conditions for the employees of certain companies. The health care institutions provide additional revenues directly from the individual uninsured beneficiaries of health services, from insured persons using health care services not included in the basic package of services or when they use higher-standard health services, from contracts with enterprises for the provision of special health services to their employees, as well as other health services not covered by the Fund.  In addition, citizens pay full price for part of health services in the private health institutions. It especially refers to dental health care, as well as part of services in the private policlinics and specialized private hospitals, that do not have contracts with the Fund. In addition, the patients pay for some health services directly (pharmaceuticals not covered by the health insurance, etc). However, no reliable data on the financial amount the patients pay in this respect is available at present. Additional revenues in the health institutions are collected from international assistance, donations by humanitarian organisations, donations and contributions by organizations and individuals from the country and abroad. There are no precise data about the amount of these revenues as well. Total revenues of the Health Insurance Fund in 2003 amounted MKD 14.698 million. Revenues from health insurance contributions from employed persons amounted MKD 8.418 million or 57,27% of the total revenues. Revenues for health insurance of retired persons and unemployed persons (provided as transfers from the Employment Agency and the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund) amounted MKD 5.033 million or 34,2% of the total revenues. For persons receiving social assistance, health insurance is provided through transfers from the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy. Ministry of Finance provides funds (trough transfers) on the basis of mandatory health-related programs. Revenues from co-payment by beneficiaries of health services account for around 4% of the total revenues. The Fund also collects other revenues (from interest, conventions, etc.), which account for less than 1% of the total revenues. Total expenditures of the Health Insurance Fund in 2003 amounted MKD 14.678 million and were used for the following purposes:   outpatient costs – primary, specialized and consultative health care (MKD 5.132 million);   hospital health care (MKD 5.038 million);   pharmaceuticals covered by the Fund (MKD 1.868 million);   hospital health care (MKD 150 million);   treatment abroad (MKD 221 million);   allowances for sick leaves covered by the Fund (MKD 968 million);   administration costs (MKD 309 million) and    other expenditures (MKD 992 million). 
Regional and National Road Fund 
The main function of the Regional and National Road Fund is the management of public roads, i.e. performing activities related to planning, financing, construction, reconstruction, maintenance and protection of regional and national roads in the Republic of Macedonia. The Road Fund acquired the status of a legal entity pursuant to the Law on Public Roads (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 26/1996, 40/1999, 96/2000, 29/2002 and 68/2004). For the purpose of performing its activities, the Road Fund prepares programs defining its activities related to the development and maintenance of regional and national roads. The financial resources used for construction, reconstruction, maintenance and protection of public roads are provided from: 1.  Transfers from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia (part of the excise tax for oil derivatives); 2.  Fee for utilization of public roads (road fee) for motor vehicles and trailers, paid at registration of the vehicles; 3.  Fee for utilization of public roads (road fee) for motor vehicles and trailers, paid by foreign transporters at the border crossings; 4.  Toll pay for utilization of motorway or national road;  5.  Loans and credits; 6. Other revenues. The part of excise taxes from oil derivatives, which the Road Fund receives as a transfer from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, was genuine revenue of the Road Fund until 01.01.1994 and was paid directly in the account of the Fund. By adopting the Excise Tax Law, all fees and taxes which were a part of the oil retail price, including the road fee, were abolished, and the excise tax was introduced instead. After introducing the excise tax, the road fee, as a part of the excise on oil derivatives, is being transferred trough the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. Pursuant to the laws, the Road Fund can utilize loans (with state guarantees) to finance road infrastructure.  The Fund allocates its revenues for financing the Program for construction, reconstruction, maintenance and protection of roads, repayment of foreign credits, studies and projects, and a part is allocated for maintenance of local roads and streets. The total revenues of the Regional and Road Fund in 2003 amounted MKD 3.668 million. Most of these revenues - MKD 1.603 million (43,7%) refer to transfers from the state Budget, followed by the annual fee paid when registering motor vehicles - MKD 797 million (21,7%), pay toll - MKD 728 million (19,8%), foreign credits  - MKD 418 million (11,3%), etc. The total expenditures of MKD 3.661 million were mainly used for: investments - MKD 1.107 million (30,23%), road maintenance - MKD 1.063 million (29%), funds used for local roads - MKD 666 million (18%), etc. From a dynamic perspective, the total revenues of the Fund increased from MKD 2.660 million in 1998 to MKD 3.668 million in 2003, while the expenditures moved almost in parallel with the revenues, in same amounts. Regarding revenue structure, from 1998 until today, the Budget generated share increased the most, while the share of credits has been declining from 2001 onwards. Regarding expenditure side, investments were stable, wit road maintenance as item with highest increase. Since 2001, the Regional and National Road Fund prepares its own Budget, which is adopted together with the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, as its integral part. Since 05.07.2004, the Road Fund has transferred its bank account from the commercial banks in the single treasury account. 
Employment Agency of the Republic of Macedonia 
The Employment Agency of the Republic of Macedonia (former Employment Bureau – renamed in June 2004) is a public institution established pursuant to the Labour Relations Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 37/1997, 25/2000, 101/2000, 50/2001, 25/2003, 37/2004 and 4/2005) This Law regulates issues related to exchange of labour, rights and obligations of employers, unemployed persons and state related to employment and unemployment insurance, as well as other issues referring to employment. Although the primary source for financing the activities of Employment Agency is the contribution for employment, which amounts to 1,6% of the gross salary, the major part of the financing of this institution is provided as a transfer from the Budget.  The Budget of the Employment Agency is adopted by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, as an integral part of the state Budget. The total revenues of the Employment Agency in 2003 amounted MKD 6.241 million. Revenues from the employment contribution amounted MKD 1.224 million and their share in the structure of total revenues was 19,6%. Transfers from the Budget amounted MKD 5.002 million and they accounted for 80,1% of the total revenues. The total expenditures of the Employment Agency in 2003 amounted MKD 6.214 million. The largest expenditure item of Employment Agency is the payment of unemployment benefit in the amount of MKD 2.377 million or 38,25% of total expenditures, followed by payment of health, pension and disability insurance contributions for the unemployed persons in the amount of about MKD 3.406 million, etc. By observing the period 1998 - 2003, it can be concluded that annual revenues and expenditures of the Employment Agency increased by almost 50%. With regard to this increase, on the revenue side, the share of subsidies (grants) from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia is dominant, surging by 53%. On the expenditure side, the increase was highest at the health, pension and disability insurance contributions for the unemployed persons, increasing by 41%. Integration of extra-budgetary funds in the state Budget Pursuant to the Budget Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 79/1993, 3/1994, 71/1996, 46/2000, 11/2001, 35/2001, 93/2001, 46/2002, 61/2002, 24/2003, 85/2003 and 96/2004), starting from 2001, the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia consists of funds of the budget beneficiaries, as well as the budgets of the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund of Macedonia, the Health Insurance Fund of Macedonia, the Employment Agency of Macedonia and the Regional and National Road Fund. These modifications have led to strengthening of the control and responsibility in the adoption and execution of the budgets of the extra-budgetary funds, so that they are prepared within the deadlines and in accordance with the procedure stipulated by the Budget Law. The same are adopted by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, upon proposal by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, as an integral part of the state Budget.  Extra-budgetary funds have the status of legal entity, managed by management board and director. Pursuant to the laws under which they are established, the line Ministry performs control over their operations. Also, extra-budgetary funds are obliged, once a year, to submit to the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, a report on their operations. Extra-budgetary funds are subject to audit by the State Audit Office, as well as the Department for Central Internal Audit within the Ministry of Finance. In 2004, separate internal audit services were established within the extra-budgetary funds. Extra-budgetary funds have a monthly obligation to inform the Ministry of Finance regarding the revenue and expenditure performance, arrears, as well as to submit other information upon request by the Ministry.   Until 2004, extra-budgetary funds had separate bank accounts in commercial banks, when they were transferred as sub-accounts into the single treasury account. This also arises from the modifications and amendments to the Budget Law, pursuant to which the accounts of the extra-budgetary funds are kept within the single treasury account (a provision stipulates that this will apply after the migration of thes accounts in the ledger by 31.12.2004, at the latest).  Transfer of accounts was carried out with the following agenda:    in July 2004, the account of the Regional and National Road Fund was transferred,   in October 2004, the account of the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund was transferred,    in November 2004, the account of the Health Insurance Fund was transferred,   at the end of 2004, the account of the Employment Agency was also transferred.  The purpose of transferring the accounts of the extra-budgetary from the commercial banks to the single treasury account is to achieve more efficient public finance management, increase the transparency of the operations, use the extra-budgetary account balances for the purpose of liquidity, improve the process of planning of revenue collection and expenditure performance, reduce the risk of keeping funds on accounts in the banking system etc.  The extra-budgetary funds are obliged to keep the accounting, the business books, to recognize the revenues and expenditures, to process data, to prepare financial reports and resolve other issues in accordance with the Law on Accounting for Budget and Budget Beneficiaries (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 61/2002 and 98/2002).  
Activities aimed at improvement of management with extra-budgetary fund  Special activities have been undertaken for improving the management of the Health Insurance Fund. Systemic audit of the Fund was carried out by Ernst & Young from Luxembourg (in cooperation with the World Bank). The audit report was adopted by Fund’s Management board in October 2004. Based on the recommendations given in the Report, an Action Plan is in a process of preparation (again with the assistance of the foreign auditor), that will include measures for improvement of the procedures in the Fund, the Ministry of Health and other health institutions. Following its preparation, it will be submitted to the Government for adoption.  In addition, since September 2004, the Health Sector Management project commenced, and a Loan Agreement concerning its realization was signed with the World Bank in July 2004. The project will last until June 2009. During the preparatory stage of the project, a social evaluation of the health sector in the country was carried out, enabling adequate focusing and modelling of the project activities in accordance with the needs of the beneficiaries and the providers of the services. In this context, a Policy Analyses Unit was established within the Ministry of Health, as a pre-condition for project realization. The project is mainly aimed at strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Health and the Health Insurance Fund, as well as the restructuring of hospital services, emphasizing the daily care and the primary health care.  
The Employment Agency of the Republic of Macedonia uses funds within the CARDS Program (2002 – EUR 1.5 million and 2003 – EUR 1 million), intended for transformation and capacity strengthening of the Employment Agency and the network of employment offices. The same will be achieved by promotion of the overall restructuring and modernization of the institutional status and the services offered by the Employment Agency, which are to be adjusted to new conditions imposed by the transition from passive into active employment policies.  The restructuring of the Employment Agency includes complete modernization and reorganization of the sector with the aim of active promotion of three types of services:   Services for intermediation in employment via the operations of the job clubs and the development of functional and harmonized instruments for assistance in integration and re-integration of the unemployed persons (interview and individual action plan);   Expansion of training and re-qualification and intermediation measures thereof for different types of target groups (including training for self-employment and entrepreneurship and basic training for unemployed persons, laid-off workers and long-term unemployed persons);   Development of services related to research, statistical monitoring and information support for the active labour market policies. 




10. Tax policy: Which are the authorities of the different government levels to generate revenues? How has the tax regime changed (amendments of tax rates, introduction of new taxes and contributions etc)? (For detailed questions on the tax system see chapter 10 – Taxation) 
Government levels generating revenues 
Besides the central government, in accordance with the decentralization principles, local self-government units represent another level of entities with the authority to collect fiscal revenues. With regard to this, the country has undergone a certain development path.  Although the administrative decentralisation in the Republic of Macedonia was carried out in mid-1990s, almost nothing was done in the area of the fiscal decentralisation. Although the municipalities were transferred certain competences, from the point of view of their financing, they were entitled only to the revenues from tax on transfer of real-estate and rights, property tax, property revenue tax and utility fees. In the fiscal environment of the Republic of Macedonia, these items do not represent significant revenue source, due to which local self-government units financing was significantly supported by transfers from the state budget.  Because of that, in addition to the new decentralisation concept, new Law on Financing the Local Self-Government Units was adopted (Official Gazette of RM No. 61/2004 and 96/2004). According to this Law, the municipality is funded from its own revenue sources, grants from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, the budgets of the Funds and by borrowing.  In order to achieve a full implementation of fiscal decentralization process, the calculation and collection of property taxes, utility fees and a part of administrative fees will become a competence of the municipal administration that will set the level of tax rates and the amount of fees within the frameworks set by corresponding laws.  
Evolution of the tax system 
The bases of the public finance system were initially set with the 1991 Law on the System of Financing General Social and Common Needs.  The revenues needed to perform the functions of the state and municipalities were provided from the following sources: A. Taxes: Income tax i.e. profit tax, personal income tax on the employees salaries, tax on revenues from international transport, tax on revenues from lottery prizes, sales tax for commodities and services, tax on revenues from agricultural activity, tax on revenues from copyrights, patents and technical innovations, inheritance and gift tax and tax for preservation of the nature. B. Fees: Administrative fees and court fees. C. Other revenues set under the law. D. Customs fees and other import duties. The municipality was also entitled to the following revenues: tax on transfer of real estate and rights, property tax, property revenue tax and utility fees. During 1993, a radical reform was carried out in the tax system in the Republic of Macedonia since the existing tax system was assessed as incompatible with the tax system model of developed countries with market economy, inefficient, unstable and unattractive for foreign investments.   Under the tax system reform, new laws were adopted, such as the Personal Income Tax Law, Profit Tax Law, Law on Property Tax and Law on Excisess and (than existing) Law on Sales Tax for Goods and Services was fully revised.  1. The Personal Income Tax Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 80/1993, 70/1994, 71/1996, 28/1997, 8/2001, 50/2001, 2/2002, 44/2002 and 96/2004), replaced the previous taxation system (calculation and payment of tax on each type of revenue) with a single tax paid annually on the total revenues earned by an individual, in the country and abroad, regardless of the source.    The personal income tax was paid at progressive rates of 23%, 27% and 35%, which were reduced in 2001 to 15% and 18%. In 2004, in addition to the existing two, new tax rate of 24% was introduced. 2. The Profit Tax Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 80/1993, 33/1995, 43/1995, 71/1996, 5/1997, 28/1998, 11/2001, 2/2002, 44/2002 and 51/2003), defined the taxpayers as all the profit earning legal entities, as well as individuals performing registered economic activity, for the profit earned in the country or abroad. During its application, many amendments and modifications were made, with most significant one in 1997 when tax rate was reduced from 30% to 15%.    These two types of taxes were largely revised in 2001. By redefining them, the profit tax was fully separated from the personal income tax, with clear definition of taxpayers as all legal entities established or seated within the territory of the Republic of Macedonia, on the profit they earn in the country and abroad.  Although the amendments and modifications to these laws provided a harmonisation with tax systems of developed market economies, a commitment remains to follow the modern European legislation and harmonize the legal system of the Republic of Macedonia with the legal system of the European Union in this field. 3. The taxation of sales of goods and services in the Republic of Macedonia, until the introduction of the value added tax, was regulated with the Law on Sales Tax for Goods and Services (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 34/1992, 62/1992, 63/1992, 3/1993, 4/1993, 80/1993, 42/1995, 4/1996, 71/1996, 5/1997, 10/1997, 28/1997, 13/1998 and 39/1999). The sales tax was paid at proportional rates, set as a percentage on the tax base and in accordance with the sales tax tariff. The sales tax on goods was paid according to three tariff numbers – at a general rate of 25%, preferential 5% tax rate and 0% tax rate, and the tax on services was paid according to one tariff number at a general rate of 13%. On 01.04.2000, Republic of Macedonia introduced the value added tax (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 44/1999, 59/1999, 86/1999, 11/2000, 8/2001, 31/2001, 21/2003 and 19/2004), thus building a tax structure according to the model of the European law. The Value Added Tax Law is in accordance with the Sixth Directive of the European Union and is compatible with the European model of this law. The value added tax is calculated by applying the following proportional tax rates - 19% (now 18%) as a general tax rate and 5% preferential tax rate. 4. The excise tax is a special type of tax on sales of goods, collected according to Excise Tax Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 32/2001, 50/2001, 52/2001, 45/2002, 95/2002, 98/2002, 24/2003 анд96/2004) on: oil derivatives, processed tobacco products, alcoholic beverages, beer, passenger vehicles and luxury goods. Previously, the excise tax was paid on coffee as well – 70 MKD/kg for raw coffee, 85 MKD/kg for roasted coffee and 90 MKD/kg for grinded coffee and coffee extracts. The excise аре paid on the sales (import) of goods, according to the following tariff rate list:    Tariff number 1 – on sales of oil derivates, the rate ranges between 0% and 20%, and between 3,136 D/liter and 24,396 D/liter.   Tariff number 2 – on the sales of processed tobacco products on all types of imported: cigarettes, cut hand-rolling tobacco of all types and quality, cigarillos, black cigarettes, pipe tobacco, chewing tobacco and snuff, excise is paid in the amount of 1,350 D/kg and on all types of domestic processed tobacco products, at 40% rate. (changed in 2004, see below)   Tariff number 3 - on sales of alcoholic beverages – 3 D % vol. of alcohol per liter and on beer – 15 D per liter.   Tariff number 4 - on sales of passenger vehicles, on the engine volume of up to 2 liters, the rate is 25%, and the rate on vehicles with engine volume above 2 liters is 55%. (changed in 2004, see below)   Tariff number 5 - sales of luxury goods, the rate ranges between 5% and 50%. 4.1. The Excise Tax Law is harmonised with the EU Directive 92/12/EEC on excise duty, as well as its accompanying structural directives separately for each type of goods subject to excise, particularly mineral oils, tobacco goods and alcohol and alcoholic beverages. Excise tax rates used for the calculation of excise taxes on mineral oils, alcohol and alcoholic beverages and on tobacco goods are given in Chapter 10 – Taxation. One of the basic objectives of the future development of the excise policy is equalizing of the excise taxes on domestic and imported tobacco products. In order to avoid the negative consequences for the domestic tobacco industry by radically equalizing the excise duty, the reduction of the excise tax will be done in phases, until its final equalization on 01.01.2007.  With latest amendments to Law on Excises (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 96/2004) excise tax on vehicles was re-introduced. In addition, corrections were made in tobacco products section – see 17H10_II_C_2 and 18H10_II_C_35. dministrative fees are paid for provision of administrative documents and services in the government administration bodies and other government bodies, as well as in the diplomatic and consular representative offices of Republic of Macedonia abroad. This issue is regulated with Law on Administrative Fees (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 17/1993, 20/1996, 7/1998, 13/2001, 24/2003, 19/2004 and 61/2004). The level of fee by tariff numbers is provided in Administrative Fee Tariff, as an integral part of the Law.   6. The Law on Property Tax (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 61/2004), regulates all property taxes based on property ownership and on the basis of property transfer – sale and purchase, substitution of real estate, inheritance, gift, etc. The following taxes belong to this category: property tax; inheritance and gift tax and tax on transfer of real estate and rights. a) The property tax is paid on the basis of ownership of real estate and movable property with a proportional rate of 0,10%. b) Inheritance and gift tax is paid on inherited real estate and movable property, and property received as a gift, at 3%, i.e. 5% rate. c) Tax on transfer of real estate and rights is paid on the transfer of real estate and rights on the determined market value of the property and rights at a 3% rate.     7. From the remaining revenues, one should mention the financial transactions tax, which was introduced in 2001 and paid at the rate of 0,5% of the value of all financial payments among the economic and non-economic entities. The purpose of its introduction was to cover a part of the 2001 and 2002 budget deficit. With reduction of need for further large budgetary deficit, determined by the internal crisis in 2001, the obligation for payment of this tax was terminated on 01.01.2003. 

11. Public debt stock: How have the budget deficits been financed since independence (main instruments etc.)? Please provide detailed information on the present stock of public debt (foreign/domestic creditors, currency, instruments, etc.), guarantees and arrears. 
The debt policy of the Republic of Macedonia in the past decade was determined by the situation with the Budget and Balance of payments, arrangements with the international financial institutions, limitations on domestic and international capital market, foreign exchange rate regime, foreign exchange policy, quality of macroeconomic policies, country risk, quality of structural reforms, etc.  Public debt in the period 1990-2004 reveals a trend of continuous growth, both in absolute numbers and relative terms. The level and growth of the debt of the Republic of Macedonia was a result of the following factors:   assumption of part of the external debt of former SFRY in a process of succession of liabilities without parallel succession of assets;   issuance of government bonds for rehabilitation of the banking system;   issuance of government bonds for solving the problem of so-called “old foreign currency deposits” inherited from the SFRY;   negative external shocks: military actions in the countries of former SFR Yugoslavia (1991-1995), Greek embargo on the Republic of Macedonia (1992-1995) and Kosovo crisis (1999);   internal security crisis in the Republic of Macedonia (2001);   financing of budget and balance-of-payment deficits; and   changes in the level of debt due to the exchange rate differences and the inter-currency relations.In relative terms, the increase of public debt-to-GDP ratio, beside indicated factors, was also determined by deep recession of national economy, experienced in the period 1991-1995, when GDP, in cumulative terms, declined by over 25%. The period 1996-2000 characterized with positive growth rates. Still, average GDP growth in this period was lower than the level of real interest rates,  It encompasses the loss of value of MKD in relation to other currencies in the past ten years, including one-off 16% devaluation in 1997. which, in conditions of persistent budget deficit, results with an additional growth of the debt-to-GDP ratio.

By assuming liabilities towards bilateral creditors (the Paris Club), undergoing since 1993 and assumption of part of the debt towards commercial creditors (the London Club) in 1997, the process of regulation of external liabilities is practically over, with Republic of Macedonia having no remaining non-regulated liabilities towards foreign creditors. The second factor affecting the level of public debt is macroeconomic situation during past decade. It is characterized by successful achievement and maintenance of price stability, but also by еџистанце of budget deficit, particularly high in initial years of economic independence. The budget deficit, as well as the policy of borrowing from abroad in order to increase the level of foreign exchange reserves in conditions of unfavorable trends on the current account of Balance of payments, caused accumulation of significant amount of public debt.
Thus, the current account deficit in the Balance of payments remained at a high level of 7% to almost 8% of GDP throughout the whole transition period. The current account deficit was at a low level only in 1993 – 3,3% of GDP, in 1999 – 0,9% and in 2000 - 2% of GDP.  

 The year 2000 is an exception to this, having high GDP growth rate of 4,5%, with 1,8% budget surplus and moderate increase of indebtedness. Additional unfavorable condition was the fact that double deficits were realized in conditions of decline of domestic saving, with the exception of 2000.The fiscal deficit was soon reduced from its initial level of 13% of GDP (1992-1993), declining within the next five years to an annual level of 0 - 2% of GDP. 2000 and 2001 are an exception from this trend, having opposite figures. Namely, in 2000, the intensification of the tax reforms and implementation of measures to increase savings of the state resulted in achievement of a positive budget balance of 1,8% of GDP. However, the internal conflict in 2001 changed the fiscal position due to, both reduced revenues (as result of declined economic activity) and high costs for financing the defense and security of the country. Because of that, the 2001 budget deficit reached a level of 7% of GDP. At the same time, deteriorated security situation, high budget costs and lack of possibility to respond to obligations towards foreign partners caused surge of Balance of payments’ current account deficit again to 7,1% of GDP in 2001, and to 9,6% in 2002. As of 2003, the deficit already dropped to 6% of GDP, with fiscal deficit also reduced to 1% of the GDP due to implemented measures for reviving economic activity in the same year. 
FINANCING OF BUDGET DEFICIT 
Although the budget deficits in Republic of Macedonia in the past ten years have not been significant, their financing in different time periods was carried out in several ways.  Monetization and financial repression (setting low interest rates of government bonds, high level of bank reserve requirements, ceilings on interest rates etc.), were applied in the initial stages of transition period, until 1995.  Basic and most frequently applied method of financing deficits in recent period was borrowing from abroad, which was forced option for Republic of Macedonia, taking into account underdevelopment of domestic financial markets, lack of domestic capital and low Inflow of foreign investments.Issuance of government securities i.e. government bonds, as a form of financing internal debt, was applied in the process of rehabilitation of banking system in 1995 and 2000, as well as in resolution of “old foreign currency deposits” problem in 2000. In 2004, issuance of treasury bills began, as method of financing budget deficits due to substitute foreign borrowing. The proceeds from privatization, although not very high, were, to a certain extent, used for financing the budget deficit. This was especially notable in 2001, as year with the highest budget deficit, when As an exception, in certain years (1998, 2000 and 2001), there were high inflows of capital as foreign direct investments, as higher-quality form of financing the current account deficit.

INTERNAL DEBT 
The largest share in the structure of the internal debt of Republic of Macedonia, measured by initial amounts of issued bonds, belongs to debt based on state liabilities on “frozen/old foreign currency deposits” – 60,7%. It is followed by the assumed debt with regard to the privatization of Stopanska Banka – 13,4%, and the debt resulting from rehabilitation (sanation) of Stopanska Banka - 8.3%.

 The amounts in which certain instruments of domestic debt were issued in the years prior to the introduction of the euro are expressed using the main exchange rate of the euro quoted by the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia on 01.01.2002.
During 1992, the state received long-term loan in the amount of MKD 64,3 million from National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia with the purpose of regulating liabilities related to reimbursement of “frozen/old foreign currency deposits” to citizens. The loan was approved at a 5% interest rate and 10 years repayment period, commencing on 01.01.1994. The last instalment was paid in January 2004, thus completely settling all liabilities thereof. The sanation of bank process was carried out by implementing several measures. One of them was removal of amount of foreign currency deposits and foreign exchange accounts of the citizens, guaranteed by the Republic of Macedonia, from banks’ balances. The second measure revision of the legal basis of reimbursements on foreign currency deposits that were removed from banks’ balances covered with their own funds. In that respect, in order to determine the precise amount of banks’ claims from the state, on the basis of remaining foreign currency deposits, kept in banks’ balances, Republic of Macedonia issued interest-free bonds (Small bond), in the amount of EUR 52 million. The repayment period of the bond was 5 years, but due to early redemption of Small bond, the repayment was fully completed in 2000. 
Until 1995, Stopanska Banka, as a state-owned bank, dominated the financial market with a market share of about 70%. Still, due to its increasingly poor financial position and low liquidity, it became an obstacle to the development of the banking system. Acknowledging that, the government enforced measures for sanation of Stopanska Banka, both in 1995 and 2000. The first phase was implemented within the process of restructuring of loss-making enterprises, with taking over by state of all non-performing MKD loans of the Bank, amounting to EUR 75 million. Five years later, the government recapitalised Stopanska Banka for the second time before selling it to foreign investors. Eurobonds were issued in exchange for non-performing loans of the Bank from the four largest loss-making enterprises, totalling EUR 120,1 million. Pursuant to Law on Issuance of Denationalization Bonds by the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 37/2002), 6 issues of denationalization bonds are envisaged within the next 6 years. Until 30.06.2004, 3 issues of denationalization bonds were completed each based on separate decision by the Government of Republic of Macedonia. All domestic bonds were issued for the purpose of settling particular state liabilities, i.e. their issuance was conditioned by the need of resolving structural problems. Thus, their features do not match the requirements of potential investors (above all, long maturity periods).  Certain (smaller) portion of these securities is relatively liquid on secondary market (on the Macedonian Stock Exchange) and their trading is stimulated by the Government through granting certain favourable conditions. For example, according to the law, citizens can use bonds issued for repayment (reimbursement) of “old foreign currency deposits”, as well as denationalisation bonds for purchasing and repayment of state property, for redemption of receivables from the Asset Management Agency, for payment of concession fees and lease of state property. 
Treasury bills – In January 2004, Ministry of Finance, on behalf of Republic of Macedonia and on the basis of decision adopted by the Government (29.12.2003), began with continuous issue of short-term government securities i.e. treasury bills.  The treasury bills are risk-free financial instrument, whose repayment is guaranteed by the state. The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia acts as an agent of the Government with regard to the issue of treasury bills. The time schedule of issuance of treasury bills is set in the Calendar of Auctions, covering a period of two quarters. The Calendar sets the date of each auction, where the amount of each auction is published in the Treasury Bills Auction Prospectus, 4 working days prior to auction. The Calendar and Prospectus are published on the website of the Ministry of Finance.  The treasury bills are sold via an auction, where direct participants are banks settled in the Republic of Macedonia. Other interested parties indirectly participate in the auction, submitting bids via banks. The following chart provides a comparison of the supply, demand and the turnover at each auction of treasury bills, held by June 2004. *English Number format is used for this chart Source: Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Macedonia  The nominal value of one Treasury bill is MKD 10.000,00. The maturity period of the treasury bills is three months. The treasury bills are issued and paid-off at nominal, and paid-in at discounted value. All domestic and foreign individuals and legal entities are allowed to buy treasury bills. As of 30.06.2004, the ownership structure of treasury bills was the following: - 49% are owned by banks and 51% are owned by their clients (legal entities and individuals). The interest rate on the treasury bills is determined on the market, depending on inter-relation between supply and demand. The interest rate achieved on the auctions held so far, indicates that treasury bills, besides being risk-free, are also very attractive financial instruments from the perspective of the yield they bring for a period of three months. 0.00

Guarantees towards domestic creditors – The issuance of guarantees is regulated by the Budget Law. The Rulebook on the Method and Procedure for Issuance of Guarantees, adopted by the Minister of Finance, stipulates in more detail the method and procedure for issuance of guarantees for liabilities of state-owned enterprises and companies with dominant state capital based on loans taken in the country or abroad. In accordance with the Budget Law (“Official Gazette of RM“No. 79/1993, 3/1994, 71/1996, 46/2000, 11/2001, 93/2001, 46/2002, 24/2003, 85/2003 and 96/2004), the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, in the past years, issued guarantees in favour of the legal entities, mainly tobacco companies (in 2000), that used credits from domestic commercial banks.  The total claims by the state on the basis of realized guarantees towards domestic creditors amount MKD 913.392.791,50. With the aim of their collection, a court procedure was initiated against each of the debtors i.e. the claims were registered in the bankruptcy proceedings of the debtor-enterprises. There is a commitment to avoid future issuing of guarantees in favour of legal entities for the utilization of domestic loans, with borrowers using other instruments to secure their loans (for example: mortgage, collateral, drafts, etc.).

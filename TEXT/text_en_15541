BELGRADE, Serbia -- The two-day referendum on the new constitution begins on Saturday (October 28th). Passage requires 50% plus one, which translates into 3,319,693 of the total 6,639,385 eligible voters, including over 100,000 in Kosovo and thousands more living abroad. The draft constitution, adopted recently by parliament, stipulates that Kosovo is an integral part of Serbia. (Danas - 27/10/06; Beta - 26/10/06)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Three top government officials resigned on Thursday (20 July), following the disappearance of a man accused of masterminding the 2005 abduction of three journalists in Iraq. Romanian Intelligence Service head Radu Timofte, Foreign Intelligence Agency head Gheorghe Fulga and the General Department of Internal Information and Protection head Virgil Ardelean met with President Traian Basescu after Omar Hayssam, a Syrian-Romanian businessman, went missing before he was to be taken in custody. The three tendered their resignations after the meeting.
Hayssam is accused of masterminding the kidnapping so that he could arrange for the release of the hostages and avoid prosecution on financial misconduct and fraud charges. (BBC, Ziua, Evenimentul Zilei, Adevarul, Nine o'clock - 21/07/06; Rompres, Mediafax, AFP, DPA, Reuters - 20/07/06)

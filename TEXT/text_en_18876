THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Wednesday (April 4th) sentenced a former Bosnian Serb policeman to 15 years in prison for the repeated rape of two Muslim women during the 1992-1995 conflict. One of the victims was just 15 when she was forced into sexual slavery. Dragan Zelenovic, 46, pleaded guilty last January, saying he did not want the victims to be further traumatised by having to appear before the tribunal. 
The Zelenovic case set a new precedent, as it marked the first time rape has been treated as a crime against humanity. Three other Bosnian Serbs indicted at the same time have been sentenced to between 12 and 28 years. (Nezavisne novine - 05/04/07; AP, RTRS, NTV Hayat, Fena - 04/04/07)

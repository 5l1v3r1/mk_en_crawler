PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Opposition parties in Podgorica's city council will file a motion of no confidence against Mayor Miomir Mugosa on Friday (August 14th). According to the law on local self-governance, the initiative can be launched by at least one third of council members. Mugosa, a member of Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic's Democratic Party of Socialists, was accused of attacking two Montenegrin journalists from the Podgorica-based newspaper Vijesti earlier this month. His son, Miljan Mugosa, was also involved in the incident and has been recalled from his post at the Montenegrin Embassy in the United States. (RTCG, Mina, Antena M - 13/08/09)

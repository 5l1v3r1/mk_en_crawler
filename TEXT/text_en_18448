ATHENS, Greece -- At least 49 people were injured when a commuter train collided with a freight train near Athens on Thursday (July 12th) morning. Neither derailed, but nearly half those injured went to hospital, many with head injuries. 
In other news, three firefighters were killed Wednesday and another was seriously injured while battling a blaze in a forest on Crete. Authorities say strong winds changed the direction of the flames, trapping the victims' vehicle. (Naftemporiki, Focus, Kathimerini - 12/07/07; ANA-MPA, ERT - 11/07/07)

TIRANA, Albania -- The EU plans to send a team of experts to Albania early next year to look into reports of mass firings in the country's customs sector. The Albanian Customs Office has said around 40 staff members were replaced, but other sources say the actual number was closer to 140. Discharged employees have complained of being sacked for political reasons and in breach of regulations. 
In a separate story, the Council of Europe's Congress of Local and Regional Authorities said Friday (16 December) that it would also send a fact-finding team to Tirana. The Congress voiced serious concern over the deadlock between the Democratic Party-led central government and Tirana's municipal council, which is dominated by the opposition Socialist Party.

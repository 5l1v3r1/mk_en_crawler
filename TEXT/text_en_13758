PARIS, France -- During a meeting with Bulgarian counterpart Ivaylo Kalfin in Paris Tuesday (21 March), Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy voiced confidence that Bulgaria would be ready for EU membership on 1 January 2007, as scheduled. Douste-Blazy says France has already begun the process of ratifying the EU Accession Treaty with Bulgaria and Romania. 
At the same time, however, Romanian Foreign Minister Mihan-Razvan Ungureanu has openly criticised France -- historically, an ally of his country -- for delaying ratification of Romania's Accession Treaty. During a visit to Brussels earlier this week, Ungureanu said Bucharest was disappointed with the slow pace of ratification by EU member states, citing France in particular.

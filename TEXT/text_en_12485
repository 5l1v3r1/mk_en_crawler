BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian government media relations chief Srdjan Djuric denied on Wednesday (8 June) that the cabinet was in talks with war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic about surrendering to The Hague tribunal. A report to that effect appeared in the Belgrade weekly Evropa. The publication cited an unnamed source who said Mladic is seeking financial security for his family and medical treatment for himself.

ATHENS, Greece -- Dissident lawmaker and expelled member of the ruling New Democracy Party (ND) Stavros Dailakis wrote to Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis on Friday (October 3rd) asking for reinstatement to the ND. In his letter, Dailakis apologised for criticism of the government and said he would resign from parliament if the party refuses to take him back. On Tuesday, the ruling party expelled Dailakis for demanding the resignation of government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos. With the move, ND's representation in parliament falls to 151; the party, however, plans to replace him. (SKAI, ANA-MPA, ERT, Reuters, Kathimerini, Naftemporiki - 03/10/08)

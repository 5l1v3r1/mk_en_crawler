ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic said on Tuesday (May 15th) that sustained minority returns -- especially of Serb refugees -- are a key priority for Croatia and vital to national interests. Mesic was addressing a meeting in Zagreb, during which the latest UNHCR survey on the returns process was presented. It found that of 120,000 registered returnees in Croatia, 43% came back permanently to their prewar homes, 40% returned only to reinstate their property and other rights but reside outside the country, 6% have not yet fully settled their status, and 11% have died since their initial registration. 
In other news Tuesday, the Croatian Mine Action Centre sealed an agreement with Osijek City on clearing mines from surrounding suburbs. The project will be financed with over 20,500 euros from the city budget. (Vjesnik, Poslovni dnevnik, Vecernji list - 16/05/07; HINA, HRT - 15/05/07)

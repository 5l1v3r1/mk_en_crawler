ATHENS, Greece -- The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) issued a statement Friday (August 28th) expressing concern over conditions in a Greek detention centre housing hundreds of illegal immigrants, including children. According to the UNHCR, about 200 unaccompanied children live in the centre on the island of Lesvos, in the eastern part of the Aegean Sea. Many of the babies there, about 50, are ill because of "cramped and unsanitary conditions in the centre", the statement said, urging Greek authorities to reform its asylum system.

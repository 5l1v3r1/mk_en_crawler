PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The United States condemns the recent outbreaks of violence in Kosovo, US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Daniel Fried said on Wednesday (27 September). "Violence is utterly unacceptable. Those who perpetuate violence, those who attack the minorities, those who set the fires or throw grenades are not acting as patriots. They are cowards and criminals and should be treated as such," he said during a visit to Pristina. He also warned that a solution to Kosovo's status must be found by the end of the year in order to prevent instability. (Reuters, AP, UPI, Tanjug, KosovaLive - 27/09/06)

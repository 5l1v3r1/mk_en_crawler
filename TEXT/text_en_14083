STRASBOURG, France -- The EU should take into account its absorption capacity of new states, but also keep its promise to all membership candidates and possible candidates, the Members of European Parliament (MEPs) said in a resolution adopted on Thursday (16 March). It urges the European Commission to draft a report that would set the standards for defining the EU's absorption capacity. The MEPs noted that disputes over the new EU Constitution are affecting the Union's ability to accept new member states.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Ludovic Orban, deputy president of the National Liberal Party (PNL), announced on Sunday (February 28th) that he plans to seek the top leadership position at the upcoming party congress. Orban said he disagrees with certain changes pushed by the current president, Crin Antonescu, who is seeking re-election at the weekend. He and Orban worked together early last summer to oust Calin Popescu Tariceanu as party leader. (Evenimentul Zilei, Gandul, Adevarul - 29/02/10; Hotnews.ro - 28/02/10)

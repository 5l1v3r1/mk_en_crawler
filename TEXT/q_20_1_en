I. EDUCATION AND TRAINING 
A. Educational system 

1. Structure of the educational system: please describe the structure of the educational system, including vocational education and training (VET) and adult education, following the Eurydice format (http://www.eurydice.org). Give details of the different levels of education, whether compulsory and/or free of charge, and the mechanisms for transition between them. Also describe the role of private education and VET providers and of enterprises in VET provision.  
The educational system of the Republic of Macedonia consists of:  Pre-school education;  Elementary education;  Secondary education;  Higher education;  Postgraduate studies;  Doctorate;   Education of adults and  Informal education. The pre-school education comprises several types of institutions (independent or associated): day nurseries, kindergartens and pre-school preparation centres. The day nurseries are intended for children under the age of two. Children between the age of two years and the school age stay in kindergartens, and are divided according to their age. The pre-primary schools are intended for those children that are at an age of a year less than the age of attending first grade at school. The pre-school education is not compulsory. The educational process is conducted in Macedonian. For the children belonging to the communities, separate educational groups are formed in the kindergartens and pre-school centres, which are within the primary schools. The educational process there is conducted in the mother tongue of the children (Albanian, Turkish, Serbian etc.) The pre-primary schools are in the frames of the primary schools, while the other institutions are independent, or associated where there are groups of children from nurseries, kindergartens and pre-primary schools. The mode of work corresponds to the parents’ needs for education and taking care of their children in the course of their working day. In the Elementary education, with the Law on Amending and Appending the Law on Primary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 63/04), starting from the school year 2005/2006, it has been prescribed that the year of education before attending the first grade of elementary school becomes compulsory. for all the children at the age of six. This means that all the children from the pre-primary schools, as well as those attending the topmost group of kindergarten groups, will be obliged to attend the so-called preparation year. This will enable more equal start of the children on their entrance into the elementary education. According to the Article 1, the Article 22 and the Article 73 of the Law on Amending and Appending the Law on Primary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 63/04), it is prescribed that the elementary education lasts nine years, starting from the sixth year of age. Each child at the age from seven to fourteen is entitled to regularly attend the teaching instruction up to the compulsory eight  grade primary school. This legal obligation has contributed to crucial improvement of the educational structure of the population. Children start attending elementary school if they reach the age of seven before the end of the calendar year in which they have enrolled in the first grade. On the other hand, younger children are also registered in schools, if they become six before September (when instruction starts), on the basis of a positive opinion of a doctor, pedagogue or psychologist. According to the Article 8 of the Law on Primary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 52/02 – consolidated text, 40/03, 42/03 and 63/04) the instruction is conducted in Macedonian language and in Cyrillic alphabet. For the members of the communities, the educational activity is conducted in the language and the alphabet of the communities in a manner prescribed by law. The pupils of the communities learn the Macedonian as the official language of the Republic of Macedonia. The internal structure of the eight-years' compulsory education is adapted to the age of the children (in two periods): from the first to the fourth grade - the so-called class instruction and from the fifth to the eight grade - the so-called subject instruction. Conclusively with the fourth grade, as a rule, the instruction is conducted by only one instructor (teacher). In the upper grades (from the fifth grade to the eight grade), as a rule, the children remain in the same classes, but new classes are formed when necessary. In the populated areas where the number of pupils is small, regional schools are organised. Organisationally, they belong to the regular elementary schools (with classes from the first to the eighth grade). In the smaller settlements, if there isn’t a sufficient number of children, combined classes are formed in the elementary schools. There, one teacher conducts teaching instruction simultaneously to children from the first to the fourth grade, using different and various methods. After that period, the children continue their education in schools with separate classes from the fifth to the eighth grade. Upon bilateral agreements in the countries where citizens of the Republic of Macedonia stay for a longer period, additional teaching instruction is organised for studying the mother tongue language and culture, according to the syllabuses that are prepared by the Bureau of Education Development. Additional instruction is present in several countries of West Europe (France, Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Sweden), Slovenia, Croatia, as well as Canada and Australia. With the Law on Primary Education (Article 64) and with the Law on Secondary Education (Article 63), as well as in the pedagogical practice, children and youngsters of exceptional abilities and talent are enabled to advance faster in their education. Talented children are entitled to enrol in elementary school if they are at the age of six (before the start of the school year), and then they are enabled to advance extra-curricula (by undergoing examinations for the next grade). In the course of their education in elementary schools, children can take advantage of this right two times. Students showing extraordinary abilities and talents in the secondary schools can also advance in the same way (by undergoing examinations for the next school year). The advancement in studies of the higher education is regulated by the statutes of the higher education institutions. After completing elementary school, pupils are entitled to the right to enrol in any secondary school under equal criteria. This right is especially exercised by young people from urban areas, thus around 85% of the pupils after the compulsory education immediately enrol in some form of secondary education. The Secondary Education is not compulsory.  Pupils attend the secondary education free of charge. The Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 44/95) extends the democratisation of this segment of education. It grants the right to conduct secondary education not only in State, Municipal (public) secondary schools, but also in private schools. The teaching instruction in the secondary education is conducted in Macedonian language and in Cyrillic alphabet. For the members of the communities, the educational process in the public schools is conducted in the language and the alphabet of the communities, in a manner and under conditions which are prescribed by this Law. The pupils of the communities study the Macedonian language. According to the Law on Secondary Education, the teaching instruction in the secondary schools can also be conducted in one of the World languages. According to the prevailing practice, the secondary schools carry out curricula for several special fields of occupation, but there also are schools for only one vocational profile or for high-school education. The level of presence of high-school or special field education in the secondary education is established with the programme which is brought by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, upon a proposal made by the respective Ministry. In the Republic of Macedonia, the following types of secondary education are carried out:  High-school education  Vocational education   Secondary education of arts   Secondary education for children with special educational needs (disabled persons) The high-school education is of a general educational character. It lasts for four years and ends with matriculation examination. According to the Law on Amending and Appending the Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 67/04) and the new Concept of Matriculation and Final Examination (Matura), starting with the school year 2006/2007, the high-school education will be concluded with State or School Matriculation Examination. The State Matriculation Examination will enable a right to enter the higher education, and the School Matriculation Examination will enable an entrance in the labour market. The basic function of the high-school education is preparation of the young people for successful entrance in the higher education. The teaching curriculum of the high-school education includes compulsory teaching subjects, elective subjects as well as elective instruction materials. High-school students have an opportunity to choose elective subjects in one of the following areas:   literature and arts;   humanistic and social area;   natural sciences and mathematics. Around 35% of pupils of a generation enrol in the high-school education. A syllabus for an International Final Examination can be carried out in the high-school education, upon a consent by the Minister. The syllabus for an International Final Examination is of equal validity as the high-school education. The secondary vocational education continues after the elementary education and is based above all on acquiring knowledge, skills and routines from the sciences that are of practical value. The basic function of the secondary vocational education is pupils’ training for work, but also for continuation of the education. It ends with final or specialist examination. According to the mentioned Concept, starting with the school year 2006/2007, the four-year secondary vocational education will end with State Matriculation Examination or with School Final Examination. The State Final Examination (Matura) enables an entrance in the higher education, while the School Final Examination provides entrance at the labour market. The three-year vocational training ends with a final examination that enables entrance in the labour market as well as continuation of the education (under special conditions) in four-year vocational or specialist education. The four-year and three-year vocational training prepares pupils for wide area of vocation within the frames of different occupations. The vocational training of duration up to two years provides qualifications for simple jobs and profiles and the specialist education refines knowledge and skills which are necessary for jobs in which special technologies are employed. Upon finishing the vocational training, pupils undergo examination on vocational proficiency that enables employment or continuation of the education (under special circumstances) in the three-year secondary vocational education. After completing the specialist education, the candidates can be employed or continue their education in the Higher Vocational Education. The vocational education is defined on the basis of educational requirements which are established for each profile separately. Profiles related according to the required education are grouped in educational profiles, which define the required knowledge, skills, routines and attitudes. The educational profiles are grouped in twenty six vocations: agriculture, veterinary, nutrition, forestry, carpentry, geology, mining, metallurgy, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, chemistry and technology, textile, leather, graphics design, personal services, geodesy, civil engineering, traffic, trade, catering and tourism, economy, law, bureau – technical, arts, healthcare and physical culture. Within the frames of the vocational education there are around 260 educational profiles, including:   80 educational profiles for four-year education;   90 educational profiles for three-year education;   50 educational profiles for two-year education;   40 educational profiles for specialist education. The Secondary Education of Arts is intended for students with special capabilities, i.e. artistic gift. Because of that, the enrolment of students in these schools is done by special testing of their talent and capabilities. The Secondary Art Education is conducted in three branches of the Art: Applied Fine Arts (six educational profiles), Music (three educational profiles) and Ballet (2 educational profiles). It ends with matriculation examination (Matura). The Secondary Education for students with special educational needs is in fact a secondary vocational education which is realised according to adapted syllabuses. The adaptation of syllabuses starts with the choice of the educational profiles i.e. most commonly for one vocation of the educational profiles for which the students with particular needs can acquire the needed competence. For persons with higher degree of needs, only training for working ability is organised. The second type of adjustment is done in the curricula and syllabuses in respect of the scope of the general education. As a rule, the subject matters that have a function of preparatory education for higher studies are avoided or reduced, and those that enable the cultural and societal function of the secondary education are retained. The higher education system consists of undergraduate studies, post-undergraduate studies and doctorate. The undergraduate studies last minimum three and maximum five years.  The studies are carried out at the higher education institutions of the Republic of Macedonia. Besides the instruction for the students, both scholarly and scientific and research activities are organised in various scientific and scholarly areas, and also a permanent improvement of the teaching staff. At the faculties, in the first year of studies students are registered as full-time or part-time students. Around 27% of the generations, after having completed the high-school education, enrol at the universities. The conditions and the criteria for enrolment of new students are proposed by the higher education institutions, and are coordinated at the universities. At the competitions, candidates with acquired high-school education apply, as well as candidates from other four-year vocational and art secondary schools. Because of the limited number of subscription posts, a procedure of ranking of candidates according to their accomplishments in the secondary education is done, also taking into consideration the results from the qualification examination of the faculty. The criteria for enrolment of part-time and full-time students are the same. The higher-education institutions are associated in four universities: Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje, St. Clement of Ohrid in Bitola, The University of South-East Europe in Tetovo and The State University in Tetovo and at the private Faculty for Social Sciences- Skopje which are integrated in Inter- University Conference.  At the universities in Macedonia separate studies are organised for the so-called Higher Vocational Education. According to the Law, these studies last no more than three years. These kinds of studies should become more popularized in the future because of the needs of the labour market for highly educated and qualified staff, especially in the field of the technical and biotechnical sciences. After graduation, the students that fulfil the particular conditions which are established with the statutes of the institutions for higher education can continue their specialization at specialist or master’s (postgraduate) studies. The postgraduate studies are organised as postgraduate scientific or scholarly studies (Master’s studies), as well as postgraduate professional studies (specialist studies) (Law on Higher Education, ‘Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia’ No. 64/00). The postgraduate scientific or scholarly studies last for at least three semesters, out of which two semesters are for instruction and one for preparing the master’s thesis. The postgraduate professional studies last for nine months, out of which one semester is reserved for instruction and three months for specialist work. Currently, the University Ss. Cyril and Methodius in Skopje and the University St. Clement of Ohrid in Bitola organise postgraduate studies. After completion of the specialist studies, the candidate acquires a Diploma of Specialist, defending his/her specialist work. The postgraduate studies end with defence of the master’s work (or thesis) and the candidate acquires the title of Master of Science or Master of Arts. In accordance with the recommendations of the Bologna Declaration, realisation of two-level studies has started at the faculties in the Republic of Macedonia, comprising of undergraduate and postgraduate studies. Thus, the postgraduate studies will become more available for a larger number of graduated students. The Doctorate represents the highest scientific and scholarly title in the Republic of Macedonia.  Doctorate is organised mainly under the principles of mentorship. The Doctorate is acquired by defending a doctoral work in front of a commission consisting of five members who are competent experts in the respective field and after a previously gained opinion from at least three organizations or institutions of the relevant field. More detailed rules for defence of the Doctorate are prescribed with Statutes of the institutions of higher education as well as public scientific and scholarly institutions where the candidates can apply for a doctorate. In the 2004/2005 Regional doctoral studies in the field of civil engineering have been started.  Elementary Adult Education represents an integral part of the educational system. It enables the attendees to acquire the necessary skills, knowledge and expertise for quicker adaptation to the social milieu, quicker employment, more flexible adapting and finding their way in the labour market. According to the Law on Primary Education (Article 6), the elementary education of adults can be organised in elementary schools, as well as in institutions for adult education and in other institutions in accordance with this law. But, in practice, the regular elementary schools do not organise and do not endeavour to satisfy the needs of the adult attendees. The instruction in schools for adult education is conducted in Macedonian and Albanian language. In the elementary education for adults can also be entered persons who haven’t completed their elementary education, who are older than fifteen years of age and their obligation to undergo elementary education had terminated. This is organised and accomplished in accordance with separate teaching syllabuses and curricula. The instruction is organised as full-time and as preparatory, depending on the age, the psycho-physical capabilities of the person and his/her capability for self-education. The Secondary Education of the Adults (part-time students) is an integral part of the regular educational process in the schools for secondary education. The education of the adults as a structural part of the educational system is not thoroughly elaborated in the lex generalis within the sphere of the education and in other sub-legislation acts and regulations. According to the Law on Secondary Education (Article 52), in a secondary vocational school in the Republic of Macedonia, full-time and part-time students who have completed the elementary education can be enrolled. The public vocational education can last for two, three and four years and also there is a specialist education. The specialist education is performed according to separate programs. In order to be included in these programs, the candidates should have completed the four-year programmes, they should also have working experience from two to five years, depending on the course or the type of the specialist education. In the vocational training of duration up to two years, persons without completed elementary education are also included, but immediately together with the vocational training, the prescribed curriculum for elementary education is also completed. Nevertheless, education and training of the adults are mostly present in several types of curricula:   acquiring vocational education in schools according to curricula verified by the state institutions;   Curricula and courses at the workers’ vocational training centres that are developed according to the perceptions acquired by monitoring of the labour market as well as of the personal needs of the candidates. At the workers’ vocational training centres curricula and courses with different duration are realised;   Curricula for vocational training, additional training and specialisation, after or in addition to the secondary vocational education. 2. Statistics: please provide statistics on pupils/students and teachers/trainers at the different levels of the educational system, including VET and adult education. If possible give an estimate of the expected evolution over the next ten years. Provide statistics on public and, if possible, private resources allocated to education at national level (in % of GDP and national budget). 
According to the State Statistical Office, the number of students in the elementary, secondary and higher education is:

Comparing the data from the elementary and the secondary education, it can be perceived that in the last eight years the number of students in the elementary education is in continuous decline, while the number of students in the secondary education is in continuous growth. The rate of the enrolled students in elementary schools in proportion to the children who belong to the population of the official school age (from 7 to 14 years), in the last decade has reached up to 96%. It is expected that with the extension of the compulsory education:   The prevailing 82,23% coverage in the year before starting school, will be extended to 100%;   The educational structure of the population will be improved;   The basic education will be reinforced;   The opportunities for professional orientation will be extended;   The shift from elementary into secondary education will be eased and effectuated;   The program successiveness will be accomplished;   The educational capacities in the rural areas will be better exploited.

This trend has strongly determined the creating of educational policy in the state, especially in relation to the network of providers of educational services and their power of accumulation, as well as the specificities and the character of the educational prospects that the state should accomplish in the following period. Within the frames of the secondary education, the changes in the high-school education and in the secondary vocational education in the Republic of Macedonia are directed towards increasing the quality of education and towards the needs of the labour market. The most important segments of the changes that are going to take place represent the new teaching syllabi and curricula, by which the students are given greater opportunity to elect subjects that they are going to study. Thus, the numbers of high-school students and of secondary vocational school students will be equalized. In accordance with the programme and process changes in the high-schools and in the 4-year secondary education, new matriculation and final examinations are introduced in the secondary education. The successful implementing and executing of these examinations will largely improve the quality of the secondary education and will ease the entrance into the higher education. It is expected that in the following period, one of the key challenges for the creators of the educational policy and the educational system as a whole, will be the accomplishment of the level of education of the youngsters and the adults, with special emphasis on the increase of the quality of their expert/working and social competencies. According to the data of the year 2002, most of the unemployed persons have completed a four-year secondary education topmost – 98,16%, while only 1,84% have completed higher and university education. Because of that, the concept of lifelong learning and training should help establishing a dynamic connection of the education to the labour market and to the social changes. The situation with the coverage and school leavers of the number of students:   The total coverage of children in the pre-school education is 18,67%;   The coverage in the first year before starting elementary school is 82,23%;   The coverage in the elementary education is 95%;   The yearly school leavers of the number of students in the elementary education is 1,42%;   The yearly termination of education in the elementary education is 0,29%;   The coverage of the children who completed elementary education and enrolled in secondary education is 83,35%;   The largest school leavers of the number of students happens at the shift from elementary to secondary education and is 16,65%;   The yearly school leavers of the number of students in the secondary education is 2,84%;   The yearly termination of education in the secondary education is 0,88%   The number of students per 100.000 citizens is 3 043;   The lowest school leavers of the number of students during the education is present among the Macedonian population and the largest among the Roma population. The Ministry of Education and Science within the frames of its activities has prepared a Draft – National Programme for Development of the Education in the Republic of Macedonia for the period of 2005 – 2015, according to which in the next ten years interventions in the following strategic/key areas are expected: 1.  Education for all/providing of educational equity. 2.  Improvement of the intellectual growth and studying. 3.  Extending the possibilities for participation. 4.  Extending the educational, the cultural and the economic competency of the Macedonian society. 5.  Reinforcement and improvement of the international cooperation. 6.  Reinforcement of the capacities of the Ministry of Education and Science. This program, together with the action plans on reforms in all educational sub-systems, will be adopted by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia before May 2005. , training and youth 14/100 Year GDP (in EUR) Realised Budget of the R.M.

In average, for education is allocated 3,5% of the GDP and 13% of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. The structure of the expenditures per programmes is the following: the elementary education participates with 55%-60%, the secondary education with 21%-23%, the higher education with 13%-15%, the pupils’ standard with 2%-3% and the students’ standard 4%. The greatest part of the expenditures is for wages, i.e. 82%, for goods and services 8%, current transfers 9%, and for purchasing capital assets – 2%. Recurrently, the funds intended for covering the material expenditures and investments (heating, communal services, materials, current and investiture maintenance, etc.) are not sufficient for the needs of the schools. The total expenditures on education nominally indicate a trend of enlargement of 3%, but viewed per programmes, in the last few years the expenditures have raised for the elementary and the secondary education, while in the higher education the pupils’ and the students’ standard inclines towards lowering of the expenditures. For the year 2005, the budget of the education is restrictive and will stay at the same level as for the year 2004. With the decentralisation, it is expected that the municipalities (part of them), within the scope of their possibilities, and with their additional incomes, will participate in covering the funds for the education, except the funds that they will gain from the budget in a form of restricted subsidies for elementary and secondary education. In the future budget projections a particular attention should be paid to providing greater financial funds for education, and especially in the part of material expenditures and capital investments, in order to overcome the present unfavourable situation and to provide better conditions for instruction of higher quality. 
3. Education of children of EU nationals: please provide information on the estimated number of EU nationals working in your country and having children residing there at the age of compulsory school attendance under Macedonian law. Please indicate whether there are special provisions for education of these children (such as free of charge courses of the Macedonian language) and what are their main countries of origin. 
According to the data of the Census realised in 2002 (Law on Census of the Population and Households in the Republic of Macedonia – "Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia" No. 43/02), 16 students, citizens of EU stayed in the Republic of Macedonia. Countries of their origin are: Austria, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Holland, Slovenia, Great Britain and Slovakia. For the present school year (2004/2005) the data is gained from the Ministry of the Interior and from the Ministry of the Exterior. In accordance with the data gained from the Ministry of the Interior in the Republic of Macedonia, who are competent body for issuing residence permits to foreign citizens (Article 77 of the Law on Residence and Movement of Foreigners "Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia" No. 36/92, 26/93 and 45/02), in the Republic of Macedonia a total of 7 children resides, at the age from six to fourteen years, whose parents are citizens of the European Union. Two of the children are citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany, and five of them are citizens of Hungary. The Ministry of the Exterior of the Republic of Macedonia has data on 20 children whose parents are citizens of the European Union countries. They are from diplomatic and consular offices, missions of foreign countries or international organisations, and come from Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Hungary, Holland, Austria, Poland and Great Britain. The Law on Primary Education ("Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia" No. 52/02 – consolidated text40/03, 42/03 and 63/04) regulates the possibility for enrolment of children who are foreign citizens in the system of the elementary education. In accordance with the existing legal regulations, enrolment in the elementary education is possible only with previous validation and equivalence of Certificates gained abroad. For the elementary education this procedure is partly regulated with the Law on Primary Education (Articles 95 – 99 of the Law on Primary Education). The validation means recognition of the certificate concerning the rights that the owner of the certificate is entitled to, for continuation of his/her education. Documents that are needed in order validation i.e. equivalence to be performed, are: original certificate issued by a verified foreign elementary school, together with three copies of translation made by authorised official translator. The commission may ask for additional documents and based on that, a decision for validation is issued. With the decision the child is enrolled in the elementary school, in the appropriate grade according to the age of the child, i.e. the completed grade abroad. The state doesn’t organise some special benefits for these children, such as free lectures in Macedonian language. But, there is an initiative for organisation of optional instruction in Macedonian language for foreign citizens’ children who temporarily reside in the Republic of Macedonia. 
4. Equal access: describe arrangements to ensure equal access to education and training regardless of gender, ethnic origin, religion or disabilities.  
The equal access to education in the Republic of Macedonia is regulated in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and the Laws on Elementary, Secondary and Higher Education that have stem from it. The Article 44 of the Constitution allows the right to education to everybody under equal conditions, with special emphasis on the elementary education, which is obligatory and free of charge. The elementary education is organised and realised in elementary schools, but also inside healthcare institutions or penitentiary and correction institutions in certain cases determined by the Law. The Law on Primary Education (Articles 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 45) provides obligatory entrance in the educational system of all the children at the age from seven to fourteen years. In the first grade of elementary school children can also enrol if they become six before the start of the school year, based on positive opinion of a doctor specialist, psychologist or pedagogue. Every elementary school is obliged to timely organise and realise enrolment of all the pupils -obligors who reside in the region that is within the scope covered by that school, determined by the Ministry of Education and Science.  Each parent/custodian is obliged to enrol his/her child in the elementary school and is responsible for his/her child’s regular attendance of school. In a case of children not being enrolled in school, or in a case of unexcused absence of some of the children from elementary schools for at least thirty days, the elementary school is obliged to inform the Ministry of Education and Science. On request made by the pupil or the parent/custodian and according to the opinion of the school pedagogue and psychologist, pupils older than fifteen, who because of certain reasons hadn’t completed the elementary education on time, could continue the elementary education in the same school up to the age of seventeen, in adult elementary education institutions or in other institutions in accordance with the Law, until completion of the elementary education.  Pupils are entitled to organised free transport if their dwelling place is further than 2 kilometres from the nearest elementary school. If free transport cannot be organised, pupils are entitled to accommodation in a dormitory or at a family. For members of the ethnic communities in the Republic of Macedonia, the educational process is conducted in the language and alphabet of the ethnic communities. Pupils with special educational needs, depending on the level of their disability, are integrated in regular classes of elementary schools or in classes of separate (special) schools. These children are entitled to free transportation. The educational activity for these children is organised in a way which enables them easier gaining of knowledge as well as easier preparing for life and integration in the community. Foreign citizens and persons without citizenship can also gain elementary education in the Republic of Macedonia under conditions that are established by law. State institutions provide obligatory education for the internally resettled persons, as well as accommodation free of charge and textbooks for the pupils. The Bureau of Education Development develops abridged versions of the existing curricula. According to the Articles 3 and 4 of the Law on Secondary Education, everybody is entitled to secondary education under equal conditions. Discrimination based on sex, race, skin colour, national or social origin or religious affiliation, wealth or social status, is not allowed.  Enrolment in the secondary education in the Republic of Macedonia is performed through a competition announced by the Ministry of Education and Science no later than 31 March. If in a public school more than the established with the competition number of students apply for the first study year, after a gained opinion from that public school, additional criteria for enrolment are applied (certificates from international and state competitions, qualification examination). The Secondary education in the Republic of Macedonia is performed in public secondary schools (state, municipal, or schools of the city of Skopje) as well as in private schools. In the secondary (high school) education enrol students who have completed elementary education, while in the vocational education - full-time and part-time students who have completed elementary education. In the two-year vocational education persons can be included, who have not completed the elementary education, but immediately together with the vocational training they attend and complete the prescribed curricula for elementary education. The adult vocational training and the three-year vocational education can also be organised in other institutions established by law. The educational activity in secondary schools is conducted in Macedonian language and in Cyrillic alphabet, while for the members of the other ethnic communities, the teaching instruction in the public schools is conducted in the language of the ethnic communities, in a manner established by this Law, but with obligatory studying of the Macedonian language. The members of the ethnic communities, who attend the instruction in their mother tongue, use textbooks that are written in the language of their instruction. In the public schools of arts enrol regular students who have completed the elementary education and talented students who have not completed the elementary school. They enrol after a permission of the Ministry, with obligation to gain parallel elementary education. The students are also given the opportunity to enrol in high-school classes that realise programs for international final examination. In the public secondary schools, it is possible to conduct the instruction in one of the world languages, while in private schools, in a foreign language. The Minister adopts the legal regulations on the conducting of the instruction in one of the world languages. With the Article 5 of the Law on Secondary Education, it is prescribed that foreign citizens and the persons without citizenship can also gain secondary education in a manner prescribed by law. Children with special educational needs have an opportunity to continue their secondary education in separate and in regular secondary schools, registered and distributed according to the type and the level of their disability, and only if they have completed the obligatory elementary education. The traditional division of masculine and feminine occupations still influences the students’ choice of the secondary school, and in that sense, there is unequal presence of students of the both sexes. There are secondary schools where the number of feminine students prevails (economy or medicine), while the masculine students prefer the schools for mechanical or electrical engineering. The Bureau of Education Development through certain projects (Decade “Education for All” under UNESCO for Roma children) endeavours to enlarge the number of students in the secondary education (especially among the Roma population as well as in the rural areas). Expert teams through education of parents aim towards raising the awareness of the importance of the education. A person who has completed elementary education abroad can enrol in secondary school if the certificate that he/she has gained abroad has been validated. Everyone is entitled to entrance in the higher education and it is regulated with the Law on Higher Education (Articles 6, 95 and 157). This Law establishes the basic conditions for enrolment for undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral studies.  It states that the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia are entitled to equal conditions and right to education in the institutions for tertiary education. The enrolment in the undergraduate studies is done in accordance with the competition announced by the university. It contains the criteria and the conditions for enrolment of the candidates, which are equal for all the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia. This is done for the purpose of providing equal access to the tertiary education. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia brings a Decision on the number of students who enrol in the public institutions for higher education (whose the education is financed by the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia), upon a proposal of the State University and based on a previous opinion of the University Council. Decision on the number of students who enrol in the state higher education institutions, above the established quota, is brought by the university under conditions established by law.  A person who has completed four-year secondary education and fulfils the conditions and the criteria established with the enrolment competition may enrol to undergraduate studies. The Law provides adequate and equal entrance in the tertiary education for the citizens of the non-majority communities in the Republic of Macedonia as well. With a purpose of creating real preconditions for the accomplishment of this right, the so-called measure of “positive discrimination” is applied. This measure enables, within the frames of the already established competition conditions, in addition to regular students, members of the non-majority communities in the Republic of Macedonia to be enrolled in the first year of studies, by establishing the so-called additional quota. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia establishes the number of students in the additional quota. This measure, with the Amending of the Law on Higher Education from 2003, (Official Gazzete of the Republic of Macedonia No. 49/03) is established as a legal obligation and is included in the Article 95, Paragraph 9 of the Law. Foreign citizens also have access to the tertiary education, but the principle of reciprocity should be respected (equal conditions to be provided for our students abroad). Persons without citizenship are enabled the right of access under conditions established by law and in accordance with the ratified international acts.  A person with completed secondary education of four or less than four years can enrol in undergraduate studies lasting less than four years or in the higher vocational schools, if the person fulfils the other conditions and criteria that are established by the statute of the higher education institution and the conditions and criteria established by the competition. An exceptionally talented person can enrol in studies in the field of arts, although he/she has not completed the secondary education, under the condition to acquire the secondary education until the end of the second year of studies, in accordance with the conditions that are established with the Statute of the faculty.   In the Republic of Macedonia, in addition to state universities, private institutions of higher education also provide access to the higher education, if they fulfil the conditions established by this law, based on an approval of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. The founder of such an institution is obliged to provide conditions and equipment for accomplishment of the educational, scientific or art activity, prescribed with the Law on Higher Education and the Rulebook on Norms and Standards. With the adoption of the Law on Establishment of State University in Tetovo (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 8/04), the State University in Tetovo has been established and started to work in accordance with the Law on Higher Education since 1 of October 2004. It consists of five faculties: Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, Faculty of Humanist Sciences and Art; Faculty of Economy; Faculty of Law and a Centre for Polytechnic Studies as a higher vocational school. At this university, for the students that are members of the Albanian community and represent more than 90% of the enrolled students, the instruction is conducted in Albanian. The Decision of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia on the additional quotas for enrolment of students – members of the communities, brought for the academic year 2004/2005, prescribes that at the state universities with same curricula as those at the State University in Tetovo, the members of the Albanian community can enrol only within the regular quotas. The status of a student and thus a member of the academic community in the Republic of Macedonia can be gained by everybody under equal terms established by law, statute and study program. With the Article 157, a student has a right to full-time studying and to the status full-time student, as well as the right to part-time studying and a status of part-time student. A student has a right to choose the type of studies and to study simultaneously several study programs of different fields, as well as different courses. Once the student is enrolled, he/she has a right to continue the studies at some other institution of higher education if the first one ceases to work. The student can use the rooms, the equipment (the textbooks), the libraries, the software and all the other scientific and scholarly infrastructure of the institution of higher education. The student is also entitled to the services of the students’ standard. Persons who are parentless, blind, deaf, disabled persons of first or second degree, mothers with infants up to the age of six, as well as hospitalized persons can also gain the status of a student, a candidate for a doctoral degree or for a specialization. The Statute of the institution of the higher education provides them with special benefits. The instruction in the institutions of higher education is conducted in Macedonian language. However, the Article 95 of the Law offers possibility for it to be conducted in the languages of the members of the ethnic communities, under conditions established by law. The instruction can also be conducted in one of the world languages: for some of the foreign language study programs, for parts of study programs in which foreign teachers participate and for study programs for which the instruction is held in Macedonian language as well. Large numbers of non-governmental organizations in the Republic of Macedonia realise educational programs and organise activities under equal conditions for everyone. 5. Stabilisation of reforms: what are the main objectives and the timetable for implementation of the most recent reforms of the education and training system or of current reforms? Should the system undergo yet more reforms? 
The major societal, political, economic, cultural and social changes that have taken place in the Republic of Macedonia since its independence until today (1991 – 2004) have expectedly influenced the existent educational system, causing changes in the educational policy in our country. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia, as well as the Ministry of Education and Science, in the period after the year 2002 have supported the decisions for changes in the educational system and the establishment of new standards for compulsory elementary education, as well as for secondary and higher education. The changes are founded on the modern processes of democracy, decentralization, autonomy, pluralism, multiculturalism and globalisation, as well as on the international documents of education and educational standards of knowledge and skills, established on the principles of lifelong learning. The main objectives aim towards: increasing the percentage of the coverage of pupils and students; innovating the instruction and more appropriate satisfaction of the needs for education of the youngsters and the adults; intensifying the professional teacher training; implementation of the computerisation program for the schools for the purpose of using the information technology; satisfying the needs of the labour market; developing skills more than knowledge; improving the quality of the educational services, etc. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia in the last few years continuously has innovated the system of education, intervening in certain system, contents and methodical matters, and changes on an institutional level are in process, which mean appropriate institutional support for successful implementation of the reforms and improvement of the quality of the education. Considering the fact that as the most evident weakness of the education in the Republic of Macedonia is considered to be its being centralised, in the reform of the educational system the priority is put on the process of educational decentralisation. For this purpose, a consistent Decentralisation Concept in the education has been prepared. In this direction, amendments have been adopted of the Law on Primary Education (“Official Gazzette of the Republic of Macedonia” No 63/04)   and of the Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No.67/04), which provided a legal framework for the start of this process. This process has several anticipated objectives: reinforcing the responsibility, improving the quality of the education and rational spending of the resources intended for education. The process will result in:   Reorganisation of the educational administration and management through the new laws on local self-government and the financing of the local self-government;   Improving the management and the administration of the education, including the strategic and the conception capacities on central level;   Development of more efficient system of financial planning, allocations and financial management;   Improving the management on local and school level, as well as the professionalism and the efficiency of the employees in the schools and the local self-government;   Precise defining and reconstructing the role and the responsibilities of the administrative institutions on all the three levels;   Building a system of school self-government and providing of training in the school management, for the principals of the schools;   Evaluating - utilising the capacities of the administrative institutions for monitoring and evaluation of schools. The started activities in the process of decentralization of the education will in large extent be professionally and financially supported with the realisation of the Project on Modernisation of the Education. For that purpose, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, through the Ministry of Education and Science, has provided Budget resources of three million USD, as its own share. Remaining part of the financing of the Project is provided through a loan from the World Bank in the amount of five million USD, as well as a grant of the Netherlands’ Government in the amount of twelve million USD. It is expected that the activities in the frames of this project will contribute to establishing a system of ensuring quality, system for accreditation of providers – institutions and programs, as well as a system of evaluation. The system of ensuring quality on a school level includes reinforcement of the school autonomy through development of schools’ capacities for implementation of self-evaluation, development planning, reinforcing the role of the school board, and professionalizing the function ‘school principal’. On a state level, introduction of external evaluation is anticipated, by the State Educational Inspectorate, which changes and enlarges the competencies of this institution. In addition, external assessments at the end of separate phases in the educational system are anticipated and external examinations at the end of the four-year secondary education. Parts of the activities that are related to the external assessments and examinations have been started with forming of the Assessment Department within the frames of the Bureau of Education Development. Important activity in the function of ensuring quality is establishment of sustainable and independent system of teacher training, which is also a part of the activities that are planned with the Project on Education Modernisation. The mentioned activities need appropriate institutional setup, which is one of the reasons for reorganisation of certain institutions on a state level, as are the State Educational Inspectorate and the Bureau for Education Development, as well as the Centre for Secondary Vocational Education and Training. For establishment of the accreditation system of providers – institutions for teacher and manager training, it is anticipated that an institutional frame should first be prepared for management and development of human resources; procedures for implementation of a competing system of implementation of training should be established, as well as deciding on the mechanisms of general accreditation of the providers of the training. Standards and plans for staff training will also be developed, as well as mechanisms for supervising the training in the course of work, and a system for issuing certificates.  In the frames of establishing the system of evaluation, procedures for evaluation on school and out-of-school level, as well as indicators on self-evaluation will be developed. The largest part of these activities will start to realise in the year 2005, and part of the decisions that are expected in the frames of the external evaluation and self-evaluation have been piloted during the past three years. The next system innovation that is going to be started is the extension of the compulsory education from eight to nine years, by introducing preparatory year in the sub-system of the elementary education. In accordance with the Law on Amending and Appending the Law on the Elementary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 63/04), this novelty is going to start its realisation in the next school year. In the scope of the total changes of the educational system, the changes in the secondary education (which, as its subsystem, is the most unstable and the most changeable part), had in the last decade, and still have, separate position and treatment. Starting from the global needs for changes, in our Republic, in the course of 1996, a Program Structure of the Secondary Education was prepared and adopted. The document defined the global relations within the frames of this sub-system, and above all, represented a foundation for the system changes and the changes in the syllabi and the curricula for the secondary education. In this document decisions were proposed, which are based on our educational traditions and real possibilities for implementation of the theoretical knowledge, the practical experiences and tendencies for development of the secondary education in Macedonia, and wider in Europe and the world. The function, the contents and the organisation of the secondary education according to the Program Structure are founded on the widely accepted principles: democracy, individualisation and differentiation, integration, rationality and efficiency, innovativeness and creativity, as well as permanent ness in education and compatibility. In accordance with the proposed solutions in the Program Structure, the vocations were redefined, thus lowering their number from the existing 29 to 25 vocations or groups of vocations, while the number of the educational profiles lasting four and three years of education has been lowered from the existing 171 to 112, depending on the similarity characteristics of the educational needs. Alongside the usual changes in the contents and the realisation of certain components of the system of the secondary education, other measures were also undertaken in our Republic for more detailed workout of certain aspects of the changes and of creation of conditions for more authentic implementation of the new decisions. One of those measures is the Project PHARE on development of the curriculum in the vocational education, which in addition to the description explicitly given in the title, also comprises the support for improvement of the educational personnel, equipping of schools and enhancement of their internal organisation. The PHARE Program on integrated reform of the secondary vocational education and training in the Republic of Macedonia (MA 9703, ETF/97/VET/CTF/0019), with approval of the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia, has been realised by the Ministry of Education and Science since 1998. The main objective of the reformed secondary vocational education and training was creation of personnel with professional knowledge, and above all, skills and competences appropriate to the modern needs and the dynamic labour market. In order to achieve this objective, program documents have been prepared, as are the General State Curriculum and Curricula Standards on: vocation or groups of vocations, educational profile, school, subject of instruction and teaching hour. In accordance with the General State Curriculum, the secondary vocational education and training enables the student to gain universal capabilities and vocational competences that are needed at the labour market, as well as to continue the education in the institutions of higher education. Consequently, the reformed secondary vocational training of the educational profiles with education that lasts four years, enables the student, according to his/her own preferences and interests, to choose between undergoing a vocational final examination or a general matriculation examination. In the present period, the realisation of the VET 3 financed by CARDS is in progress, in the frames of which the following activities should be realised:   establishment of an institution (Vocational Education and Training Centre) for support and development of the vocational training;  teacher training;   training of principals of the educational institutions. Thus, in the secondary vocational education and training, the following profiles have been reformed:   22 educational profiles of 11 vocations or groups of vocations that are present in 52 schools;   8 educational profiles of 3 vocations for students with special educational needs thatare present in 4 schools. In the school year 2004/2005, 56 schools have been included in the reformed secondary vocational education and training. In the frames of the fourth phase of VET 4 (CARDS) which is going to start in 2005, the component related to the equipment of the educational institutions is expected to be realised. In 1999, an Agreement for Technical Cooperation between the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Macedonia has been signed. A year later, in 2000, in the frames of the Pact for Stability of South-East Europe, in cooperation with the German Association for Technical Cooperation, the project “Improvement of the Vocational Training in the Technical Vocations” has started. The goal of the project is to qualify the students of the secondary vocational education that lasts three years, in accordance with the needs of the structural changes in the economy of the Republic of Macedonia and to adjust the secondary vocational education to the altered economic conditions. The project envisages accomplishment of the following results:   improvement of the conditions for the vocational and the practical education in the pilot schools;   appropriate qualification of the teaching staff, especially the teachers of the vocational subjects;   realisation of the vocational education and of the practicum in accordance with the requirements of the labour market;   development of a unique system of vocational education and training, relevant to the needs of the labour market etc. In the frames of the project, program documents are prepared for three educational profiles that last three years, for three vocations (electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and traffic). After the performed equipping of the schools, training of teachers and providing the other necessary conditions, in the school year 2003/2004, the new teaching curricula and syllabi have started to realise in seven pilot schools. Starting with the year 2004, in the secondary education in the Republic of Macedonia, with support by the USAID, the realisation of the SEA project has started (activities in the secondary education). In the frames of this project, in the following five years the following components should be realised:  teacher training;  principals’ training  career development. With the project 50 schools will gradually be involved. The Ministry of Education and Science continually coordinates these projects in the secondary education for of preventing parallelism. In a similar way, changes have been initiated in the high school education in the Republic of Macedonia. After the introduction of the high school education, in the course of the last decade of the last century, positive experience was noticeable, but also weaknesses and drawbacks, which more or less influenced the quality of this type of education. The weaknesses were related, above all, to: the high unification of the teaching curricula and syllabi; non-existence of criteria in the high school curricula for enrolment of the students; the traditional internal organization of the life and activities of students in schools; non-existence of standards of following and assessment of students, etc. More important amendments of the Teaching Curriculum and Syllabi for the high school education were adopted in the year 2001. Their realisation has started since the school year 2001/2002, with the whole population of students, without any previous preparations and pilot researches on the offered alterations. This meant a beginning of educational activities in the most elite kind of secondary education in the Republic of Macedonia without previously prepared conception for high school education, insufficiently trained teaching staff, inappropriate working conditions, undefined methodology and organization of the teaching process, etc. In the course of the two-year implementation of this curriculum, more problems appeared, as well as open questions, dilemmas, inconsistencies and difficulties in the realisation of the teaching curricula. The parts of the Teaching Curriculum that were related to the elective subjects, to the obligatory elective programs and subject matters, because of the inappropriately defined status, have caused additional problems in the teaching process, and also additional burden to students, variations in the assessment, prolonged stay of students in schools, etc. Starting from these perceptions and facts, approaches have been made towards certain alterations and appending of the Teaching Curriculum for high school education, as a short-term solution for improvement of the unfavourable conditions. The long-term solutions should be sought in the planned introduction of changes, in preparing a concept of high school education, defining standards and in a step-by-step introduction of the designed solutions in the pilot schools. Only then, a real reform of the high school education can take place. With the performed alterations and the appending, the Teaching Curriculum has been unburdened in the sense of lowering the number of teaching subjects and decreasing the total fund of teaching hours in all the study years. By defining the status and the function of its separate teaching areas, essential conditions have been provided for more efficient organisation of the educational activity in the schools. Republic of Macedonia has been following the processes that have been initiated with the Sorbonne Declaration and has coordinated the reforms in the field of the higher education, with the Bologna Process of building a unique European field of higher education. The reforms have accelerated after the official acceding in the Bologna Process, on the Berlin Conference of the European Ministers competent for the higher education, in September 2003. The Law on Higher Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 64/00) and the Law on Amending and Appending the Law on Higher Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 49/03) represent the legal framework for implementation of the process. The Law regulates: the legal status and the autonomy of the universities, the establishment of state and private institutions of higher education, the system of ensuring quality (evaluation and accreditation), the manner of financing, the structure of the grades, the institutional framework, the recognition of the acquired grades and qualifications, etc. In the year 2003, norms and standards were adopted for establishment of institutions of higher education, in accordance with which the accreditation is performed. The adoption of the Law on Establishing a State University in Tetovo (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 8/2004) created normative and legal prerequisites for larger access to the higher education of the minority communities such as the Albanian and other communities. The further modernisation of the legislation will encompass: the structure of the grades and the qualifications (including the professional higher education and the applied sciences); different forms of lifelong learning and recognition of the qualifications that result from the continuing process of education; strengthening of the relation university – faculties, with promotion of integrated university (a complex structural change that should be performed within a period of five years); establishment and recognition of  “shared grades”; larger participation of students in the key institutional functions and processes; establishment of legal basis for portability of the national scholarships and student credits. With the establishment of the Council for Development and Financing of the Higher Education, in November 2003, in the reform processes, a partnership structure of the state administrative bodies and the institutions of higher education have been established. Large numbers of the Council commissions work on defining the criteria on financing the higher education, preparing a programme for development of the higher education, etc. The Minister of Education and Science formed a group for monitoring the Bologna Process, with representatives from the universities of the Republic of Macedonia, from the students’ organisations and from the Ministry. The group prepared the National Report on the Implementation of the Bologna Process in the period 2004 -2005.  An Accreditation Board and an Evaluation Agency are established, as structures for ensuring quality in higher education. In 2002 a national project was realised, through which the first self-evaluation of the institutions of higher education has been performed. In cooperation with the European Association of the Universities, the German Rector’s administration, the Embassy of the Republic of France, the Ministry of the Exterior of Austria, the foundation ‘Open Society Institute “Macedonia” ’ etc., external evaluation of the universities has been performed. Further activities in the area of ensuring quality will be directed towards acceding in the European Network Quality Agency (ENQA), acceptance and application of the standards, the procedures and the directions that are prepared by ENQA, and cooperation with the bodies for ensuring quality from the countries of South-East Europe. Republic of Macedonia is a member of the network of SEE agencies for accreditation and evaluation.   The adjustment of the existent two-grade system of higher education is the key element of the reforms. The first and the second grade should be differently oriented and should form different profiles, in order to be adjusted to the individual needs, the academic needs and the needs of the labour market. At the beginning of 2004, in collaboration with the German Rectors’ Conference, the Ministry of Education and Science organised a Conference of Higher Vocational Education and Applied Sciences. In the academic year 2004/2005, most technical faculties at the universities of Skopje and Bitola introduced three-year studies, oriented towards the needs of the labour market.  The Republic of Macedonia is following the activity of the “European Network of Qualifications”, and is going to prepare a national network of qualifications. Through the TEMPUS project, inclusion in the third phase of the TUNING project that has been financed by the European Commission is expected. Because of the need of close relation between the European area of higher education and the European research area, at the Conference in Berlin, the ministers have extended the focus of the two-grade studies by including the doctoral studies as a third cycle in the Bologna Process. The importance of research is emphasised, as well as the training of the researchers and the promotion of interdisciplinary fields in the third cycle. Mobility on the level of doctoral studies and on the post-doctoral level is motivated, and the institutions are encouraged to extend the cooperation in the field of doctoral studies and education of young researchers. Development of networks for doctoral studies is stimulated, as well as development of centres of excellence, as promoters of the development of “Europe of Knowledge”. The Republic of Macedonia utilizes the Sixth Framework Program of the European Union, the COST Program, The UNESCO Program, the UNDP, the IAEA, and has a bilateral cooperation with countries of the European Union, the USA, Japan and other countries, for reinforcing the research and development components. The new SOCRATES –TEMPUS actions and the Erasmus Mundus Programme of the European Union have extended the possibilities for mobility on postgraduate and doctoral level. Republic of Macedonia pays particular attention to the development of credit systems harmonised with ECTS. Restructuring of the study programs, their modularization and introduction of credit systems are in progress. The extending of the credit systems by inclusion of the vocational education and credits for lifelong learning should become part of the reforms. Many TEMPUS projects have helped in development of patterns and introducing credit systems in the institutions of higher education at the universities in Skopje and Bitola. The implementation of the ECTS in these universities is obligatory starting with the year 2005. The University of South-East Europe in Tetovo has implemented the ECTS since 2001. The State University in Tetovo, which started working in October 2004, is obliged to develop the study programs in accordance with the ECTS. The implementation of the ECTS should enable larger mobility of the students within the frames of the institutions of higher education, among the universities in the country, the region and wider. The further activities in the field of ECTS will be directed towards implementation of the European Commission Guidebook on the ECTS, monitoring the development and the implementation of the ECTS system as a system of accumulation and transfer of credits related with the formal and informal education as well as the informal lifelong education. The Republic of Macedonia has ratified the Lisbon Convention in 2003. The country is a member of the ENIC/NARIC network of acknowledgement centres for courses, degrees and diplomas. The National Information Centre functions within the frames of the Ministry of Education and Science. Before 2005, conditions should be created for every graduate student, in addition to the Diploma, also to be granted Diploma Supplement without extra fees. Republic of Macedonia should actively be included in the Project on creating global qualifications network in the European area of the higher education. In 2003, the Republic of Macedonia hosted the Regional Conference on Lifelong Learning. The Foundation “Conrad Adenauer” for three years in a row has been the patron of the Happening on Lifelong Learning, where, in addition to the institutions on higher education, a large number of non-governmental organisations take part. The Ministry of Education and Science has formed a work group that prepares a strategy for lifelong learning. Successful and efficient adjustment of the system of higher education in the Republic of Macedonia to the Bologna Process is possible with an efficient management and leadership. The current organisation of the state universities in Skopje and Bitola as associations of faculties, institutes and other organisational units, with a capacity of legal entities, restricts the opportunities for quality reforms. The establishment of a legal framework for development of an integrated university with the faculties and institutes as constitutive units, and its implementation, represent the priorities for the year 2005 and the following years. For the reforms in the higher education, the Republic of Macedonia gains considerable support and performs important cooperation with the European Commission (predominantly with the TEMPUS Program), the Council of Europe, the European Universities’ Association, UNESCO-CEPES, the German Rectors’ Administration, the World Bank, the foundation ‘Open Society Institute “Macedonia” ‘ and others. The bilateral cooperation with the countries of Europe is also intensive (Austria, France, Netherlands, Switzerland, Slovenia), and especially the regional cooperation with the countries of the Western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro and Croatia). 6. Governance and financing: please describe arrangements for the governance and financing of education and training, giving details about the degree of financial and administrative autonomy of establishments and about stake holder participation, in particular the role of the social partners in VET.

In accordance with the Law on Primary Education, the resources for financing the work are allocated by the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia; by projects that have been approved by the Minister; by the local self-government unit, by legates, presents and legacies. In the Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 52/02 – consolidated text, 40/03, 42/03 and 67/04) the School Board is established as a managing body in the secondary schools. The School Board counts nine members: two representatives of the establisher, three representatives of the students’ parents if they are not employed in the school; and four representatives of the teachers, based on the principles of expertness and competency. The representatives of the parents and of the establisher cannot be elected form the part of the employees in the school.

The management of the secondary private schools is established by the establisher. With the Law on Amending and Appending the Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 67/04), starting with March 2005, after the forthcoming local elections, a new way of forming and election of school boards has been established, as well as new competences of the school board. The managing Body in the public secondary schools is the School Board. The School Board in the public secondary schools is composed of twelve members: four representatives of the teachers, three representatives of the students’ parents, three representatives of the establisher, and one representative of the Ministry and of the business community, respectively. The representative of the business community participates in the work of the School Board, but does not have the right to participate in the voting or in bringing the decisions.

With the Law on Higher Education, the bodies of the University and of the Polytechnics are prescribed, as well as their structure and competences (the Articles from 64 to 79). According to the Article 64 of the Law on Higher Education, the bodies of the University are the Senate, the Rector and the Rector’s Office. The University Senate is a managing and expert body, which is composed of the representatives of the institutions of higher education and science within the frames of the universities, who are elected immediately, and with secret voting, for a mandate of four years from the rank of the professors, i.e. the senior research fellows, as well as the representatives of the students. In the Senate, an established number of members elect accompanying members of the university. The Chancellor and the Vice-Chancellor of the University participate in the work of the Senate, without the right to vote. The number of the members of the Senate, as well as their election and dismissal are established with the Statute of the University.  The competences of the Senate are prescribed with the Law on Higher Education, which also offers the opportunity to establish the other activities of the Senate with the Statute of the university. Thus within the legal competencies of the Senate are the following: it brings annual and four-year programme for development and activity of the university; gives opinion and proposals for the Programme of the Higher Educational Activity of the Republic of Macedonia, as well as opinion about the annual programme on the development of the institutions of higher education that are within its framework; brings annual financial return, as well as annual final financial report of the university; adopts the annual work report of the University; proposes norms and standards for the establishment of institutions of higher education and for the performance of higher educational activity, which are brought by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia; establishes uniform prerequisites for performance of the higher educational activity; establishes a rulebook on uniform rules of studying; a rulebook on uniform prerequisites of organising the postgraduate and doctoral studies; rulebook on the uniform standards of the credit system; a rulebook on the uniform criteria and procedures for election in teaching and scientific titles, teaching and associate titles; brings an international cooperation programme, forms a commission for evaluation of the university, as well as other activities that are established by the Law and the Statute of the university. The Senate can decide if more than the half of the total number of members are present at the session, and decides with the majority of the present members of the Senate, except for questions that are established with this Law and with the Statute of the University. According to the statutes of the existing state universities in the Republic of Macedonia, for bringing their statute, for the election of chancellor and vice chancellors of the universities, for acquiring and ending the membership in the university, another type of bringing decisions is prescribed, i.e. the senate can be in session if two thirds of the total number of members of the senate are present, and the decision is brought if more than a half of the total number of members of the senate voted for it. The Rector’s administration consists of the chancellor, the vice-chancellors, the deans of the faculties and of the polytechnics and of the accredited scientific institutions, as well as the representatives of the students, but also the heads of the associate member-institutions that are in the frames of the universities can participate, when questions related to their activity are discussed. The Rector’s administration prepares and proposes the Acts and the materials on the issues for which the senate and the chancellor decide; gives consent to the study programs of the faculties and polytechnics; decides on the organizing and the organisational units of the university; establishes the scientific or scholarly, i.e. the art fields, areas, and teaching disciplines for performing the higher educational activity in the institutions of higher education that are within its scope. It also organizes the issuing of diplomas, establishes opinion for merging, incorporation or termination of certain faculties within the scope of the university and their transformation into private institutions of higher education; it also harmonizes the co-financing of the students; announces competitions for enrolment of students in undergraduate studies and performs other activities that are established by the Law and the Statute of the University. The Chancellor is entitled to a veto of the decision of the Rector’s administration, when he/she is of an opinion that it is in the interest of the university, and to bring a decision concerning the critical issue. Bodies of a faculty are the Teachers’ Faculty Council, the Dean and the Dean’s Office, and the bodies of the polytechnics are the Teachers’ Council, the Principal and the Administration. The Teachers’ Council is an administrative and an expert body of the faculty, which is comprised of the full and associate professors as well as the assistant professors and representatives of the associates and of the students. The Teachers’ Council of the polytechnics is consisted of the professors, the senior lecturers and the lecturers, as well as the representatives of the students. The number of the representatives of the associates and the students, as well as their mandate is established with the statute of the institution of higher education. With the Law on Higher Education and the Statute of the faculty, the competences of the Teachers’ Council of the faculty, i.e. of the polytechnics are established respectively: it brings a Statute, as well as a four-year development program and an annual working program; elects and dismisses the dean and the sub-deans, i.e. the principal and vice-principal; establishes subject study programs; brings programmes on scientific research and art activity; elects the teachers, the teaching and scientific or scholarly workers and associates in titles; proposes the number of the students that are to be enrolled in the first year of studies at the undergraduate and postgraduate studies; brings measures for creating and promoting the teaching and research, and artistic junior staff, as well as for improving the standard of the students; undertakes measures for improving the teaching, and the scientific research work; brings financial return and adopts the closing account, and also performs other activities that are established with the Law and the Statute. The Dean’s administration of the faculty, i.e. the administration of the polytechnics are elected for the period of four years, and consists of the dean, i.e. the principal; the sub-deans, i.e. the vice-principal as well as the heads of the organisational units, and the representatives of the students. The more specific provisions on the organisation and the functioning of the Dean’s administration of the faculty, i.e. the administration of the polytechnics are established with the Statute of these institutions of higher education. The Dean’s administration of the faculty, i.e. the administration of the polytechnics respectively prepares and proposes the Acts and the materials for which the Teachers’ Council of the faculty and of the polytechnics decides respectively, together with the dean of the faculty, i.e. the principal of the polytechnics; it also decides on the rational performing of the activities, on the publishing activity and also performs other activities that are established with the Law and the Statute of the institution of higher education. A private university, as well as a private institution of higher education that is out of the scope of the university, i.e. faculty, can adequately apply the provisions of the Law on Higher Education that relate to the bodies of the faculty or of a polytechnics, in a way in which a university is organised, i.e. in a way a private institution of higher education is organised, and they can also have other Bodies with rights and obligations that are established with the Establishment Act. At the same time, the Bodies cannot have the rights and obligations which narrow the autonomy of the institutions of higher education, established with this Law. The transformation of the higher education in the Republic of Macedonia, today, after its independence and constituting as an independent and sovereign country, is accomplished in transformed and complex social, economic and political conditions, in circumstances of transition of the overall societal conditions. In this context, the universities have undertaken intensive steps for self-transformation into autonomous institutions, which for the first time have gained constitutional ground with the passing of the Law on Higher Education. The autonomy of the universities means academic freedom, academic government management and inviolability of the autonomy. The autonomy of the universities should, above all, be understood as spiritually-oriented, personnel, organisational, as well as operational and structural unity, which in practical sense will be confirmed through the freedom of creative activity, of internal organisation and the like. In accordance with the Law on Budgets and the Law on Amending and Appending the Law on Budgets (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No.85/03), the institutions in the field of education (elementary and secondary schools) which are budget beneficiary units, are obliged to submit annual financial plan within the scheduled deadline since the adoption of the Budget, so that they could use the funds that have been allocated with the budget. The financial activity of the institutions is established with the Law on the Execution of Budget of the Republic of Macedonia in accordance with approaching of the form towards the international classification of expenditures. The Budget for 2005 means further approaching towards the standard economy classification of expenditures which is needed for external financial reporting. The funds for performing the activity of the elementary education are provided by the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. Except providing the funds from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, the elementary schools also provide financial resources from self-financing services (giving school premises under lease, commissions from food supplement for students, commissions from students’ magazines and journals, etc). The revenues earned in this way are mostly used for covering the schools’ expenditures, with regard to the fact that the resources that are allocated by the Ministry are not sufficient. The starting foundation for financing the elementary schools is their annual financial work plans and programs. The Ministry of Education and Science approves the financial plans of the elementary schools and in an aggregated form for all the units, submits a financial plan for the activity ‘elementary education’ to the Ministry of Finance. The financial plan contains funds for:  Wages and fees  Material expenditures  Students’ standard  Capital expenditures (equipping of schools; running-investment maintenance and reconstruction, as well as building of new school premises). The funds for wages of the employees in the elementary education are established on the basis of criteria for allocation of the funds for wages that are provided by the Republic Budget for the elementary education activity. The mass of the funds for wages also contains funds for current and past labour. For every completed year of past labour, 0.5% of the amount of funds for net wages is estimated. For teachers who work in mountainous and in bordering areas, additional funds for wages are estimated for work in difficult conditions and in mixed classes. The financing of the material expenditures of the elementary schools is done in accordance with separate criteria that are prepared every year within the frames of the established funds with the Budgets (enclosed Criteria). For certain types of material expenditures the criterion is the number of classes in the educational institution, the area of the school premises, the work shifts, the heating of the premises, as well as the price of the services of the public enterprises. The students’ standard in the elementary education comprises:  Students’ transportation;   Accomodation and food of students in boarding schools and those accommodated with families; and   Participation for snacks for children – students with special needs.  The assets distribution for the running-investment maintenance and for capital expenditures is done in accordance with special programs, prepared on the basis of previously expressed needs by the schools. The amounts of the funds that are approved by the Budget for the running year are independently realized by the institutions and relate not only to the Budget funds, but also to the revenues earned from sources of self-financing and donations. For the following year the accomplishment of the first phase of the financial decentralisation is expected in the elementary and the secondary education, with regard to the running material expenditures (category of expenditures 42). The allocation of these expenditures will be performed on the basis of block subsidies. The expenditures for the teaching instruction in the secondary public schools are provided by the state and in the private schools by the students’ parents. There the adults who pay their own tuition fees are easily included. In accordance with the Article 113 of the Law on Secondary Education, the funds for financing the activity are provided by the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia; by co-financing the beneficiaries; by selling of products and services that result from the performance of the principal activity; by the trade companies, the public enterprises, the institutions and the bodies of the public administration in which practical training is accomplished; by projects that are approved by the Minister; by interests and dividends of invested capitals; by legates, presents, legacies and other sources. The public schools, i.e. the institutions for adult education can acquire funds by giving educational services to citizens, which are not qualified as needs and interests of the state and for which the state does not provide funds. In the secondary education the financial funds for accomplishment of the principal activity are provided by the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. The educational process in the Republic of Macedonia is accomplished in eighty six state secondary schools, four specialized schools and one Recovery Institute. However, with bringing the Law on Decentralisation, only six state secondary schools and the four specialized schools for rehabilitation will be financed on a state level, while the rest of the state schools will be financed on a local level. The financing of the activity in the state secondary schools in the Republic of Macedonia is performed in accordance with the formerly established measures and criteria on financing, that have been prescribed by the Minister of Education and Science, as well as in accordance with the Law on Secondary Education, the teaching syllabi and curricula, and in accordance with the announced Competition for enrolment of students in the new school year, and finally as the most important condition, according to the approved Budget for the running year.  In accordance with the Law on Execution of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, the state secondary schools – the units-beneficiaries prepare their own financial plan in quarters, in programmes and rates and are obliged to submit it to the authorized ministry, and the authorized ministry submits the consolidated plan to the Ministry of Finance within a period of 25 days from the day of the Budget adoption. The state secondary schools – the units-beneficiaries of the funds of the Budget are obliged to use the financial resources restrictively and cannot take responsibilities over the limit of approved funds with the Budget, at the same time strictly respecting the Law (The Law on Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, The Law on Execution of the Budget, The Law on Secondary Education, The Law on Public Procurement, The Labour Relations Laws and others). With the passing of the Law on Amending and Appending the Law on Secondary Education, the financing of the ten state secondary schools, the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia will finance the expenditures for the wages, the renumerations, the utility services, the heating, the communication, the transportation and the capital expenditures for primary and special maintenance of the buildings. For the rest of the 81 secondary schools, the financing will be performed through the municipalities, with restricted subsidies from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia (which comprise: the utility services, heating, communication and transportation), while the wages and the refunds on wages, as well as the capital expenditures for primary and special maintenance of the buildings will be provided by the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. Because of the restrictive Budget, year in year out it shifts the uncovered payments for the utility services, the heating, the communication, the transportation and the capital expenditures for the primary and the special maintenance of the buildings, which means transfer of the expenditures on a local level and additional burden on the modest budgets of the municipalities. Concerning the financial and administrative autonomy of the schools, it is a fact that they are strictly restricted in the part of using the financial funds of the Budget, because in accordance with the Law on Execution of the Budget, they cannot take responsibilities above the limit of the approved restricted funds. Regarding the using of the funds from the accounts 631 – Revenues from services, 787 – Revenues from self-financing activities and 785 –Revenues from donations, the schools do not have entire autonomy, i.e. although the schools regularly submit monthly financial plans for their monthly needs, the Ministry of Finance decides for their realisation, according to the available funds. The autonomy in administering the institutions of higher education is expressed through the available approved funds, as well as their own financial resources; forming of funds and establishing other organizations out of their own financial resources, donations and other sources, as a result of performing higher educational, scientific, publishing and applicable activity. The state universities and the state faculties, i.e. the state polytechnics have the quality of legal entity, one account for the activity through which they have on their disposal the Budget funds, as well as several separate accounts through which they have on their disposal the funds that they acquire by the self-financing activities, by donations and by credits.  The private institutions of higher education have a quality of legal entity and are entitled to a gyro account under terms that are established with the Establishment Act and with the Statute of the institution of higher education. By assuming the responsibilities of the Bologna process, the higher education is confronted with new challenges in its further transformation. In accordance with the Bologna Declaration, the faculties will gradually lose the status of legal entity and the universities will gain the key role. In the higher education, the resources allocated for the accomplishment of the primary activity are provided by the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. Except from the Budget, the institutions of higher education also acquire the funds from: performing educational activities with legal entities and natural persons; selling of scientific and expert services and products to legal, natural, homeland and foreign persons; interests and dividends; incomes on the basis of copyrights under property of the institution of higher education; legates, presents, legacies, contributions, and other sources. In accordance with the Law of Amending and Appending the Law on Higher Education, except for the financial resources for financing the state universities, financial resources are also provided for financing of private institutions of higher education, if in accordance with the Law on Higher Education the financing of the higher educational activity is prescribed, and also for study programmes, which the Government of the Republic of Macedonia has been interested in, for the sake of fulfilling certain needs in accomplishing the higher educational activity that the private institutions of higher education perform. The primary bases for financing the state universities are their annual financial plans, i.e. the programmes of the private institutions of higher education. The Development and Finance Council of the Higher Education decides on the allocation of the financial resources for the activity of the institutions of higher education, in accordance with the Rulebook on the measures and the criteria for financing the activity of the universities and of the institutions of higher education. The Council decides on the allocation of the financial resources on investments; on maintenance of the existing equipment and purchase of new one; on approving the funds for purchase of expert literature and on providing amortisation and insurance. For every budget year, the latest by 15 July in the running year, the Council proposes for the following budget year the amount of the budgetary funds intended for financing the universities and the independent institutions of higher education to the Minister who is competent for the activities in the higher education. The Ministry of Education and Science prepares a Draft-Budget and submits it to and coordinates it with the Ministry of Finance. The coordinated amount becomes part of the Draft-Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, which is submitted to the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia for adoption. After the approval, the funds are allocated according to the measures and criteria on: wages for the really employed executives in accordance with the weighted indices of the measures and criteria on financing; financial resources for regular functioning (for electricity supplies, water, postage expenses, hygiene, office facilities); for publishing activity, heating, and maintenance of the buildings. Every month, the institutions of higher education receive from the Ministry of Education and Science, a twelfth of the established funds for the performance of their activity, and they individually, on the basis of their own Acts, allocate the funds in accordance with the purpose for which they have been gained.  With the Law on Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, and the Law on Execution of the  Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, inter alia, the way of payment and utilizing the budget resources of the budget users in the higher education are regulated, as well as the individual resources that the faculties and universities realise. A common Treasury system is introduced in the Republic of Macedonia for the users of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, and in accordance with the Article 88 of the Law on Higher Education, the institutions dispose with the funds in accordance with the purpose of the donor. The restricted financial resources from the state represent one of the main obstacles in the process of transition and development of the higher education. The priority part of the entire changes in the higher education is the new system of financing which should be founded on financing a project-education for given activity and to be of real price, having in mind the teaching, the material, the technical, the laboratory and the other needs for its realisation. This means bringing new measures and criteria on financing the higher educational activity, and in this sense exceeding the present financing system. For that purpose the Council of Development and Finance of the Higher Education has formed a Commission that has already prepared the new Draft-Rulebook on the measures and criteria on financing of the higher education, which awaits adoption. The social dialogue related to the connection of the educational system with the needs of the labour market is performed on several levels. Namely, on national level, the Economy and Social Council is established, and consists of representatives of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, of the Syndicate and of the Association in Chamber of Commerce. In the frames of the Ministry of Education and Science a project on secondary vocational education is realised, financed by the European Union through the CARDS program. In the Managing Board of this project the members are representatives of the Ministry of Labour and Social Politics, the Employment Agency, the Chamber of Commerce and the Syndicate, and finally in the Republic of Macedonia a National Observatory exists, which has been formed with support of the European Training Foundation, and which should have a role of moderator in the social dialogue. Unfortunately, the present experience shows a passive attitude of the participants in the social dialogue, because of what in the incoming period measures will be undertaken for effectuating the role of the social partners in the social dialogue. This means active part of the social partners in the market analyses, defining the educational standards, drawing curricula of secondary and post-secondary education, work on mutual projects, drawing of documents and the like. The process of decentralisation will encourage the implementation of the social dialogue on a local level. 
7. Qualifications: please describe educational and VET qualifications frameworks and structures, including arrangements for recognition of informal and non-formal learning (work experience, in-service training, self-learning, etc.). 
In accordance with the Article 43 of the Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 52/02 – consolidated text, 40/03, 42/03 and 67/04) the secondary education is carried out through syllabi and curricula for: high-school education; vocational education; secondary art education and secondary education for students with special educatioal needs. In high schools only students who have completed the elementary education are enrolled as full-time students. On their completion of the secondary education, these students take final exams. An international graduation programme can be included in the high school education, upon the Minister’s consent. The international final exam programme is equivalent to the high school education.  In the public art school students who have completed elementary education can enrol as full-time students in fine art, music and ballet. In the secondary art education talented students who have not completed primary education can also enrol with prior approval from the Ministry, with an obligation to parallely finish the primary education. The students who have completed the last school year in the public art education take final exam in accordance with determined programmes. Students who have completed primary education can enrol as full-time and part-time students in the vocational schools. The public vocational education can last for three or four years, and there is also specialist education. Persons who have not completed primary education are also included in the vocational training; however, alongside the vocational training they have to complete the prescribed primary education curricula. The vocational training programmes and three-year vocational education can be also carried out at the institutions for adult education, and other institutions, too. These programmes are customized according to the needs of the economy. After their completion, the students acquire corresponding qualifications. On completion of the last school year at the public vocational education, students take a final or graduation exam according to determined programs. After completing the three-year public vocational education, students take final exam including practical work. After completing the four-year public vocational education, students take final or graduation exam. The students who take graduation exam attain the right to education of corresponding studies, whereas the students who take final exam with practical work enter the labour market. The programmes for final exam, graduation exam, and international graduation are adopted by the Minister and proposed by the Bureau of Education Development (except for the international graduation programme). In the secondary education for students with special needs, the students are educated according to tailored curricula for certain occupations or job training. The Law on Amending and Appending the Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 67/04) envisions new programmes for state final exam programmes, school graduation exam and final exam to start from 2007. High school students will take either state graduation exam or school graduation exam. After completing the high school education the students get a Diploma for passed state graduation exam, or school graduation exam. With passed state graduation exam students have the right to enrol at high education institution. The four-year vocational education students will take state graduation exam or final exam. After completing the vocational education students get a Diploma for passed state graduation exam or final exam. After passing the state graduation exam they have the right to enrol at high education institution; after passing the final exam they enter the labour market. The three-year vocational education students will take final exam and get a Diploma for passed final exam. If they pass the final exam, they enter the labour market. The art education students will take school graduation exam and get a Diploma for passed school graduation exam. The the secondary education students with special needs will take state graduation exam or final exam and get a Diploma for passed state graduation exam or final exam. The state graduation exam and part of the final exam (the practical part) will be performed by external evaluation of the acquired students’ knowledge. As a consequence of the reforms that have started in the secondary vocational education, the Law on Vocational Education and Training is in procedure, which regulates the levels of qualification that students acquire in the vocational education and training in a separate section. There will be five degrees, i.e. four levels of qualifications that the students will acquire in this kind of secondary education:   First and second degree – for acquiring vocational competence. Persons who have completed primary education can also enrol. Persons who have not completed primary education can also enrol, but are obliged to complete the primary education while acquiring the vocational competence,   Third degree – for acquiring a vocation and secondary vocational education. Persons who have completed primary education can enrol.   Fourth degree – for acquiring a vocation and secondary vocational education. Persons who have completed the third degree can enrol.   Fifth degree – for acquiring vocational specialist education. Persons who have completed the third and fourth degrees of the corresponding vocation can enrol. The student who has completed the first degree can continue his/her education in the second degree, and the student who has completed the second degree can continue his/her education in the third degree, providing educational continuity between the levels I, II and III. The first and second degrees correspond to level I, the third degree corresponds to level II, and the fourth degree corresponds to level III. After the completion of the secondary education, because of his/her personal needs or the needs of their employer, the persons could further extend their knowledge and skills or acquire new ones by training, re-training or additional training. If the persons continue their further secondary education at a secondary school, they receive a public document recognised by the state. If they continue their secondary education at another institution they receive a document, but it is not verified by the state. Students do not receive public documents verified by the state for studies such as work experience, in-service training, and self-education. In order to overcome these deficiencies in connecting the systems of the formal and the informal education, the preparation of the Law on Informal Education and Adult Education is in procedure. This Law will develop a certification system and a system for training evaluation, a catalogue of knowledge, criteria for accreditation of institutions for informal education and training, and other relevant issues with regard to the informal education. By including the State Statistical Office, systematic data collection of the informal education will begin. Currently, the informal education is carried out by the workers’ universities, the employment centres, the educational centres of the trade companies, etc. The workers’ universities with their programmes educate large number of trainees, most of which attend foreign languages courses, computer courses, courses for hairdressers, courses of cosmetics, preparatory courses for enrolment at secondary vocational schools and tertiary education institutions, sewing courses and for tailors, catering, radio and television mechanics and other occupations. The trainees of these centres get certificates that are not publicly verified by the state. With regard to the qualification system, in accordance with Art. 18, paragraph 2 of the Law on State Statistics (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 54/97), the Government of the Republic of Macedonia by a decision determined the acquired qualifications in the vocational and professional education and training by determining the national classification of occupations. It is the fundamental act on systematization of vocational qualifications and occupations in the Republic of Macedonia. By this decision the national classification of occupations was determined, with standard names and codes of occupation, by groups, sub-groups, and individual groups based on 1SCO/88 (International Standard Classification of Occupations). In the attachment, the names of qualifications acquired after high education and post-graduate degrees are specified. Beside this act, there are related editions which classify and regulate the professional high education qualifications. These editions include the “National Classification of Occupations” published in 2002 which is according to the standards and principles of 1SCO/88. It also includes the changes in the labour structure in market economy conditions. Harmonization was carried out alongside with the international norms and standards, by providing comparable data from the European Union Member States and the other members of ILO. A similar but informal edition was “Classification of scientific areas, fields, and research disciplines.” It was published by Tempus in 2001. This edition classifies the scientific-research, development, and creative activities, and the activities of the high education and the scientific and research institutions in the Republic of Macedonia. In the course of 2004, the CARDS programme started a new project on establishing a Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF). This fund is expected to develop into an Institute for Human Resources Development, with a role of an Agency for Accreditation of all  informal education institutions. 
8. Tuition fees and other conditions of access to higher education establishments (public and private): how are they regulated? Are they different for Macedonian nationals and for foreigners? 
Enrolment of candidates in undergraduate studies at the state and private institutions of higher education, is done in accordance with the Law on Higher Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 64/00 and 49/03), the Rulebook on the conditions and the criteria for enrolment in the undergraduate studies, which is adopted by the universities and the Decision of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia on the number of students that enrol in the first year of studies, which is brought each academic year. The number of the students that can enrol in the higher education institutions is determined according to the studying capacity and cannot be larger than the number of students, which is established with the accreditation of the higher education institution, based on the Rulebook of Norms and Standards of Establishment of Institutions for Higher Education and Performance of Higher Educational Activity (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 33/03).  The competition for enrolment of students in the first study year is announced by the Rector’s Office of the university, or the higher education institution which is not a member of the university. The Competition includes: number of students per separate study programs, conditions for enrolment, conditions and criteria for choice of candidates, procedure for effectuation of the competition, the amount of the tuition fees for students enrolled in the state quota, the co-financing fees for the candidates that are enrolled in the private quota, as well as the deadlines for application, for undergoing the exams and for enrolment of the candidates.  The students enrolled in the state quota, whose education is subsidised by the Ministry of Education and Science, i.e. the state, pay a co-financing fee in the amount from 100 to 200 EUR in the equivalent value of denars in the course of their entire studies. At the faculties, candidates who fulfil the conditions for enrolment but due to limited quotas cannot be enrolled in the category of students financed by the state, can also be enrolled as regular students. The enrolment in this category with the students’ co-financing is done under the following conditions and criteria:   Candidates should successfully pass the admission examination and should gain at least 60 points;   Candidates should submit a written declaration that they agree to co-finance their studies in the course of their entire studies; The amounts of co-financing for this category of students are as follows:   Technical Science, Natural Science and Mathematics              from 250 to 700 EUR    Social Sciences     from 400 to 600 EUR   Medical Science     from 700 to 1000 EUR    Biotechnical Science                   400 EUR Arts 800 EUR 
The private institutions of higher education, which can be established and can perform educational activity, if they are accredited by the Accreditation Board, can admit students through competition that will be announced by the institution of higher education, in a manner determined by their Statute. All the interested citizens of the Republic of Macedonia have the right to enrolment. In the 2004/2005 academic year the tuition fees at the private institutions of higher education are in the amount of:   Faculty of Business Administration and Computer Science   1.500 EUR Faculty of Public Administration     1.200 EUR   Faculty of Law and Communication Sciences 1.100 EUR   Post-Secondary School of Computer Science 1.500 EUR Post-Secondary School of English     1.100 EUR Faculty of Social Sciences      2.000 EUR Candidates – foreign citizens are enrolled at the faculties without undergoing the admission examination. The tuition fee ranges from 2 500 EUR to 3 000 EUR per one academic year. 
9. Please provide information on measures to integrate young people into the job market or higher education and VET, including educational and vocational guidance. 
On completing the secondary education, the young people in Macedonia are confronted with two options: to continue their education in the institutions of higher education or to look for employment at the labour market. In the last few years the institutions of higher education make efforts to attract the interest of the future freshmen through their own promotion. Through these presentations, they acquaint the future students with the opportunities they offer, with the curricula, and with the possibilities of employment after the completion of the studies. Such promotions are already of traditional character and are organised within the frames of the fair manifestations.  The employment after the graduation from the secondary school is a large extent hindered due to the large number of unemployed persons of relatively low qualification structure. A profile of secondary vocational education almost does not exist, although it is demanded by the labour market. Therefore, appropriate forms of education are organised, especially for those who have completed a high school education and have not continued to study, with an aim of their additional qualification and retraining. The workers’ vocational centres play an important role in the processes of additional qualification and retraining. Having this in mind, a Law on Informal Education is being drafted, by which new rules will be established in offering educational services of informal type, through an adequate system of accrediting. The professional orientation of the youth in the Republic of Macedonia is not institutionalised, which to a large extent hinders the choice of a future profession by the young people. The elementary and secondary schools pedagogy and psychology services are offered, which within their working assignments also plan activities for professional guidance of the young people. But those activities are not of systemic character. With reference to introducing and institutionalising of the professional orientation as important element in directing the young people and their proper integration in the labour market, in the last period activities have been undertaken within a scope of existing projects. The activities that have been realised in the last period have been focused on the establishment of professional orientation in the frames of the secondary vocational education and training. The projects have included several secondary schools. The professional work of integrating the young people in the labour market through professional informing and advising in the Republic of Macedonia is realised in the Employment Centres. In the Republic of Macedonia there are thirty regional employment centres in which Job Clubs work, which do the counselling on employment in the same profession, and they also work on balancing the capabilities and the interests; professional informing and advising, retraining and mediating in finding a job. In the year 2000, with the VET–1 Programme on Integrated Reform of the Secondary Vocational Education and Training, the project “Professional Orientation and Advising of the Youth” was launched. With the project, a coordinative body for school aid was established, in cooperation with the Employment Agency of the Republic of Macedonia (“Employment Office” at that time). In the year 2000, in 26 schools for secondary vocational education, centres for professional orientation and counselling were formed, for the purpose of which the school pedagogues have been trained for work in this field (two consultants: a pedagogue and a psychologist), and in 52 schools one consultant (either a pedagogue or a psychologist). 13 500 students in the elementary and the secondary schools have been encompassed with professional orientation. All the secondary schools (which were included in the project) have drafted and realised plans and programmes, as well as curricula for the work of the consultant for professional orientation and advising. In 50% of the schools, the students and the parents have been informed about the curriculum of the educational profiles and teaching subjects, with the possibilities of horizontal and vertical mobility. In 73% of the schools that are encompassed with the reform on secondary vocational education, workshops have been organised with the students and the teachers, on the techniques of learning as well as on elaborating the SWOT-analysis. In 15% of the schools testing of students was carried out, with regard to their general and specific capabilities. The monitoring of the development and the improvement of students was carried out in 35% of the schools, through keeping a school dossier. In these schools the students were interactively writing a CV (Curriculum Vitae). In 2003, with support provided within the frames of CARDS Project – A Programme on Secondary Education and Training – VET 2, practical tools for accomplishment of the professional orientation have been devised by the Bureau of Education Development and the State Employment Office:   a model on professional advising and employment mediation;   VET Guidebook for vocational teachers, on professional orientation and youth advising;   A Guidebook on professional orientation and vocational advising, and   Strategic development plan for career advising and employment mediation. In eight centres for secondary vocational education in the Republic of Macedonia, activities which stem from the Handbook on Career Advising are already realised. 
Since 2004, with professional and financial support of USAID, in 51 secondary vocational schools the project on Secondary Education Activities has been realised, one of the components of which is the development of the students’ career. In these secondary schools centres for career development are planned to be formed. The training of the teaching staff for organization and work of seven virtual and forty-four real companies is in progress. This should result in improvement of the measures for integration of the young in the labour market (self-employment, opening small- and medium-sized businesses, as well as integration in the companies). The experiences gained from the project will initiate legal formalizing of the duty of the pedagogy and psychology offices in schools to perform activities of professional orientation. A permanent and sustainable system of professional orientation on school level is expected to be provided through the centres of career development. The Project of the German Association for International Development – GTZ in the year 2000, included activities for professional orientation and technical support in the three-year secondary schools.  The project PRISMA of the Ministry of Labour of The USA gives its own contribution (1999-2004), where the professional orientation is treated in the component of competitiveness of the enterprises and training. Within the frames of the USAID–SEA project, forming of real companies in all the secondary schools is expected. Through the project ECONET, financed by KulturKontakt, virtual companies are already formed in several secondary schools of economics. Through these virtual and real companies it is expected that an entrepreneurial spirit will be built in the young people and they are going to be accustomed to and will prepare conditions for self-employment. These activities represent continuation of the Junior Achievement Programme which is funded by the Open Society Institute Foundation in Macedonia, within the frames of the elementary schools. In direction of following the needs of the labour market and adjustment of the education to it, the Macedonian National Observatory, which is financially and professionally supported by the European Training Foundation, plays a very important role. A “Guidebook on Professional Orientation” is in process, the effect of which will be related to the services on professional orientation in the education of the Republic of Macedonia. The secondary schools in the Republic of Macedonia are more and more included in the professional orientation of the young people, through organising various manifestations like secondary schools fair, festivals of lifelong learning, campaigns for enrolment in institutions of higher education, and the like. The enhancement and improvement of the cooperation between the educational sector and the employment sector is in process, with the aim of establishing a close partnership and accomplishment of efficient mechanisms of professional orientation of the young, on the basis of enforced legislation through which the rights and the duties of the interested parties will be standardised. The activities for career development of the students are part of the National Action Plan on Employment for the year 2004-2005, and at the same time of the Draft National Program on Education in the Republic of Macedonia 2005-2015. With this Programme, a transformation of the educational system is expected, in direction of its flexibility for the purpose of effective fulfilment of the needs of the labour market. 
10. Please provide information on the transition from school to work and the role of the social partners and enterprises. 
The Employment Agency of the Republic of Macedonia is able at any moment to provide data on the number of the unemployed, according to the qualification and age structure. The number of graduated secondary school students who are immediately employed, is very low. The transition of the secondary school students from school to work is done through the Employment Agency, which represents a network of thirty local employment centres, where the so-called Job Clubs exist. These clubs offer advising on employment according to the profession, and also conduct surveys on the competences and the interests, as well as on professional informing and advising, retraining and employment mediation.  In terms of market economy in the Republic of Macedonia, a greater necessity arises for information and advisory assistance for the students of secondary education, especially in the secondary vocational education for professional orientation and career development. The services regarding these needs are provided via appropriate offices in the employment agencies, in several elementary schools via the professional associates, and in the secondary schools those activities are realised through projects within the reform process. (PHARE – VET 1-1998-2000, VET2 2002-2004 and CRDS program VET3 – 2004-2005). With the PHARE – VET1 project, eight pilot centres were formed, engaged in activities directed towards career advising and orienting. This project did not fully yield the expected results in the sense of transition from school to work, because in the last decade several larger enterprises in the Republic of Macedonia collapsed, which is mainly due to the new change in the management of the enterprises (transition from public into private ownership), and also because of the slow development of the small and medium enterprises. Consequently, the planned number of teaching hours for the practical instruction was not realised on satisfactory level, and it gained only a formal character. On the other hand, the employers were insufficiently involved in the development and profiling of the workforce that will correspond to the current needs of the labour market. The role of the social partners as: the Trade Union, the Chamber of Commerce, the Craftsmen Association, the line ministries, the employment agencies, the representatives of the institutions of secondary and higher education, is negligible with regard to employment, i.e. the involvement of the young people in the labour market. In the last years, some enterprises have initiated activities for collaboration with the institutions of higher education for the selection of workforce, as for example: the cement factory USJE - Skopje in cooperation with the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, or the Faculty of Economics with the Commercial Bank. In 1996, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia together with the Sindicate and the Chamber of Commerce signed an Agreement for forming an Economic and Social Council, which represents a first endeavour for institutionalising the social dialogue. The Council, which has a counselling and advisory function, promotes the social dialogue between the negotiators in the sphere of the economic and social issues that are of the country’s interest, however, no visible effects have been achieved. The Trade Union Association of Macedonia, as a confirmed social partner in 1990, in partnership with the Government and the Board of Employers of the Chamber of Commerce, has signed a General Collective Agreement on national level, which at present undergoes appropriate alterations and adaptations. The Ministry of Education and Science has prepared a Draft-Law on Secondary Vocational Education, which is supposed to be adopted in the course of the year 2005. With this law, the organising, the structure and the management of the system of secondary education and training will be regulated, as well as of the post-secondary education, based on the collaboration of the state administrative bodies with the social partners. The law also anticipates the establishment of a National Council for Vocational Education and Training, which will propose a list of occupations for vocational education to the Ministry of Education and Science and will propose state qualifications and standards and vocations. In cooperation with the municipalities it will also submit proposal for development of the network of the vocational education and training. The post-secondary education and training is also one of the objectives of this law. It also anticipates the formation of Vocational Education and Training Centre, which, inter alia, will prepare and propose a list of vocations for vocational education and training to the Council, as well as state qualifications and standards. It will also prepare and propose teaching curricula and syllabi and will devote special attention to the career development of teachers and students. The Centre will give opinion on the fulfilment of the conditions of the institutions which apply for verification of the vocational education and training, will survey the needs of the labour market on national level, and at the same time will coordinate the research studies and the professional services that are provided for development of the vocational education and training. This Centre will strengthen the relations between the secondary education and training with the elementary and with the higher education and will at the same time develop the international cooperation. The Ministry of Education and Science has prepared a Draft-National Programme on Education Development in the Republic of Macedonia 2005-2015, which is expected to be adopted in the first half of the year 2005, whereby, besides the above mentioned measures and activities, the following is anticipated: increasing and maintenance of the working competence of the young and the adults and establishment of a systemic link with the labour market, as well as establishment of more efficient dialogue among the social partners. 
11. Young persons leaving education and/or training without formally recognised qualifications: what are their numbers and percentages? What are the second chance measures undertaken to provide alternative routes to achieving qualifications? 
The analyses of data of the State Statistics Office that are related to the leaving of education in different phases and at different levels, shows the following:   The yearly drop out rate  of students in the elementary education is 1.42%;   The yearly school leaving in the elementary education is 0.29%;   The percentage of the children who completed elementary education and enrolled in secondary education is 83.35%;   The largest drop out rate of students happens at the transition from elementary to secondary education and is 16.65%;   The yearly drop out rate of students in the secondary education is 2.84%;   The yearly drop out rate in the secondary education is 0.88%   The slightest drop out rate of students in the course of the education is present among the Macedonian population and the largest, among the Roma population. The National Programme on the development of the education in the Republic of Macedonia 2005 – 2015 (the debate on the draft-document is in its final phase), perceives the necessity of extending the efficiency and the quality of the educational institutions and the necessity of finding the mechanisms for detecting the children who are out of the institutions of the system, with the aim of their including or their returning in the educational system. On the agenda of decreasing the percentage of students who leaving their education, two objectives are determined:   upgrading the educational level of the youngsters and the adults who are out of the educational system and reinforcement of their vocational and social competences, and   eliminating the possibility of creating new generations with incomplete education. In order to accomplish the first objective, the Republic of Macedonia will carry out activities that are directed towards: rising the youngsters’ and the adults’ awareness of the importance of education; active inclusion of the formal and the informal sector in  the actions for raising the educational level and the competence of the population; providing financial subsidies for the persons who are going to be included in the actions; activating of the existent and finding the alternative forms for financing programs, the objective of which will be education and training of the unemployed population. The second objective implies undertaking measures for eliminating the reasons that make the education inaccessible or cause the pupils and students leave it. The total decrease in numbers of students in the elementary and secondary education is 18.32%, which means that the number of persons who are on a low educational level is increasing every year. The upward mobility of students in the elementary and in the secondary education on a generation level is worse. For example, from a generation that has enrolled in elementary education in the school year 1994/95 (with 34,935 students), only 89% of the students completed their primary education in the school year 2001/02. From a generation that enrolled in a secondary education in the school year 1998/99 (with 26,244 students), 21,241 students have regularly completed their secondary education, which represents 80.93% of the total number. With 3,043 students per 100,000 citizens, the Republic of Macedonia is among the countries with lowest number of students in percents. The Ministry of Education and Science will undertake measures for enlarging the extent in the higher education and for reaching the number of 3,500 students per 100,000 citizens, by which the country would come closer to the minimal number in the developed countries. In this direction, efforts will be made to raise the attractiveness and the efficiency of the higher education; the network of the educational institutions will be improved; the private initiative in the higher education will be encouraged; the international cooperation will be stimulated, as well as the mobility of the students and teachers on the national and international level; and the legislation will be modernized. 
B. Administration of the systems 
1. Status of educational institutions: Describe the procedures for setting up educational institutions. Is there an authority which monitors the setting up and functioning of educational institutions? Are there different sorts of status for educational institutions (e.g. private, public, private subject to control, etc.)? 
To date the Government of the Republic of Macedonia has been the establisher of the Elementary Schools. With the passing of the Law on Amending and Appending the Law on Primary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 63/04), the establisher of the elementary schools will be the municipality. The Decision on establishment of the elementary schools is brought by the Municipality Council with previous opinion of the Government. In order to establish an elementary school certain conditions should previously be fulfilled, that are determined with the Article 16 of the Law on Primary Education. These conditions are the following: number of students and teachers, premises, equipment, teaching resources and financial resources. The Ministry of Education and Science verifies whether these conditions are fulfilled, and if they are, brings decision for verification. Then, the elementary school is registered in the Register of Elementary Schools which is kept by the municipality in the region that the school belongs to, as well as in the Central Register that is kept by the Ministry of Education and Science. In accordance with the Law on Amending and Appending the Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 67/04), and in context of the decentralization of the Government, a secondary school can be: a.  Municipal secondary school which the Municipal Council establishes with Decision upon previous opinion of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia; b.  Secondary school of the City of Skopje that is established by the Council of the City of Skopje with Decision, upon proposal of the Municipal Council and on previous opinion of the Government; c.  State secondary school which is established by the Government, for certain categories of students in which the State is interested; d.  Private secondary school which is established by domestic or foreign legal or natural persons, for which consent should be granted by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. For establishment of a secondary school several conditions should be fulfilled, cited with the Article 11 of the Law on Secondary Education: financial resources should be provided, teaching curricula and syllabi should be brought, and certain equipment should be possessed, as well as premises, qualified teaching staff, and students. All these requirements should be examined by a special commission. The Ministry of Education and Science verifies the fulfilment of the conditions and brings a Decision for verification and start of the activity of the school. The secondary school is registered in the Register on Secondary Schools kept by the Municipality for the region which the school is situated in, and in the Central Register, kept by the Ministry of Education and Science. Authorised the supervision of the work of the elementary and the secondary schools is carried out by the Ministry of Education and Science, which supervises the legality of the schools’ activity, the Education Development Bureau, charged with the professional supervision, and the State Education Inspectorate charged with the inspection supervision. In Accordance with the Law on Higher Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 64/00 and No. 49/03), the higher education is realised in the state or private institutions of higher education. The state institution of higher education is established by the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia with a law, and a private institution can be established by domestic or foreign legal or natural persons, with consent given by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. In accordance with the Law on Higher Education (Article 36), a university can be established if it has five accredited higher education institutions (faculties or higher vocational schools) out of which at least three are faculties. A Faculty can be established if in accordance with the Article 35 of the Law on Higher Education the following conditions are fulfilled: defined field of studies, appropriate equipment and premises; sustainable level of financing, and available teaching, research and associate staff. In order to establish a private institution of higher education, except for the conditions that are determined with the Articles 35 and 36 of the Law on Higher Education, the establisher should also submit a financial guarantee for refunding the financial means that the students have paid, in case the institution stops working. The conditions for establishment are more closely defined with the Rulebook on Norms and Standards on Establishment of Institutions of Higher Education and on Performing the Higher Education Activity (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 33/03), which on proposal of the University Conference is brought by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. The establishing procedure starts with a project on establishment of an institution of higher education, which is prepared by the establisher, who submits it to the Accreditation Board in order to obtain Decision for Accreditation. The Government appoints a main commission which is charged with the preparations; thereafter the establisher submits an application to the Ministry of Education and Science to inspect the fulfilment of the conditions and to bring a Decision for commencing work. The institution is afterwards registered in the Register of institutions of higher education, followed by constituting the bodies and registering in the Court Register, thus acquiring legal entity. The supervision of the legality of the work of the higher education institution is carried out by the Ministry of Education and Science, while the Evaluation Agency does the external assessment of the quality of the institution of higher education and its work. 
2. General mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation of the educational system: Are there mechanisms envisaged or in the process of implementation for monitoring and evaluating educational establishments? What data do they examine? To what extent are they independent of Government ministries?  
In the pre-university education there are three basic mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation of the educational system. The State Educational Inspectorate is a body of the Ministry of Education and Science, which is responsible for monitoring of the execution of the laws and the other regulations and acts on the work of the educational institutions starting with the pre-school education, up to the higher education. In accordance with the Law on State Education Inspectorate, the inspection monitoring refers to:   The fulfilment of the legal provisions for performing the activity relating the teaching staff, the premises and the equipping;   The implementation of the approved teaching curricula and syllabi;   The realisation of the annual school programs concerning the type and the scope of the activities;   The enrolment policy and the students’ regularity;   Implementing approved textbooks and handbooks in the instruction;   Pedagogy records and documentation;   Coordinating the students’ assessment and progress with the legal acts and by-laws;   The procedures for bringing teaching curricula in the higher education;   The election of the teaching staff in the higher education. On every inspection conducted, the inspectorate prepares a report, and if needed, proposes measures for surpassing the perceived legal inconsistencies. The proposed measures by the Education Inspection are executive. With the National Program on Education Development in the Republic of Macedonia 2005-2015 and the amending in the Law on Education Inspection (in process of preparing), alterations of the competences of the State Education Inspection are planned, which will also include a quality control in the education through integral evaluation of the schools. The Expert Supervision is done by the Bureau for Development of Education– a specialised institution of the Ministry of Education and Science. Through visits to classes, analyses of the documentation and interviews, it supervises the qualitative aspects of the school activities as a whole, and separately of the teachers. For each conducted inspection a report is prepared and recommendations for improvement of the activities are given. Occasionally, on the basis of the conducted inspections and analyses, reports on the work quality are given on a certain level of education, in particular educational area, etc., which are submitted to the Ministry of Education and Science. Then they are utilized in creating the educational policy and in the planning of the expert support of the school and the teachers. The recommendations given by the expert supervision performed by the Bureau for Development of Educatio are of advisory nature. The National assessments and the other external evaluations of the students’ achievements are conducted by the Assessment Department of the Bureau for Development of Education. A system of national assessments, standards and examinations is in a phase of establishment, which will provide objective data on the students’ achievements at the end of separate educational cycles, as part of the system of quality control. A Conception on school-leaving examination and final examination (Matura) in secondary education is adopted, and in a phase of development are the State Examination Centre which will conduct the assessments and the examinations. Until the present day national assessing is done at the end of the instruction in the mother tongue, mathematics and civics education, and school-leaving examination is conducted in the art education. The level of achievements of students and the factors that influence the achievements are measured with recognition international instruments.  Republic of Macedonia participates in TIMSS, PIRLS and PISA+. Reports have been prepared on the achievements’ results, which have been submitted to the creators of the educational policy, to the schools and the broader public. Except for the stated facts, the Bureau for Development of Education occasionally evaluates the quality of the teaching curricula and syllabi and their realisation through contents analysis and gathering opinions from the realizers. The knowledge is utilized in altering the teaching curricula and in planning the vocational specialization. The State Educational Inspectorate and the Bureau for Development of Education are semi-independent bodies within the framework of the Ministry of Education and Science. The Government, on proposal made by the Ministry, appoints the heads of these bodies. The work program of these bodies is approved by the Ministry of Education and Science, and they are independent concerning the methodology of work and presenting the findings gathered from the supervision and from the assessment. In accordance with the Law on Higher Education of the year 2003, the providing of quality supervision in the higher education is under competence of the Evaluation Agency. The Agency has been constituted by the Accrediting Board. The members of the Evaluation Agency of the Higher Education are independent in their work and can not be revoked before the expiration of their mandate. The evaluation is performed through evaluation methods as external evaluation, self-evaluation, as well as through the system of quality assessment of the academic staff. The external evaluation and the collective quality assessment of the academic staff are performed by the Evaluation Agency, and the self- evaluation is done by the institutions of higher education through their evaluation commissions. The evaluation commissions of the institutions of higher education evaluate the following areas and activities:  study programs;   teaching and scientific or scholarly staff and associates;   teaching and educational activity;   premises and material resources;  external cooperation;  research;  finance activity On the basis of the reports given by the evaluation commissions of the institutions of higher education, and on the basis of the visits, and the dialogue with the evaluated persons, the Evaluation Agency verifies the contents of the reports. The evaluation Agency prepares a Report on the results from the evaluation and submits it to the Ministry of Education and Science, to the Government and to the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, as well as to the Accrediting Board. Every five years this agency evaluates the condition and the activity of the institutions of higher education and of the academic staff, on the basis of which it proposes to the Accrediting Board to continue or to take away the accreditation to/from the institutions of higher education. With the incoming amending of the Law on Higher Education, and having in mind the European experiences, merging of the Accrediting Board and the Evaluation Agency in one body is envisaged, which will be responsible both for evaluation and accreditation of the institutions of higher education.
3. Statistical data collection and processing facilities: Describe the facilities and the data collected. Describe the various levels at which such data is collected and processed. Are there statistics on the destination of school leavers, VET and higher education graduates? Are there statistics on the concrete benchmarks for the improvement of education and training systems (early school leavers, number of graduates and gender balance in maths, science and technology, number completing upper secondary level education, basic skills, participation in continuing education and VET)? 
A competent institution for collecting, processing and dissemination of the statistical data of the education of the Republic of Macedonia is the State Statistical Office. The statistic data are collected through regular annual statistical researches for the elementary, the secondary and the higher education. Here the regular elementary schools, the specialised and the adult schools are included, and in the secondary education regular secondary and specialised schools are included. In the sphere of higher education, students that are enrolled in the undergraduate studies, graduate students, Masters of Arts and Sciences, specialists, Doctors of Philosophy and Doctors of Science, and the structure of the teaching personnel of the institutions of higher education are included. For the elementary and the secondary education the researches are performed through regional units on a level of inhabited places, as for the higher education they are performed directly by reporting units-colleges and rectors’ offices. The questionnaires are submitted twice a year to the reporting units (at the beginning and at the end of the year). The collected data are electronically processed, with checking of the same through logical control. The researches’ results are published in the publications and in the announcements and refer to an annual level. The filling in of the applications that are submitted by the international institutions (EUROSTAT, UNESCO etc.) is done in accordance with the ISCED classification, which enables international comparison of data. The Ministry of Education and Science also collects and processes data for the elementary and the secondary education, but for its own internal needs. Each year, before the start of the new school year, the Ministry of Education and Science, submits to all the elementary schools in the Republic of Macedonia a form “Basic Data on the Elementary Education Activity in the School Year 2003/2004”. (for regular elementary education, music and ballet education, education for children with special needs, as well as for elementary adult education (students-candidates at the age above fifteen)  With this form all the relevant data of the elementary schools are required, among which:   The number of regional schools, the language of instruction, the signature of the person who fills in the data, the signature of the principal, the signature of the regional representative of the Ministry of Education and Science, who is in charge of inspection of the data in the form;   The number of students that are included in organised meals (snacks and hot meals), type of kitchen (central or distributive);   Data on the size of the school area, kind of heating, work in shifts (for the central and for the regional elementary schools);   Data on the number of pupils and the number of classes for children with development impediments, by language of instruction;  The number of candidates and the number of classes for additional completion of the elementary education of the adults within the frameworks of the elementary school;   Data on the full-time and the part-time employees, level of education, work post, weekly number of teaching and working hours, professional experience, pedagogic titles and note. On the basis of the data on the number of the employees in accordance with the qualification structure and the teaching hours, in accordance with the Ministry’s of Education and Science Criteria on Distribution of the Resources Intended for Wages, which are Provided by the Republic Budget for the Elementary Education Activity, the number of the conditionally unqualified employees is established with separate Calculation; On the basis of the data on the conditionally unqualified employees, each month the elementary schools submit calculation for the net and gross wages per employee, expenditures needed for food and transport to and from the workplace, in an electronic form, as well as in filled in form, prescribed by the Ministry of Finance; The change in the number of the employees and in the qualification structure in the course of the year, because of various reasons (retiring, sick-leave, unpaid leave and the like) in the Sector of the elementary education, is monthly updated, for the purpose of accurate determining the amount needed for expenditures on wages and allowances; The data on the number of classes per elementary school, in accordance with the Criteria on Allocating the Funds for Material Expenditures and the approved funds for the activity of the elementary education with the annual budget, are used for establishing the funds needed for separate kinds of material expenditures per year and per month. All the previously stated data are computer processed (the integral text on the criteria is submitted in the answer of the question 18_I_A_6.  Every year, before the start of the new school year, the Ministry of Education and Science submits the form “Elementary Data on the Activity of the State Secondary Schools” to all the public secondary schools in the Republic of Macedonia. With the form the following data are required: 1.  Type of education (high school, vocational - in vocations and educational profiles); 2.

Every change in the number of the employees and the qualification structure in the course of the year, because of various reasons (retiring, sick-leave, unpaid leaves and the like), is updated in the Sector of Secondary Education, for the purpose of accurate establishing of the needed amount for wages and allowances. In the State Statistical Office and in the Ministry of Education and Science, there are no records with the name and the surname of students who leave the education, of students who graduate secondary education, and no records about the ones enlisted in the Employment Bureau, or who have continued their education. With an aim the new legal regulations for the higher education to enable compatibility with the European norms and standards and its permanent orientation based on the principle of the Bologna Declaration, one of the most important segments is collecting of the statistical data, which are collected and processed annually by the Ministry of Education and Science, the universities and the State Statistical Office. The starting elements in collecting the statistical data for processing are the following:   the teaching curricula and syllabi of the institutions of higher education;   the number of the study groups, departments and modules;   the number of the first time and more than once enrolled students in the public and in the private quota;   the qualification structure of the employees;   the number of graduate students;   net utilizable area of the buildings of the institutions of higher education; After all these elements are collected, it is approached towards data processing, which will be utilized in creating the enrolment policy for the next school year, as well as in the financing, and for other needs that will be declared in the course of the year. 
C. Infrastructure 

1. Criteria for setting up infrastructure: Coverage of national territory: What variables are taken into account for setting up educational infrastructure (population density, geographical criteria etc.)? According to what criteria is infrastructure set up for the education of children of national minorities? 
The following are the criteria for establishing educational infrastructure in the elementary education:   Population density. In accordance with Article 16 of the Law on Primary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 52/02 – consolidated text, 40/03, 42/03 and 63/04), elementary school can be established with at least sixteen classes, with number of pupils from twenty-five to thirty-four in a class (in accordance with Article 36 of the same Law);   Providing correspondent teaching staff, and in accordance with Article 70 of the Law on Primary Education, the professional employees who work with students belonging to minority communities for the students of the languages of the communities besides the Macedonian, should know the language and the alphabet of the language of instruction;   Providing appropriate school premises, equipment and teaching means in accordance with the pedagogical standards of the language of the members of the communities (Article 83 of the Law on Primary Education);    Providing necessary funds. In accordance with Article 118 and 119 of the same Law  the necessary funds are provided by the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, by projects approved by the Minister of Education and Science, by the local self-government unit and other sources like legacies, presents, testaments and others, and will be utilized restrictively; According to the population density, and in accordance with Articles 16, 20 and 36 of the Law on Primary Education – elementary school can be formed even with a lower number of students, but not less than ten students (Article 36). In accordance with the building norms and standards, reconstruction and adaptation of the school buildings   the minimal surface of the building should be 7 mper student;   the surface of the school complex should be 22 mper student;   the minimal wideness of the corridors should be 1.80 m, and for every 100 students it is extended per coefficient of 0.70m up to 500 students;   The number of lavatories should be two lavatories per classroom, one women’s and one men’s toilet.  (The norms are brought by the Assembly of the Republic Self-Management Interest Community for the Elementary Education, at the session of 10.04.1986, with the Decision No. 18-156/8, and these norms apply for the school buildings of the secondary education as well). In accordance with the same norms, the school building is defined as a basis of the spatial and the material working conditions of the school. The building should be functional, economic, with its spatial form it should enable contemporary educative work and should create a comfortable feeling among the students. The classrooms should be provided with sufficient natural light and air; they should protect the health and improve the working ability of the students. Particular attention should be paid to:   the location of the school building, which is established with the development plan of the school network, as a consistent part of the urban planning;   site of the location (not to be in an industrial zone, to give spatial opportunities for possible extension, and to be optimally  far from the streets and the other sources of noise and pollution);   number of floors in the building (ground floor plus two floors utmost);  orientation towards providing appropriate insulation and suitable conditions for accomplishment of the teaching activity and   The needed rooms with dimensions correspondent to the needs and the capacity. On preparing the investment and technical documentation, and on building schools in seismic areas, seismic structural safety of the building should be provided. The seismic intensity for a certain location is taken according to the map of seismic zoning of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 2/79). Concerning the teaching staff, in accordance with Article 70 of the Law on Primary Education, if cannot be provided  a professional associate who knows the language of the correspondent community for teaching the members of the communities, temporarily, the instruction can be held by a professional associate who doesn’t know the language of the correspondent community. The elementary school is obliged to organize testing of the language knowledge of the professional associates. According to the teaching curriculum, in schools in which the instruction is held in other language, the Macedonian is also studied, (in accordance with Article 48, Item 4 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia). Besides, for these variables, the members of the languages of the communities who are taught in a language other than the language of their community, have the right to additional and facultative instruction for learning the language of the community (established with the Decision of the Minister of Education and Science). In accordance with the Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 52/02 – consolidated text, 40/03, 42/03 and 67/04), the criteria for establishing secondary school are the following:   certain types of cadres to be needed by the state;   to ensure necessary means for work;   to bring curricula and syllabi for educational work and   To provide equipment, space, appropriate teaching staff in all the subjects and sufficient number of pupils in accordance with the pedagogy standards and norms. These conditions also count on establishing municipal schools as well as schools of the City of Skopje and private schools. The educational infrastructure for children and youngsters – members of the different communities, is established in accordance with the criteria: population density, geographic distance of the infrastructural educational objects from the inhabited places (where the members of the communities live), providing of cadres, spatial planning of the educational buildings, providing equipment and correspondent teaching means, in accordance with the pedagogy standards and funds.  With Article 35 and 36 of the Law on Higher Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 64/2000 and 49/2003), the general conditions (criteria) for establishing the educational infrastructure in the higher education are set up, in which, for the establishment of a university, i.e. a college the following is needed:   the university/college  should within its frames have five accredited faculties and polytechnics , of which at least three are faculties;   to have established study field with appropriately elaborated study programs;   Appropriate rooms and equipment to be provided for the accomplishment of the higher education and the research activity.   Appropriate number of persons to be provided, who fulfil the conditions that are set up for the election in teaching and academic titles, teaching and associate titles, i.e. in order to start working, an institution of higher education should have elected and employed three teachers and three associates for the first and the second study year, respectively for every study year.    In order to establish a private institution of higher education, the establisher should provide a quality financial guarantee with a financial plan in cycles per four years. In accordance with the spatial and the equipment norms of the institution of higher education, the norms for the needed space are:   Buildings with minimum 5mgross space per student, i.e. 3 mfor conducting of instruction per student in a shift;   An amphitheatre, i.e. several amphitheatres which could accept ¼ of the total number of enrolled students in one shift for instructions;   Lecture rooms with total number of seats which is equal to the ½ of the total number of students enrolled in one shift;   At least one computer room with capacity of 20 computer working places, connected to Internet;   Laboratories for holding practical instruction with capacities from 10% to 20% of the total number of enrolled students. In accordance with the number of needed teachers for the institutions of higher education, the number of teachers in the institution of higher education is established in dependence of the number of teaching hours per teacher in one study year, and particularly:   Up to 240 teaching hours a year for a teacher in an institution of higher education, which represents instruction in equivalent teaching subject with number of 8 teaching hours per week;   Up to 300 teaching hours a year for a teacher in the polytechnics, which represents instruction of the equivalent teaching subject with number of up to 10 teaching hours a week;   Up to 300 teaching hours a year per teacher for the teaching subjects of Physical Culture, which represents instruction of the equivalent subject with number of teaching hours up to 10 hours a week. The necessary space for performing educational activity and the specificity of the laboratories for different fields is dependant on the study program and the teaching plans. The space should be appropriate for the performance of the higher educational activity, in accordance with the technical, building, hygienic and other standards established with law, i.e. with an Act based on the Law. With Article 95 of the Law on Higher Education, it is prescribed that for the purpose of expressing, nourishing and developing the own identity and the other particularities, the members of the communities have a right their instruction in the correspondent study programs to be held in the language of the community, different from the Macedonian, in the institutions of higher education, in accordance with this Law and the Statute of the institution of higher education. A legal provision is also built in, in which the orientation of the Framework Agreement is enlightened, according to which the financing on the side of the state will be provided for the higher education as well as for the language which is spoken  by at least 20% of the population in the Republic of Macedonia. Besides, in Article 95 of the Law on Higher Education, a possibility is given the instruction to be held in the languages of the members of other communities, who are not the majority in the Republic of Macedonia, in the state pedagogical institutions of higher education for education of elementary school teachers, as well as for the Didactics and Methodology of Teaching subjects for secondary school teachers. It is the state’s obligation to finance this type of instruction. Consequently, as criteria which are taken into consideration for establishment of the educational structure of the community members, except for the above mentioned general criteria, established with Article 35 and 36 of the Law on Higher Education, is also the need of providing conditions for accomplishing the constitutional and legal right the instruction at the institutions of higher education in correspondent study programs and matters to be conducted in the language of the communities, for the purpose of expressing, nourishing and developing their identity. In this sense, within the frames of the University of “Cyril and Methodius” in Skopje – at the Faculty of Philology, studies in Albanian language have been organized, at the Department of Albanian Language and Literature, as well as in Turkish, at the Department of Turkish Language and Literature. The same case is at the Faculty of Drama Arts and the Faculty of Physical Culture, where the instruction is held in the languages of the members of the communities, for separate study programs. In accordance with the Item 3 of Article 95 of the Law on Higher Education at the Faculty of Pedagogy “St. Clement of Ohrid” in Skopje, studies are also organized and the instruction for educators for pre-elementary education and for teachers in elementary education is held for the members of the Albanian and of the Turkish community. All the necessary parameters for accreditation of the institutions of higher education are prescribed with the Rulebook on Norms and Standards for Establishment of the Institutions of Higher Education that has been adopted in May 2003.  In the Republic of Macedonia three state universities have been established and still work, as well as one independent private faculty, which is not within the framework of any university. The criteria for establishment of the educational infrastructure for the children – members of the communities are regulated with international documents as well (which the Republic of Macedonia has prescribed and enforces). Among the more important are the following: the Documents on the Fundamental Human Rights, and especially the Right to Education in the Languages of the Minorities. Important documents on the basis of which the right to education in the mother tongue is drawn, are the following: The UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 26), International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Article 13), International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination   (Article 5); the UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education, The Convention on the Rights of the Child (Article 28 and 29, UNESCO), the  European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, The Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minoriti (Ordinance No. 4, The Council of Europe). 2. Criteria for the provision of equipment: Who takes decisions and according to what procedures concerning the purchase of equipment for schools and universities? Does equipment include: manuals, libraries, teaching equipment for instructors, computer and multimedia equipment? Give information for each type of equipment and each level of education. 
Out of the total funds of the Ministry of Education and Science that are anticipated with the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, the Ministry allocates funds for purchasing equipment for the needs of the elementary schools, the secondary public schools and the state universities. Depending on the type, the equipment has been classified in separate budget paragraphs, and particularly: - Stationery In this type of equipment the Registry Books for pedagogical records and documentation are included (a Class Record Book, Main Students’ Registry Book, Educational Group Work Book, School Work Book) and other office supplies needed for functioning of the schools and the universities. The Books for Keeping Pedagogical Records and Documentation for the elementary and the secondary public schools are elaborated in accordance with a Rulebook on Pedagogy Records and Documentation and the Mode of Recordkeeping, brought by the Ministry of Education and Science (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 56/02). On the basis of the number of enrolled students and formed classes, the Ministry of Education and Science, through the Central Commission of Public Procurements, makes procurement of this type of equipment for all the schools in the Republic of Macedonia. The procurement is done in accordance with the Law on Public Procurement (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 19/04). For the other types of stationery (paper, forms, fascicles, registers, toner cartridges, etc.), the Ministry of Education and Science, on the basis of the criterion ‘number of students’ and ‘number of classes’, allocates funds for the schools and the universities, and they perform the procedure for procurement of these types of stationery, in accordance with the Law on Public Procurement. - Books and Textbooks The funds that are envisaged for purchase of books and textbooks are moderate, and by them elementary and secondary school students are aided, who belong to the category of utterly socially disadvantaged persons, and parentless students (children of the defenders in war). In the higher education, the funds envisaged for this type of supplies are utilized on the basis of yearly program for publishing books and textbooks. The programme is brought by the Minister of Education and Science, on previously established priorities by the Teachers’ Councils of the institutions of higher education. The funds for this type of supplies are transferred by the Ministry to the universities, which in accordance with the Law on Public Procurement implement the procurement procedure. Teaching and educational aids With this type of equipment (visual aids in the offices of history, biology, geography, physics, chemistry etc.), for which the Ministry allocates funds for the elementary and the secondary education, the quality of presenting the teaching material by the teacher/professor is improved. The allocated funds are transferred to the schools on the basis of the criterion ‘number of classes’. The procedure for equipment procurement is performed by the schools in accordance with the Law on Public Procurement. Information Technology Equipment The Budget funds for procurement of the information technology equipment are very moderate. For this reason the Ministry doesn’t draw an annual programme for equipping information technology studies, but transfers the allocated funds to the elementary and secondary schools. The procedure for procurement of the equipment is performed by the schools in accordance with the Law on Public Procurement. For the higher education, Budget funds for this type of equipment are not anticipated. - School furniture On the basis of the requests and needs of the schools, the Sectors of the Elementary and the Secondary Education prepare annual programs for purchase of school furniture (school tables, school chairs, blackboards, desks etc.). The programs are prepared on the basis of the criteria ‘newly – formed classes’ and ‘old damaged furniture’. The school equipment is produced in accordance with established norms and standards. The Ministry, through a Central Commission does the purchasing and distribution of this kind of equipment for the schools that are included with the program. The procurement is done in accordance with the Law on Public Procurement. For the higher education, the budget funds for this type of equipment are not allocated. Regular maintenance of the school buildings and capital investments The funds for regular maintenance of the school buildings and capital investments are provided by the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. On the basis of the requests made by the schools and the inspection done by the Ministry’s experts, the Minister brings Programs for regular and investment maintenance of the buildings of the elementary and the secondary education. The public procurement is performed by the Central Commission of Public Procurements of the Ministry, in accordance with the Law on Public Procurement. The Budget of the Republic of Macedonia doesn’t allocate funds for regular maintenance and capital investments of the buildings of higher education. With the Law Amending the Law on Primary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 63/04) and the Law on Amending and Appending the Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 67/204), the ownership of the school buildings of the elementary and the secondary education will be conveyed to the municipalities. The regular maintenance of the school buildings also will be under the jurisdiction of the local government. The allocation of the Budget funds for capital investments (building new schools, extension, reconstruction and adaptation of the existent buildings) will stay under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education and Science. The universities of the Republic of Macedonia comprise all the faculties, polytechnics and research and academic institutions. Taking into consideration the fact that the universities are autonomous and independently decide around all the crucial questions of improvements, they are also independent concerning this question. At their Teachers’ Academic Councils the institutions of higher education establish the priorities for the necessary equipment which is needed for the accomplishment of the teaching activity. For procurement of the equipment they use their own funds from own resources, and if they are not sufficient for procurement of the equipment - from the Ministry. If the Budget funds are used through the Ministry of Education and Science, the requests are submitted to the Ministry, where it establishes priorities for all the institutions of higher education, through the Programme that is brought by the Minister. No matter on where the funds are provided from, the institutions of higher education are obliged to utilize the same in accordance with the Law on Public Procurement. In accordance with the provisions of that Law, the same are obliged to bring a plan for the needs of equipment procurement in the course of the year and to determine the realization dynamics of the procurements as well as the procedure that will be implemented for the public procurements. Until the end of January of the current year the institution of higher education submits this Plan to the Bureau for Public Procurements of the Ministry of Finance, which checks whether it is in accordance with the provisions of the Law on Public Procurement. Each institution of higher education has a Commission for Public Procurements, which realizes the necessary public procurements. In accordance with the provisions of the Law on Public Procurement (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 19/04), the purchase of the equipment is realised through the following procedures: on public invitation, on restricted invitation, procedure of negotiation, competition for project elaboration, and restricted invitation for consultation services. For the purpose of respecting the legal provision, before implementing the procedure for public procurement with provided funds, the Commissions for Public Procurements are obliged to request a certificate for provided funds by the Bureau for Public Procurements at the Ministry of Finance, as well as consent to approach toward contracting a certain agreement for procurement of equipment, before they contract any agreement for public procurement. With this law, the possibility of implementing procedures without previously providing funds is eliminated. The Law on Public Procurement is implemented in all the cases when the institution of higher education has to purchase a greater quantity of textbooks, multimedia equipment, laboratory equipment and computing equipment. 
3. Give information and statistics on ICT use in education and training, including the number of pupils per computer and distance learning facilities, etc. 
According to the data of the State Statistics Office, at the end of the school year 2002/2003 the elementary education in the Republic of Macedonia was realised in 1020 buildings and had had 235.516 students. According to the data of the Ministry of Education and Science, the total number of computers in the elementary education is 4126, and the number of printers is 255. The number of students per computer is 57, and the number of students per printer is 920. According to the State Statistics Office, at the end of the school year 2002/2003 in the sphere of the secondary education in the Republic of Macedonia, 91 state schools were working with 92.678 students. According to the data of the Ministry of Education and Science, the total number of computers in the secondary education is 3689. The number of students per computer is 25.4 while every second school has an access to Internet.  The equipping of the elementary and the secondary schools with computing and communication equipment is mainly done through donations by the international organizations. The Government of the Peoples’ Republic of China has donated 3300 personal computers in the elementary schools and 2000 personal computers in the secondary schools. The Project E-School.mk, funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), has enabled the installation and the networking of the computers in the elementary and the secondary schools, which were donated by the Chinese Government, as well as providing of additional communication equipment. Through the PHARE/VET1-VET3 Project for the secondary vocational schools in the Republic of Macedonia, 299 personal computers were provided, as well as 17 laptops, 15 typographical stations, 47 laser printers, 18 scanners and 2 Xerox machines. Within the frameworks of the TEMPUS Project, modernisation of the computer laboratories for simultaneous interpreting has been done at the Faculty of Philology in Skopje. The Ministry of Education and Science in the scope of its financial potentials donates computing equipment for the elementary and secondary schools, as well as for the institutions of higher education. In the period from 2000 to 2004, the Ministry of Education and Science donated 100 printers and 200 personal computers. Of this equipment, 124 personal computers have been utilised for modernisation of the instruction in Physics, in 62 secondary schools, and for that purpose appropriate devices for digital measuring of physical dimensions and computer simulations of experiments were provided and purchased from Holland. In cooperation with the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics in Skopje, the Ministry of Education and Science provided teacher training for correct utilization of this equipment in the instruction. The Ministry of Education and Science also realised two projects for utilisation of the multimedia software in the instruction: Cyber Mathematics, for studying Mathematics in elementary schools and the English – Macedonian Digital Dictionary. In July 1999, in the Republic of Macedonia, the National Contact Centre (NCC) for open and long-distance learning has been formed as an independent unit, in accordance with the agreement done between the Government of the Republic of Macedonia represented by the Ministry of Education and Science and the European Training Foundation. The main office of NCC is at the Institute of Computer Science at the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics in Skopje, an all the information are available at: http://odoserver.pmf.ukim.edu.mk/. NCC is a national coordinator and co-operator for long-distance education of the Republic of Macedonia and participant in PHARE multi-national program for long-distance education. Some of the activities of NCC are the following:   Promotion and knowledge of the strategic importance of the open and long-distance education,   Organizing tuition for open and long-distance education methods;   Establishing contacts and study visits of the open and long-distance education centres in the European Union and in the PHARE countries;   Cooperation with and among open and long-distance education study centres;   Establishment of National Coordination Committee in the open and long-distance education;   Development and pilot application of open and long-distance education course. At the time being in the Republic of Macedonia the following electronic study systems have been established:   Electronic testing system (http://twins.pmf.ukim.edu.mk), realised in 2001 at the Computer Science Institute at the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics; on-line students’ testing is enabled;   Tuition realisation for the students of the Faculty of Philosophy (around 300), for an Introductory Course in Computer Science;   At the University of South-Eastern Europe, in Tetovo, part of the elective subjects are conducted by teachers from abroad, through video conferences and other types of open and long-distance learning;   On-line access to the library systems of the National University Library, the University Library in Bitola and also the libraries of the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics and the University of South-Eastern Europe in Tetovo. The Study Centres that implement e-learning and function on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia are: 1.  The Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Skopje, http://odl-skopje.etf.ukim.edu.mk. The Centre is established in 1999, and the equipment consists of web server and a multimedia classroom. It has been utilized by two thousand students. It enables long-distance learning of the faculty students and wider. A VIKTO network has been established with more than twenty elementary schools in the Republic of Macedonia, and through the Internet, school materials have been exchanged, that have been implemented in mutual projects. The elaborated system of long-distance learning include several modules: digital library, virtual board, chat module, virtual laboratory, and project control. Several web educative pages are also elaborated. In September 2004, video-conference equipment has been installed, which extends the opportunities for long-distance learning. 2.  At the Institute of Computer Science at the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics in Skopje, within the frameworks of the National Contact Centre, a software (Shell) has been elaborated, as well as three web-oriented courses, and an appropriate laboratory has been equipped for preparation of materials and conditions for open and long-distance learning. 3.  The Faculty of Pedagogy in Bitola, formed in July 1999, which has on its disposal a modern multimedia classroom. Several seminars have been organized in the field of long-distance learning, in cooperation with the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Skopje, as well as with the National Contact Centre. 4.  The University of South-Eastern Europe, Tetovo, with instruction in their study programmes for full-time and part-time students at the Faculty of Communication Sciences and Technologies, the Computer College and the Certificate Programmes. 
There is one institution of higher education in the Republic of Macedonia, which offers its postgraduate study programs exclusively with the methods of long-distance learning: Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, University of Pittsburgh, USA. Some private initiatives for long-distance learning have also been realized: The MATEIS System (Mathematical Electronic Interactive System, education system for learning mathematics and informatics) (http://www.mateis.edu.mk) is the first system installed in 1997. It is intended for students of elementary and secondary education for learning mathematics and informatics. The UTOS System - (web-based distance education system for learning, testing and assessment) (http://www.utos.edu.mk) represents a system for distance learning, testing and assessing. Here the teachers create their own bases of questions, through these bases the students prepare for the examinations. This system is at the time being utilized by several teachers in the secondary and higher education, and is attended by several hundreds of students. In the Republic of Macedonia there is a long-years’ experience of participation in the educative programs in the Macedonian Radio and Television. The Ministry of Education and Science, in collaboration with these institutions will cooperate in further improvement of the quality of this type of education, having in mind above all its efficiency and its acceptability from the economy point of view. 
4. Provision of accommodation for students/trainees not living at home: What facilities exist? What services do they provide? Are developments in such facilities envisaged? If so, what developments? 
In the elementary education in the Republic of Macedonia, a boarding-school accommodation is provided as well as accommodation in homes with families for the students from the rural areas, where elementary school doesn’t exist, or there isn’t a traffic infrastructure for transport to the nearest elementary school. In sixteen boarding-schools that work within the frameworks of the elementary schools 237 students are included, and in a home-family, 81 students. During their stay in the boarding-school 42 educators with higher, high and secondary education take care of them. Twenty-six cooks are engaged for preparing hot and cold meals, and sixteen workers are engaged for maintenance of the hygiene of the buildings. The Ministry of Education and Science provides food and accommodation, as well as transport during the weekends and holidays for the both categories of students. The accommodation price per student is amounting to of € 50, and the funds are allocated to the elementary schools on the basis of the submitted request and invoice by the schools. For the students of the elementary education who are accommodated in the boarding schools for secondary education, the elementary education participates in the amount of the economy price established for accommodation and meals of the students of secondary education, i.e. in the amount of € 135 per student.                         The buildings in which the students are accommodated are of solid construction, in relatively good condition. In the elementary education there is tendency towards lowering the number of students who are accommodated in the boarding schools, as a result of their parents’ wish during their education the children to stay home, and a transport to be organized for the school attendance, although we are speaking about hilly and mountainous areas, where the transport might be risky especially in winter conditions. With respect to this tendency improvement of these buildings is not anticipated, which means that the same are neglected in relation to their running maintenance. In the Republic of Macedonia there exist 25 boarding schools and 5 dormitories There are fourteen boarding schools with a capacity of legal person, and seven are within the frameworks of the schools. In the Students’ Standard Program, except for the mentioned boarding schools, there are four separate Centres for taking care and educating blind and deaf children, as well as children with special needs, which function within centres where the educative activities are conducted for children of elementary and secondary education. The capacity of the boarding schools for accommodation and food can be 3 900 students of the secondary education. The buildings are built in solid construction, except for the one in Debar. The activity and the stay of the students in the state boarding schools, as institutions of educational activity is performed in an organized way, in accordance with a Rulebook on the Work of the Boarding Schools and the Educational Activity Programme.  The students are distributed in an education group of 25-30 students (in accordance with standards brought and criteria by the Ministry of Education and Science, based on the Law on Students’ Standard), managed by educators with correspondent higher education. The state participates in the accommodation and the students’ meals in the boarding schools up to 50%, on which the participation of the state is higher in the underdeveloped regions. The number of students interested in accommodating in the boarding schools is always lower than the total capacity, and because of that a selection procedure is not performed. With the Law on Pension and Disability Insurance (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 80/93, 3/94, 14/95, 71/96, 32/97, 24/00, 96/00, 5/01, 85/03 and 50/04), for the children with disabilities in their physical and psychological development whose parents are insured persons, i.e. users of pension, as a transitory solution until regulating the question by regulations in the field of education and social care, covering of the expenses is anticipated for the period during their vocational i.e. work training. There are five dormitories with total capacity of around 6000 beds in the Republic of Macedonia. Out of the total 6000 beds in the dormitories, around 1135 are in cabins which are in rather bad condition, for which the Ministry allocates funds for renovation every year. In these dormitories except for the accommodation, the students exercise the possibility to have meals, and they realise their free activities in appropriate rooms intended for that purpose, as for example the Internet Café rooms and the cultural and fun activities rooms. Concerning the question of what kind of activities are undertaken by the Ministry, it can be said that they are realised through the investment programme which is brought every calendar year. Depending on the funds allocated by the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia and their amount, the Ministry intervenes in the improvement of the conditions in the boarding schools and dormitories. The Interventions above all are realised through renovating and equipping the buildings. The hall of residence “Macedonia” – in Stip is a private building where students of the faculties in Stip are accommodated under same conditions years backwards, as well as the other students in the other state dormitories, in accordance with the standards and the criteria for accommodation and food. The state participates with 50% in covering the accommodation expenses and 40% in covering the expenses for students’ meals. The number of students interested for accommodation in the halls of residence is always larger than the existent capacities, because of what, ranging and election of students who are going to be accommodated in the dormitories is performed. The choice is done on the basis of the following criteria: financial and social condition of the student, accomplishments in his/her studies and remoteness from the place of his residence. The ranging is done by the Commission. Representatives of the students, the Rector’s Office, the student’s centre and the Ministry of Education and Science take part in the work of the commission.  In the frameworks of the University of “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” there is a dormitory for postgraduate students and doctoral candidates, called “Atanas Bliznakov”, which was built in 1991. The hall disposes of 83 residential units of which 51 are bed-sitting-rooms and 32 are one room flats. In the frameworks of the hall of residence for postgraduates and doctoral candidates a part of it is extended with flats for the guests of the University of “Ss. Cyril and Methodius”. The building was built in 2001.  There is a building for lecturers who, as a matter of fact, teach at the University of “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” as a separate housing unit. The capacity of the building is 24 flats. 
5. Are there special facilities, at all levels of education, for handicapped persons in mainstream education and VET establishments? 
The education of the persons with special educational needs in the Republic of Macedonia is organised on the basis of the Law on Primary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No.52/02 – consolidated text, 40/03, 42/03 and 63/04 and the Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 52/02 – consolidated text, 40/03, 42/03 and 67/04). There is no “special” legal Act that would regulate this subject matter. The essence of the notion “persons with impaired abilities” is established with many Acts (Rulebook of the Criteria and the Method of Accomplishing the Elementary Education for the Persons with intellectual and physical development impediments  (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 27/96); Rulebook for assessing the specific needs of the persons with intellectual and physical development impediments  (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 30/00) and the Article 25 of the Law Amending the Law of Elementary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 29/02). Differences can be noticed in defining this notion. The Law Amending the Law on Protection of Children (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 65/04) provides the possibility the “children intellectual and physical development impediments ” to be included in kindergartens with “finding and opinion of the appropriate professional institution”.  At the same time, conditions are created for acceptance of the children in the groups or in the special conditions, in accordance with special programs. The right to a special education is accomplished in the elementary education as well (Law Amending the Law on Primary Education - “Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 29/02). Pursuant to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, the elementary education is free of charge and compulsory for everyone, no matter the possibilities, the capabilities and the needs. One part of the persons are included in the existent elementary schools (Law on Primary Education - “Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 44/95). Certain number of students obtain the educational activity - on the level of elementary education – in special elementary schools, special classes at the elementary schools, institutes, health care institutes, educational corrective institutions, penitentiaries and other institutions (Article 5 of the Law on Primary Education - “Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 44/95). For certain group of students (students with moderate impediments in their development and the like), who exercise their right to education in special classes, special elementary schools or institutes, an expert institution has drawn special curricula and syllabi (Article 25 of the Law on Primary Education - “Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 44/95), The existent curricula and syllabi are provided for the other students. The designing of these curricula is done by experts in the field of special teaching, who are at the same time included in developing visual aids which are necessary for realisation of this type of instruction.  The elementary education is financed by the state. In other institutions that are on state and regional level, the state also funds the free food and boarding – school accommodation. Part of these institutions is co-financed by the Ministry of labour and Social Policy. The secondary education is also established in legal, organizational and financial aspect. The students with impaired abilities can continue their education in the special secondary schools or in the regular secondary schools. The student himself/herself decides which vocation he/she will choose.  Children are educated according to special curricula and syllabi in dependence of the type of disability in the special secondary schools. Curricula and syllabi for children with: impaired sight, impaired hearing, and impediments in their psycho – physical developments are used in the secondary school practice special teaching. The following vocations are realised in the schools: mechanical, electrical, graphics, traffic, agricultural, textile and construction. Work training lasting for twenty-four months is realised for the students of older age or with more serious disabilities in the special secondary schools. The Law on Higher Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 64/00 and 49/03) does not regulate the access of the persons with disabilities in the higher undergraduate and postgraduate education. One sub-paragraph of the Law points out that the competency is left to the institution of higher education. The students, the doctoral candidates and the specialization candidates who are without parents, or blind, deaf, invalids of first and second degree, mothers with children at the age up to ten, and the hospitalised persons, have the right to special conditions that are established by the statute of the institution of higher education. Part of the children, the youngsters and the adults with disabilities are taken care of within the frameworks of the institutions of the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy. They are embraced in various forms of care, but the Ministry of Education doesn’t have any jurisdiction over their work. The reasons for accommodation of these persons in the institutes are different – the poor social conditions, the unstable family relations, non-acceptance of the children and their special needs by the kindergartens, the schools and the incapability to provide an expert help in the area where the person lives. Children are included in the institutes very rarely because of social reasons. They are most frequently sent there for the reason of exercising their right to education and rehabilitation. The Law on Social Care (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” Nos. 50/97, 16/00 and 17/03) provides a right to a training for work and production activity for the persons with moderate and severe impediments in intellectual development, which includes referring to an institution for social care, reimbursement of the expenses for accommodation and meals, as well as expenses for training for work and production activity and  transport fee. There are day care centres for work and production activity of persons with moderate and impediments in intellectual development within the framework of these institutions , carrying out a day care and enabling work and production activity and work therapy. The day care centres for children with impediments in intellectual development, which are managed by the centres of social work having local jurisdiction, largely function on the basis of norms and standards that are obtain by well-known international organisations (UNICEF, ECHO, EDUKAID) which have a great experience in the approach to educating children with special needs. Besides these, the day care centres for persons with impediments in intellectual development, which are managed by citizens’ associations and which fulfil the conditions, are registered into the Registry of the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy. 
D. Teachers 

1. Describe the requirements for the qualification of school teachers and school principals at all levels of education? 
The requirements with regard to qualifications of school teachers and school principals are established by the particular laws for all levels of education, and are elaborated in details in the correspondent rulebooks and norms (standards). As for the subsystem of the pre-school education, this issue has been regulated by the Law on Protection of Children (Law Amending the Law on Protection of Children, Article 43 “Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 65/04) in accordance with which the provider of the educational activity is an educator who is supposed to have graduated from correspondent post-secondary or higher education for educators. Educator in a kindergarten may also be a person with completed studies in pre-school education – pedagogy major. Educator in a group with children with intellectual and physical development impediments is a person with completed correspondent studies for work with children with intellectual and physical development impediments. Educator in a group with children with intellectual and physical development impediments may also be a person who fulfils the conditions to be an educator and have completed specialist studies in special teaching. As for the sub-system of the elementary education, this issue has been regulated with the Law on Primary Education (Law Amending the Law on Primary Education, Article 32 “Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 63/04). In accordance with this Law, the educational activity in the elementary education is performed by teachers and professional associates (pedagogue, psychologist, special teacher and librarian) as well as by educators. Educator in a preparatory year may be a person with completed post-secondary or higher education. Teacher in a class instruction may be a person who has completed correspondent higher education. Teacher in a subject teaching may be a person who has completed a correspondent single or double major group of education for teachers that is acquired at the faculties, colleges, at the Faculty of Fine Arts and the Faculty of Music. The art and music teachers may also be persons with graduation from other majors and with acquired education in pedagogical-psychological and methodical subject group at the Faculty of Fine Arts and at the Music Faculty. Teachers of subjects for which the instruction is held in foreign language may also be foreign citizens with appropriate type of education and they should know the language of instruction. For this type of activity approval is given by the Ministry of Education and Science. Teachers in the elementary education may also be persons who have completed undergraduate studies and have acquired Bachelor’s Degree. Teachers in the elementary education may also be persons who have completed undergraduate studies and have acquired the title “Bachelor” as well as training in pedagogy and psychology and methodics at the correspondent faculties.

Professional associate in the elementary school (a pedagogue, a psychologist, a sociologist and special teacher) may be a person with appropriate higher education. The type and the grade of professional training for the persons who perform the educational activity are established by a norm on teaching staff, which is brought by the Minister. As for the sub-system of the secondary education, this issue has been regulated by the Law on Secondary Education (Law Amending the Law on Secondary Education, Article 32, “Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 67/04). According to this Law, teachers in the secondary education may be persons who have graduated in the appropriate studies at a faculty, college or academy and have passed the professional examination. Teachers in the secondary education may be persons who have acquired higher education at some other faculties, but have acquired training for the pedagogic-psycho logic and methodics fields at the corresponding faculties and have passed the professional examination. Teachers in the secondary schools may be persons who have completed the appropriate undergraduate studies at a faculty and have acquired the title “Bachelor”, and also have passed the professional examination. The type and the grade of the professional training of the persons who perform the educational activity are established by the norm on teaching staff in the secondary education, which is brought by the Minister. The basic training of the teaching staff for the pre- elementary, elementary and the secondary education and of the managing staff is carried out at the four universities in the Republic of Macedonia: “Ss. Cyril and Mathodius” – Skopje, “St. Clement of Ohrid” – Bitola, “The South-Eastern European University in Tetovo” –Tetovo and “State University in Tetovo” – Tetovo. The requirements with regards to the qualifications of the school principals for all levels of education are established by the Law on Children Protection, the Law on Primary Education and the Law on Secondary Education. A person who has gained higher education and has a work experience longer than four years and acquired after the graduation in the profession, and who fulfils the general conditions established by the law, may be elected to be a pre-school institution principal (Law on Children Protection, “Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia, No. 98/00). A person may be elected for a pre-school institution principal, if except for the general conditions established by law (Law on Amending and Appending the Law on the Elementary Education, “Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 63/04) fulfils the requirements for a teacher, pedagogue and psychologist in an elementary school, has at least five years’ work experience in an institution of educational activity which is verified by the Ministry, as well as passed managers examination. As exception, if there isn’t a candidate who has passed the managers examination, a person may be elected for a principal, but he/she is obliged to pass the same exam a year due from the day of the election as a principal. If the elected principal doesn’t pass the managers examination in the prescribed deadline, his/her mandate of principal expires. A person may be elected for a principal of a public secondary school if except for the general conditions established by law (Law on Amending and Appending the Law on Secondary Education, “Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 67/04), fulfils the conditions for a teacher, a pedagogue or a psychologist in a secondary school, has acquired higher education, as well as five years’ experience in an institution of educational activity, verified by the Ministry and should have passed managers examination. As exception, if there isn’t a candidate who has passed the managers examination, a person may be elected for a principal, but he/she is obliged to pass the same exam a year due from the day of the election as a principal. 
2. What initial and continuing training facilities are available for teachers? 
The basic training for the teachers in the pre-school, elementary and secondary-school education, as well as for the managing personnel of the school is carried out at the four universities in the Republic of Macedonia: “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” – Skopje, “St.Clement of Ohrid” – Bitola, “South East European University of Tetovo” - Tetovo and the “State University of Tetovo” – Tetovo. There are faculties for education of teachers at all universities.   A teacher (elementary-school teacher, secondary-school teacher, tutor, expert associate) employed for the first time by an elementary or a secondary school undergoes probationary period.  The probationary period lasts one year.  During the first year, the elementary-school teacher-probationer is being trained to carry out educational work.  The probationary teacher is being provided with assistance and support from a mentor (eminent teacher, expert associate, tutor from the same or from another school) designated by the school council. On the proposal of the Bureau for Development of Education, enacted by the Minister of Education, the probationary teacher must master the programme and sit for a professional examination.  The professional examination is taken before an examination committee, composed of three members and established by the Ministry of Education and Science. The professional examination consists of three parts: written (homework) assignment, practical pedagogical-educational task and oral examination.  Teachers of the vocational groups of courses in the secondary schools, who have completed other types of higher education, should also acquire pedagogical, psychological and methodological training at the appropriate faculties and pass the professional examination.  Continuous advanced training of the teachers in the Republic of Macedonia is an obligation of every teacher, expert associate, tutor or principal.  The advanced training falls under the regular working hours schedule and is within the framework of the forty-hour working week, regulated by virtue of the following:    Laws: The Law on Primary Education (The Law Amending the Law on Primary Education, Article 75 and 76 (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 63/ 04), the Law Amending the Law on Primary Education, Article 77, 78 and 79 “Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 67/04);    Program documents Elementary education - content and organisation of the educational activity and of curricula (Ministry of Education and Science, 1997); “All About the High-School Education” (Bureau for Development of Education, 2001).   Rulebooks: Rulebook on Methods and Procedures of Passing Professional Examination for Teachers, Expert Associates and Tutors in Elementary Schools (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.27/96), Rulebook on Methods and Procedures of Passing Professional Examination for Teachers and Expert Associates in the Public Secondary Schools (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 27/96); Rulebook on Methods and Procedures on Working Hours of Teachers and Experts Associates in Elementary Schools and Tutors in the Boarding Schools (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.27/96 and 46/98), Rulebook on the Schedule of Working Hours of Teachers and Expert Associates in the Public Secondary Schools (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.27/96 and 46/98). Continuous advanced training of teachers of the elementary and secondary schools is carried out at following levels:    State or regional – mostly according to the local branches of the Bureau for Development of Education depending on the objective of the advanced training or on the number of participants to be covered (for curricula and syllabi, certain issues related to the educational technology, projects – didactical or program innovations);    schools / educational institutions such as professional groups of teachers (class instruction, subject instruction, general instruction, professional/vocational group of subjects) or school teams (mainly within the framework of separate projects) ;   expert meetings, roundtables, symposiums, mostly on current or “basic” questions relating to the educational process where the participation is individual or in capacity of school representative;    Pedagogical and professional magazines, newspapers, information with professional material, methodical supplements, recognizing where the participation is on individual and where should be on the level on the institution / school.  According to the Law on Primary Education (Article 76, paragraph 2) and the Law on Secondary Education (Article 79, Paragraph 2) the continuous (vocational and pedagogical) advanced training of the teachers is conducted by the Bureau for Development of Education. This advanced training is mainly conducted by the Bureau for Development of Education at a national or at a regional level in its branch units, depending on the goal or on the number of participants to be covered by the appropriate training.  The Bureau for Development of Education conducts the advanced training via the following forms: Seminars, methodical workshops, professional / working meetings, instructive and counselling work – with teachers individuals or small groups (3 – 7 from the class council, separate teaching subjects). Seminars are thematic and linked to: The approach to the realization of the curricula and the syllabi in the pre-school, elementary and in the secondary education, application of certain aspects of the educational technology, project implementation – such as didactical or program innovations. Trainers for this kind of training are the advisors from the Bureau for Development of Education and teachers – mentors.   In the realization of seminars on projects (in the answer to the question 18_I_F_4 are stated the more significant projects) in the first few phases, are included experts from the member states of the EU and of the USA, professors and teachers from the teaching faculties in the Republic of Macedonia, advisors from the Bureau for Development of Education, teachers-mentors or coordinators from the pre-school institutions, elementary and secondary schools.  Most of the seminars shall be implemented with financial support from the foreign Governments and non – Governmental donors (The Kingdom of Netherlands, the United States of America, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, UNICEF, CRS, and FOSIM). The Ministry of Education and Science finances the seminars on the curricula and syllabi  Seminars on projects are carried out according to the prepared programmes, with defined goals and workshop activity design of activities.  These seminars cover groups of 20 – 25 participants, in cycles which mostly last from 2 to 5 days.  At the end of the training for the appropriate project, the teachers are usually receiving certificates.  Methodical workshops (in small number) are being implemented for certain professional or methodical issues with groups of teachers (10 – 30) at a national level (for example, certain issues of educational surveying) or at the level of teaching subject from certain region (English language, vocational teaching subjects). Implementers are expert consultants from the member states of the European Union and the United States of America, advisors from the Bureau for Development of Education and teachers - mentors. Professional / working meetings are organised aiming to transfer and explain certain information on changes, procedures, obligations originating from the curriculum and from the syllabi in the elementary and secondary education. Implementers are representatives from the Ministry of Education and Science and the Bureau for Development of Education, and the number of participants per group varies from 25 to 60, mainly principals and expert associates from the elementary or secondary schools.  Instructive-counselling work with the teachers is mainly used after the implementation of the professional supervision in the elementary and secondary schools by the advisors from the Bureau for Development of Education. However, more often this kind of advanced training is being realized upon requests from individual teachers or school teams addressed to the appropriate advisor from the Bureau for Development of Education.  Similarly, the issue of the professional advanced training of teaching staff is covered by the “National Programme for Development of Education in the Republic of Macedonia” 2005 – 2015 (currently a draft version).  The Programme clearly emphasise the need for strengthening the system of initial training and advanced training of the teaching and managing staff, and for that aim the Ministry of Education and Science will define the indicators for successfulness in the implementation of the teaching work, i.e., sets for expert and professional competencies, which will represent a framework for the initial and advanced training of the teaching staff.  Such standardisation will enable licensing the teaching occupation which will be conducted by a specialised institution.  Within the framework of the Project for Modernisation of Education, supported by a credit from the World Bank, a grant from the Government of Netherlands and by a national contribution in a total amount of 20 million dollars, will be established a wide circle of accredited providers of educational services, “free market” that will enable professional advanced training of the teaching staff in the pre-school, elementary and secondary education. With the already made amendments of the Laws on Elementary and on Secondary Education (October 2004), the professional advanced training received a systematic framework which will enable teachers to advance in their carrier.  It will result with increased dynamics of the educational mobility and continuity in advanced training of the teachers.  In accordance with the Law on Higher Education (Article 123), the higher education institutions may establish forms of continuous education, which will enable acquiring new knowledge and expanding the knowledge and expertise.  The Statute of the higher education institution will determine the conditions for acquiring knowledge by using the forms of continuous education as well as the conditions for issuing the document for completed education (diploma, certificate, etc.). In the period 1996-2003, education and training of teachers were continuously priority fields.  Larger number of the projects is intended for strengthening the capacities of the higher education institutions for enabling continuous advanced teacher training.  Most significant TEMPUS co-operation is implemented by the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics at the “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” University - Skopje.    The Institute of Physics was supported with two projects on modernization of the study programmes and establishment of a program on continuous advanced teacher training.  The infrastructure of the Institute was strengthened with modern laboratories and significant IT equipment.  Further upgrading of the structure will be enabled by the Government of the Kingdom of Nederland, with a donation of software for learning physics in all secondary schools in the Republic of Macedonia.  Largest numbers of the physics teachers are covered by the intensive courses for modernization of their knowledge and usage of IT technology.  For the purpose of enabling the continuity of the process, in 2004 the European Commission has accepted financing of a new project for establishing a centre for continuous education of the teachers in the fields of natural sciences.    Two projects (at the Pedagogical Institute at the Faculty of Philosophy at the “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” University – Skopje and at the Faculty of Technology and Metallurgy at the “University of St. Clement of Ohrid” – Bitola) were aiming to provide support to the continuous education of teachers in the specialized education, within which framework have been established centres for continuous education of the teachers from the mechanical engineering, medical and textile profession.      The Faculty of Pedagogy at the “University of St. Clement of Ohrid” – Bitola in co-operation with the two pedagogical faculties in Skopje and Shtip at the “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” University – Skopje have realized intensive courses for continuous training of teachers from 7 elementary schools and 3 kindergartens for teaching in the field of democracy.   The mentors trained are disseminators of knowledge and trainers of teachers.     The Faculty of Philosophy at the “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” University – Skopje is coordinating a project for inclusive education of persons with special needs by introducing up to date approach combined with social work. Continuous education of teachers in the elementary schools for children with special needs and in the Rehabilitation Centre for Visually Impaired Children is also another component of this project.  By virtue of the amendments of the collective agreements with regard to wages and contributions in the elementary and secondary education is established a system for promotion of the teaching staff in 4 categories:  teacher-beginner, teacher, teacher-mentor and teacher-educator One of the criteria for promotion of the teacher will be their professional development which will be enabled through continuous training, thus resulting with a cease of the rule according to which the differences in wages of the teaching staff will solely depend on the length of service of the teachers.  In the (draft) National Program on Development of Education in the Republic of Macedonia 2005 – 2015 the attention is devoted to the changes in the initial training and in the professional advanced training of the school principals, again through establishing indicators of achievements of the principal work.  The indicators will be a base for establishing the initial training and the continuous professional advanced training of the principals, and the implementers will be a wide circle of providers of the educational services with accredited programmes.  A state body will license the acquired competences of the principal. 
E. Curricula 

1. Decentralisation of decisions relating to the curriculum: Which are the authorities that establish the curricula at each level of education? What degree of autonomy do educational establishments have in respect of hours occupied by the curriculum, and the content of such teaching time? 
The Bureau for Development of Education is competent for preparing teaching curricula and syllabi, monitoring the realization of the teaching curricula and syllabi and drawing proposals for their amending, in accordance with the Laws on Pre-School, on Elementary and on Secondary Education. The Bureau establishes professional commissions consisting of teachers who realize the curriculum of the corresponding subject, teachers of the teacher training faculties and consultants of the Bureau. The professional commissions draw draft-teaching curricula that are submitted to the schools for an opinion, on which basis a final draft – document is drawn. These documents are afterwards reviewed by the Pedagogic Service of the Ministry of Education and Science. The Minister brings a ruling for approval and implementation of the teaching curricula and syllabi in schools on proposal of the Pedagogic Service. The procedure of drawing of the curricula and syllabi is public and transparent, and the very procedure of their bringing is centralized. Structure for the teaching curricula and syllabi of the educational activity is determined by virtue of the amendment of the Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 63/04). The aforesaid should contain: objectives, teaching fields, topics and subject matters, educational standards and profile of teaching staff that realises the teaching curriculum. By virtue of these alterations of the laws on elementary and on secondary education, the old structure of the teaching curricula is supplemented by educational standards. According to the above mentioned amendment of the Laws, the curricula are elaborated in accordance with model curricula, which are brought by the Minister, on proposal by the Bureau for Development of Education, in which the flexibility in the realisation of the teaching fields and topics is determined.  The syllabus is a document with a list of the subjects studied by the students at particular levels of education (in classes), the subject status (compulsory, optional, facultative), as well as the frequency of studying the subject (weekly and yearly number of teaching hours). The curriculum is a document which refers to the subjects, and it determines: the general objective of the subject, the objectives and the tasks of the subjects in classes/ school (study) years, the topics which are going to be studied, with an orientation number of teaching hours for realisation of every topic, as well as short didactic directions for realisation of the programme and the profile of the teacher who realises the instruction. The contents of the topic is given in the framework of every topic as well as the concretised aims of learning, i.e. the knowledge and the skills that the student should show that he/she has achieved, and also the didactic directions of the topic (examples with regards to : means, activities, correlation). Besides the above-mentioned, the curricula determined for each grade of elementary education (I - VIII) (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 63/04), provide the elementary knowledge and skills that should be acquired by a pupil. Drawing of outcomes’ standards has started also for particular subjects and fields at the end of the class instruction and at the end of the elementary education since the 2001. They are drawn by expert teams of the Evaluation Unit of the Bureau for Development of Education, and are brought by the Minister of Education and Science. Legal grounds for establishment of the State Assessment Centre will be set up by the prepared amendments of the Law on Primary Education and of the Law on Secondary Education. The pre-school institutions and the elementary schools are not entitled to bringing decisions related to the teaching curricula and syllabi. The secondary schools have the right to propose a curriculum, but that right has not been used enough in the past. The curricula and syllabi in the higher education are brought by the Academic Councils of the faculties, and their verification is done by the University Senate.  The autonomy of the educational institutions in the pre-school, elementary and secondary education can be perceived in the planning and the organisation of the whole educational activity in the internal right and legal obligation to draw an annual programme on the educational activity. As for the annual programme, besides the realisation of the compulsory subjects that are prescribed by the curricula and the syllabi, the school autonomously decides on the presence of the elective subjects, the facultative subjects and other programmes and activities which are in the students’ interest, as well as in the interest of the school and the local environment, for which conditions for realisation exist. The annual working programme of the school includes: description of the conditions in which the activities will be realised, activities for the start of the year; planning, realisation and improvement of the educational work of the school; planning of the regular education, the facultative education, the optional education, the extra-curricula activities; students’ health care; activities for cooperation with the local environment; monitoring and grading the students’ achievements; methodical – didactic and specialized training of the teaching staff and the other professional associates of the school; cooperation with the Bureau for Development of Education; cooperation with the parents and the parents’ associations; planning the activities of the expert bodies in the schools; keeping pedagogy records and documentation; planning of performances, celebrations and patron’s days of the school. There is not autonomy regarding the number of classes for particular subjects prescribed by the syllabi. On the other hand, the teacher who realises the curriculum is entitled to envisage and realise the teaching subject matters, which enables him/her to achieve the teaching aims determined by the curriculum. The teacher also decides on the methods which he/she will implement. The autonomy is present in the right to a choice and presence of the optional subjects, the facultative subjects and the other programmes and activities. The teaching curricula and syllabi in the higher education are brought by the Academic Councils of the faculties, and their verification is done by the University Senate. Further on, the Accrediting Board for the Higher Education brings ruling (accreditation) of the study programmes. The autonomy of the higher education is guaranteed with the Law on Higher Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 64/00, Article 10 and Article 11). The intellectual freedom of the members of the academic community, as well as the creative nature of the research and educational process are guaranteed by the autonomy of the institutions of higher education, as supreme values and powers. The university autonomy includes academic freedom of the institutions of higher education, autonomy in the management and inviolability of the autonomy. The academic freedom includes:   Freedom of teaching and research, as well as of the artistic and of applied art activity;   Freedom of studying, of establishing the study rules, the form and the types of the educational activities of students’ grading;   Drawing and establishing the study programmes and the subject matters of the particular subjects, as well as drawing textbooks and other teaching aids, etc. 
2. What is the core/compulsory curriculum in primary and second level education?  
The obligatory teaching curricula for all the types of education in the Republic of Macedonia are elaborated by the Bureau for Development of Education, and are approved by the Minister of Education and Science. The instruction in the elementary education is conducted in two cycles: class instruction and subject instruction. As for the class instruction, all the subjects, except the first foreign language, are obligatory. The subjects that the students study in the class instruction are: the mother tongue (Macedonian, Albanian, Turkish and Serbian), Mathematics, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, Music, Fine Arts and Physical Education. These subjects are studied for four years. The students of the ethnic communities in the Republic of Macedonia start to learn the Macedonian language in the third grade. As for the subject instruction, compulsory subjects are: the Mother Tongue (Macedonian, Albanian, Turkish and Serbian), Macedonian Language for the pupils - members of the ethnic communities, first and second Foreign Language, Mathematics, History, Geography, Civics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Craft, Fine Arts, Music and Physical Education. The subjects in this cycle of the elementary education are studied for four years except for the second foreign language which is studied for three years, as well as the subjects: Chemistry, Physics, Technical Education, Fine Arts and Civics are studied for two years. The compulsory teaching curricula, i.e. the common curriculum core of the high-school education in the Republic of Macedonia, consists of subject matters of the contemporary general education, which in the I (first) year of studies are organized in ten teaching subjects, to gradually decrease in the IV (fourth) year to five teaching subjects. The common curriculum core consists of twelve different teaching subjects distributed in the four years: Mother Tongue and Literature, Mathematics, First Foreign Language, Second Foreign Language, History, Geography, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Sociology, Philosophy and Computer Science. These are basically the largest part of the teaching subjects which imply psycho-physical capabilities of higher age, so they appear for the first time in the high school education, and contribute to the general education of the individual. These subjects represent supposition for providing a standard of general education, which enables horizontal and vertical passableness of students. Subject matters in the field of sport, fine arts and music appear in the high school education as optional syllabi.. In the Republic of Macedonia, the secondary vocational education that lasts for three and four years is conducted in fifteen broader areas of labour, and includes 170 educational profiles (80 of four-year duration and 90 of three-year duration). As for the teaching curricula that are realised according to the PHARE Programme, it is envisaged that program subject matters are distributed in six subjects of general education, which are common and obligatory for all the vocations, i.e. for all the labour areas: Macedonian Language and Literature with Communications, Foreign Language, Business, Computer Science, History and History of Macedonia. On a level of each separate vocation (labour area) there exist utmost three obligatory general education subjects more per vocation, which are in function of the respective vocation, as well as compulsory common-vocational subjects. The teaching curricula for the common-vocational subjects represent a broad vocational and theoretic basis for the rules that govern the working process, which enables conscientious and rational acceptance of the working procedures. The structural model of the teaching curricula and syllabi that has been worked out for the needs of the PHARE Programme is also taken as a basis (with negligible modifications) for the alterations pending in the other types of secondary education.. Such is the case with the secondary art education, and with the three-year long secondary education in which the realisation of the GTZ project is in process (it is a project for improvement of the secondary vocational education for the technical vocations). As for the existent teaching curricula for the three-year secondary vocational education, there are fourteen compulsory teaching subjects for all the vocations and educational profiles: Macedonian Language and Literature, Foreign language, Music, Physical Education, Peace and Tolerance, Sociology, History, Geography, Mathematics, Computer Science, Chemistry and Biology. With regards to each vocation, there are vocational subjects as well, being common for all the educational profiles in that vocation. The common vocational subjects differ from vocation to vocation. One of the characteristics of the obligatory teaching curricula for the secondary education is the enrichment of their structure. During the last decade, efforts have been made for approaching towards more complex program documents – curricula in which not only the objectives and subject matters have been operationally defined, but also the necessary activities, the conditions for the realisation, the strategies of learning and the standards for assessing the students’ achievements. 
3. Are VET and higher education curricula modular? What arrangements exist for credit transfer? 
The teaching curricula and syllabi for the vocational education and training do not consist of modules. They are targeted curricula and syllabi (general and specific targets grouped as cognitive, psychomotoric and affective ones) with developed structure which precedes the curricula with modules or modular teaching curricula. This will also be followed by modular syllabi.  The characteristics of the new teaching curricula and syllabi drawn within the framework of the VET1 and VET2 Projects, is that they are considerably eased by virtue of the subjects without an important role in training the students for the vocation, removing the unnecessary subject matters in the curricula and syllabi, and thus lowering the established yearly and weekly number of classes. At the present moment, under conditions of realisation of the decentralisation, the local communities are not authorised to elaborate and realise the curricula and syllabi. The decentralisation process and the conceptual guidance, gives the opportunity for monitoring the needs of the labour market at a local level, while the local community takes part in defining parts of curricula for training of the professional cadres. In accordance with the Copenhagen Declaration, in the secondary vocational education in the Republic of Macedonia is anticipated gradual introduction of modules in certain types of secondary education, in the vocational training that lasts two years above all, as well as in the specialist education. Within the framework of the Project GTZ that has been supported by the German Association for International Development, the application of the curricula modules has already started on a pilot basis in the three-year secondary vocational education, with regard to certain vocations and educational profiles. By introducing the modules in the secondary vocational education, greater horizontal possibility of advancing the studies will be enabled in the framework of the same vocation or the related vocations. This possibility of advancing the secondary vocational education will be realised through implementation of appropriate Credit Transfer System. One of the central elements of the educational reforms in the higher education system is the establishing of new rules of studying and introducing elective modules and the European Credit Transfer System. The introduction of the European Credit Transfer System and the new study regime means realisation of the basic idea of the reform - to place the student as a subject in the centre of the educational process, and that means to make a turn over in the educational process, as a part of the modernisation of the educational activity, which understands flexibility and dynamics in the functioning, for providing validity and recognition of diplomas, or of segments of the education (exams and semesters). This will provide dynamic and flexible study system in wider scope. Aiming realisation of the project on modernisation of the study programmes and introducing subject modules, as well as electiveness of subjects and credit –system of studying, many symposiums and seminars have been held, with participation of representatives from the developed universities in Europe and the World. It should be emphasised that new study and subject programmes that are coordinated with the credit-system are rapidly elaborated and brought. In this way, the universities and the faculties become constituent part of the European system of higher education, and some faculties have already approached towards implementing the new study programmes in accordance with the Credit Transfer System of studying, by introducing electiveness of subjects up to 30%, especially in the last two years of studying. Within the scope of this project, even before bringing the legal acts, the Mining and Geology Faculty in Stip was chosen as a pilot-faculty for realisation of the Credit Transfer System introduction in the study programmes. During the process of realisation of the Modernisation Programme of the educational activity in the institutions of higher education at the University, at the session held on 29 November 2001, the Rector’s Office of the University of “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” in Skopje has adopted the basic acts for introduction and implementation of the Credit Transfer System in the study regime:   Rulebook on the Unique Foundations of the Credit System and the Transfer from One to Another Institution of Higher Education within the Framework of the University;   Rulebook on the Unique Rules of Studying at the University of “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” in Skopje. By introducing the Credit Transfer System (CTS), the University of “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” in Skopje endeavours to achieve the following objectives:   Greater mobility of students at institutional and national level;   Precise insight in the load of work and expressing the students’ load in the process of studying;   Development and functioning of mechanisms for permanent monitoring of the students’ improving according to the study results;   Objectivity in the grading and acknowledgment of the study results;   Accomplishing compatibility of the study programs at institutional and national level;   Establishing international mobility of students and accomplishing compatibility of study programmes at international level, in accordance with the principles of the European Credit Transfer System ;   Unimpeded transfer of the student’s results from one to another institution;   Greater individualisation in the course of studying;   Creating bases for accomplishment of the concept of lifelong learning. CTS will be implemented in the accomplishment of the study and subject programmes for: undergraduate studies, postgraduate (specialisation and Master’s) studies, as well as doctoral studies. According to the mentioned rulebooks, it is anticipated that until the beginning of the academic 2004/05 year the latest, unique study rules are going to be established, in accordance with the bases of the credit system, as well as transfer from one to another institution of higher education, i.e. academic institution of the University of “Ss. Cyril and Methodius”. With regard to the realisation of the Project of Modernisation of the Study Programmes and Introduction of the Credit Transfer System in Studying, the complete situation at the University of “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” is the following:   Faculties at which the educational process is carried out on the basis of the new study programmes, in accordance with the credit system: Faculty of Pharmacy, Mining and Geology Faculty, Faculty of Dentistry; Faculty of Economics, Faculty of Agricultural Sciences and Food.   Faculties at which the educational process on the basis of the new study programmes starts to be implemented in the academic year 2004/2005 in accordance with the CTS: Faculty of Philosophy, Faculty of Pedagogy “St. Clement of Ohrid – Skopje, Faculty of Pedagogy “Goce Delcev”- Stip, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Technology and Metallurgy, Faculty of Forestry and Faculty of Physical Culture;   Faculties whose modernization projects for study programmes have been submitted to the bodies of the University of “Ss. Cyril and Methodius”, and faculties which are in the finalizing phase of drawing the new study programmes: Faculty of Architecture, Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, Faculty of Law, Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Philology “Blaze Koneski”, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Drama Arts, Faculty of Fine Arts, Faculty of Music. The introduction of the Credit Transfer System at the University of St. Clement of Ohrid in Bitola has started in the academic year 2003/2004, with the implementation of the results of the joint European projects of two pilot study programmes: the Study Programme for Traffic Engineering at the Faculty of Technical Sciences and the Interdisciplinary Studies of Public Administration. The same trend has continued so that the CTS is implemented at five of the existent seven faculties of the University. The CTS has been launched in all the study programmes in the academic year 2004/2005. The CTS is introduced in all the faculties and study programmes at the private University of South Eastern Europe. Thereby, a student gains thirty credits (sixty credits for one study year) for each semester. One credit corresponds to thirty hours student’s work load. Thereby, the lectures, the tutorials and the seminars, as well as the required time for the student to acquire the knowledge of the subject matter (at home and in library) are included in these thirty hours. At the newly established University in Tetovo, which started working in the academic year 2004/2005, the study programmes are structured so that it immediately should be started with the CTS. Although the CTS has been introduced or is in a procedure of implementation in almost all the faculties at the Universities in the Republic of Macedonia since the academic 2004/2005, it is still necessary to emphasize that this implementation is fraught with many difficulties. This is mostly related to establishing the number of credits per courses. It can actually be said that the system of credit collection is already introduced, but additional efforts should be made with regard to the transfer of credits, especially by the Universities in and out of the Republic of Macedonia. 
4. Teaching of the official languages of the European Union: please describe the teaching provided at the various levels of the education system. Provide available statistics on the number of young persons or children studying the various languages. 
There is a considerable tendency for studying more than one foreign language in the Republic of Macedonia in the last few years, as well as studying the same at a younger age, i.e. in the class instruction. The Bureau for Development of Education draws the curricula for the foreign languages with regard to class and subject instruction in the elementary education and the decision for their realization is brought by the Minister of Education and Science. The curricula are founded on the Amended Elementary School Syllabus, brought by a decision of the Minister of Education and Physical Culture in 1998. Two models of learning the foreign languages exist: compulsory and elective instruction of the foreign languages. The compulsory instruction is realized through obligatory studying of one foreign language from the fifth to the eighth grade. In the framework of the above-mentioned Syllabus, the first foreign language as an obligatory subject is included in the fourth grade.  In accordance with the Amendment of the Elementary School Syllabus, brought by decision of the Minister of Education and Science in 2001, the second foreign language has been introduced as an obligatory subject, starting with the sixth grade. The foreign languages curricula for the elementary education are realised by the foreign languages teachers with completed post secondary and higher education at the corresponding institutes. 
Presence of foreign languages studied in the elementary schools at the start of the school year 2003/2004 Foreign Languages Number of Pupils 
English 125504 70,0 French 43582 24,3 German 10166 5,7 Total 183056 100,0 (source: State Statistical Office). The foreign languages instruction in the secondary education is based on the curricula and syllabi for the high schools, secondary vocational schools and the art schools. The curricula are drawn by the Bureau for Development of Education, and the decision for their realisation was brought by the Minister of Education and Science in 2001. Studding of foreign in high school education is based on addenda and amendments of the curricula and syllabus for school education brought by decision of the Minister of Education and Science in 2001.  The curriculum of the high school education provides that two foreign languages shall be studied compulsory (as a first and as a second foreign language). The first foreign language is continuation of the first compulsory foreign language in the elementary school, and the second is usually beginners’ course or continuation of the second compulsory foreign language or elective subject in the elementary education. The third foreign language as elective subject is included in the third and the fourth year in the field of languages/arts. Studying of the foreign languages in the secondary vocational education and training is mainly founded on the innovated curricula and syllabi for the secondary vocational education, brought by decision by the Minister of Education and Science in 1999. One foreign language is studied in most of the secondary vocational schools, except for the catering and tourism schools and the economics, law and trade schools where the second foreign language is studied as a compulsory subject in the first and the second year. The foreign languages are also included as elective subjects for the purpose of school leaving examination in the third and the fourth year of the catering and tourism schools, then, in the schools of mechanical engineering for the purpose of final examination (Matura) and in the economics, law and trade schools for the purpose of school leaving examination (Matura) and final examination. Only one foreign language is included in the secondary art schools. In the Republic of Macedonia, within the recent years in several high schools the instruction is held bilingually, mainly in French (in six high schools), International Baccalaureate is included in the third and the fourth year of high school education in one high school, where part of the subjects are studied in English. Special classes are introduced in three high schools where the German language is studied with extended number of teaching hours (six hours per week).

The forms of work that teachers most frequently implement are the individual, the frontal and the work in pairs and groups. The communicative approach is mostly used in teaching which includes several contemporary methods for realisation of foreign language instruction, corresponding to the needs for realisation of certain language components. The schools are still insufficiently equipped with teaching means and aids necessary for successful realisation of the foreign languages instruction, and even those that are available in the schools are very traditional ones. The greater part of the schools has tape recorders at their exposal. Only small number of teachers can use information and communication technology. There are five resource centres for the teachers of English established in the country, with modern didactic aids and literature, two reading-rooms for teachers of German equipped with modern aids and literature, as well as two French Alliances (French educational institutions) also equipped with appropriate literature and aids in the field of methodics and didactics. Additional instruction is organised for the pupils with exceptional foreign language learning abilities in the primary schools, as well as additional instruction for pupils that need additional help in mastering the foreign languages. The professional training for the foreign language teachers is realised at a level of expert groups for foreign languages in the schools and through seminars that are organised by the Bureau for Development of Education. Another form for training of professional foreign language teachers is by means of seminars organised by the associations of foreign language teachers. Support for specialisation of the foreign languages teaching staff is granted by the Public Affairs Office of the American Embassy in Skopje, The British Council, Institute Françoise, Service de cooperation, Linguistique et Educative aupres de L' Ambassade Françoise, Goethe Institute, Austria Kultur Kontakt, Deutshe Botschaft, Skopje, Zentrallstelle fur das Ausladsschulwesen, Koln, Bayerishes Staatskazlei, Munchen, Bayerisches Staatsministerium fur Unterricht und Kultur, Munchen, PAD, IIZ and others. The foreign language teachers regularly participate in the seminars related to the foreign languages organised by the European Centre for Modern Languages form Graz, Austria. In the secondary schools (high schools) a student can choose to write a school-leaving (Matura) essay in foreign language. In the secondary art schools internal examination of the knowledge of foreign language is realized as a compulsory subject within the framework of the school-leaving examination (Matura). In the elementary and secondary schools are used  mainly textbooks in foreign languages by foreign authors, except for the Russian language, for which are used textbooks by Macedonian authors in the elementary schools, and as for the secondary schools, textbooks by local and foreign authors. There is a large assortment of textbooks, and the teachers select the textbook individually, in accordance with the interests and the needs of the students. Competitions in knowledge of foreign languages at a school and at a national level are organised by the associations of foreign language teachers every year. In accordance with the concept of the school-leaving (Matura) and final examinations (2004), foreign languages will be treated as elective examinations in the public secondary schools in the Republic of Macedonia. The realization of the same will start in the school year 2006/2007. Foreign languages will be studied in all the institutions of higher education within the framework of the universities, and most frequently as two–semester subjects, with lectures and exercises, The English language is mostly present with regard to the ratio thereof to the German, and then the French and the Italian language. At the Faculty of Philology the foreign languages are studied at the Department of English Language and Literature, the Department of Roman Languages and Literatures, the Department of German language and Literature, the Department of General and Comparative Literature, the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures (with Polish and Czechoslovakian language as well), the Department of Albanian Language and Literature, and the Department of Interpreting and Translation. The studies last for four years. The students attend the general module In the first two years of the undergraduate studies, and they decide between the teaching and translation module in the third study year. The Law on Higher Education (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 64/00 and 49/03), (Article 95) provides that the instruction at the public institutions of higher education can be administered in one of the world languages: for separate study programs, for parts of study programmes in which foreign visiting professors take part, and for study programmes in which the instruction is held in Macedonian. F. Adapting to change 

1. The identification of skill needs/deficits and the responses from the education and VET systems. 
Responsible for monitoring and initiating changes in the pre-university education is the Bureau for Development of Education– Unit of Methodical Issues. For monitoring the needs of the labour market for new/different skills, responsible are the National Observatory, the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy and the Employment Agency. These institutions perform this through analyses of the educational systems, periodical surveys and in other less formal ways (interviews of employers, teachers, and managers). The Minister of Education periodically forms ad hoc expert teams for analysis of the society from a point of view of skills that the students who complete the education should possess, and for proposing solutions of how the educational system should answer to those needs.  In the last fifteen years national and foreign experts have evaluated the congruence of the educational system and the capability to answer to the societal needs and changes, and especially to the needs of the variable labour market. (Group of authors (1994), Global Projection on changes and development of the pre-school, the elementary and the secondary education, Pedagogy Bureau of Macedonia; Crighton J (1996), Republic of Macedonia - Education Rehabilitation Project Identification, World Bank; Ministry of Education and Physical Culture (1998), Inceptive Report – Integrated PHARE Programme on the Secondary Vocational Education and Training in the Republic of Macedonia; University of “Ss. Cyril and Methodius”- Skopje (2000), The Pre-school and the Elementary Education in the Republic of Macedonia; USAID (2000) Education for change: Changing Education; Expansion consulting ltd. (2000), Inceptive finds – Consultants’ Report Relating the Education Development Potential of the Republic of Macedonia; Expert team (2003), Recommendations to USAID/Macedonia on Interventions in the Educational System; Handly D. (2003), System of Expert Qualifications Concept in the Republic of Macedonia).  The common thing in most of the reports was that:   the educational system is not flexible, the curricula are very much content–oriented, the young people complete the education insufficiently prepared to enter the labour market (they lack practical skills, information technology skills, knowledge of foreign languages, communication skills, self-initiative, capabilities for solving problems), as well as the democratic civic society;  The education is devoid of professional knowledge and skills corresponding to ISCED - level 4.  These evaluations are widely accepted by the expert and wider public. They have been taken into consideration during the changes in certain areas of the educational system, that have been made in the last decade, and also in the drafting of projections on education development (for example: Ministry of Education and Science (2000), Strategy on Education Development in the Republic of Macedonia; Ministry of Education and Science (2004), Draft National Programme on Education Development in the Republic of Macedonia 2005-2015. By virtue of the new Curriculum the second Foreign Language (launched in the sixth grade) and computer science as elective subjects in the last two years (in the seventh and the eighth grade) are introduced (Ministry of Education and Science [1997 and 2003], Elementary Education – the Essence and the Organisation of the Educational Activity and Curricula). The education of the Civic Society is incorporated in the subject matters of the other subjects from first to the sixth grade, and as separate subject in the seventh and in the eighth grade.  The curricula are framed, target oriented and directed towards development of the competencies. That means that the schools and the teachers have an opportunity to adjust the needs to the environment and to the students’ needs Teachers of the next grade of education (from the secondary education) are included in the drafting of the programmes, with an aim to incorporate goals that are related to the skills needed for continuation of the education. All the teachers have undergone training in teaching methods directed towards flexible programming, differentiated approach towards the work, leading project work, and realization of civic education programmes. Drawing of achievement standards has been started, which is also oriented towards competences (Bureau for Development of Education (2001), Achievement standards in Macedonian, in Albanian and in Mathematics at the end of the class instruction). By virtue of the new curriculum of high-school education (Ministry of Education and Science (2000), the High-School Education – Elective Subjects and School-Leaving Exam- Matura) compulsory studies of the second foreign language have been introduced for all the students during the whole education as well as obligatory studying of computer science for all the students in the first year, and also in certain modules the possibility to continue the computer science courses and to study third foreign language as well. In certain modules the students can choose to study management, political system and human rights in the last two years. Subject matters in the civic society, peace and tolerance, and culture of living are performed as project activities. All the students are trained for project work. The curricula are framed, target oriented and directed towards development of competencies. The schools and the teachers have opportunities to adjust their needs to the environment and to the students’ needs. In the drafting of the curricula representatives of the universities are obligatorily included, who have important influence in the establishment of the objectives and subject matters of the high-school education from the point of view of competences for continuation of the education. Some teachers have undergone training in the teaching methods directed towards flexible programming and leading project work. The training is in process for the others.  Important contribution to the adjustment of the secondary vocational education to the economic and technological changes and giving knowledge for acquiring the needed skills had been provided by the PHARE Programme for Reform of the Vocational Education and Training. Twenty nine educational profiles lasting four years of eleven vocations have been redefined in order to be able to answer to the changed that needs of the labour market.  Curricula for the other vocations have been innovated as well. Greater emphasis on the practical skills, the communicative skills, the computer use, the entrepreneurship and the management has been put in the new curricula. Representatives of the employers have also taken part in their drawing.  In the framework of the PHARE/CARDS Programme, models of qualification standards for continual and post-secondary vocational education are drawn with regard to four vocations. They are going to be used in the innovating of the system of national vocational qualifications. The teachers of the fifty six schools, who work according to the new curricula, have undergone training in the teaching methods for implementation of new teaching methods, or some of them are included in the process of training. In fifteen schools that have not been included in the new VET (Vocational Education Training) Programmes, starting with this year, training in teaching methods has been realised within the framework of the SEA Programme (Secondary Education Activity – Activities in the secondary education), funded by the USAID, and the total of fifty schools will be included in the following three years. With the help of GTZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technishe Zusammenarbeit – German Association for Technical Cooperation), a Project is realised on reforming the three-year vocational education in the technical vocations, the goal of which is the students to acquire skills that are needed for successful entrance in the labour market. New curricula are drawn in which the scope of the on-the-job training is increased to 50% of the total hours, grater accent is put on the technical culture and training in computer work. Half of the on-the-job training is realised at companies. The teachers of on-the-job training of the seven schools where the alterations have been introduced have obtained training in teaching methods. In the schools that are included in the mentioned curricula, the conditions for giving instruction have been improved by equipping the workshops and the schools with computers. Examinations that are primarily aimed towards check of competences are planned for the end of the secondary education, and it is planned that representatives of the social partners to be included in the examinations at the end of the secondary vocational education as well. The work on the innovative projects has made an important contribution to the qualitative respond of the education and training for the newly identified skills needed. More details on the innovative projects are given in the answer to the question 18_I_A_6.  Serious obstacle for the adequate response of the educational system with regard to providing the students with the skills needed is the insufficient scope of training the teachers for instruction, oriented towards acquiring competences, as well as the lack of the equipment needed (computers, laboratories, workshops). There are no formal ways in which the Employment Agency could convey their information on the skills that the employers point as lacking ones to the policy creators and to the schools. The employers are also insufficiently interested to be included not only in the drafting of the curricula, but also in the conducting of the on-the-job training and the on-the-job examinations. It is probably due to the great excess of labour force because of the high percentage of unemployed. Far quicker in reactions to the newly emerged needs are the Workers’ Universities, which through various courses (foreign languages, computers, courses in various vocations and the like) primarily train those that have come from the educational system with skills that are demanded at the moment, or it is foreseen that will be demanded. However, in accordance with the laws on education they can not issue verified certificates. The employment centres also organise training for employment in the framework of which they supplement the skills which they have concluded to be lacking together with the employers. The European experiences show that within the framework of the higher education and the research work, the following skills and competences should be developed: envisaging the trends and capabilities for coping with unexpected development of the events; team work and ability of work with networks of teams; guidance; communication skills, including using foreign languages; capability of individual researches; excellent capability for implementation of computer science in the field in which the student/the researcher is trained; connoisseurship of law in the field of intellectual property (including the problems). Depending on the institute, the curricula and the educational methods implemented by the institutions of higher education in the Republic of Macedonia enable acquiring some of the mentioned competences. Hereby we quote the specific approach towards building skills and competences that is present at the South East European University in Tetovo. The first two semesters of studies are intended for language learning (English and Albanian), utilisation of information technology and work on the Internet, introducing to the techniques of analyses, presentations, reviews and European studies.  
2. The adaptation of education and training to the requirements of the knowledge society. 
The global process of development of “knowledge-based society” binds all countries to accept the changes and challenges and to adjust to them. The development of human resources is even greater responsibility for the Republic of Macedonia, as a country in societal and economic transformation, because in such a way the country could be able to utilise better the global knowledge in economics, in social sector and the sector of environment, for the purposes of its own development. The Republic of Macedonia makes efforts to follow the directives of the European Union for development of “Europe of Knowledge” (strategic goal set by the European Council in Lisbon in 2000, extended two years later in Barcelona). The challenge is “Europe to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion” by 2010.  The development of the “knowledge-based society” changes our way of living and work and imposes new standards and qualities when we speak of the human factor and its role in the society. As a signatory of relevant European documents related to the goals set in Lisbon and Barcelona, the Republic of Macedonia adjusts the education and training to the needs resulting from these goals  Development of Information Society In July 2002, the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia has adopted the “E-Declaration 2002” – Recommendations for Quicker Development of Information Society and Digital Economy in the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 48/2002). Thus the development of “knowledge-based society” became a national priority. The same year in December, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia formed an Information Technology Commission with the following tasks: analyses of the activities in the sphere of information and communication technology (ICT); coordination of the activities for development of information society; preparing a draft-national strategy for the ICT, with recommendations to the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, the economy, the education, the science, the health and the culture. In October 2002, by signing the International Agreement “eSEEurope Agenda for the Development of the Information Society” (eSEE Agenda), at the Conference “Telecommunications for Development” in Belgrade, the Republic of Macedonia acceded the processes of eEuropeandeEurope+. In accordance with the action plan of eEuropeandeEurope+, the Commission on Information Technology adopted a work programme for the period from 2003 to 2007. The Project “Formulation of a National Strategy on Information Society Technologies for Development ”, supported by the Foundation Open Society Institute “Macedonia” has started in 2004. Separate strategies are going to be prepared for e-commerce and e-Government. The Programme represents a complex approach, which includes: harmonisation of the legislation with the European Union and its implementation; the ICT and the economy; ICT in the education and science; ICT in the health; ICT in the culture; on-line state administration and ICT and the local self-Government. The Programme envisages realisation of the following Projects: “Macedonia on the Internet”, The E-tender, Macedonia.mk, Internet Newsstands, the E-market-centre and The E-economy. Due to the fact that the activities planned and the implementation of the projects in the period from 2003 to 2007 cover the widest spheres of the society and economy, the human capital will play the key role for their successfulness.  Besides large number of computer science cadres with higher education, it is also necessary to develop continuing computer education and upgrading the computer science connoisseurship of the employees in the economy, the state administration, the public institutions and the non-Governmental sector.  At present, higher education for computer science profiles is carried out at three universities in the Republic of Macedonia. At the University of “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” in Skopje, the Faculty of Electrical Engineering organises undergraduate and postgraduate studies in Informatics and Computer Technologies, Telecommunications and Automatics. The Institute of Informatics at the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics in Skopje organises undergraduate and postgraduate studies in Computer Sciences. The Faculty of Economics in Skopje organises studies in E-business. At the University of “St. Clement of Ohrid” in Bitola, the study program on Business Statistics and Informatics is present at the Faculty of Economics in Prilep, and three-year studies in Technical Informatics are organised at the Technical Faculty in Bitola. Four-year undergraduate studies are held at the Department of Communication Sciences and Technologies of the University of South-East Europe from Tetovo. The study programs concept of the University envisages that during the first two semesters of the studies, all students will obtain training in “general academic skills”, which inter alia includes use of information technologies and Internet. The Information infrastructure of the University is a modern one and comparable with the demanding criteria of the European Union and the United States. The support provided by the European Union for development of modern study programs and creating conditions for e-learning is important:   In the period from 1999 to 2000, the Republic of Macedonia has been included in the PHARE Project “Multi-country Co-operation in Distance Education”, in the framework of which a national contact point was established at the Institute of Informatics of the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics of the University of “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” in Skopje. Study centres were established at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of the University of “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” in Skopje and at the Faculty of Pedagogy of the University “St. Clement of Ohrid” in Bitola.   In the period from 1996 to 2004, the Tempus Programme has financed numerous projects. A series of four Joint European projects has enabled completion of the concept of “virtual university”: virtual classroom, virtual laboratory, virtual library, and wireless campus (technical faculties and institutes of the Universities in Skopje and Bitola). The Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics of the University of “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” in Skopje completed and carries out numerous projects financed by Tempus, NATO and other donors, aiming at establishing infrastructure and use of distributed information technologies for flexible education, management, business and software engineering. A separate Tempus Project on e-business and management, supported by additional bilateral cooperation with the Netherlands, is on-going at the Faculty of Economics of the University in SkopjeThree regional Tempus Projects enabled development of networks for distance learning:   A Project for continuing education of judges from Albania, Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in coordination with the University of Bologna;  Postgraduate studies in Tourism and Catering for Albania, Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro and Croatia;  Development of regional postgraduate studies in Software Engineering, leading to a “joint degree” acquired at the University of “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” in Skopje and at the University of Novi Sad (Serbia and Montenegro). With these studies, joint degrees will be introduced for the first time in the Republic of Macedonia.Tempus projects support development of e-libraries and modernisation of the library information systems at the Faculty of Technology and Metallurgy, the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics and the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of the University “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” in Skopje, as well as the National and University Library “St. Clement of Ohrid” in Skopje. More detailed information and statistics on the infrastructure and on software developed to support e-learning is provided in 18_I_C_3Because of the importance of the computer science cadres find enclosed data on the students enrolled in undergraduate studies in Computer Sciences and Informatics for the period 1990 -2003:

Computer science and informatics subjects are present in the curricula of majority of the other professions, especially at the faculties and the higher vocational schools of the technical, technological and other applied sciences. The Law on Higher Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 64/00) envisages distance learning as a form of continuing education (Article 123). Bearing in mind the importance of this type of education, the foreseen amending of the legislation should enable distance learning (we consider “e-learning” as a more appropriate notion) to become a constituent part at all levels of education (exclusively, or “blended” - combined with the traditional forms of teaching and learning). As for the high school education computer science is compulsary studied by all the students in the first year of education, and in certain streams the studying of computer science continues in the upper years. Skills for using computers are acquired in the secondary vocational education. In the framework of the first and the second phase of the reforms of the vocational education in the Republic of Macedonia (the VET1 and VET2 Projects), supported by the European Commission, important components were: procurement of ICT equipment, CNC machines, educational software, teachers’ and students’ handbooks and teacher training. Interventions took place at 56 secondary vocational schools. As for the primary education, computer science is studied as elective subject in the seventh and the eighth grade. Large number of private companies in the Republic of Macedonia organise training for use of information technologies and training for use of Internet. Education and training of this type is organised by the workers’ vocational centres, too. These opportunities are used by a large number of employees aiming at acquiring computer science education and skills or updating the knowledge, as well as by persons that have lost the job or are seeking for employment. In elementary and the secondary schools in the Republic of Macedonia, the USAID supports projects important for the development of the information society in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and Science. The projects cover: Creative Teaching and Learning (2002 -2005), Programme for Secondary Vocational Education (2003-2008), Information Technology in Elementary and Secondary Schools (2003 – 2007) and Programme for use of Internet (2004 – 2007). In accordance with the work programme of the Information Technology Commission, in the period from 2003 to 2007, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia will continue to support the projects for development of information and communication network for connection of the scientific and educational institutions, with special emphasis to wireless computer networks. Fast Internet will be provided for the academic staff, the students and the research cadres at the institutes and at the development units. The activities planned for raising the level of computer science education of the population are: stimulating translation and publishing of literature in the field of the information and communication technologies; introducing computer science as compulsory subject in the fifth grade of elementary education; providing donations for equipping research and educational institutions with computer laboratories with access to Internet; establishment of a Faculty of Computer Sciences; support for drafting a Programme on prevention of brain-drain from the country. Reducing the Rate of Early School Leavers Detailed information on the persons who leave the education and remain with uncompleted education, as well as the measures that are undertaken by the state for overcoming this problem is provided in the answer to the question 18_I_A_11Reforms of the Elementary and the Secondary Education Management of knowledge in the educational system, and especially within the reforms, puts the schools under pressure to show measurable results to: relevant organisations of the state administration at national and local level, the parents, the students, the business community and to the public as a whole. The reforms and the quality requirements depend on the curriculum balance, the standards and the grading. The PHARE/CARDS supported reforms of the vocational education were related to the changing of curricula, and the educational and qualification standards. New forms of grading, different from the traditional testing, are more and more introduced. For example, grading standards have been introduced to four sectors of vocational education aiming at establishment of competences. Implementation of Portfolio as grading instrument is planned. Data on the knowledge and the achievements of students in the Republic of Macedonia have been collected in a more systematised way since 1999. The Republic of Macedonia participates in the international Projects:   TIMSS – 1999 assessing of pupils’ knowledge and skills in Mathematics and in the Science group of subjects in the eighth grade   PIRLS – 2001 assessing of pupils’ knowledge and achievements in Reading Comprehension, in the fourth grade   PISA+- 2000 international assessing of knowledge in Reading Comprehension, as well as in Mathematics and in Science, of pupils at the age of fifteen. An assessment of the pupils’ achievements in the mother tongue (Macedonian/Albanian) and in Mathematics, in the fourth grade, based on the requirements envisaged with the curricula has been carried out at national level for the first time in 2001. The results of the international assessments categorise the Republic of Macedonia into the countries of low achievements.  The results of the national assessments in 2001 lead to a conclusion that the pupils do not achieve the levels that are established with the national content standards. Part of the reforms are directed towards improving the literacy, and achievements in Mathematics and in the Science group of subjects. The implementation of the projects has contributed to developing of cultural interaction among schools, leading to implementation of the best practices, solving of problems, sharing of knowledge and its implementation. Pilot resource centres have been created as a core of innovations, as well as networks of teachers, managers, schools and institutions at national and international level. The increasing of the expertise level by virtue of the so-called “twining” projects and the opportunity for joint work of national and international leaders, contribute to forming of teams of local experts. The tacit knowledge that spreads among people is of great importance for improvement of education. The reform of the vocational education is particularly aimed at integration of the work and learning as an important component for building of knowledge-based society. This approach gives double effects: the students can develop their knowledge via studying at the workplace, and the employees can develop their skills via repeated learning. The cooperation of the educational institutions with the enterprises is intensifying. The ways of cooperation are different: on-the-job training for pupils and students, engagement of outstanding professionals from different vocational fields in the process of instruction (especially for the practical subjects), work on joint projects, research, use of the equipment etc. Example of good practice: The Human Resources Development Centre at the Cement Factory “Usje” from Skopje has signed cooperation agreements with the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and with the Faculty of Technology and Metallurgy in Skopje. The preparatory work for signing agreements for cooperation with the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Skopje, the state secondary school “Marie Curie-Sklodovska for conducting on-the-job training, as well as with the School for Children with Special Needs “Dimitar Vlahov” (for children with impaired sense of sight). is in its final phase. In accordance with the agreements, the forms of cooperation will consist of mutual visits, possibilities for on-the-job training, on-the-job training during holidays, employment of pupils/students, etc. Further reforms of the vocational education will take place in the period when, in accordance with the Copenhagen Declaration (2002), at European level, instruments will be developed that should contribute to achievement of transparency, quality and recognition of qualifications in the complex sphere of vocational education and training (“unique European framework for transparency of qualifications and competences” (Europass)); joint framework for quality assurance, including joint core of quality criteria and coherent set of indicators; fundamentals of the European Credit Transfer System for vocational education and training; joint European principles for evaluation of the non-formal and in-formal learning).   The concept of the vocational qualification framework for the Republic of Macedonia, prepared in 2003 will ease the harmonisation with the European solutions. More information on the structure of the vocational qualifications and the recognition of the non-formal and in-formal education is provided in the answer to the question 18_I_A_7. The answer to the question 18_I_F_3 is related to the modularity of the curricula. Besides restructuring and modernisation of the curricula of the vocational training (please, see answers to questions 18_I_A_518_I_F_2), important role in increasing the interest for vocational education and training have the measures for integration of youth in the labour market, creating opportunities for the persons with completed secondary vocational education to continue in higher education, developing forms for directing towards career development (for more details see 18_I_A_9), as well as the increased role of the social partners and the enterprises in the support to the shift from school to work (for more details see.18_I_A_8). Study programmes have been drawn for the three-year higher education (mostly at the technical faculties) as a response to the need of educating flexible profiles, adjustable to the changing conditions of the labour market. Three-year studies have started at the Faculty of Architecture, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, and Faculty of Electrical Engineering of the University “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” in Skopje and at the Technical Faculty of the University of “St. Clement of Ohrid” in Bitola in 2004. The Polytechnics at the State University in Tetovo is in the process of establishment. More information on the adjustment of the education and the training to the industrial and technological changes is provided in the answer to the question 18_I_F_3Teaching Cadres’ Education and Training Ensuring qualitative education and training of persons of all ages is possible if conditions for qualitative education of teaching cadres at all levels of education are enabled. The requirements with regard to qualification requirements for the teaching profession and for principals of schools are described in the answer to the question 18_I_D_1The Republic of Macedonia has developed a career development and teachers’ promotion model. The opportunities for continuing education and training of teachers are presented in the answer to the question 18_I_D_2. The answer to the question shows that continuing teacher training for use of information and communication technologies in education is still insufficient. The transfer of innovations and good practice into mainstream education, as well as the forms of teachers’ improvement are presented in the answer to the question 18_I_F_4In the period from 1996 to 2004, education and training of teachers have been continuously priority areas for Tempus cooperation. Numerous projects aimed at strengthening the capacities of the higher education institutions to provide continuing education of teachers have been financed:   The most important Tempus cooperation in this field is performed by the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics at the University of “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” in Skopje. The Institute of Physics completed two projects for modernisation of the study programmes and established a programme on continuing teachers’ education. The Institute has equipped modern laboratories and has been granted valuable information technology equipment. The Government of the Kingdom of Netherlands has enabled further improvement of the structure by donating software for studying Physics to all secondary schools in the Republic of Macedonia. Majority of Physics teachers is included in intensive courses for updating of knowledge and for use of information technology. In 2004, the European Commission has accepted a new project for establishing a Centre for Continuing Education of Science Teachers.   Two projects (at the Institute of Pedagogy - Faculty of Philosophy at the University of “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” in Skopje and at the Technical Faculty - University of “St. Clement of Ohrid” in Bitola) with objectives to support continuing education of teachers in vocational education, resulted in establishment of centres for continuing education of teachers for mechanical, medical and textile vocation.   The Faculty of Pedagogy at the University of “St. Clement of Ohrid” in Bitola, in cooperation with the two faculties of pedagogy of the University “Ss. Cyril and Methodius”, located in Skopje and in Shtip, organised intensive courses for continuing training of teachers from seven elementary schools and three kindergartens for teaching democracy. The trained mentors are disseminators of knowledge and trainers of teachers.   The Faculty of Philosophy at the University “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” in Skopje, coordinated a project for inclusive education of persons with special needs, by introducing a modern approach combined with social work. Continuing education of teachers who work in the elementary schools for children with special needs and in the Rehabilitation Centre for children with impaired sight sense is one component of this project. Development of Competences Important for “Knowledge-Based Society” The analyses of the compatibility of the elementary and the secondary education in the Republic of Macedonia (part of which were realised in framework of international projects), have shown that the young persons lack practical skills, computer science literacy, knowledge of foreign languages, communication skills, self-initiative, capability for solving problems and living in a democratic civic society. Information on the response of the elementary and the secondary education, aiming at enabling the young people to acquire the needed skills is provided in the answer to the question 18_I_F_1Opportunities for learning the languages of the Member States of the European Union exist in the elementary, secondary and higher education, as well as via in-formal education. More details and information are given in the answer to the question 18_I_E_4.  For the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, a country which makes transformation into a market economy, the development of knowledge and skills for entrepreneurship is of great importance. In the educational system of the Republic of Macedonia, Entrepreneurship is taught/studied in elementary, secondary and tertiary education. More information on this topic is provided in 16__A_1The European experiences show that in framework of higher education and the research work, the following skills and competences should be developed: foreseeing trends and capability for coping with unexpected developments; team work and competence of working in networks of teams; leadership; communication skills, including foreign languages; excellent competence in implementing IT in the field of the studies/research; knowledge in the field of intellectual property law (including the problems). Possibilities for acquiring some of the above mentioned competences have been introduced in different study groups. The sets of competences depend on the study groups, the curricula and the educational methodologies applied at different higher education institutions in the Republic of Macedonia. Here, we point out the specific approach towards building of skills and competences, applied at the University of South East Europe in Tetovo. The first two semesters of studies are dedicated to studying languages (English and Albanian), use of information technologies and work with Internet, introduction to techniques for analysis, presentation and critical thinking, as well as European Studies. The Higher Education and the Research Institutions – Core of the Development of “Knowledge-Based Society” The Bologna Process of tuning the higher education in Europe, aiming at establishment of a European Higher Education Area determines the role of higher education in the development of “Knowledge-Based Europe” (Communiqué on The role of the universities in building Europe of Knowledge, COMM (2003)58 final). In 2003, the Minister of Education and Science formed a Bologna Follow-Up Group, with representatives of the Universities in the Republic of Macedonia, the students’ organisations and the Ministry of Education and Science. The group monitors the process of building the European Higher Education Area, proposes adequate activities and prepares reports for the Conferences of the European Ministers responsible for higher education. At the Berlin Conference of European Ministers responsible for the higher education, the Republic of Macedonia signed the Bologna Declaration (September 2003). By this, the country officially became one of the forty participatory countries in building the European Higher Education Area. A more detailed description of the undertaken and the foreseen activities for tuning the higher education of the Republic of Macedonia to the process of building the European Higher Education Area is given in the answer to the question 18_I_A_5.  With the Communiqué of the Berlin Conference, the European Ministers committed themselves to make efforts for a synergy between the European Higher Education Area and the European Research Area. The former focus of the higher education based on two cycles, was extended with doctoral studies as a third cycle of the Bologna Process. The importance of the research, the research training and the promotion of the interdisciplinary approach in higher education as factors of ensuring and promoting the quality of the higher education were emphasised. The Ministries called for increased mobility at a doctoral and post-doctoral level and encouraged the institutions to cooperate in the field of doctoral studies and training of young researchers. The institutions of higher education are expected to extend the role and the relevance of the researches for technological, social and cultural evolution oriented to the needs of the society. Taking into consideration the complexity of the task, the European Commission has awarded a separate Project to the European University Association to carry out an analysis of the present situation of the doctoral programmes in Europe, to identify basic preconditions for successful doctoral studies in Europe and to promote cooperation of doctoral programs at European level. The Republic of Macedonia, where the doctoral studies are of a mentorship type at the time being, monitors the results of the Project. For the purpose of achieving quality and competitiveness at this level of education, the development and accomplishment of organised study programmes on doctoral studies are necessary. At the present moment, the network of accredited institutions of higher education in the Republic of Macedonia, provides the following levels of higher education: 
Institution of higher education Undergraduate studies Postgraduate studies Doctoral studies University of “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” in Skopje University of “St. Clement of Ohrid” in Bitola University of South East Europe in Tetovo State University in Tetovo Faculty of Social Sciences - Skopje Quantitative information on academic and research potential of the Republic of Macedonia is provided in the answer to the question 17_9The Communiqué of the European Commission (COM (2002) 629 final pays special attention to higher education in the fields of mathematics, basic sciences and technologies. The official data of the State Statistical Office show the situation for the period from 1990 to 2003:

The students of computer sciences and informatics are presented in the first part of the answer to this question that is related to the development of information society.  The higher education institutions and the scientific and research institutions of the Republic of Macedonia contribute to building of knowledge-based society via:   Support to the regional development - More balanced development of the Republic of Macedonia can be attained if a more balanced distribution of the human resources is achieved. The results of the tradition of twenty five years’ work at the University of “St. Clement of Ohrid” in Bitola confirm its role in producing cadres majority of whom have continued to live and work in this part of the country. Conceived as a university of an outstanding regional character, the University of South East Europe has started with its work in 2001 in Tetovo. The academic offer of the University stems from the wider social context, and the adjustments are result of the dialogue with the local community. The work of the State University in Tetovo started in 2004, by which conditions were created for access to higher education of students of the Albanian community coming from families with lower income. The Republic of Macedonia will continue to support the development of the regional higher education institutions. Besides fostering the funding from national sources, mutual cooperation will be stimulated, as well as the involvement of the regional universities in international higher educational and research cooperation. The companies and the institutions in the regions will be encouraged to develop cooperation with the higher education institutions, which will contribute to transfer of knowledge and development of joint research that will boost the social and economic development of the community. The dissemination of positive results and experiences of the research and innovative work will be boosted, too.   Improvement of the cooperation between the higher education and the economy, aiming at transfer of knowledge and development of innovations. The mechanisms for stimulating cooperation of the institutions of higher education and the scientific and research institutions (funding of research projects for development and innovative projects by the National Budget as well as co-financing of research projects for development and innovative projects carried out by units and organisations for technological development) are described in the answer to the question 17_7. The organization of the transfer of technologies and knowledge between the higher education and research institutions on one side and the economy on the other (centres for technology transfer, research cores etc.) is described in the answer to the question 17_6Having realised the necessity of improvements in the sphere of intellectual property rights, the European Commission finances a Tempus Project, in framework of which, the Centre for Continuing Education in EU Industrial Property Law was established at the Faculty of Law “Iustinianus Primus” at the University of “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” in Skopje. In future, the institutions of higher education and the institutions of science and research jointly with the sector of economy, should establish forms of better informing on the existing capacities and knowledge in both sectors, thus contributing to development of quality partnerships. In this sense, the country will accept the “open method of coordination” for stimulation of the cooperation of the institutions of higher education with the research institutions and with the economy. The national framework of knowledge transfer will be improved (legal framework and its efficient implementation as well as fiscal reductions);   Development of interdisciplinary studies and research. Interdisciplinarity is widely accepted as an instrument of fostering the “excellence”, the creation of innovations, creation of new knowledge and their dissemination. Structures of this type are rare at the institutions of higher education in the Republic of Macedonia: interdisciplinary studies of Public Administration at the University of “St. Clement of Ohrid” in Bitola, Journalism Studies at the Faculty of Law at the University of “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” in Skopje etc. The main impediment for raising the number of interdisciplinary studies at these two universities is their organisation (they are loose associations of faculties and research institutes with capacity of legal entities). The necessity to change the structure of the universities in Skopje and Bitola has been recognised. Amendment of the Law on Higher Education is planned for 2005, by which, the legal framework of an integrated university will be established. Interdisciplinary is more present in research, especially in the projects of international character.   Reinforcing the international competitiveness of higher education and research. The reforms of higher education encouraged by the Bologna Process contribute to education of competent, mobile cadres, with knowledge of the European processes, well prepared for developing international cooperation in the global process of building a knowledge-based society. In the sphere of research and development, the necessary knowledge and skills are acquired by way of international cooperation. The involvement of the Republic of Macedonia in the research and development projects of the European Union is presented in the answer to the question 17_14. The international cooperation in the field of research and development out of the EU Programmes is presented in the answer to the question 17_11Lifelong Learning Due to the more and more emphasised globalisation and development and implementation of new technologies, as well as to the fact of demographic ageing of the population (for more details see 18_I_A_2), the fast changes that take place in all the spheres of the economic and social life, put the lifelong learning and the “active ageing” in the focus. The implementation of the principle of lifelong learning into the policies, the systems and the structures of education and vocational education in the Republic of Macedonia, is given in the answer to the question 18_I_F_5Three years in turn, a festival of lifelong learning is organised in the Republic of Macedonia. The patron of the festival is the President of the Republic of Macedonia, and co-organisers are: the Ministry of Education and Science, The Stability Pact of the South East Europe, The Conrad Adenauer Foundation, the Institute of International Cooperation of National Universities and others. In 2003, in framework of the festival, a Conference of the Ministries of education and higher education of the countries of South East Europe was held. The Ministers signed the Declaration “Lifelong Learning, Adult Education and Employment Opportunities”. In accordance with the Declaration, the following tasks should be completed until the end of 2005: the Ministries to establish departments, or to assign persons responsible for adult education and lifelong learning; to develop wider opportunities for andragogy studies and to organise at least two meetings at expert level for the purpose of monitoring the results and exchange of experiences.  The Ministry of Education and Science established a working group that prepares a strategy on lifelong learning. The Ministry of Education and Science will draw a proposal for bringing a Law on Lifelong Learning in 2005. The law will cover formal, non-formal and in-formal lifelong learning. The PHARE/CARDS Programs contribute to the development of the vocational training with regard to lifelong learning, especially by stimulating the continuing education, the teacher training and the implementation of the National Qualification Framework for Vocational Education. Around six hundred teachers from the vocational schools, as well as representatives of the social partners (The Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, the Ministry of Economy, the Commercial Chamber of the Republic of Macedonia, The Education, Science and Culture Union) and representatives of the employers (the Commercial Bank –Skopje, Fershped – Skopje, Health Care Centre – Bitola, Clinical Centre – Skopje, KNAUF – Gostivar etc.) have been included in the training  Due to several reasons, such as the insufficient retraining of the teachers and lack of necessary equipment (computers, laboratories, workshops), very often the mainstream system of education can not answer appropriately to the needs for additional training, retraining, and development of new competences of persons of different age. Such needs are especially explicit with regards to persons that have lost their jobs and haven’t been included in the working activities for a longer period of time. The workers’ vocational centres show greater flexibility, which via courses in foreign languages and computers, as well as courses in various vocations, carry out training of persons out of the mainstream educational system. The retraining is carried out for lacking knowledge and skills that have been identified jointly with the employers. In accordance with the Law on Higher Education (Article 123), the institutions of higher education can establish forms of continuing education. They carry out training via short courses for persons whose workplace requires refreshment of knowledge, or for unemployed persons who are of an opinion that certain knowledge and skills would help them to get employed. Some faculties have special structures for cooperation with the economy and the wider community (e.g.: The Faculty of Technology and Metallurgy from Skopje, the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences and Food from Skopje, the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering from Skopje, the Faculty of Economics from Skopje, the Faculty of Law “Iustinianus Primus” from Skopje, the Faculty of Mining and Geology from Shtip and others). More detailed information on continuing education is given in the answer to the question 17_8. Having in mind that the process of building the knowledge-based society gradually requires more specific and more sophisticated knowledge, the institutions of higher education in the Republic of Macedonia should increase their openness towards the needs for education and training of different structures of the society and to develop capacities for quick response to the expressed needs. Monitoring of the Progress in Education and Training The capability to measure the adjustment of the national system of education and training to the changes caused by the development of “knowledge-based society” is of crucial importance. With the aim of providing comparability, the Republic of Macedonia should implement the methodologies of collecting, processing, storing and presenting the data that were accepted as indicators of progress by the Communiqué of the European Commission “European benchmarks in Education and Training”(COM(2002) 629final. The question 18_I_B_3 is directly linked to the implementation of the Communiqué. The presentation of the current situation of collecting and processing of statistical data shows that it is necessary that the Ministry of Education and Science and the State Statistical Office intensify the already started work on adjustment of the procedures of collecting, storing and processing statistical data. The Ministry of Education and Science will follow the work of the European Commission on improving the existent indicators, and introducing limited number of new indicators (“’EDUCATION & TRAINING 2010’THE SUCCESS OF THE LISBON STRATEGY HINGES ON URGENT REFORMS, 6905/04). The Ministry of Education and Science will strengthen the capacities for data analysis and processing and for their presentation in forms appropriate for support to the process of creation and implementation of educational policy at national and local level.  Important element in building the “knowledge-based society” is involvement of all relevant factors in policy building in the field of education, research and development. In this context, public debates, seminars, conferences, public campaigns and informative meetings with regard to the National Programme for Education Development in the Republic of Macedonia for the Period from 2005 to 2015, as well as to the improvement of educational legislation at all levels and for various forms of modernisation of the educational process (e.g.: the concept of lifelong learning and training, profile and career development of the teachers, the concept on school-leaving (Matura) and final examination etc.) are taking place,.  The Draft-National Programme for Education Development in the Republic of Macedonia for the Period from 2005 to 2015 anticipates the duties of the education with regard to the development of the “knowledge-based society”. Based on the framework set by this document, programmes prepared for development of the educational sub-systems (pre-school, elementary, secondary, post-secondary, higher education and adult education) as well as for three transversal systems: legislation, research work and information and communication technologies by the middle of 2005. The programmes, each in the separate sphere, will elaborate aspects important for the development of “knowledge-based society”. With the aim to enable comparability of the achievements and the reforms in the area of education and training relevant for the development of “knowledge-based society”, by building “Europe Based on Knowledge”, the programmes will set national benchmarks of achievements for monitoring and evaluation of the system in accordance with the European Commission Communiqué (COM (2002) 629 final. 
3. The adaptation of education and training to industrial and technological change. 
The rapid societal changes and the dynamics of the labour market, impose requirements for appropriate adjustment of the education and training to these trends. The realising of these objectives needs removing certain obstacles that sprung from obsolete teaching subject matters and curricula and form the insufficient and obsolete equipping of the educational institutions; then, it needs training and expertise of the teaching and managing staff for application of the new and larger technical and technological achievements, as well as adjusting the legislation. These processes are continually monitored by the competent institutions (The Ministry of Education and Science, the Macedonian National Observatory and the Bureau for Development of Education) which undertake measures for appropriate answer to the changes. Interventions in the curricula which envisage realisation freedom (up to 30% of the envisaged syllabi and work programs) in the improvement of the infrastructure of the schools (equipment and room), and in the systemic implementation of ICT in the education are carried out. In relation to the legislation, bringing of the Law on Secondary Vocational Education is in its final phase (expected to be brought during 2005), the main goal of which is the secondary vocational education and training to prepare a labour force for the needs of the labour market on one side and continuation of the education on the other. By virtue of this Law, forming of National Council for the Secondary Vocational Education is proponed, the competence of which is to propose the Ministry of Education and Training a list of vocations for vocational education as well as training corresponding to the demands of the labour market; to elaborate state qualifications and standards according to professions, to implement them for the needs of the labour market, and to participate in the state strategy on vocational education and training. Forming of Centre of Vocational Education is also proponed, under whose authority shall be professional and methodological development of the activities with regard to vocational education and training, preparing syllabi and curricula, and career development of teachers and students. The accreditation of institutions for realisation of vocational education and training will be under the competence of the Centre, and one of its more important roles will be inspection of the labour market at a national level by which the requirement for adjustment of the education and the training to the industrial and technological changes is met. At the same time the competences of the social partners in the sphere of the vocational education and training are regulated, i.e. the rights and the duties of the employers included in the on-the-job training are regulated, anticipating financial and tax exemptions for them. Out of the total Budget of the Republic of Macedonia intended for the education, around 22% are for the secondary vocational schools. Only 20% are intended for maintenance and infrastructure improvement of the educational institutions out of the Budget funds that are intended for the schools. These funds are not sufficient for providing the needed qualities of the educational processes, for the support needed for the teaching process, as well as for the professional development of the teaching and managing staff, and for creating attractive staff in the educational institutions that will satisfy the needs and requirements of the labour market. For this reason exactly, the financial and the professional help of the European Union is of great importance for the process of adjustment of the education to the new technical and technological changes and reforms in the secondary vocational schools in the Republic of Macedonia. The most important is the support within the framework of the Projects PHARE/VET1, PHARE/VET2 and CARDS/VET3, as well as the incoming CARDS/VET4 Project. Important role for connecting the needs of the labour market and the vocational education has the Macedonian National Observatory, which is part of the network of national observatories supported by the European Training Foundation from Turin. Furthermore, the projects and programmes of other countries and international institutions and foundations also contribute (USAID, SOROS-FOSIM, Germany – GTZ, Holland, Italy, Japan, China and others). By virtue of the PHARE/VET1 and PHARE/VET2, a Draft-Strategy for Vocational Education and Training has been prepared, and issues related to the labour market have been discussed, and it has been intervened also in the improvement of the curricula, the training of instructors and school managers, as well as in establishing international partnerships and procurement of equipment. A Draft-Law on the Secondary Vocational Education, as well as a concept of continuous vocational education (post-secondary education and training), of continuous vocational staff training, for creating a national system of qualifications and standards and a students’ career programme have also been drawn. The pending Project CARDS/VET3 furthers to the results, the achievements and the recommendations of the PHARE/Vet1 and PHARE/VET2 Projects. This reform Project embraces 56 secondary vocational schools out of a total of 91 schools in the Republic of Macedonia. The goal of this programme is fulfilling the requirements of the Ministry of Education and Science with regard to educating cadres with required knowledge and skills appropriate for the contemporary industrial and technological development, as well as for fulfilling the needs and requirements of the labour market. This Project envisages forming of a Group for Vocational Education and Training Policy, which will work on including relevant partners from other ministries, government agencies, associations, foundations, citizens’ associations, trade unions, employers, representatives of the Secondary School Students’ Union, as well as non governmental organisations. The Project of the SOROS Foundation has resulted in curricula for 10 secondary vocational schools, on the basis of the model of PHARE/VET1. These schools will be directly included in activities for teacher training, and in the VET3 Project; The European Training Foundation, through the Macedonian National Observatory and in the framework of the Ministry of Education and Science realises the following projects:   National Qualifications Framework,   Professional Orientation Guidebook (the project was finalised in December 2004), with an aim to support development of contemporary professional/vocational services;   Report on the Labour Market of the Republic of Macedonia, which final phase is expected in March, 2005. It is expected that the expertise will contribute to the reforms of the vocational education and training. All these projects mean collecting and analysis of data related to the condition of the vocational education, monitoring the trends of labour market – offer and demand for labour force, collecting and disseminating information on vocational education and connection with the labour market and the relevant factors in the country, as well as the role and the involvement of the social partners in all the development processes. The Project of the German Association for International Development – GTZ, which intervenes the process of modernisation of the two-year and three-year training in the electrical and technical , the mechanical and auto-technical and similar fields in seven secondary vocational schools is directly connected with the VET3 Program. This Project will end in February, 2005, but aiming its successful implementation and attractiveness of the cadres for the labour market, the anticipations that the same will continue for a certain period are realistic. As for the sphere of education and training, at the present time the United States Agency for International Development financially supports the realisation of the following projects:   Activities in the secondary vocational education, the program of which includes:   teacher training in fifty secondary vocational schools intended for realisation of contextual instruction;   establishment of career development centres with three subcomponents: establishment of career centres in all the schools, virtual companies in six secondary schools of Economics which will be included in the ECONET Project, implemented in Macedonia by the Austrian organisation Cultur Contact. Then, real companies in 44 secondary vocational schools, the activity of which should be in accordance with the vocations and the profiles that are present in the school and which will appear on the market with real products and services and previously prepared business plan, in order to provide successful business of the company;   Program on professional training of the school principals (legal obligation regulated by virtue of the Law Amending the Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 67/04, Article 42, Item 2”) and the Law Amending the Law on Primary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of  Macedonia” .. No. 63/04, Article 59, Item 2”). The amending of both laws provides requirement of the condition for passed “Managers’ examination” besides the other conditions for appointing a principal of a school.   The E-school Programme supports introduction of information technology in the elementary and the secondary schools (until 2007), and is related to installing and connecting the computing equipment, donated by the People’s Republic of China: 2000 computers for the secondary and 3300 for the elementary schools. At the same time, the Program includes teacher training for integration of the information technology in the teaching process.   USAID also realises a Programme that envisages access to Internet in all the central elementary and secondary schools in the Republic of Macedonia (until 2007). By virtue of a loan from the World Bank and donations from the Holland Government, a realisation of an Education Modernisation Project is pending. the processes of decentralisation start With this project, and important contribution to the adjustment of the education and the training to the new technological and industrial processes are made. In accordance with the employment directives of the European Union a National Action Plan of employment in 2004-2005 has been prepared in December 2003 with the support provided by the CARDS Project on Technical Aid for Institution Development as a support to the employment policy,, which in the context of providing greater employment inter alia establishes the following measures to which special attention is going to be paid:   Vocational training and lifelong learning   Development of strategic initiatives in cooperation with the social partners   Improving the quality and the work productivity   Coping with the changes and the improvement of the adjustability and mobility of the labour market. The above mentioned measures represent key imperatives established in the Draft Programme for Education Development for the period from 2005 to 2015, having in mind the demands of the labour market and the adjustments to the changes of the industry and technology. The Bologna Declaration which envisages the credit transfer system to be implemented in the secondary vocational schools will also contribute to the adjustment of the education and training to the industry and technology changes. The reformation undertakings should provide greater possibility of students’ advancing from the secondary vocational schools to the institutions of higher education. The adjustment envisages connection of the institutions of higher education with the economy, through establishment of research centres and through other forms, the research results of which will produce a greater impulse on the economy development of the country when connected to and implemented in the economy. Aiming adjustment of the study programmes of the institutions of higher education to the economy needs, a restructuring of the study programmes is performed at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences and Food, the Faculty of Civil Engineering in Skopje, as well as the Technical Faculty and the Faculty of Biotechnology in Bitola. In accordance with the Law Amending the Law on Higher Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No  49/2003) vocational and higher vocational studies lasting three years for educating cadres for the needs of the economy have been introduced to these faculties. A Polytechnics with study programs in Civil Engineering and Technology of Food and lasting three years also operates at the State University in Tetovo since October 2004. Taking into consideration the fact that a large number of great industrial capacities in the country are already closed or restructured (privatised and the like), the cadres that are educated in the institutions of higher education should be trained for work under the new market conditions (small and middle sized enterprises). Because of these reasons, the institutions of higher education in this respect should adjust not only the study programmes, but the learning methods also. 
4. The transfer of innovation and good practice in training into mainstream education and training provision. 
The training innovations in pre-university education are effectuated primarily by the Bureau of Education Development and the teacher-trainingfaculties, then by the schools, non-governmental organisations, as well as by more developed business entities (enterprises, craftsman’s shops), like: the branch office of Peugeot, Audi and Volkswagen, the Company for production and trade of steel structures “Kartel”- Gostivar and others). The transfer of innovation into mainstream education lately has been accomplished via the successful completion of the following projects: “Active Teaching – Interactive Learning” and “Step by Step” – method Projects which have started in 1994, “The European Networkof Health–Promoting Schools”- which has started in 1995, “Civil Education” - which has started in 2000, “Inclusion of Children with Special Needs” - which has started in 1998, “Descriptive Assessment of Students from First to Third Grade” - which has started in 1998; in secondary education: “Creative Instruction” – teaching methods Project for high-school education, which has started in 2002, “Programme on the Reforms in Vocational Education and Training” within the PHARE Programme – curriculum and teaching methods oriented,  which has started in 1998, “Improvement and Promotion of Vocational Education for  the Technical Occupations in Macedonia”,  curriculum and teaching methods oriented, which has started in 2000, supported by GTZ (German Association of Technical Cooperation), “Secondary Education Activities - SEA”, which has started in 2004, funded by USAID. The innovation transfer is largely accomplished via seminars and workshops within the frames of the projects by implementing the cascade training system and experienced learning. Thereby, a special emphasis was put on incorporating and motivating the schools from different geographical regions, which were selected as model-schools, and the good practitioners were appointed as training mentors. Special project teams are formed in schools for each innovation transfer, their task being to draft action plans for the dissemination and monitoring the innovation effects. The dissemination of innovations at the initial stages (when highly motivated schools were included) has proved quite efficient. Within the frames of certain projects (“The European Networkof Health–Promoting Schools”, PHARE/VET 1, ECONET), networks of schools were established for the cooperation with schools that were not included in the projects, with the aim to foster exchange of good practice. The examples of good practice are being promoted in the periodicals, published within the frames of most of the innovation projects, as well as in professional magazines in the field of education. Moreover, handbooks on examples of innovation practice prepared by school teachers are also being published frequently. Apart from the seminars held within the frames of the projects, a significant role (regarding the number of participants) is also assigned to the seminars for the implementation of the new curricula, which lately has incorporated nearly the entire teaching staff. These seminars were organised by the Bureau for Development of Education, which, in cooperation with the school management team, monitors and facilitates the implementation of innovations regarding the curricula. The good practice, as an outcome of these projects, is implemented in the realisation of the new curricula. The Bureau for Development Education– the instruction support unit, is engaged in continuous monitoring (via attendance at observation classes) of the transfer of innovations and good practice by offering advisory assistance to the schools and the teaching staff. The transfer of innovations had a considerable impact on the legislation (pertaining to the assessment and integration of children with special needs), on the curricula (with regard to the defining of the objectives, subject matters and methodology modules), on the teacher training (differentiated approach, project work, practice, and alike), as well as on the basic education of the teaching staff and of the school management.  Although in the course of the last decade, the teaching practice has been considerably upgraded, the quality of the instruction and learning is unsatisfactory. This is, primarily, due to the insufficient training for certain innovations, lack of teaching aids and materials for the implementation of innovative teaching methods, interrupted innovation transfer process caused by project team and school management transfer, as well as the lack of motivation of the teachers. All the development documents (the Strategy on the Education Development in the Republic of Macedonia in the period from 2001 to 2010 (2001), Recommendation to USAID/Macedonia for the interventions in the educational system, the Expert Group (2003), the Draft National Programme on Education Development of the Republic of Macedonia 2005-2015, Ministry of Education and Science (2004)), as well as the ongoing project of the World Bank on modernisation of education are aimed at stabilising and upgrading of the implemented innovations. Furthermore, the cascade training system and the established schools networks create a solid basis for the transfer of innovation and good practice, even after the completion of the decentralisation process in education. The role of the schools in the choice and the creation of innovations in accordance with the local community needs will be even more emphasised. 
5. The application of the lifelong learning principle to policies, systems and structures for education and VET. 
The primary objective of the application of the lifelong learning principle in our society is raising the awareness of the need of adult education. In order to achieve this goal, the education system should enable each individual, regardless of his/her age or professional status, to acquire new knowledge, skills and abilities. In accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, and the Laws on Primary, Secondary and Higher Education, each individual is guaranteed the optimal conditions for development, regardless of sex, social and cultural background, religious beliefs and nationalorigin. There are substantial differences in our state with regard to the learning conditions and the infrastructure in the urban and rural areas, the coverage of children in the rural areas (especially female children), the physical availability of the educational institutions for the students. Taking this aim into consideration, the Draft National Programme on Education Development of the Republic of Macedonia, 2005-2015, has set the priorities of planned activities in enhancing the inclusion of children (female children of Roma and Albanian nationality), reducing the drop out of pupils, raising the level of education of the population, reinforcing the system of professional training/retraining of the teaching staff, introducing system instruments for the availability of education to children and adults with special needs. Job training or job placement assistance as a key programme goal is organised for individuals who have not completed their secondary education and for the unemployed and adults, at the secondary vocational schools, workers’ universities, employment centres, educational centres within the trade companies, etc.  The public secondary vocational schools offer job training programmes with duration of 2, 3 or more years for vocational education and training programmes. The retraining and additional training programmes, as well as specialist training programmes obtained proper accreditation and credentials by the Ministry of education and science. After the completion of the two-year VET programmes, the candidates can enrol in the first year of the three-year vocational training programme, and after completing the three-year programme, they can continue their education for a year more in order to complete the four-year vocational education. After graduating from the secondary vocational schools, the candidates can continue their education for acquiring secondary specialist education. Furthermore, training sessions for employment are provided within the Employment Centres, or at designated employer, according to corresponding programmes.  The full-time employment trainingprimarily serves one or more of the following groupsthewelfare recipients,the unemployed who have acquired at least elementary education, and the workers who have lost their jobs due to redundancy, economic or structural changes. The training has to last no longer than three months. The retraining programme is for the unemployed or the workers whose employment has terminated and who have completed at least the first level of vocational training. Additional training programmes are provided for the same line of work (educational profile) that is commensurate with the level of vocational training or the vocation of the unemployed. The additionaltraining for the same line of work lasts no longer than a month and in same vocation lasts no longer than two months. The job training is performed via an adequate programme. The trainees’ competence is assessed by an examination panel of two representatives of the employer and a representative of the employment centres. The unemployed, i.e. the trainees who have completed the job training receive a certificate, as a proof that the candidate is competent to perform his/her duties for a certain job. In 2000, the workers’ universities organised 572 seminars and training courses for 9354 trainees and in 2002, 187 seminars and training courses for 10 876 trainees. The courses that have attracted the largest number of students are: courses on foreign languages (for children and adults), computer training courses, courses on hairstyling, cosmetics, preparatory courses for admission in the secondary vocational schools and higher education institutions, dressmaking and design, catering, TV/VCR technicians, etc.  The trainees receive a certificate that is not verified from a recognised accrediting institution. Within the last decade, a considerable number of private institutions offering informal education and training have been established in our country. The students at these institutions acquire certain skills, abilities and competences. However, there are no mechanisms for comparing the informal qualifications to the ones acquired by formal education. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to create mechanisms to verify the acquired knowledge and skills via accredited diplomas/certificates. Therefore, the Concept on continuing vocational education and training has been drafted, which shall provide for a system/concept for accreditation/certification of the acquired knowledge, skills and competences; a system of informal education; a Concept on the vocational training in the Republic of Macedonia; The Law on Vocational Education and Training; Model for professional guidance and job placement assistance in the Republic of Macedonia; a Teaching profile for secondary vocational education and training schools; Career Prospects Model; and a Regional Centre Model. The Republic of Macedonia does not have a system on assessment of informally acquired knowledge and qualifications that could verify the acquired knowledge, skills and competences at informal education and training institutions via accredited diplomas/certificates from a recognized accrediting institution. Almost all informal education institutions issue certificates for attendance of the training programmes. In order to establish a system of issuing certifications, a new Law on National Certificates should be drafted and adopted; a system of assessment and evaluation of the training programmes should be established; a Decision for the regulation of informal education and training should be adopted; a Catalogue of Knowledge should be issued; a Rulebook on the Criteria for Informal Education and Training Institutions Accreditation should be adopted, etc. At present, the new Law on Informal Education and Training is being drafted that will provide some of these needs. The right to acquire primary education is guaranteed by The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (Article 44) and is one of the fundamental rights of every citizen. However, although it is compulsory and free, the data provided by the State Office of Statistics on the educational structure of the population of the Republic of Macedonia beyond 15 years, show that 67 358 individuals or 4, 2% have not attended schools; 219 505 or 13, 8% have not completed their primary education; 559 082 or 35, 1% have completed their primary education; i.e. the population that has a very low level of education and the largest number of unemployed. Hence, the state makes efforts via the National Programme on Education Development, to direct its activities in raising the level of education for both the young and the adults who are outside the educational system, and at enhancing their professional and social competences. Assuming that one of the key goals of any state is to educate its citizens, lifelong learning has to be set as one of the public priorities. Therefore, there is a need of establishing a public-private partnership for financing the educational activities. In October 2003, the Institute for International Cooperation of the German Adult Education Association (IIZ/DVV) and the Ministry of Education and Science organised a Regional Festival of Lifelong Learning in the Republic of Macedonia, where eight countries from South-East Europe participated. Within the frames of the Festival a Conference on: “Lifelong Learning, Adult Education, and Career Prospects” was held, whereby a Declaration of the Ministers of Education of the Countries of South-East Europe was issued. The ministers of education have confirmed their commitment for enhancing the regional cooperation in the field of adult education, as a key issue of the economy and the social reinvigoration of the region. In accordance with the signed Declaration, special working groups were formed at the Ministry of Education and Science to draft the Law on Adult Education, Informal Education and Lifelong Learning, as well as the National Strategy on Lifelong Education and Learning. 
6. The integration of vocational training into mainstream education and pathways between general and vocational streams. 
The vocational training in the Republic of Macedonia is an integral part of the mainstream secondary vocational education, which according to the Law on Secondary Education offers general and vocational (theoretical and practical) education that enables the students to enter the labour market, as well as to continue their education. The secondary vocational education and training model in the Republic of Macedonia is a complex system of diverse and interrelated syllabi and curricula and forms of organised education, which is realised at adequate conditions in order to comply with the needs of the individual, as well as with the needs of the labour market and the society in general. It comprises several modalities of vocational education and training that are differentiated and systemised on various grounds, whereby 63% of the overall secondary school student population is encompassed.  The basis of the vocational education and training in the Republic of Macedonia is composed of three- to four-year programmes, as well as of two-year specialised education and training programmes. The objectives, the tasks and the curricula of the respective types of vocational education and training are determined by conceptual and programme documents. The vocational education and training is developed and regulated by the state on a school-based principle in all spheres of interest. Thus, on the basis of the four-year programmes, the students are simultaneously trained for immediate employment in different areas of the labour market (economics, law, administration, trade, catering, tourism, healthcare, agriculture, electrical engineering, etc.), as well as for further education. Within these curricula (with minor exceptions) both the theoretical and the practical instruction are provided in schools. Within the three-year programmes, the students are offered career-related courses of study. Thereby, students get practical training at in-school settings, as well as at work-sites in the respective companies. The specialised training provides upgraded technology-related knowledge and skills (technological specialisation), as well as at organising and managing the working process (supervisor specialisation) with regard to the educational profile. The two-year vocational training that is provided in schools and workers’ universities is aiming to prepare students for simplier work tasks in the manufacturing business, services and administration.  In order to adjust the system of vocational education and training to the social and economic changes and the workforce development, the Republic of Macedonia has opted for its gradual transformation. Since the 1999/2000 school year the PHARE Programme has been implemented within the frames of the four-year secondary vocational education and training, whereas the project GTZ (for upgrading the vocational education in the technical field) has been realised in the three-year vocational schools). The PHARE Programme has encompassed 25 educational profiles from 11 labour spheres in 55 secondary vocational schools, whereas the GTZ project has encompassed three educational profiles in seven pilot-schools. Within the PHARE Programme and the GTZ project, special attention has been paid to improve the quality of acquired knowledge and skills, i.e. to key competences, like problem solving, creativity, using information technology, and mastering foreign languages.  The four-year vocational education is completed by passing the final examination that provides opportunities for the students to proceed further education, whereas the three-year vocational education and training is completed by passing the labour market oriented final examination. Due to the limited opportunities of the students graduating from three-year vocational schools to continue their education, they have been offered retraining, additional training and opportunities for upward mobility in the respective educational profile. Within the frames of the forthcoming integral transformation of the secondary vocational education and training, the role, the structure and the curricula of the vocational education (lower vocational education), as well as of postsecondary education will be redefined.  The vocational education and training in the Republic of Macedonia is carried out in educational institutions which have insufficient cooperation with general education institutions. This is mainly due to the considerable difference in the syllabi and curricula of these two streams of education and the lack of a modular programming system. The forthcoming reforms of the syllabi of the four-year educational profile will be directed at establishing closer cooperation between the vocational and general streams. The integration of vocational education into mainstream education will be enabled via the introduction of new courses on general knowledge that would lead to broadening the courses spectrum, comparable to the general education courses. On the other hand, more elective and optional courses in the field of technical and vocational education will be offered in the general education.  With regard to the new conception on matriculation and final examination, which is going to be introduced in the 2006/2007 school year, the students will have to pass the state matriculation exam upon graduating from the four-year secondary vocational schools that will be commensurate with the structure and contents of the state matriculation exam in the general education. Thus, the pathways between vocational and general education will become closer. Moreover, this will result in establishing closer linkages and cooperative education placements between the vocational and general education. The answer to the question on the informal education and training (learning foreign languages, computer training and job training) is incorporated in the answer to question 1109 pertaining to the adult education.

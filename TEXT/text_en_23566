BUCHAREST, Romania -- Social Democratic Party (PSD) leader Mircea Geoana said on Monday (March 23rd) that according to preliminary discussions with a visiting IMF delegation, Romania will secure a loan worth 13 billion euros from the IMF and another 4 to 5 billion euros from the EU. The latter would cover Romania's budget deficit. Another 2 billion euros would come from the European Investment Bank and the World Bank, he added. Geoana warned that Romania is heading towards a crisis and the loan is crucial to "avoid severe economic risks".

ATHENS, Greece -- Foreign Minister Petros Molyviatis left on Wednesday (23 March) for a six-day visit to the United States. Issues related to the Balkans, Greek-Turkish relations, the Cyprus problem and the Middle East are expected to dominate his agenda.
In other news, a new poll published Wednesday suggests a sharp rise in poverty and homelessness in the wake of the 2004 Athens Olympics. The rise in homelessness is now attributed to high unemployment and soaring property prices in the run-up to the Games. (ANA, ABC - 23/03/05)

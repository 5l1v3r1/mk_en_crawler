PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic announced his resignation on Tuesday (December 21st). Speaking at a press conference, he said the decision was a personal choice and was not made under pressure from the international community, as some media reports have suggested. 
Djukanovic led Montenegro for 20 years, during which he served five mandates as prime minister and one as president. Igor Luksic, currently serving as finance minister, has been mentioned in local press reports as a likely replacement. Earlier in the day, Deputy Prime Minister Svetozar Marovic also announced his resignation, also for personal reasons. (Mina, RTCG, Cafe del Montenegro - 21/12/10)

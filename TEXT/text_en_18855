ANKARA, Turkey -- Several NGOs announced on Monday (February 5th) that they agreed on a proposal to amend the penal code's controversial Article 301, which criminalises "denigrating Turkishness" and has led to court proceedings against various Turkish intellectuals. The NGOs plan to submit their proposal to the government. The agreement was reached at a weekend meeting in Ankara, the latest in a series aimed at reaching common ground. The proposal reportedly calls for shortening the article and replacing the ambiguous term "scorning and deriding Turkishness".
In other news, Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer and visiting Pakistani counterpart Pervez Musharraf reaffirmed on Monday their countries' willingness to contribute to the peace processes and regional co-operation in the Middle East. In addition to discussing Iraq and Afghanistan, they talked about ways to boost bilateral trade and economic relations. (Milliyet, Zaman, Sabah - 06/02/07; Focus, Turks.US - 05/02/07)

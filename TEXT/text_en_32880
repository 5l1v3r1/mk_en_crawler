ANKARA, Turkey -- At the request of employers, the Turkish government pledged Saturday (30 November) to draft a new labour law aimed at improving market flexibility. The government will try to pass the new law before the enforcement of the controversial job security law in March 2003, according to Industry and Trade Minister Ali Coskun. Employers say the current measure imposes too many restrictions on downsizing staff, which they argue, hurts the overall business climate. (Turkish Daily News - 01/12/02)

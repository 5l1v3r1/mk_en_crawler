ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia's new Interior Minister Ivica Kirin sent five investigators to the eastern town of Osijek on Monday (25 July) to reopen an inquiry into the disappearance of more than 30 Serb civilians there in 1991. He also replaced the town's police chief with an experienced senior officer from Zagreb. Witnesses have said Croatian soldiers murdered the Serbs and dumped their bodies in the River Drava; however, a previous police inquiry did not result in any criminal indictments. Last week, Justice Minister Vesna Skare-Ozbolt confirmed that UN tribunal prosecutors are also looking into the case. (Vecernji list - 26/07/05; Reuters, HRT, Hina - 25/07/05)

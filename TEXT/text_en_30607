BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu warned on Monday (December 13th) that the next report by the European Commission (EC) on Romania's progress in reforming its judiciary may signal "at least partial failure" which "will not help" the country join Schengen. The next interim report on the Co-operation and Verification Mechanism is due next month. Meeting with representatives of the ruling parties, Basescu said that the evaluation depends on the Superior Council of Magistracy, which recently decided that some of its members can seek a second mandate, despite concerns raised by magistrate associations and NGO. Three of the current council members were re-elected recently, a move that was challenged in court by some of their own colleagues. The election of one of the three was nullified.

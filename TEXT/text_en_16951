PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Montenegrin Parliament on Saturday (3 June) formally approved the results of the 21 May referendum and adopted a declaration proclaiming the independence of Europe's newest state. The document describes Montenegro as "a multiethnic, multicultural and multiconfessional society, founded on respect for and protection of human freedoms and rights, minority rights, principles of parliamentary democracy, the rule of law and a market economy". It pledges Montenegro's readiness to continue on the path of reforms, stability and European integration, and sets EU and NATO membership as a strategic goal. 
Reactions in Serbia were mixed. President Boris Tadic sent a message wishing Montenegro "peace, stability and overall prosperity". Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica refrained from congratulations and signalled that his government was in no hurry to establish diplomatic relations with the new state. On Friday, he told visiting EU security chief Javier Solana that Brussels' assistance is not needed in the separation talks between Serbia and Montenegro. 
Solana, meanwhile, reiterated that Serbia has a clear European perspective, but must resolve its obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal in order for talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement to restart.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Fines that labour inspectors can impose increased tenfold on average to boost compliance with labour laws. The Bulgarian government approved the new regulations at its session Friday (May 23rd).The most frequent violations are working without a contract or at the minimum rate and poor labour conditions, mostly concerning safety and health standards. The fines for minor violations are minimal but cannot be appealed. The government hopes the measures can reduce informal employment as well as the practice of paying a small salary officially and the rest under the table. (Darik, Dnevnik, bTV - 23/05/08)

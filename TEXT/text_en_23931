SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko says the so-called Prud process of dialogue among leaders of the three main political parties is basically dead, and is now a process involving more parties, local media reported on Sunday (July 19th). In an interview with Sarajevo-based OBN TV, Inzko said that minor changes to the constitution are still possible. Asked about his Bonn powers, under which he can enact laws and dismiss politicians, Inzko said Bosnian citizens have similar powers: the presidential and parliamentary elections will be held in October of next year.

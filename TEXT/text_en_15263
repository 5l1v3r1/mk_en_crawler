NEW YORK, United States -- Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis met with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday (26 September) and said her country would never allow Macedonia to join NATO or the EU until the name dispute with Greece is resolved. She added that she does not believe any solution is imminent, but is more optimistic regarding a solution to the Cyprus problem. Bakoyannis meets on Thursday with the UN mediator on the name dispute, Matthew Nimitz. (Eleftherotypia - 27/09/06; Makfax, A1 TV, ERT, ANA-MPA - 26/09/06)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Defence Ministry issued a press release on Tuesday (June 5th), to clarify remarks by Minister Teodor Melescanu regarding Romania and Bulgaria working together to ease tensions with Russia, over allowing US military bases in the two countries. Local media offered different versions of Melescanu's statement from Paris on Monday. One interpretation was that he had directly proposed that Russia, Romania, Bulgaria and the US hold joint army drills. Melescanu denied this comment, but stands by reports that quoted him as saying Bulgaria and Romania will embark on a common approach towards Russia, with military experts working to draft a strategy.

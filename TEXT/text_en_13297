ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Six young Iraqis, between 2 and 20 years of age, arrived in Turkey on Monday (20 February) to receive eye surgery as part of a mission organised by the US Johns Hopkins University, Turkey's Anadolu Medical Centre and several NGOs. The US military provided a plane to fly the patients and their families to Istanbul. The Iraqis will stay there for a week to undergo cataract surgery, retina transplants and other treatments.
Also Monday, Turkey's Supreme Board of Radio and Television announced that it has decided to approve the launch of Kurdish-language broadcasting on private media starting in March. Since 2004, only limited transmission in Kurdish has been allowed on national radio and TV channels. (AFP, NTV - 20/02/06)

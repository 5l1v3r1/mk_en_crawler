BELGRADE, Serbia -- The country will not hold early elections before the spring of 2007, the newspaper Politika reported in its Friday (22 September) edition, citing unnamed sources in the ruling coalition. The sources say Serbs will, however, go to the polls this year regarding the new constitution. A draft version is expected in parliament within the next few days, while the referendum itself should take place from 15 to 90 days after parliamentary ratification. Politika says that after the constitution is adopted, the government plans to adopt some key legislation, including provisions on government decentralisation, elections and other important issues.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Stoyan Cheshmedzhiev, the director of the Bulgarian news agency BTA, resigned Tuesday (18 March) amid protests by several hundred journalists. Cheshmedzhiev wrote to the president of the National Assembly that he was the victim of a campaign orchestrated by the Union of Democratic Forces. His appointment last October sparked controversy, as it broke from the tradition of appointing the director from among the agency's staff.

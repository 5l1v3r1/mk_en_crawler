PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government expects a positive decision from the European Commission (EC) on visa liberalisation by next year, Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said Monday (January 25th). After meeting with parliament's EU Integrations Committee, Kuci acknowledged that the five EU member states that have not recognised Kosovo -- Romania, Slovakia, Greece, Cyprus and Spain -- could hinder the process. A delegation of EC experts is to arrive in Kosovo Wednesday to push dialogue between Pristina and Brussels on the issue. (Zeri, Lajm - 26/01/10; RTK, Kohavision, Telegrafi - 25/01/10)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prosecutors intend to press charges against members of the Greek "November 17" terrorist group for attacks on Turkish diplomats in Athens in the 1990s, local media reported on Thursday (October 23rd). The indictment by the chief prosecutor's office says four members of the group currently jailed in Greece should face punishment for murder and "an attempt to forcefully change the constitutional order of Turkey". Two diplomats working at the Turkish Embassy in Athens died in two separate attacks by members of "November 17" in 1991 and 1994. A criminal court in Ankara reportedly has accepted the indictment and is now expected to launch a trial shortly. (Zaman, Worldbulletin, Anadolu news agency - 23/10/08)

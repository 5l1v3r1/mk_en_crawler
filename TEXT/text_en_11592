BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Addressing Serbia-Montenegro's Parliament on Tuesday (21 December), Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic cited EU integration and ties with the United States and Russia as priorities in the federal union's foreign policy. "We can and must get to Brussels more quickly than the greatest of optimists would say. Geographically, we form the bridge between Europe and Asia and economically a bridge with Russia," Draskovic said. (Beta, ITAR-TASS, Tanjug - 21/12/04)

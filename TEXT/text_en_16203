BRUSSELS, Belgium -- By an overwhelming majority Wednesday (14 June), the European Parliament adopted a resolution in support of Bulgaria and Romania's EU entry in 2007, on condition that the countries implement pre-accession reforms. The document urged Romania and Bulgaria to consolidate their efforts regarding judicial reforms and ensure the transparency and independence of their respective judiciaries. EU leaders kick off a two-day summit Thursday in Brussels to discuss accession. 
In other news, Bulgaria's Parliament endorsed a resolution Wednesday in support of the government's action plan for EU accession, which addresses issues described as problematic in last month's monitoring report by the European Commission.

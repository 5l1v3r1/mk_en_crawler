ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu on Tuesday (October 12th) urged France to help Ankara along its road to EU membership. Speaking at a joint press conference with French counterpart Bernard Kouchner in Ankara, Davutoglu asked for France's "active support" in starting talks on EU accession in some policy areas. Kouchner said such talks are possible in three chapters, but at the same time, stressed that Turkey should first demonstrate progress in its reform efforts. The three policy areas are social policy, employment and competition. Turkey needs to complete negotiations in 35 policy areas to bring its institutions and legislation in line with those of the EU. Eighteen of them, however, remain blocked over the Cypriot issue. "The ball is in your court," Kouchner said. Davutoglu reiterated calls for progress in the long-standing Cypriot issue, which has been a major obstacle on Ankara's road to the EU, saying Turkey is being treated unfairly because of the dispute. For years, France has backed the idea of offering Turkey "privileged partnership" status, rather than full EU membership.

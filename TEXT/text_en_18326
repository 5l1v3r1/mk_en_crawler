ANKARA, Turkey -- A political science professor was formally indicted on Tuesday (March 13th) because of remarks he made about the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Atilla Yayla said in a speech last November that Ataturk's one-party rule between 1925 and 1945 was not as progressive as people were led to believe. He also condemned the practice of hanging portraits and erecting statues of Ataturk in public places. Gazi University in Ankara suspended the professor after receiving hundreds of letters protesting his statement. 
"If Turkey wants to be a civilised country, academics must be able to scientifically criticise and evaluate Ataturk's ideas," Yayla said in an interview. No date has been set for his trial. He faces up to three years in prison if convicted. (AP - 13/03/07)

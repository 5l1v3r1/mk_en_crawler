SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The international community's High Representative to BiH, Christian Schwarz-Schilling, is again urging the BiH Council of Ministers to ensure the implementation of key reforms. In his weekly column published on Friday (May 25th) in leading newspapers, Schwarz-Schilling said he was disappointed that many ministers still act as though they are responsible to their parties rather than to the public. But he welcomed the fact that the cabinet, led by Prime Minister Nikola Spiric, had adopted and published a work plan for 2007, stressing this would allow the public to better gauge government performance.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has backed the continuation of the EU expansion process, saying late on Tuesday (October 10th) that the European prospect serves as a major incentive for democratic reforms in the Western Balkan countries. The region should not be perceived as Europe's "backyard", he said, but as part of Europe. He added that the planned internal restructuring of EU institutions must enable Croatia to become the 28th member -- after Bulgaria and Romania, which are scheduled to join in 2007. 
As for Serbia, Rehn said the EU wants to help Belgrade overcome current challenges. He stressed, however, that full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal remains a condition for resuming negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement.

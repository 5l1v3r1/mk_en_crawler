ZAGREB, Croatia -- The newly-established Foreign Investors' Council in Croatia highlighted its priorities Tuesday (3 May). Panel president Jorn Pedersen, the CEO of Carlsberg Croatia, said these include rooting out corruption, framing a viable investment policy for the private sector, and strengthening management. Pedersen added that foreign investors view government support for local producers and adjusting the legal framework as key to improving the country's investment climate. The council, established last month, includes eight leading foreign companies already investing in Croatia. (HINA, HRT - 03/05/05)

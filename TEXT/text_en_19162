SOFIA, Bulgaria -- An airplane with Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov onboard made an emergency landing on the Azores islands late Tuesday (January 29th) due a technical problem. The Russian-made Tu-154 presidential plane was to take Parvanov and the delegation accompanying him to Mexico for the first official visit by a Bulgarian head of state. The visit, which was to last three days, had to be cancelled. The president and the delegation returned to Bulgaria on a charter flight late Wednesday.

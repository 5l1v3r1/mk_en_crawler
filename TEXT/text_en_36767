BUCHAREST, Romania -- The last of Romania's Dacia-1300 cars rolled off the assembly line Wednesday (21 July) after 35 years of production. The car became a symbol of communism in Eastern Europe, with nearly two million vehicles built since August 1969. The car, a version of the Renault 12, underwent only a few minor facelifts over the years. It is being discontinued to make room for Dacia's new model, the 5,000-euro Logan. The company, now owned by Renault, posted record sales last year. (AFP - 21/07/04)

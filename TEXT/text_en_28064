BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Chamber of Deputies approved a bill late on Tuesday (October 19th) slicing the VAT for basic food products from 24% to 5%, in violation of Bucharest's agreement with the IMF. Some lawmakers from the senior ruling Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) said they'd made a mistake and need clarifications to correct the error. The bill on cutting the VAT on food products was initiated by the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD), which argues that although basic food products are more than 50% of the entire food category, the budget will not be negatively affected. They argue the decrease in revenues will be offset by less tax evasion. Procedurally, the measure moves next to the president for promulgation and then enforcement, but he is expected to send the legislation back to parliament for reconsideration.

ATHENS, Greece -- The EU must keep its doors open to Turkey, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said during a visit to Athens on Monday (December 4th). He voiced opposition to setting any new conditions for Turkey's accession, but stressed that Ankara "must understand that progress in the accession negotiations depends on progress in fulfilling the criteria and conditions agreed with the EU".
Prodi also said problems in the accession process must be resolved via negotiations, adding that he supported the European Commission's (EC) efforts to resolve a stalemate over Cyprus. Last week, the EC recommended a partial suspension of accession talks, following Ankara's refusal to open its naval and air space to traffic from Cyprus, an EU member.
Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, meanwhile, reiterated that his country supports Turkey's EU membership bid. However, he added, Ankara has not met its obligations. (Kathimerini, Sabah - 05/12/06; ANSA, ERT, ANA-MPA, AFP - 04/12/06)

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- A UN bomb disposal expert died on Wednesday (October 28th) while trying to remove a mine southeast of Nicosia. The death of Femisberto Novele, a Mozambique national, is the first accident of this type since mine-clearing activities began five years ago in the so-called "green line" that separates the northern and southern parts of the island. UN peacekeeping forces are monitoring the 180km-long stretch. (DPA, AP, Reuters - 28/10/09)

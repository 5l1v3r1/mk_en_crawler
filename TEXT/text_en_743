Industrial growth in the Federation of BiH (FBiH) slowed from 7.9 per cent year-on-year in February to 5.9 per cent year-on-year in March, according to the latest data from the FBiH statistical bureau.

Statistical reports in the other BiH entity, Republika Srpska (RS), showed that RS industrial production decreased from 23.9 per cent year-on-year in February to 17.2 per cent year-on-year in March, mainly because of poorer performance in the mining and utility sectors.

NEW YORK, United States -- The UN special envoy for Kosovo status talks, Martti Ahtisaari, told the UN Security Council on Thursday (13 July) that negotiations would move to a more advanced stage soon, according to a UN press release. Speaking at a closed-door meeting, Ahtisaari briefed members of the Council about the progress achieved in the UN-mediated talks between Belgrade and Pristina since February and confirmed that the negotiations must shift from a technical level to a senior political level. The first such meeting is expected by the end of the month. 
In a speech to the full Council, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica reiterated that Belgrade is prepared to accept a compromise solution, but would reject an imposed solution, such as independence. He also accused the international community of neglecting the UN standards set for the province. (Blic, Politika - 14/07/06; UN Web site, RTS, Tanjug - 13/07/06)

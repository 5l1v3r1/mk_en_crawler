NEW YORK, United States -- Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat voiced disappointment Friday (September 25th) with Cypriot President Demetris Christofias' speech to the UN General Assembly. "He destroyed everything that was achieved during the [reunification] talks," Talat told a press conference in New York. "I offered to him a trilateral meeting with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon but he refused. They were afraid that thus the Cypriot issue would attract too much attention among the international community," Talat said, ahead of a meeting Monday with Ban. In his speech last week, Christofias said that "despite our common efforts, the Turkish Cypriot side, supported by Turkey, continues to present positions and proposals which lead us outside the framework of the UN resolutions on Cyprus."
Last week, relations between leaders of the two communities took a negative turn over their differing views on Turkish settlers. Greek Cypriots insist that the island could be reunified only if the Turkish settlers return to Turkey. Last Wednesday, however, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan met in New York with Christofias and told him that the settlers will not leave Cyprus.

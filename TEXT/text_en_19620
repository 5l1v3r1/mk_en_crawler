BELGRADE, Serbia -- Labour and Social Affairs Minister Rasim Ljajic promised on Thursday (November 22nd) that the government would act to improve conditions in institutions for the mentally disabled. A report last week by Mental Disability Rights International (MDRI) catalogued serious deficiencies in the treatment of children and adults with disabilities in Serbia, including deplorable conditions in some facilities. Ljajic acknowledged that many of the findings were true, and blamed the shortcomings on inadequate medical personnel and overcrowded hospitals. But he rejected allegations by MDRI that the state was deliberately dumping disabled children into institutions. (Reuters, AFP, Focus - 22/11/07)

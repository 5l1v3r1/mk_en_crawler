BUCHAREST, Romania -- The two chambers of parliament announced results Tuesday (6 May) from declarations submitted under the recently adopted anti-corruption package. A total of 152 out of 344 members of the two chambers declared having posts in companies. According to the anti-corruption law, they must leave the business sector by 5 July to retain their seats in parliament. Another 14 lawmakers requested clarifications, as they have posts in non-profit institutions. The law aims to break alleged links between corporate interests and politics. Opposition parties say it will not reduce corruption. (Mediafax, Rompres, Nine O'Clock - 7/05/03)

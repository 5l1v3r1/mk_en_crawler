TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament decided on Thursday (October 25th) to establish a special commission to investigate the activities of General Prosecutor Theodhori Sollaku. The panel was established at the request of 28 ruling coalition MPs, despite protests by the opposition. President Bamir Topi called for Sollaku's removal earlier this month, citing alleged inefficiency and links to organised crime. The commission will have a month to complete its investigation and submit its findings to the president. (Shekulli, Shqip, Panorama, Kohajone - 26/10/07; Balkanweb, Top-Channel - 25/10/07)

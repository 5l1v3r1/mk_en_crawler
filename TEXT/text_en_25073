PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu blamed the international community's strategy for the situation in the Serb-dominated north Thursday (October 29th). "The problems in the north have been present for ten years now due to the situation that was created at the beginning [1999], or due to objective circumstances created due to the lack of efficiency of international structures, and the evil acts of parallel structures," Sejdiu said in his annual speech to students at the Judicial Faculty at the University of Pristina. He added that the international community's strategy is to avoid provocations and to go "step by step", while Kosovo's public wants to see more rapid developments. He noted however that the international community's authorities are in Kosovo to guarantee the young country's independence and sovereignty. (Koha Ditore, Express, Kohavision - 30/10/09)

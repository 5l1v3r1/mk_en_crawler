SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Four parties held a news conference in Sarajevo on Monday (December 20th) to present the platform for the future Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) government. Leaders of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the Party of Democratic Action, the Croatian Party of Rights of BiH, and the People's Party Progress through Work told reporters they have reached consensus on the programme document and formation of the entity government, as well as on their joint participation in the new state-level government, but not on the specific ministerial seat distribution. That will be agreed separately, they said. 
Zlatko Lagumdzija, leader of the SDP, which won the October 3rd general elections in FBiH, once again invited the HDZ 1990 to join the future coalition. The party however, has refused to comment for the time being. Lagumdzija also invited the main Serb parties to study the platform. (RTRS, Srna, Fena, BHRT - 20/12/10)

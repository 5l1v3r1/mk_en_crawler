WASHINGTON, United States -- State Department spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos denied on Thursday (August 23rd) speculation that the UN's plan for Kosovo's final status would turn the province into a NATO satellite state. "Calling the Ahtisaari plan for Kosovo a 'NATO state' is quite a stretch," Gallegos said, referring to recent statements by Serbia's Kosovo and Metohija Minister Slobodan Samardzic. Last week, he said NATO intended to make a "military state" out of Kosovo, one which would serve "their geopolitical and military strategic goals â¦ in the region". Earlier, Serbian Interior Minister Dragan Jocic accused NATO of planning to turn Kosovo into "its own puppet state".
Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko, Russia's envoy to the international troika overseeing the new status negotiations, said on Thursday that reaching an agreement between Belgrade and Pristina seems "unbelievably difficult". Kharchenko added that Moscow opposes setting any arbitrary time limits for resolving the status issue. Though the troika must file its report by December 10th, Russia says that should not necessarily mark the end of negotiations. (Bloomberg, AFP, RTK, Telegrafi, RFE - 23/08/07)

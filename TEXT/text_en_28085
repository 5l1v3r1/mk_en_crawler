STRASBOURG, France -- The Council of Europe's Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) on Tuesday (April 20th) urged deeper review of Turkey's anti-corruption legislation. In a report published in Strasbourg, the group criticised what it describes as insufficient control over party financing, as independent authorities do not monitor the bank accounts of political parties. "Most parties do not publish their accounts. In addition, the supervision of party finances -- currently performed by the Constitutional Court -- warrants further improvements," the report concludes.

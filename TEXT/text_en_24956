ANKARA, Turkey -- US President Barack Obama's Special Envoy for the Middle East George Mitchell has postponed a planned visit to Turkey as part of a regional tour, the US Embassy in Ankara said on Friday (January 30th). US Ambassador James Jeffrey cited technical reasons and said the decision is not related to Thursday's incident in Davos, where Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan stormed out of a debate on the Gaza Strip conflict with Israeli President Shimon Peres. Jeffrey did however describe that as an "unfortunate" development. As part of his Mideast tour, Mitchell visited several countries including Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Saudi Arabia to discuss possibilities for a cease-fire in Gaza and to promote Israeli-Palestinian peace. He was to visit Istanbul on Sunday.
In other news, the southern Turkish city of Antalya hosted a two-day international conference on security and co-operation that ended on Saturday. The event brought together NATO representatives, politicians, academics and media figures who discussed the future of the Alliance. The conference was considered a flagship event before the big NATO summit in April. (Anadolu news agency - 31/01/09; Hurriyet, Zaman - 30/01/09)

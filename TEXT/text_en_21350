TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha demanded a reform of the justice system Sunday (September 28th), saying judges and prosecutors accused of corruption have not faced trial. The news is not all bad, he noted, as the country's police have arrested 224 officials in the last three years. Corruption watchdog Transparency International ranks Albania as the Balkan country that improved most in fighting graft in 2008. (BBC, Top Channel, BalkanWeb - 29/09/08)

ATHENS, Greece -- Prosecutors filed charges Sunday (January 3rd) against five police officers who allegedly tortured a suspected thief. Three young policemen are suspected of abuse of power and torture, and two others are believed to have helped them harass a 30-year-old Chilean national being held at a police station in Athens. "The suspect suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital in Athens on Friday," a police spokesperson announced. Citizen Protection Minister Mihalis Chrysohoidis said those responsible will be punished. He added, "Anyone who believes they are not bound by the constitution and the laws in this country should not be a member of the police and of the security forces." (Reuters, ANA-MPA - 03/01/10)

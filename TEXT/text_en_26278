TIRANA, Albania -- Border police along Vlora's coastline seized two motorboats in an operation Saturday (October 10th). Lacking proper documents for sailing in Albanian waters, the dinghies were confiscated. Police patrols in the region have intensified since June, when the coast was re-opened for commercial use after a three-year ban enforced by the current Democratic Party rule. Albania's coastline has posed a serious problem since the early 1990s due to illegal immigration and drug smuggling. (ATSH, Shekulli, Lajme - 11/10/09)

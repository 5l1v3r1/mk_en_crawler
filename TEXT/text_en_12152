ANKARA, Turkey -- A small bomb exploded in a seaside resort on Sunday (10 July) injuring 20 people, including at least two foreign tourists. According to the police, the explosives were placed in a plastic bottle and dumped in a garbage can in the main square of Cesme, south of Izmir. A group calling itself the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons claimed responsibility for the attack. This is the group's second attack of the year. In April, a police officer was killed and four were injured in a blast in the Aegean resort town of Kusadasi. (Zaman - 11/07/05; AP, AFP, FT, The Guardian - 10/07/05)

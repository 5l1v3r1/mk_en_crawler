OTTAWA, Canada -- The customs and revenue agency on Thursday (11 September) imposed provisional tariffs on imports of hot-rolled carbon steel plate and high-strength low-alloy steel plate from Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Romania. The move followed an investigation by the agency that found these products were being sold at dumping prices. The Canadian International Trade Tribunal established that there is enough information to suggest that the products were being sold in Canada at prices lower than those in the exporters' home markets.

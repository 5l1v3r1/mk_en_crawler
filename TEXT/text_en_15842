ATHENS, Greece -- Greece and Turkey are due to hold their first-ever joint naval exercise in the Aegean, local media reported on Wednesday (20 September). Several frigates from both countries are expected to hold a brief communications drill on Saturday. Top military officers from the two countries met in July in a bid to ease tensions, following a midair collision between fighter planes shadowing each other over disputed waters in the Aegean.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Undersecretary for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns says all the Balkan countries have the chance to achieve great progress and ensure a better future, but must overcome problems from the past. In an interview in Tuesday's (7 June) Nezavisne novine, Burns reiterated that full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal remains the main condition for BiH's entry in the NATO Partnership for Peace programme. Burns is making a regional tour, with stops in Sarajevo, Pristina and Belgrade. In Sarajevo, he met with members of the BiH presidency and Prime Minister Adnan Terzic, and said Washington expects the country to complete crucial reforms and accelerate the economic reconstruction process. As for Kosovo, Burns said talks on final status must start in the autumn. (Nezavisne novine, The Guardian - 08/06/05; Fena, B92 - 07/06/05)

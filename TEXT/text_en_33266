SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Authorities in Republika Srpska (RS) have handed over eight detainees charged with human trafficking and sexual exploitation to the BiH State Court in Sarajevo, the RS Interior Ministry announced Saturday (10 May). The list of suspects includes Milorad Milakovic, owner of several nightclubs that have been frequently raided by the NATO-led Stabilisation Force and RS police in actions against prostitution. This was the first case transferred from RS authorities to the state-level judicial body, which was established last year with a decision by High Representative Paddy Ashdown.

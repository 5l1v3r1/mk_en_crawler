SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The cabinet on Thursday (29 April) is expected to endorse draft law changes providing for looser supervision of the country's privatisation process. The changes include eliminating supervisory boards of the privatisation commission and the post-privatisation agency. The panels would report directly to the cabinet, which would be responsible for endorsing draft privatisation contracts.
In other news, European Integration Minister Meglena Kuneva said Wednesday that accession talks with the EU might extend beyond the end of June deadline. She attributed the delay to technical factors, insisting there is no disagreement on issues and that the planned 2007 accession date would not be affected.

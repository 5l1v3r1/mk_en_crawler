BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos said Thursday (16 October) that a possible Cypriot veto of Turkey's EU accession negotiations would be unwise. According to Papadopoulos, veto is the business of superpowers and would be unconvincing if it came from a small country like Cyprus. He added that a Turkey that complies with EU norms is in the interest of Cyprus. In response, Turkish Prime Minister Recap Tayyip Erdogan said the UN proposal for resolving the dispute over Cyprus is negotiable. (Anadolu Agency, NTV, TRT 2 - 16/10/03)

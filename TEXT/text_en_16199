SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Sofia City Court acquitted former Sofia Mayor Stefan Sofianski of abuse of office charges Wednesday (14 June), stemming from a 1998 deal to build a retail centre in the capital. The court said there was no evidence the 4.5m Euros deal with an Israeli investor had violated the law or had resulted in damages to the municipality. Sofianski, now a member of parliament, still faces charges stemming from three other real estate deals. (Monitor, Novinar - 15/06/06; Darik, Mediapool, bTV - 14/06/06)

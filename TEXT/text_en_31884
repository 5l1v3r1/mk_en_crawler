STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- A Swedish Defence Research study released Tuesday (29 October), showed 21 Swedish soldiers had lower levels of uranium in urine samples when they left Kosovo than when they arrived six months earlier. In most cases, the levels dropped by as much as 90 per cent. Researchers attributed the higher initial readings to food sold in Sweden. All levels of uranium, however, were well within safety limits. The study backed earlier findings that depleted uranium munitions used during the Kosovo conflict could not have affected the health of the local population or international peacekeepers.

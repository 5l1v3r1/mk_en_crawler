SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Lab tests conducted in Britain indicate that the bird flu virus detected in the Bulgarian village of Slanchogled last month was not of the highly pathogenic H5 or H7 strains that are dangerous to humans. The agriculture ministry issued a statement Tuesday (8 August), saying the British lab confirmed initial findings that the birds had the Newcastle disease virus and a low pathogenic avian influenza virus. A 21-day quarantine on Slanchogled is to be lifted Thursday. (BNR, Mediapool - 08/08/06)

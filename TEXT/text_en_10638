BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- During a meeting Monday (11 October), Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic and the commander of KFOR, Lieutenant General Yves de Kermabon, discussed the possible removal of the air security zone along Kosovo's administrative border. De Kermabon also reportedly promised that KFOR would work to ensure the peaceful conduct of the 23 October parliamentary elections in Kosovo. 
In other news, local media reported Monday that a Serb formation -- Serb List for Kosovo and Metohija -- has submitted a list of nominees to run in the elections. The list, endorsed by UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen, now awaits certification by Kosovo's election commission. Meanwhile, a new survey by the Kosovo Institute for Ethnic Relations suggests significant voter apathy ahead of the vote. (Danas - 12/10/04; Tanjug, B92, FoNet, KosovaLive, Beta - 11/10/04)

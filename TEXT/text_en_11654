PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- German Defence Minister Peter Struck started a two-day visit to his country's troops in the Balkans on Monday (21 March). He urged Kosovo's politicians to seek reconciliation, arguing that foreign "military engagement in Kosovo would be hard to justify if Serbian enclaves were protected without any will on the part of Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to live together in peace." Struck visits Bosnia and Herzegovina on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, NATO's Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe, General John Reith, visited Bucharest on Monday for talks with Romanian Defence Minister Teodor Atanasiu. Tuesday, Reith visits neighbouring Bulgaria. (Rompres, Adevarul, Dnevnik - 22/03/05; DW - 21/03/05)

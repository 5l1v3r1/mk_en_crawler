ATHENS, Greece -- Parliament adopted the country's budget for 2011 early Thursday (December 23rd), which aims to trim the deficit to 7.4% of GDP from around 9.4% this year and envisions further cuts and austerity measures, recommended by the EU and the IMF. More than 2,000 people joined a rally outside the parliament building in Athens on Wednesday, demanding that the government abandon plans to restructure state-owned companies. Joining them were employees in local administration and cleaning companies. Public transport workers continue their strike Thursday. (AFP, Reuters, ANA-MPA, BBC - 23/12/10)

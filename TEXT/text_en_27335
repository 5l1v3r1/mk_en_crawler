BELGRADE, Serbia -- The public prosecutor's office in Belgrade has completed an indictment against former Serbia and Montenegro Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic, charging him with abuse of office, the Belgrade-based daily Danas reported on Monday (May 31st). The charges stem from a contract to rent a spy satellite from an Israeli company at unfavourable rates. Earlier this month, Serbia lost a legal battle over the deal and will have to pay 36m euros in damages for violating the contract. Davinic signed it in 2005, allegedly without consulting the government. The cabinet decided on Friday to declassify 30 documents related to the so-called "Satellite" affair and to establish a commission to negotiate with Israel to reduce the compensation.

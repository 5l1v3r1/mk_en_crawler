TIRANA, Albania -- Albania's ruling Democratic Party and the opposition Socialist Party agreed to extend the mandate of the parliamentary commission on electoral reforms, which was to have expired Monday (December 17th). According to one of the co-chiefs of the commission, Socialist lawmaker Kastriot Islami, the commission will finish its job in the next three months. Both the ruling party and the opposition are trying to avoid a deadlock in electoral reform, a key condition for joining NATO and the EU. (Balkanweb, Top-Channel â 16/12/07)

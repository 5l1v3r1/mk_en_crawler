PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu made clear on Saturday (September 25th) he has no intention of resigning despite a Friday ruling by the Constitutional Court which concluded the president violated the constitution by holding office and the leadership of his Democratic League of Kosovo party simultaneously. The ruling means Sejdiu could be dismissed by parliament. The request for proceedings at the Constitutional Court was launched by 31 lawmakers. Dismissing a president requires two-thirds backing of the 120 lawmakers in parliament. Sejdiu said on Friday he does not think he violated the constitution and will comment on the court's ruling once he studies it. (MIA - 25/09/10; AP, Koha Ditore - 24/09/10)

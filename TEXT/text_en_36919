SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament approved amendments to the law against corruption on Friday (2 July). It envisions the establishment of an anti-corruption commission to draft policy and oversee the implementation of measures. During the debate, Parliament Speaker Ljupco Jordanovski insisted that the measure be passed in two stages, as some parts require additional discussion.
In other news, local media reported on Saturday that supporters of former Prime Minister and former leader of the VMRO-DPMNE party, Ljupco Georgievski, plan to establish a new party called VMRO-People's Party. Georgievski had a falling out with VMRO-DPMNE leaders months ago. (Dnevnik, Utrinski Vesnik - 03/07/04; MIA, Makfax - 02/07/04)

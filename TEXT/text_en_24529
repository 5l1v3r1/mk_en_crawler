SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country needs ten years and 400m euros to clear about 220,000 mines left over from the 1992-1995 conflict, the BiH Mine Action Centre announced on Monday (April 6th). "The government hopes that one third of the money -- 125m euros will be provided through donors by 2019, mostly from the governments of the US, Canada, Austria, Germany, Norway and Sweden. The rest of the money will be provided by the government of BiH and other countries," centre spokeswoman Svetlana Trifkovic announced. Explosions of undiscovered mines have killed 468 people and injured 1,818 since 1996. (MIA, BTA - 06/04/09)

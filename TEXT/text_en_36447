BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The newly-appointed chief of the Republika Srpska (RS) Army's General Staff, Major General Novak Djukic, said Wednesday (11 August) that BiHâ€™s admission to NATO's Partnership for Peace programme is a top priority. According to Djukic, the entity's army has met all commitments, including military staff downsizing, and the education and training of army officers is in line with NATO standards. Djukic also confirmed that a new organisational structure has been implemented, following the reduction of RS troop strength from 6,000 to 4,000 as part of the BiH defence reform.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- EU membership remains Turkey's primary foreign policy issue, chief negotiator Egemen Bagis reiterated on Monday (June 7th), as the country began hosting a Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia. Heads of state from Russia, Iran, Iraq, and Azerbaijan are attending, among others. Opening the conference in Istanbul, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu called on Israel to accept a UN-supervised investigation into last week's deadly raid on a Turkish-led flotilla of ships carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza. The UN's Human Rights Commission has called for the probe, with the inclusion of one Turkish and one Israeli official. (Zaman - 08/06/10; AP - 07/06/10)

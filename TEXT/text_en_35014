BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal said on Sunday (7 December) that it was launching legal proceedings to force retired General Pavle Strugar to appear before the UN court. He and three other former Yugoslav Army officers were indicted for the 1991 shelling of Dubrovnik, Croatia. He surrendered to the tribunal last year and was released pending trial. Strugar failed to respond to two court summonses last week because of poor health. He was then transferred to a military hospital in Belgrade. The tribunal has asked Belgrade to make sure that he appears before judges in The Hague on Tuesday. Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic told reporters that failing to respond to the order would hurt Serbia-Montenegro's credibility.
On Friday, Svilanovic insisted that the Serbian government is doing all it can to locate war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic. Detention of the former Bosnian-Serb army commander is a major condition for unfreezing aid to Serbia. (AFP, Beta, BBC, B92, Tanjug - 07/12/03)

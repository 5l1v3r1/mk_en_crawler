ANKARA, Turkey -- Addressing parliament on Friday (23 May), Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said his government is about to propose a package of laws intended to address EU concerns about human rights in Turkey. The European Commission is due to examine a report on Turkey's bid in December 2004 before deciding on a date for the start of negotiations.
Gul said that in many cases, the critics of Turkey's human rights record are right, as the new laws are not always implemented properly. He was referring to a recent EU statement, which pointed to a "yawning gap" between theory and actual practice. The new laws to be introduced in the coming months would provide for more freedom of expression and religion. An old law banning activism for Kurdish rights would be revoked.
Turkey received another warning on Friday when Luigi Vinci, an Italian member of the European Parliament, said a decision by a local court to keep four Kurdish deputies in jail could harm Ankara's bid for EU membership. Vinci was an observer in the highly publicised retrial of the four lawmakers, who have been in prison since 1994 for ties to the banned Kurdish Workers Party. The European human rights court in Strasbourg ruled that they had not had a fair trial. (AFP - 23/05/03)

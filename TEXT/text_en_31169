BELGRADE, Serbia -- Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac urged lawmakers Thursday (December 2nd) to support a proposal that would end obligatory military service, as a component of far-reaching army reform. "The vast majority of our citizens are in favour of the army becoming a professional force," Sutanovac said, explaining that the government will find a way to provide benefits for everyone who decides to join the army voluntarily. In response, opposition nationalist lawmaker Slobodan Samardzic accused Sutanovac of "pushing secret policies" towards joining NATO, despite the country's stated policy of military neutrality. He urged the government to call a referendum on whether Serbia should join the Alliance. (RTS, Blic, Press Online, AP - 02/12/10)

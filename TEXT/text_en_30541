SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria and Romania reiterated on Wednesday (February 16th) plans to join the EU's Schengen zone together, and rejected any additional requirements for their accession to the border-free area. In a joint declaration after a meeting in the border town of Rousse, Bulgarian and Romanian lawmakers said they would not accept "double standards" when it comes to conditions to join the zone. Bucharest and Sofia hoped to become part of Schengen in March, but now face a delay over objections raised by some EU members. (BTA, BNT, Standart, 24 Chasa - 16/02/11)

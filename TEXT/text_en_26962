THE HAGUE, the Netherlands -- Serbia filed a lawsuit Monday (January 4th) against Croatia at The Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ), claiming that genocide was committed against Croatia's ethnic Serb population between 1991 and 1995. The document cites atrocities committed in Gospic, Sisak, Karlovac, Osijek, Medacki Dzep and during the Croatian army's Operation Storm. Serbia was responding to a similar lawsuit that Croatia filed in the same court in 1999, claiming that Serbian attacks during the conflict amounted to genocide.
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said Belgrade had no choice but to file the counter lawsuit. "We are aware that we are now entering a new phase in relations with Croatia, but we still want to co-operate with that country in the process of European integration, just as we want peace and stability in the western Balkans," he stressed.

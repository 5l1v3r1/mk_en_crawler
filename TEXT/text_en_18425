PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prime Minister Zeljko Sturanovic met with visiting Croatian counterpart Ivo Sanader on Friday (January 12th) and announced the opening of a new page in bilateral ties, based in part on the joint goals of EU and NATO accession. This was the first official visit by any prime minister since the breakup of the former Serbia-Montenegro state union. During his stay, the Croatian embassy in Podgorica was formally opened. Bilateral agreements on co-operation in the fields of EU integration and foreign affairs were signed, as was an accord between the Croatian and Montenegrin chambers of commerce.

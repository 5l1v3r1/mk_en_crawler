ZVORNIK, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH-based International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) on Tuesday (16 August) unveiled a new method of locating and mapping mass graves, combining satellite imagery and soil resilience techniques. The method, initiated at the site of a grave near Zvornik, was developed by a team of UK and US researchers, commissioned by the ICMP. They explored 16 different mass gravesites in eastern BiH and found common characteristics to help locate other hidden sites. 
In other news Tuesday, the Republika Srpska (RS) government said a sub-panel of the Srebrenica Commission -- tasked with scrutinising the activities of the RS Defence Ministry in relation to the Srebrenica massacre probe -- adopted and submitted a report to High Representative Paddy Ashdown, as required. No other details were provided. (ICMP Web site, Fena, OHR Sources, RS Government Web site - 16/08/05)

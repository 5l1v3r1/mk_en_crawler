BUCHAREST, Romania -- EU Commissioner for Enlargement Olli Rehn said Thursday (6 April) that Romania made considerable progress over the past year in terms of accession. He added, however, that he expects hard evidence over the next weeks that reforms would continue. Meeting with Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu and other officials, Rehn noted that this was the last evaluation visit before the release of a monitoring report that will recommend whether or not Romania should join the EU in 2007, or see its membership delayed one year.
While indicating that he would recommend Romania's admission on schedule, Rehn was more cautious about Bulgaria. Sofia, he said, slowed the pace of reforms at the end of 2004 and early in 2005. EU experts are working to help Bulgaria reform its judiciary. 
In other news Thursday, British Home Secretary Charles Clarke said his government has not decided yet whether to open its labour market to Bulgarian and Romanian workers when the two countries join the EU. He acknowledged, however, that allowing workers from eight new EU member-states to get jobs in the United Kingdom has benefited the British economy.

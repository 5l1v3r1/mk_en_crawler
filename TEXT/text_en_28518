TIRANA, Albania -- The government will establish a special structure to deal with repatriated citizens from Europe, a key condition set before the EU offers Albania visa-free travel. During a cabinet meeting Tuesday (June 15th), Prime Minister Sali Berisha said that there is an Albanian-specific issue related to repatriation, a reference to Albanians from Macedonia and Serbia who applied for asylum in some EU countries after Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro were included in the Schengen white list. Before Brussels makes a decision, Albania has to boost efforts in the fight against corruption and implement a law that would allow officials to seize the assets of criminals.

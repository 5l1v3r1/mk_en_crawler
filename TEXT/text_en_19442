TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament's session Thursday (March 27th) was marred by angry accusations between the ruling Democratic Party and the opposition over an arms deal the New York Times covered in detail Wednesday. The paper, which was investigating Pentagon contracts, said Albanian officials had closed shady weapons deals with the US-based firm AEY. The Pentagon suspended its contracts with the company earlier this week amid claims it was supplying decades-old ammunition to the Afghan army. The defence ministry rejected the claims by the newspaper, saying the contract with the company was approved by the US Defence Department and military intelligence services.
Opposition MPs also accused Prime Minister Sali Berisha of endangering Albania's NATO membership bid by supporting trafficking and corruption networks. Socialist Party leader Edi Rama called on Berisha to resign as soon as possible, saying "he has shamed Albania". Berisha denied the accusations.

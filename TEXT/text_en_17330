TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha named Transport and Telecommunication Minister Lulzim Basha as the new foreign minister Wednesday (April 25th), following the surprise resignation of Besnik Mustafaj earlier this week. Berisha also named senior Democratic Party official Sokol Olldashi as Basha's replacement at the Transport Ministry. Olldashi previously served as interior minister and lost his bid for mayor of Tirana in elections earlier this year.

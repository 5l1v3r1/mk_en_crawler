Access to free and independent media continued to decline across the globe in 2010 to reach its lowest point in more than a decade, the US-based watchdog Freedom House said in a report published on Monday (May 2nd), the eve of World Press Freedom Day. 
One of the main findings of the survey was that "only 15% of the global population -- one in six people -- live in countries where coverage of political news is robust, the safety of journalists is guaranteed, state intrusion in media affairs is minimal, and the press is not subject to onerous legal or economic pressures." 
While Guinea, Niger and Moldova were cited as the countries that showed "impressive openings" in 2010, there were "significant declines in press freedom" in another eight, including Egypt, Honduras, Hungary, Mexico, South Korea, Thailand, Turkey, and Ukraine. 
The report also noted the increasing violence and physical harassment directed at the press. 
"A country where journalists cannot report freely without fear of interference, by the government or other actors, has little hope of achieving or maintaining true democracy," Freedom House Executive Director David J. Kramer said. 
The report assesses the level of press freedom in 196 countries and territories in the world on the basis of 23 methodology questions. Based on their scores -- from 0 (best) to 100 (worst) -- countries are then classified as "free" (1-30 points), "partly free" (31-60), or "not free" (61-100). 
Sixty-eight countries, or 35% of all those surveyed last year were rated as "free". With a best global score of ten points, Finland topped the watchdog's 2011 press freedom index. Norway and Sweden shared second place, with 11 points each. Only two Southeast European (SEE) countries were placed in that group. 
Based on its score of 22 points, Cyprus was ranked 36th, along with Lithuania, Malta and Slovakia. Greece, Guyana, Hungary and Samoa, with 30 points each, shared the 65th position in the 2011 index. 
The other 11 SEE nations were all placed among the 65 "partly free" countries, or 33% of all 196 surveyed last year. 
Serbia fared best among countries in the region. With a score of 33 points, up from 35 last year, it tied for 72nd in the world, along with Benin and South Africa. 
Bulgaria, East Timor and India, shared the 77th position, followed by Montenegro in the 80th. Croatia tied for 85th, along with Burkina Faso. Romania came next in the 87th, together with El Salvador. Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Macedonia were ranked 96th, along with Comoros, Lesotho and Tanzania, while Albania shared the 102nd slot with Maldives. Kosovo tied with Argentina for the 104, while Turkey was placed 112th with Bangladesh, Congo (Brazzaville), Kenya, Senegal and Uganda. Moldova fared worst among the SEE countries. It was ranked 118th in the world along with Georgia and Malawi. 
Albania, BiH, Bulgaria and Montenegro all received the same scores as last year, while Croatia, Macedonia and Turkey received scores that were between one and three points lower than those in 2010. Romania and Kosovo improved their scores by one and two points, respectively, while Moldova's new mark of 55 points was ten points better than last year.

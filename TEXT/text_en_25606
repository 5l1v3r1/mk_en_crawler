SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Police announced on Thursday (October 22nd) the arrest of a couple suspected of trafficking pregnant women to Greece, where the newborns were later sold for about 8,000 euros apiece. Investigators say roughly two-thirds of the money went to the mothers, mostly Roma women. The married couple allegedly provided financial support to the women, which allowed them to give birth in Greek hospitals, and paid local lawyers to organise the babies' adoption by Greek families. 
The husband was arrested while trying to cross the Greek border Sunday and the wife was detained on Wednesday in the town of Nova Zagora, near the village of Lyubenova Mahala, where the couple lived. Police say they started their "business" about eight years ago, selling four to five babies a year. (Vima - 23/10/09; BBC, Focus, Standart, BNT - 22/10/09)

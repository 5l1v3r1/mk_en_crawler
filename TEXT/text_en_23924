PRISTINA, Kosovo --The Kosovo Police Service (KPS) has severely beaten prisoners, the Council of Europe said in a report published on Tuesday (January 20th), denouncing the treatment as torture. Members of the Council's Committee for the Prevention of Torture, who visited police stations, prisons and psychiatric hospitals in Kosovo in March 2007, documented their findings. "The allegations mainly concerned punches, slaps and kicks by ... Kosovo police officers attempting to obtain confessions from criminal prisoners," the report said. "Further, a number of detained persons alleged that KPS officers had exerted psychological pressure on them" not to lodge complaints, it added. 
In other news, EU special representative in Kosovo Pieter Feith and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana agreed on Tuesday that Kosovo should not hold general elections this year because of political and economic reasons. President Fatmir Sejdiu wants to hold the next general vote in 2011, which the opposition says is totalitarian.
Meanwhile, Pristina officially disbanded the Kosovo Protection Corps at midnight on Tuesday, giving way to the new Security Force, which became effective minutes later. The recruitment campaign for civilians starts on Wednesday. (Zeri, Koha Ditore, Express, Telegrafi, Kosova Sot - 21/01/09; CPT website - 20/01/09)

ATHENS, Greece -- Four people were killed and nearly 40 injured when a passenger train collided with a truck near the northern Greek town of Drama on Sunday (16 April) evening. The train was travelling from Thessaloniki to Alexandroupolis when the truck slammed into the middle carriages, causing a derailment. The truck driver --who reportedly ignored a crossing signal -- and his passenger were among the dead. Rescue teams spent hours freeing passengers trapped in the wreckage. This was Greece's second deadly train accident in less than a month. (ANA, Focus, Reuters, AP - 17/04/06)

VIENNA, Austria -- A court in Salzburg on Monday (May 9th) green-lighted former Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader's extradition to Zagreb. His lawyers, however, vowed to appeal the ruling. Sanader has been in Austrian custody since December when he was arrested for suspected criminal actions and abuse of power in Croatia. He refuses to be extradited to his homeland claiming he would not get a fair trial there. (HRT, Vecernji List, Nova TV - 09/05/11)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic said on Thursday (October 16th) that problems in relations with Montenegro and Macedonia "cannot be allowed to last indefinitely". Serbia wants the best possible relations with its neighbours, Tadic told the daily Vecernje Novosti. "Being anti-Montenegrin or anti-Serb is not only pointless in a historical context, but also dangerous," he warned. "After the recognition of Kosovo's independence by the Montenegrin government, the result is that Serbian and Montenegrin children cannot travel to Montenegro or Serbia for a field trip, which is the height of stupidity." He stressed, however, that implementing diplomatic measures against Montenegro and Macedonia -- after both decided to recognise Kosovo's independence -- was "the right thing to do".

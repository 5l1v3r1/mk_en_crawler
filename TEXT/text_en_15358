PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The independence of Montenegro might be declared next week, President Filip Vujanovic told AFP on Sunday (28 May), in remarks widely reported by local media. He predicted that talks on splitting from Serbia would begin shortly after that. As for immediate consequences of Montenegro's independence, Vujanovic explained that authority over the Serbian-Montenegrin Supreme Defence Council would be transferred to the presidents of the two republics. The final results of the 21 May referendum are expected this week. Preliminary results suggest 55.5 per cent voted for independence, just above the 55 per cent required threshold. Montenegro's unionists, led by Predrag Bulatovic, have written a letter to the EU disputing the results and insisting the vote was marred by irregularities.
Meanwhile, Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic meets with EU security chief Javier Solana and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn in Brussels on Monday, focusing on post-referendum steps that must be taken. Afterwards, Rehn goes to Belgrade where he will discuss the referendum, negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, and the Kosovo status talks.

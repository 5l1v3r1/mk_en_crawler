Please provide quantitative and/or qualitative information as appropriate on the following: a) development of the average gross and net wages; b) the determination of government wages and employment; c) the share of taxes in the total wage bill, including social contributions paid by employers and employees, and the bracket structure of income taxes; d) the pass on of labour productivity improvements to the compensation of employees. 

) Development of the average gross and net salaries 
The State Statistical Office calculates (and publishes) data on average salary per employee in the Republic of Macedonia. Until 1999 only data on net salary was calculated, and from 1999 the State Statistical Office calculates and publishes data on gross salary data as well. Hence, according to the State Statistical Office the current situation regarding average gross and net salaries is as follows:  
1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 VIII/2004 I-VIII/2004 Average monthly gross salary (in MKD) 16.939 17.952 17.886 19.025 19.950 21.036  20.645 Average monthly net salary (in MKD) 8.817 9.063 9.394 9.664 10.193 10.552 11.279 11.824 12.443  12.222 Source: State Statistical Office 
b) the determination of government wages and employment  The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia stipulates that execution of employees’ rights and their status is to be regulated by law and collective agreements. Article 69 of the Labour Relations Laws (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 80/1993) also stipulates that salaries should be calculated according to criteria determined by law and collective agreements. One part of the employees in public (government) institutions has a civil servants status with salaries calculated according to the Law on Civil Servants.  The Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 59/2000, 112/2000, 34/2001, 103/2001, 43/2002, 98/2002, 17/2003, 40/2003, 85/2003 and 17/2004) also regulates the status, rights, duties and responsibilities of civil servants, as well as the system of calculation of salaries and remuneration for the civil servants.  Civil servants are employed on the basis of a public advertisement pursuant to the Law on Civil Servants. All other employees in public (government) authorities are employed pursuant to the Labour Relations Laws (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 80/2003 – consolidated version) on the basis of public advertisement, unless otherwise specified by this or another law.  Pursuant to this law civil servants, are persons employed in state administration institutions and the professional stuff of: the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, the President of the Republic of Macedonia, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia, the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia, the courts, the State Judicial Council, the Ombudsman Office and the Public Prosecutor’s Office.  The provisions of the Law on Civil Servants do not apply to military and civil persons in the service of the Army of the Republic of Macedonia, the uniformed staff in the Ministry of Interior, penitentiary and correction institutions, the forest police, the court police, the financial police and the Customs Administration, the persons with special duties and authorisations employed in the Ministry of Interior, Intelligence Agency, Customs Administration, the authorised state auditors and the persons performing state audit tasks in the State Audit Office, as well as the aviation and expert staff in the Civil Aviation Authority who perform duties and tasks related to air transport safety.  The law defines the components of the salary, which comprises of:   Basic component and  Additional component. The basic component consists of:   Basic net salary related to the degree of education based on the determined number of points;   Occupation related salary supplement (each occupation brings certain number of points);   Career related salary supplement, which depends on fulfilment of certain conditions by each employee, such as minimal tenure in the civil service and positive performance, in accordance with the criteria determined by Law.  The additional component consists of:   Salary supplement related to special work conditions (night work, shift work, high risk work, work during weekends and work during national holidays and    Additional wage allowance (overtime). The law also stipulates a valuation of the working experience of the civil servant, in the amount of 0,5% of the part of the basic salary related to the degree of education, for each started year of work tenure, but not more than 20% in total. Thus, pursuant to the Law on Civil Servants the amount of the net salary is determined depending on the job position occupied by the civil servant and the value of the points. The value of the point is determined by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. Payment of salaries pursuant to the Law on Civil Servants started in April 2004, and full harmonisation shall be carried out in a period of 24 months.  Salaries of the military and non-military (civil) persons in the service of the Army of the Republic of Macedonia are regulated by the Law on Military Service in the Army of the Republic of Macedonia in the Republic of Macedonia ("Official Gazette of RM” No. 62/2002, 98/2002, 25/2003, 71/2003). Pursuant to this law, the salary comprises a basic salary and supplements to the basic salary. The basic salary of the professional soldiers and military officials is determined according to the rank and duty, whereby certain numbers of points are awarded. The basic salary for the civil persons is determined according to the degree of education related to the job position of the employee, the duty, the working experience, army supplement and career supplement. The Law stipulates that the army supplement is 30% of the basic salary according to rank and duty, where as for the civil persons this supplement is 20% and is calculated on the basis of the basic salary related to degree of education. The working experience is valued by 0,5% of the part of the basic salary according to rank and duty for each started year of working tenure, up to 25 years of working tenure, and 0,75% after the 25year, but not exceeding 20% in total. The salary supplement related to working tenure for civil persons in the service of the army is calculated by 0,5% for each year of working tenure, but not exceeding 20% in total. The value of points, pursuant to the Law on Military Service in the Army of the Republic of Macedonia, is determined by the funds for salaries and benefits allocated in the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia and the number of points for salaries and benefits.  Payment of the salaries of the elected and appointed persons in the Government bodies is done pursuant to the Law on Payment of Salaries in the Republic of Macedonia and Other Benefits of Members of Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia and Other Elected and Appointed Persons in Republic of Macedonia ("Official Gazette of RM" No. 36/1990, 44/1990, 11/1991, 38/1991 and 23/1997). The amount of the salary is determined by multiplying the principal with coefficient determined for each position and this amount is increased by a percentage related to working experience (0.5% for each year of working tenure, but not more than 20% in total). The principal for the calculation of the salary is the average wage per employee in the Republic of Macedonia. However, due to implementation of the Law on Payment of Salaries in the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 70/1994, 62/1995, 33/1997, 50/2001, 26/2002 and 46/2002) the value of the principal in the past has become lower than the average wage per employee in the Republic of Macedonia and has not changed, i.e. the salaries of the elected and appointed persons have been frozen.   In governmental bodies where neither the Law on Civil Servants nor the Law on Military Service in the Army of the Republic of Macedonia applies, the salaries are paid in the frames determined by the Law on Payment of Salaries in the Republic of Macedonia, with limits on the right for increasing the average wage per employee. Pursuant to this law, salaries in the past 10 years were not allowed to be increased, except for a certain correction in 2002. According to the Law on Payment of Salaries in the Republic of Macedonia, the maximal possible salary per employee is determined according to collective agreements or internal regulations for allocation of salaries, depending on complexity of duties and tasks of individual employee. Funds from the Budget for all employees that do not have the status of civil servants are provided on the basis of unified criteria, depending on the degree of education. Each entity allocates the provided funds on the basis of collective agreements or internal regulations for allocation of salaries.  In addition to the right to salary, the employees in the governmental agencies (civil servants, military and civil persons in the service of Army and all other employees which do not have the status of civil servants), have the right on:  Food bonus   Bonus for vacations;   Severance payment for retirement;   Financial assistance in case of death of the employee, members of closest family of employees, or severe natural disasters;   Travel to/from work expenses supplement;   Per-diems for business trips in the country and abroad;   Field-work supplement and for supplement for living and working outside of home environment;   Expenses for using private car for business (official) purposes. Due to the limitations when planning the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, the bonus for holidays has not been stipulated and therefore has not been paid in the last several years.  During the negotiations with the Trade Unions Association (TUA), it has been proposed that the aforementioned rights, related to the salaries of the employees, should no longer be an obligation of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia.   The funds for salaries in the Budget of Republic of Macedonia are planned on annual basis, taking into account the legal regulations for salaries and the economic situation in the country. Due to projected downsizing of the number of employees, paid within the Budget, a 4% decrease of funds for gross salaries in 2004 was stipulated. Projection of gross salaries of these categories of employees is based on projection of macroeconomic indicators provided in the Macroeconomic Policy and the Fiscal Strategy documents, enacted by the Government. The Fiscal Strategy for 2005 - 2007 incorporates current economic trends and execution of the Budget for 2004; the macroeconomic policy and macroeconomic indicators for 2005, 2006 and 2007; budget revenues; budget expenditures, as well as the budget deficit. Funds for gross salaries for employees in the government institutions in 2003 has increased due to implementation of the provisions of the Framework Agreement related to the employment of about 1.890 persons in the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Interior. The total number of employees in government institutions and other budget beneficiaries (legislative branch, judicial branch, education, child protection, social protection, science and culture), at the beginning of 2004, was 71.624 persons. This number does not comprise employees of (paid by) the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund, the Employment Agency and the Health Insurance Fund. As a result of the implemented reforms, in August 2004, this number was reduced to 70.138.  Out of the total expenditures, planned in the Rebalance of the Budget for 2004 (MKD 65.708.297.000), MKD 10.501.857.000 are net salaries for all budget beneficiaries, MKD 7.887.318.000 social contributions, MKD 2.351.241.000 benefits and other supplements (food, transportation, separatee living, per-diems) and MKD 538.633.000 are salary supplements (night shift, overtime, work during state holidays) – all totalling MKD 21.279.049.000. Projected gross salaries and benefits for the 2004 - 2006 period do not provide for increase of salaries, except for civil servants, due to the effect of the implementation of decompression of salaries and Public Administration Reform. Additional funds have been projected for the decompression of civil servants salaries as follows: Year Amount (in MKD) 2004 81.213.000 2005 392.530.000 2006 203.033.000 TOTAL: 676.776.000 Source: Ministry of Finance 

c) The share of taxes in the total wage bill, including social contributions paid by the employer and the employees and the bracket structure of personal taxes 
Personal income tax is calculated in accordance to the Personal Income Tax Law ("Official Gazette of RM” No. 80/1993, 3/1994, 70/1994, 71/1996, 28/1997, 8/2001, 50/2001, 52/2001, 2/2002, 44/2002 and 95/2004). The tax is calculated using a tax progression with three tax rates (15%, 18% and 24%) applied on a predetermined tax principal. The monthly tax base is determined by reducing the gross salary by the mandatory social contributions (21,2% for pension and disablement insurance, 9,2% for health insurance, 1,6% employment contributions) and personal tax exemption. The latter is revalued at the beginning of each year by the planned increase of the net salaries of employees in the Republic of Macedonia (for 2004 the annual personal exemption was D 2.770 and for 2005 it is MKD 2.880).  The tax rates are then applied on the determined monthly tax base: For a monthly base  Per rate Less than MKD 30.000 15%  30.000 to 60.000 MKD 4.500 MKD + 18% for the part of the income between MKD 30.000 and 60.000 Above 60.000 MKD 9.900 MKD + 24% for the part above 60.000 MKD Source: Ministry of Finance In the structure of the average monthly salary paid in the Republic of Macedonia in 2003, the taxes are as follows: Structure of taxes on the salaries calculated for an average net salary paid in RM in 2003 In MKD in % Gross salary  19.762 Contributions for pension and handicapped insurance  for pillar 1,  65% of the total amount for pillar 2, 35% of the total amount 2.723 1.467 21,2% Contributions for mandatory health insurance 1.818 9,2% Contributions for employment 316 1,6% Monthly personal exemptions 2.680 Personal income tax 1.614 8,2% Net salary 11.824 Net salary / expenditure of the employer 59,8% Contributions and taxes / expenditure of the employer 40,2% Source: Ministry of Finance 
In addition to the taxes and social contributions, the following contributions are applied to the gross salary as expenses to employers: contribution for water supply with a rate of 0,20% (this contribution is applied only to institutions and bodies where salaries are provided by the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia), and the additional contribution for injury at work or occupational disease at a rate of 0,50%.  The taxes and all contributions are calculated by the salary payer, at the time of payment of salary. The revenues from the personal income tax are revenues of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia until the end of 2004. Starting 01.01.2005, 3% of these revenues shall be revenues of the local self-government units, where the employee has permanent residence. The revenues from the social contributions paid from the salaries are revenues of the respective social (extra-budgetary) funds. In 2003, according to the data from the budget accounts receivable, a total of MKD 6.059.706.140 have been collected from income taxes.

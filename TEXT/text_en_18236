WASHINGTON, United States -- Romanian Foreign Minister Adrian Cioroianu met with US counterpart Condoleezza Rice and Pentagon officials on Wednesday (June 13th), telling them that his country is ready to boost the number of its troops deployed with the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. Romania already has 900 peacekeepers with the ISAF, but would be ready to send more, including officers to train Afghan troops, Cioroianu explained. He acknowledged that the future of the Romanian contingent in Iraq is uncertain, as public pressure to withdraw is high. (Mediapool, AFP, UPI - 14/06/07)

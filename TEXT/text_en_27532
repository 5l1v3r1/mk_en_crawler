BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Security and Information Agency (BIA) has received information that Serbian Progressive Party leader Tomislav Nikolic has been targeted for assassination. BIA Director Sasa Vukadinovic said on Tuesday (June 29th) that an investigation is under way. According to some media reports, Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj, who is on trial at The Hague, ordered Nikolic's assassination and sought the services of criminal Luka Bojovic. The tip allegedly came from Zemun Clan member Milos Simovic, who was arrested on June 11th after allegedly trying to kill another member of the crime gang, Sretko Kalinic.

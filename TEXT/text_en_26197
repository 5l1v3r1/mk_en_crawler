SOFIA, Bulgaria -- National Revenue Agency head Krasimir Stefanov announced on Sunday (February 14th) that Sofia has asked Germany if any Bulgarian names appear on a stolen disc containing Swiss banking data, offered to authorities in Berlin. Germany announced earlier this month that it is considering buying the data from a former official at a bank in Geneva who stole it in 2006 or 2007. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said that if this data is authentic, German authorities should obtain it. Stefanov said on Sunday that he has written to the German Finance Ministry requesting the data, should Germany decide to purchase it. "It is high time we show that Bulgaria is part of the EU and no one can evade payment of tax," Stefanov said. (Dnevnik, AFP, Standart - 14/02/10)

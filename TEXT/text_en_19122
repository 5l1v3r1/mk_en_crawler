BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Prime Minister Nebojsa Radmanovic said on Friday (March 30th) that the state parliament must resume work on the BiH constitutional reform package, which was rejected last April due to lack of political consensus. During a meeting with journalists in Banja Luka, Radmanovic warned that political negotiations on constitutional change would otherwise have to begin from scratch and could last for two or three years -- time, he said, which the country cannot afford to waste.
Meanwhile, the Federation of BiH (FBiH) now has a new government, following endorsement Friday by the entity's House of Representatives. The new ruling coalition consists of the two main Bosniak formations in BiH -- the Party of Democratic Action and the Party for BiH -- as well as the Croatian Democratic Union of BiH and HDZ 1990. Nedzad Brankovic, a former entity transport and communications minister, is the new FBiH prime minister. (Dnevni avaz - 31/03/07; RTRS - 30/03/07)

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Foreign Minister Giorgos Lilikas decided to attend this week's Turkey-EU consultations in Finland, which began Sunday (November 26th) in Tampere. Nicosia initially suggested that Lilikas would not be attending the meeting, scheduled to take place within the framework of a European-Mediterranean summit. No talks were anticipated between Lilikas and Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul. Earlier this month, the EU set a deadline of December 6th for Turkey to open its air and naval space to Greek Cypriot traffic, warning that otherwise, Turkey's EU membership talks might be jeopardised.

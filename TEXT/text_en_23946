PODGORICA, Montenegro -- A court in Podgorica on Monday (January 19th) charged nine former police officers with the illegal deportation of Muslims to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Prosecutors say the officers handed over 79 Muslims to Bosnian Serbs. Most of the Muslims, who escaped to Montenegro during the 1992-95 conflict, died at the hands of the Serbs. The court did not release the names of the officers. (AP, AFP - 19/01/09)

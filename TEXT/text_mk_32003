ZAGREB, Croatia -- The health of Gen Janko Bobetko deteriorated sharply early last week, according to his physician. Because the 83-year-old retired general refuses to go to a hospital, nurses are reportedly treating his thyroid condition at home. He is the subject of a controversial indictment and arrest warrant issued by the UN tribunal at The Hague. Prime Minister Ivica Racan is convinced Bobetko will be hospitalised by Tuesday, prior to the arrival of chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte. (HINA, Hinet, HRT - 20/10/02)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Democratic Party (DS) expects the resumption of the Serbian legislature's constituent session and the election of a new Parliament Speaker, who would schedule an emergency meeting on the state's budget financing and Kosovo's status issue as soon as possible. DS official Milan Markovic noted on Monday (April 9th) that the constituent session was suspended on February 14th. The democratic bloc, meanwhile, has been struggling to agree on a coalition government since elections in January. 
In other news, The New York Times says a decision by the UN war crimes tribunal to allow Serbia to censor incriminating documents may have affected a recent International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling that cleared Serbia of direct responsibility for the 1995 Srebrenica genocide. According to the publication, Serbia had been allowed to seal certain parts of its military archive for the sake of national security. Sources quoted by the paper say the tribunal's decision forced the ICJ to base its ruling on evidence gathered during the course of other war crimes cases.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb commander General Zdravko Tolimir, 58, who was recently captured and sent to The Hague war crimes tribunal (ICTY) for alleged involvement in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, wants to defend himself personally and to receive the documents in the trial against him in the Cyrillic alphabet, the tribunal said Monday (August 13th). Tolimir was arrested at the end of May on the border between Serbia and Republika Srpska, prompting the EU to resume suspended talks on closer ties with Serbia.
In other news, Milan Lukic, indicted by the UN tribunal for torturing, terrorising and killing as many as 150 people in Visegrad, Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992, has demanded the tribunal remove his lawyer from the case. Lukic says he is considering other lawyers or may represent himself. (RTS, Tanjug - 13/08/07)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) cannot impose solutions that are outside the framework of the Dayton Peace Accords, OHR spokeswoman Ljiljana Radetic said on Monday (March 26th), in regards to the Srebrenica City Council's vote to move the town outside the jurisdiction of Republika Srpska (RS). Radetic explained any such change could only happen through the appropriate constitutional amendments. In an interview with Dnevni Avaz newspaper, High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling described the demand by Srebrenica councillors as unacceptable. At the same time, he appealed to the RS institutions to dismiss all those who are proved to have been involved in genocide. Bosniaks began seeking special status for Srebrenica after the recent international recognition of the genocide Serbs committed against Bosniaks there in 1995.

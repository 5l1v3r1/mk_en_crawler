PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EU Envoy for northern Kosovo Michael Giffoni said on Tuesday (June 22nd) that if the bloc's mission in the north succeeds in integrating communities there, the government's strategy for the north will also be successful. "I'm the EU representative in Mitrovica north and our role in the area is not an administrative one, but we will give our contribution in solving social and economic problems," said Giffoni, who is also Italy's ambassador to Pristina. "The local community should take advantage of our presence, so that problems can be solved through dialogue," he added during a visit to Suhareka/Suva Reka. Giffoni pointed out that while the EU does not recognise parallel structures as institutional partners, if those structures have a positive impact on the local community, they will be viewed positively.

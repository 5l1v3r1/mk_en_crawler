BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Serbia should not link the prospect of closer relations with the EU to Brussels' future role in Kosovo, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told Reuters on Wednesday (January 9th). "It is sad that Serbia's European future is being offered up on the altar of domestic power games," Rehn said, a reference to presidential elections later this month. He reiterated that Serbia needs to establish full co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU. "The SAA does not affect Serbia's territorial integrity since Kosovo's status will be decided in another context." His comments were in response to ones by Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica who opposes deployment of an EU police mission to Kosovo.
In other news Wednesday, Serbian Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac ruled out using military force to retain control of Kosovo. He told the Sarajevo-based newspaper Dnevni Avaz "As long as I am minister of defence and Boris Tadic is president, we will not send any troops," adding "I have said on a number of occasions that I do not think the army can resolve the Kosovo issue."

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Senior BiH officials and representatives of the Office of the High Representative met in Sarajevo on Thursday (24 April) to discuss the reform process. Afterwards, Prime Minister Adnan Terzic announced the start of a new phase of reforms, aiming to reduce the budget deficit, achieve financial sustainability and reduce unemployment over the next six months. Terzic added that, over the next three months, the government must remove obstacles blocking access to the EU market, in order to dramatically increase exports.
In other news, a new poll by the Partner Agency finds most people in BiH believe the three main ethnic groups can live together peacefully. Of 1,200 people surveyed, 67 per cent said Serbs, Muslims and Croats could co-exist without a problem. Among Serbs, however, support for interethnic coexistence was significantly lower: 51 per cent were opposed to having members of other ethnic groups as their immediate neighbours.

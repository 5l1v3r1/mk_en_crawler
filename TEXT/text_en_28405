PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci met on Thursday (April 15th) with the head of the European Commission Liaison Office, Renzo Daviddi, who told him that fighting corruption "is a process where deep and important changes need to be made". In order to achieve results, Daviddi said, it is not enough to dismiss one or two officials, but to sentence officials who have been found guilty of abusing their positions. 
Britain is also urging the government to become more engaged in fighting corruption and organised crime. UK Ambassador to Kosovo Andy Sparks said on Thursday that recent changes in the government of Kosovo are positive, but London wants to see more efforts by Thaci. Sparks was meeting with new Integrations Minister Besim Beqaj. (Koha Ditore, Zeri, Express, Lajm, Kosova Sot - 16/04/10)

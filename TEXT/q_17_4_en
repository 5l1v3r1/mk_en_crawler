Notes for question 1 to 3: 
1) c) domestic demand and 1) d) national self-supply ratio:  "For calculation of 1) c) and 1) d), import-further processing and export-further processing are deducted from the import and the export.„ 1) d) national self-supply ratio:  "Negative values occur in cases when there is no domestic production, or when it is by far lower than import. Negative values are due to export of previously imported goods (re-export). 2) c) exports / production ratio and import / production ratio:  "For calculation of 2) c) import-further processing and export-further processing are included in the import and the export„. 2) c) exports / production ratio:  "Indices over 100 occur in cases when there is no domestic production, or it is very low, while the country imports goods, out of which part is exported to third countries (re-export)„. 2)c) import / production ratio:  "Indices over 100 occur in cases when there is no domestic production or when it is by far lower than the recorded imports.  3) d) Structure of enterprises:  "State Statistical Office does not possess data for plant and machinery and plant and machinery in active use„. 3) f) Largest enterprises: "Gross output has been used as a indicator for the production of the enterprise„. 3) f) Largest enterprises: "The symbol * next to the name of the enterprise indicates that the presented NACE activity is auxiliary to the enterprise. The enterprise is not registered for the auxiliary NACE activity at the State Statistical Office. These data have been prepared by the Ministry of Economy“. 3) f) Largest enterprises: "The symbol ** next to the figures for gross output and number of employed indicates that the data is for 2002. Data for 2003 do not exist. Included are enterprises which are important for the presented NACE activity.“ 3) f) Largest enterprises: "Enterprises with less than 10 employees were not considered.„. 3) h) Productivity per employee: "In the Republic of Macedonia, there are not available data for hours worked. Because of this, it is not possible to calculate productivity per hour worked. Productivity per employee is calculated as a ratio between the Gross value added and the number of employees„.

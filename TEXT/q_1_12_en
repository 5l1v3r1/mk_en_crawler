K. RETURN OF REFUGEES AND DISPLACED PERSONS: 

1. Statistics: Please provide statistics for the following categories of persons: (a) Refugees from the Republic of Macedonia who went to other countries during (1) the Kosovo crisis of 1999; (2) the crisis of 2001. What proportion of these refugees has returned? (b) Refugees from other countries who came to the Republic of Macedonia. When did they arrive and what proportion has returned? (c) Displaced persons within the Republic of Macedonia. How many were there in 2001 and how many have returned? 
(a)  Official data on the number of persons who have sought asylum in other countries is not available in the Republic of Macedonia. The only available data is the number of Macedonian citizens who have requested assistance with their repatriation in the Republic of Macedonia. The number of such persons is 842 refugees who have been on the territory of Kosovo.  (b)  As a result of the Kosovo crisis in 1999, in the first half of that year, international protection in the Republic of Macedonia has been requested by approximately 360.000 refugees - ethnic Albanians mainly, originating from Kosovo. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia, on 02.03.1999, adopted a Conclusion for Granting Temporary Protection. The majority of these persons – around 234.000 (64,9%) were hosted in families in the Republic of Macedonia. The remaining 126.000 (35,1%) were accommodated within the eight collective centres that have been build for this purpose country wide. The Collective Centre Stenkovec which is in the vicinity of Skopje, accommodated the largest portion of persons – 91.476, or about 72,6%.   In accordance with the international principle of shared responsibility in cases of mass-influx of refugees, and aiming to alleviate the pressure on the Republic of Macedonia, 28 European states, USA, Canada and Australia took over from the Republic of Macedonia a total of 94.408 Kosovo refugees. As soon as  the security situation in Kosovo improved, 50.572 persons that have been transferred to third countries, were repatriated through the territory of the Republic of Macedonia. A certain number returned directly to Kosovo and a certain number is still present in these countries. As the security situation in Kosovo was improving, the ethnic Albanian Kosovo refugees sheltered  in the  Republic of Macedonia have voluntarily returned to their homes. By the end of 1999, on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia there were 8.103 refugees under the Temporary Protection Status. The majority of them were non-Albanian citizens of Kosovo, i.e. Roma, who have fled the Yugoslav province after the return of the ethnic Albanian refugees. On the basis of voluntary repatriation or upon individual voluntary departure in third countries, the total number of refuges under temporary protection status in Macedonia was decreasing. At the end of the 2000, the total number of persons under temporary protection in the Republic of Macedonia was 5.416 refugees, and further decreased to 3.410 at the end of 2001; and 2.750 at the end of 2002.  On 22.09.2003, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia adopted a Conclusion abolishing the temporary protection for the refugees from Kosovo. In doing so, all those refugees who deemed that  14.104 in Germany; 8.045 in Turkey; 7.648 in the USA; 6.501 in Italy; 5.801 in Norway; 5.461 in France; 5.006 in Canada; 4.795 in Austria; 3.828 in the Netherlands; 3.597 in the UK, etc. conditions for a safe return and stay in Kosovo had not yet been met, were allowed to file individual applications  for recognition of the right to asylum in the Republic of Macedonia, pursuant to the new Law on Asylum and Temporary Protection (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 49/03), that entered into force in August 2003. A total number of 2.326 persons have invoked this right. Acting upon submitted applications, the Asylum Unit within the Ministry of Interior has granted refugee status to 12 asylum-seekers; granting also the right to asylum on the humanitarian grounds for 809 persons. A number of 209 applications for seeking asylum were rejected; and in 199 cases the determination procedures for the right to asylum were suspended due to various reasons (non-availability/ failure to appear at the interview; regulated residence on the basis of the Law on Movement and Residence of Aliens (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/92, 66/92, 26/93, 45/02, 49/03). Procedures are still underway for the remaining 1.097 asylum seekers applicants. (c)  During the crisis in the Republic of Macedonia, a number of citizens from the crisis regions, in fear for their safety, moved to other regions of the country and acquired a status of internally displaced persons (IDPs). The number of the internally displaced persons during the 2001 crisis at one point reached its maximum of 76.046 (on 11.09.2001). Out of this number, 72.134 were accommodated within the host families, while the remaining 3.912 persons were accommodated within 21 collective centres throughout the country. Once the conditions were created for their return (reconstruction of homes), many of these persons returned to their homes. Currently there are still 1424 internally displaced persons in the Republic of Macedonia, which means that a total of 74.622 persons have returned to their homes. From the current total figures of 1424 internally displaced persons, 794 are Macedonians, 397 are Serbs, 110 Roma, 106 Albanians and 17 Bosniaks.  2. Legal and regulatory framework: Please enumerate and describe the legal and regulatory framework governing the return of refugees and displaced persons. 
The legal and regulatory framework of the Republic of Macedonia governing the return of refugees and internally displaced persons in the country comprises international instruments and national legislation. This process took place in a time when Macedonia was affected by the refugee crisis in 1999 and the internal armed conflict in 2001. In such circumstances, along with the development of legislation and implementation mechanisms, authorities in Macedonia were faced with large scale crises that posed serious risks. Hence, the first mass influx of refugees from the Kosovo crisis in 1999 was handled on the basis of the Macedonian Government's conclusion on acceptance of persons massively fleeing from Kosovo into Macedonia and on granting them a status of persons under humanitarian protection. This decision was in accordance with the EXCOM conclusions No. 15-1979, 22-1981, 74-1994 and especially the 9541/01 Directive on minimum standards for giving temporary protection in the event of mass influx of displaced persons. After the initial consolidation of mass influx and creation of conditions for the application of the status determination procedure, and after the individual review of applications for a refugee status (as opposed to the collective mode of determining their status in the course of fleeing, the prima face criteria), the  regulatory framework in this period was the application of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees from 1951 and the Protocol on the Refugee Status from 1967 ratified by the Republic of Macedonia. On 25.07.2003, the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia adopted the Law on Asylum and Temporary Protection (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 49/03) which is a primary law regulating the issues of refugees and asylum seekers. It also regulates the conditions under which the Republic of Macedonia may issue temporary protection and the rights arising from such status (Article 1).  The adoption of this Law was in fact the implementation of the National Action Plan on Asylum and Migration adopted in October 2002, within the Stability Pact initiative.  The Law on Asylum and Temporary Protection was adopted in accordance with provisions of the Convention (1957) and Protocol (1967) and is a concrete implementation of these international instruments in the national context, regardless of the fact that Macedonia had previously ratified them without any reservations.  It is also important to mention Article 61 of the Law on Asylum relating to voluntary repatriation and organisation of this repatriation by the Ministry of  Interior in co-operation with UNHCR, which may occur after the expiry of the right to asylum in the Republic of Macedonia. The crisis in 2001 caused a number of internal migrations in Macedonia. Key regulatory framework is the Ohrid Framework Agreement, which in Annex C, item 3 – Refugee Return, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction(for the text and details see the answer to the question I_C_14) regulates the mode of return of refugees and internally displaced persons in the Republic of Macedonia. Hence, the Framework Agreement is still the most important regulatory framework for the return of refugees and internally displaced persons.  Additionally, a wider regulatory framework comprise the more significant conclusions and ad hoc guidelines adopted by Government crisis bodies regarding particular issues related to refugees and internally displaced persons. For instance: as a result of lack of facilities to accommodate the internally displaced persons, the Government adopted a decision to disburse accommodation and alimentation costs in collective centres. After the normalisation of conditions and completion of reconstruction of destroyed or damaged houses in crisis areas in the course of 2003, the Government passed a decision to revoke the status of an internally displaced person to a certain number of persons given that prerequisites for their return had been created. The Ministry of Labour and Social Policy disposes of data on internally displaced persons in January 2005, according to which the total number of these persons is 1424, while the number of persons temporarily residing in Kosovo is 837.   All readmission agreements ratified by Macedonia are part of the wider regulatory framework. This particularly includes the readmission provisions regulating the return of Macedonian citizens who have illegally left Macedonia and have been declined a status of a recognised refugee or whose refugee status has expired in the countries in which they have applied, and with which Macedonia has signed such readmission agreements.   It is important to note that all readmission agreements have been prepared pursuant to the Council Recommendations of 30 November 1994 with regard to the specimen of bilateral readmission agreement between EU member countries and third countries, and pursuant to Recommendations of  Ratified Agreements by the Republic of Macedonia:  Agreement on Readmission with Italy signed on 26.06.1997 (“Official Gazette of the RM”, No. 34/97);  Agreement on Readmission with Switzerland on 16.04.1988 (“Official Gazette of the RM”, No. 27/98);  Agreement on Readmission with Slovenia on 27.01.1998 (“Official Gazette of the RM”, No. 21/98);  Agreement on Readmission with France on 08.10.1999 (“Official Gazette of the RM”, No. 13/99);  Agreement on Readmission with Slovakia on 23.01.2002 (“Official Gazette of the RM”, No. 13/02);  Agreement on Readmission with Bulgaria on 30.01.2002 (“Official Gazette of the RM”, No. 12/02);  Agreement on Readmission with Croatia on 20.06.2002 (“Official Gazette of the RM”, No. 47/02);  Agreement on Readmission with Germany on 26.06.2002 (“Official Gazette of the RM”, No. 09/04);  Agreement on Readmission with Hungary has been signed and is in the process of ratification;  There are ongoing negotiations with the countries of Benelux, Denmark, Ukraine, Romania, the Czech Republic and Albania. 24.07.1995 regarding the principles on preparation of protocols on implementation of readmission agreements.Another relevant act regulating the return of refugees and internally displaced persons is the Amnesty Law (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 18/02), which grants amnesty to perpetrators of crimes related to the conflict in 2001 and hence their return in Macedonia has been facilitated.  Precisely, Article 1 of this Law reads: “This Law releases from prosecution, terminates criminal procedures and fully acquits (hereinafter: amnesty) citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, persons with legal residence as well as persons having property or family in the Republic of Macedonia (hereinafter: persons), for which there is reasonable doubt that they have organised or perpetrated crimes related to the conflict in 2001, 26 September 2001 inclusive. The amnesty also covers persons who have organised or perpetrated crimes before 1 January 2001 related to the conflict in 2001. Provisions in this law do not refer to persons who have committed crimes related to the conflict in 2001 and who are under the competence of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.” The return of refugees from the Republic of Macedonia who have sought asylum in other countries is assisted by the UNHCR. These persons during the return process enjoy all rights pursuant to existing legal regulations as other Macedonian citizens. 3. Please provide statistics for reconstruction: number of houses reconstructed to date; break-down by year, ethnicity, cost; number of requests still pending (including details of the ethnicity of those whose requests are still pending); envisaged deadline for the processing of such requests; envisaged deadline for completion of reconstruction. 
The number of houses that have been reconstructed to date is in total 6051 houses, including 4873 of first and second category and 1178 of third and fourth category. Break-down by year: By the end of 2002, a total of 5337 houses were reconstructed, including 4873 houses of first and second category  (from these 200 houses were audited and again fixed in 2004) and 464 houses of third and fourth category. By the end of 2003 a total of 677 houses of third and fourth category were reconstructed; whereas in 2004 a total of 37 houses of third and fourth category were reconstructed, and over 200 of first and second category were audited. 
Number of reconstructed houses according to the ethnic affiliation of owners: 5253 houses of Albanians 798 houses of Macedonians/Serbs/Others Reconstruction costs: The international community and donors have hitherto secured approximately 33, 9 million EUR covering the costs of reconstruction of the aforementioned houses as well as the reconstruction of the following ones which are still under way:   29 houses in M. Maala and Brest,    19 houses (12 houses of first and second category and 7 houses of third and fourth category) in Tanuševci, and    102 houses of first and second category in Tetovo and its vicinity, including 6 houses in the village of Slupane.  Number of requests still pending (Houses that have not been included in the hitherto reconstruction programmes) Due to various reasons there are another 112 houses that have not entered the process of reconstruction. One of the reasons is the fact that a large portion of these houses are seasonal, i.e. are used in a certain time of the year; hence the reconstruction programme has envisaged their reconstruction at a later phase. The rest are houses with problems of determining their legality, i.e. they have been erected on an undefined land in the property of the Republic of Macedonia (in the villages of Raduša and Dumanovce). Also, some houses have been vandalised and ruined after the reconstruction, thus they cannot be used (in the villages of Opae and Otunje). Approximately 570.000 EUR are necessary for the renovation of these houses. (See table) In addition, there are still unreconstructed houses in the village of Arainovo (76) and Mateje (119) as owners (users) of the houses have either refused reconstruction aid or have refused to sign the reconstruction contract.  According to claims of the Association of Citizens “Associated Organisation of Displaced Persons from Arainovo – “Zora”, out of 176 houses owned by ethnic Macedonians, during the conflict 40 houses have been completely destroyed, and after the conflict 13 have been burnt down. Around 80 houses have been hitherto reconstructed; over 30 have been sold; while around 60 families have begun construction or have bought lands in nearby villages and settlements as a result of lack of confidence for a continued life in the village. Approximately 1.942.600 EUR are necessary for the reconstruction of these houses (see table). Other houses that have not been reconstructed are those that do not meet the criteria for reconstruction (such as summer kitchens, garages, insured houses, houses without property rights, deserted houses, second houses, houses not used for living, etc.). During the first assessment they were registered as damaged; however, during a detailed technical assessment their status was determined. The number of these houses is 164. Envisaged deadline for completion of reconstruction The aforementioned houses currently under reconstruction are: 29 in M. Maala and Brest; 19 (12 of first and second category and 7 of third and fourth category) in Tanuševci; and 102 of first and second category in Tetovo and its vicinity, including 6 houses in the village of Slupane that should be completed by the end of 2004. The remaining 112 houses will be reconstructed after securing reconstruction funds in 2005 (see table). Houses that have not been completed due to refusal to sign tripartite contracts (Arainovo 76 and Mateje 119) will be reconstructed after conditions for their reconstruction are met, i.e. after the signing of reconstruction agreements and securing funds.

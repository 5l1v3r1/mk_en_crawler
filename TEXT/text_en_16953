SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The US Embassy in Skopje issued a statement Tuesday (4 July) reiterating Washington's commitment to the NATO integration of countries in the Western Balkans -- Albania, Croatia and Macedonia -- possibly in 2008. The statement was in response to a Reuters report suggesting the US is hesitant regarding any further NATO enlargement. 
In other news Tuesday, EU Justice, Freedom and Security Commissioner Franco Frattini said in Brussels that EU interior ministers would decide on alleviating the visa regime for Macedonian citizens on 24 July. While the ministers will discuss the visa regimes for all Western Balkan countries, Frattini said he believes Macedonia is the only country that will start talks on relaxed visa regulations before the end of the year.

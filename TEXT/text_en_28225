PODGORICA, Montenegro -- State-level coalition partners -- the Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) -- reached an agreement to form a coalition within Podgorica's local government. According to the deal reached on Saturday (June 19th), the mayoral seat will be reserved for the DPS while the president of the city assembly will come from the ranks of the SDP. During last month's local elections, the DPS-led coalition won 28 seats, the united opposition got 24, and the SDP got five. The mandate of incumbent Podgorica Mayor Miomir Mugosa expires next year.

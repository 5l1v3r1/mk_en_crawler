ROME, Italy -- The doors of the EU should remain open to all Balkan nations, Italian Foreign Minister Gianfranco Fini said in an article published Monday (16 January). The promise of a future in the EU should stabilise the entire area, he said. A compromise in the talks on Kosovo's future status, future membership in the EU for Serbia-Montenegro and Kosovo, and a strong international political and military presence should ensure peace and stability in the entire region, he added.

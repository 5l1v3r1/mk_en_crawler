SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski's press department said on Thursday (June 5th) that he has cancelled a trip to Greece because Athens refuses to allow his plane to land. It bears the Macedonian state symbol, a sensitive image in light of the long-standing name dispute between Greece and Macedonia. Crvenkovski was to attend a summit with counterparts from Southeastern Europe late next week. In April, Greek officials refused to allow Macedonia's national carrier, Macedonian Airlines, to fly over Greek airspace because of the company's name. (MIA, Makfax, A1 TV, AP - 05/06/08)

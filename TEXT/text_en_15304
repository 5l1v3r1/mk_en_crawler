TIRANA, Albania -- The chairmen of the parliamentary parties' caucuses agreed on Thursday (27 April) to postpone until Tuesday a vote on the ruling Democratic Party's demand to dismiss chief prosecutor Theodhori Sollaku. The Democrats accuse him of links to organised crime.
Earlier this week, Sollaku submitted his annual report to the legislature on the performance of the chief prosecutor's office, in which he blamed the government for corruption in the country. According to the document, last year prosecutors handled 16,987 cases involving a total of 9,439 defendants.
In other news, prosecutors announced charges against Alush Xhihani, a former member of parliament from the Socialist Party. Xhihani was indicted for financial misappropriations at the Durres Mortgage Office. (Albanian News - 28/04/06)

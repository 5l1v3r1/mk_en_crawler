SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EUFOR troops on Monday (May 7th) raided the home of a man suspected of helping former Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic evade detention and extradition to The Hague. EUFOR said in a statement that unspecified items had been seized during the search of Vojislav Topalovic's house in the southeastern town of Rudo. The raid was conducted at the request of the UN war crimes tribunal and was aimed at collecting information about Karadzic's whereabouts. EUFOR also reiterated that members of the public should share any information regarding Karadzic and other fugitives, as rewards are being offered. (AFP - 07/05/07)

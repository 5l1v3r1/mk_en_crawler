TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha told a press conference Saturday (November 29th) that corruption charges against him stemming from a highway construction deal are politically motivated. Prosecutors charged him Thursday with violating procurement procedures in financing a section of the Durres-Kukes highway, Albania's largest infrastructure investment in decades. Basha says prosecutors have deliberately dragged their feet for a year and that the whole process is under the opposition Socialist Party's influence. He served as transport minister at the time of the deal. (Top Channel, Telegrafi, Klan, VOA - 29/11/08)

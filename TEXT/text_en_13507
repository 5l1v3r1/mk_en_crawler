SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling called on citizens and NGOs alike Saturday (25 March) to take an active role in BiH's upcoming election campaign, to ensure it is fair and focused on real issues. Speaking at a conference in Sarajevo, Schwarz-Schilling stressed that society's role is to seek responsibility from political parties. Ahead of the October general elections, he said, politicians must be asked "to explain what will they do and, equally important, how will they do it". He emphasised that the next vote would be held without internationally imposed protection mechanisms. (Fena, PBS BiH, RTRS - 25/03/06)

LUXEMBOURG, Luxembourg -- Meeting in Luxembourg on Monday (13 October), the EU foreign ministers expressed regret over Croatia's unilateral move to proclaim a fishing and environmental zone in the Adriatic. While agreeing that it was Croatia's sovereign right to proclaim the zone, the council protested the manner in which the decision was made. Good neighbourly relations were crucial to Croatia's EU accession hopes, the ministers said.
In Brussels, meanwhile, NATO officials praised the progress Croatia has made in implementing its Membership Action Plan (MAP) during the past twelve months. According to Zagreb's National Co-ordinator for NATO and MAP, Zoran Milanovic, the officials cited results achieved in downsizing redundant military personnel, improving relations with neighbouring countries, reforming the judiciary and protecting minorities.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament rejected on Tuesday (14 March) a third motion launched by the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) to dismiss Finance Minister Kemal Unakitan. As in the previous two motions, CHP cited Unakitan's alleged involvement in corruption and abuse of office. The ruling Justice and Development Party, however, again secured the majority needed to defeat the motion. (NTV, AP - 14/03/06)

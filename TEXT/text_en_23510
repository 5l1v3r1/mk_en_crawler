SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Social Democratic Party (SDP) filed a no-confidence motion against the cabinet of the Federation of BiH (FBiH) on Wednesday (March 25th), citing the aggravated economic situation as a cause for the motion. Several smaller parties are expected to support the proposal. The Dnevni List newspaper quoted SDP's representative in the federal parliament, Damir Masic, as saying the motion may succeed if a secret ballot is used. (Dnevni List - 25/03/09)

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- After months of negotiations, the ruling coalition reached a deal with part of the opposition on the country's new constitution, opening the way for its adoption by a 2/3 majority in parliament. Svetozar Marovic, vice president of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), and Nebojsa Medojevic, leader of the opposition Movement for Changes (PzP), announced late on Tuesday (October 9th) that a coalition of the DPS and the Social Democratic Party will be backed by the PzP, the Albanian Alternative Party and the Bosniak Party. The new constitution is required, following Montenegro's split from its union with Serbia last year. (MINA, DPA, Vijesti, RTCG - 10/10/07)

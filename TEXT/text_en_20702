BELGRADE, Serbia -- Strained relations among members prompted the government to hold a teleconference Thursday (February 7th) rather than meet in person. The purpose of the session was to approve the privatisation of RTB Bor, a mining and metallurgical conglomerate. The session was held after Economy Minister and G17 Plus leader Bozidar Djelic warned he could not sign a nearly $500m privatisation deal without government confirmation. Cabinet members from G17 and President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party (DS) demanded the agenda include a discussion of the political agreement offered by the EU, but local media said the issue was not broached.
Meanwhile, tension in the ruling coalition escalated further after Slobodan Samardzic, minister for Kosovo, said the cabinet will fall if the DS and G17 Plus continue to insist on signing the political agreement offered by the EU. Samardzic, a member of Prime Minister Voijslav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia, accused the EU on Thursday of attempting to destabilise the political situation in Serbia with its decision to send a mission to Kosovo. 
Later in the day, Labour Minister Rasim Ljajic, of the DS, accused Kostunica of "destructive" policies and compared him to the late autocrat Slobodan Milosevic. (Blic, Danas - 08/02/08; RTS, Tanjug, beta, B92, AP - 07/02/08)

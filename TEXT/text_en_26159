THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The war crimes trial against two former senior Bosnian Serb officials began Monday (September 14th) before The Hague tribunal. In her opening statement, prosecutor Joanna Korner said Mico Stanisic, 54, and Stojan Zupljanin, 57, participated in a criminal conspiracy to purge non-Serbs from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) in 1992. "It is not suggested that either of the two accused personally committed any murders or beatings or took part personally in looting. However, they were aware of these crimes," Korner said. At the time, Stanisic was interior minister of Republika Srpska and Zupljanin was a regional police chief. 
Meanwhile, media in BiH reported on Monday that Bosnian Serb police have identified two people with information about the whereabouts of former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic. The two have been interrogated and put under surveillance, local news agency Fena reported, citing a report on co-operation between Republika Srpska's institutions and The Hague war crimes tribunal.

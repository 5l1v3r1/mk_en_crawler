TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha and visiting Italian counterpart Silvio Berlusconi attended the signing of four bilateral energy and infrastructure agreements on Tuesday (December 2nd). Two of the deals signed in Tirana are worth 2.4 billion euros and envision construction of the first wind farm in Albania, as well as a natural-gas-powered electricity plant. "In my vision, Albania should turn into a small energy superpower in the Balkans," Berisha said, adding that he will use Italy's partnership to continue efforts to build nuclear power stations. The two prime ministers also agreed to start work on three other accords worth 3 billion euros. (Shekulli, BBC, VOA, Top Channel, AP - 02/12/08)

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot communities will be asked to approve a reunification deal in simultaneous and separate referenda, government spokesman Stephanos Stephanou said on Sunday (July 12th). "It will be the people of Cyprus that will decide," he said. Describing the current period as crucial for the reunification talks, he said a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation is the only way to "restore territorial integrity, sovereignty and freedom" in Cyprus.
On Friday, Cypriot President Demetris Christofias warned that continuing the current situation in Cyprus "encompasses huge risks". In comments quoted by local media, he said the ongoing reunification process will proceed, as "there is no other way to reach a solution".
In other news, Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat arrives in Ankara on Monday for a two-day working visit. He will discuss the reunification process with Turkish President Abdullah Gul, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and Chief of General Staff Ilker Basbug.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal turned down on Wednesday (April 28th) an early release request from convicted war criminal Mladjo Radic. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2001 for crimes against Bosniaks committed during the 1992-1995 conflict, specifically the torture and killings of non-Serbs in the Omarska detention camp near Prijedor in 1992. Radic, who is in prison in France, had asked the court to be released after serving half of his sentence. In its ruling, the tribunal noted early release can only be considered when two-thirds of a sentence is served. (Dnevni Avaz, Onasa, Radio Free Europe - 28/04/10)

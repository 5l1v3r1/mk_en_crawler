NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Tassos Papadopoulos announced on Monday (July 23rd) he would seek a second term in the February 2008 elections and urged voters to show him their "trust and support". In a statement on national television, Papadopoulos, 73, said his decision was prompted by his wish to continue efforts aimed at reunifying the island. Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when the Turkish army intervened and occupied the north after a coup by a group of Greek Cypriot officers seeking union with Greece.

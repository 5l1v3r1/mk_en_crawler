BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Rasim Ljajic, chairman of Serbia-Montenegro's national council for co-operation with The Hague tribunal, said Sunday (14 November) that the council will open a new session on Tuesday. He said he expected the session to result in allowing more witnesses to testify about state secrets and submitting more documents sought by prosecutors at The Hague. 
Ljajic, who serves as Serbia-Montenegro's minister for human and minority rights, also said that this week's meeting of the federal cabinet would focus solely on the problem of war crimes co-operation, ahead of a report to the UN Security Council by the tribunal's chief prosecutor, Carla del Ponte.

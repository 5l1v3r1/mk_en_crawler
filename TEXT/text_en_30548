SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina /TIRANA, Albania -- Bosnian and Albanian citizens are free to travel without visas within Schengen Zone countries as of Wednesday (December 15th). All holders of biometric passports are eligible for the visa-free regime, which does not give them right to settle or work in these countries. The EU decided to scrap visa requirements for citizens of BiH and Albania on November 8th. Thus, Kosovars are the only people in the Western Balkans who need visas to enter the EU. Macedonia and Serbia were included in the regime last December. (BBC, Ora News Balkan Web, Top Channel - 15/12/10; Nezavisne Novine, BHRT, B92, Tanjug - 14/12/10)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The cabinet is not surprised that the European Commission's (EC) upcoming progress report, parts of which were leaked to the media, concludes that the government does not control the entire country, or that Belgrade supports parallel structures, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said on Monday (October 12th). He reiterated that his "government is upset by the negative occurrences which Belgrade is instigating" and that this has been made clear to both Washington and Brussels. However, Thaci pointed out that for the first time, the EC report clearly supports Kosovo's European prospects. The annual progress report for countries in the Western Balkans will be published on Wednesday. (Kosova Sot, Lajm, Zeri - 13/10/09; Kohavision, RTK, TV 21 - 12/10/09)

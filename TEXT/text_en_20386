ANKARA, Turkey -- A new poll published in Zaman newspaper on Friday (March 14th) suggests growing religious tolerance in Turkey. The survey, conducted by the independent polling company Veritas, found that only 4.8% of the more religious say they cannot stand women not covering their heads, while only 5.2% of hard-line secularists express feelings of intolerance towards women with headscarves. Thus, about 95% of society is unconcerned with the issue. (Zaman - 14/03/08)

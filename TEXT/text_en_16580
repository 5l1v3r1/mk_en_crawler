SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Deputies of the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Democratic Integration -Party for Democratic Prosperity (DUI-PDP) attended a Friday (8 September) parliamentary session marking the 15th anniversary of the country's independence. This was their first appearance in a month, due to their ongoing boycott against the new government of Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski. DUI leader Ali Ahmeti stressed that the deputies attended to demonstrate respect for the holiday, but have not changed their view of the government. He added, however, that DUI-PDP lawmakers would attend sessions involving crucial votes, such as the one on police reform. (Vest, Utrinski Vesnik - 09/09/06)

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The Hague war crimes tribunal should not close down before the capture of the two remaining high-profile fugitives -- Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic, the new president of the tribunal, Patrick Robinson, said on Monday (November 17th) as he assumed the post. The Jamaican-born Robinson said that he will work to bring war crimes fugitives to justice, adding that as judge with the tribunal for ten years, he is familiar with both its achievements and its main problems. Robinson, 64, replaced Italy's Fausto Pocar, who presided over the tribunal for the past decade.
Meanwhile, Hague tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz met on Monday with senior officials in Belgrade. He wraps up discussions there Tuesday. (B92 - 18/11/08; ITAR-TASS, Tanjug - 17/11/08)

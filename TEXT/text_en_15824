BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) announced on Monday (19 June) that it has joined the European Fund for South East Europe (EFSE) with a contribution of 60m euros. EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said the move was aimed at strengthening support for micro enterprises and households in the region. He also suggested it would act as catalyst for a considerable amount of private investment in EFSE. Launched late last year under a joint initiative by sovereign donors, national and international financial institutions and the EC, EFSE is aimed at supporting the private and financial sectors in Western Balkan states.

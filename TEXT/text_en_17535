SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament completed the vote on amendments to the local elections act Friday (July 27th), but the procedure was highly contentious. At the end of the session, the opposition walked out, protesting what it said was the abuse of voting cards belonging to absent MPs. Furthermore, the approved changes are more modest than had been expected. A residency requirement, stipulating that a prospective voter must have lived for at least ten months in the respective municipality, was approved, but the final text does not require local election bureaus to enforce it by removing non-residents from election lists. Lawmakers also decided to re-establish direct voting. After the session, parliament began its summer recess. (Standart, Monitor - 28/07/07; BNR, Mediapool, Sega - 27/07/07)

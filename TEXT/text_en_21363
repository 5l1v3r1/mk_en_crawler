NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat called for a rapid solution regarding the divided island of Cyprus on Saturday (September 27th). "The more time passes, the fewer chances we have [to solve the issue]," Talat warned in an interview with the Greek radio station Flash. "I prefer to have a solution by the end of the year. Time is very crucial," he stressed. He said the main problem between the two Cypriot communities is the property issue, adding that territorial disputes are also difficult to solve. Greek Cypriots should stop blaming Turkey for the situation in Cyprus and accept more UN involvement in the negotiation process, the Turkish Cypriot leader said. Talat and Cypriot President Demetris Christofias are scheduled to hold their next round of reunification talks on October 10th. The two sides agree in principle to a bizonal, bicommunal federation, but sharp differences remain on security, territorial issues and Turkish settlers.

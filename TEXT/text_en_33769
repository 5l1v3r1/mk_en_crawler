SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The country's two major ethnic communities -- the Macedonians and the ethnic Albanians -- hold different views on what the country's most acute problems are, according to a survey by the local research agency BCC ESTEK. The results of the poll, released Wednesday (26 November), suggest Macedonians consider society's chief problems to be unemployment and poverty, followed by economic crime and misappropriations by state institutions. Most ethnic Albanian respondents, however, cited what they consider the slow implementation of the Ohrid Peace Accord, followed by corruption of state administration. The state statistical office is expected to release the first official results from the 2002 national census on Monday; the information should give a clearer picture of the country's ethnic composition.

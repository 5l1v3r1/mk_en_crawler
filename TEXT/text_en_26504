BELGRADE, Serbia -- Albanian Foreign Minister Ilir Meta wrapped up a two-day visit to Belgrade on Friday (March 12th), saying his country is ready to launch a thorough investigation into the alleged trafficking of organs removed from Serb prisoners as fighting ended in 1999. Allegations that members of the Kosovo Liberation Army abducted civilians during the war to eventually harvest organs first surfaced in a book by Carla del Ponte, former chief prosecutor of The Hague war crimes tribunal. Meta said on Friday that it is time to put an end to del Ponte's claims. (AFP, ANSA, Albanian Times - 12/03/10)

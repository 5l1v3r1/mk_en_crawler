KONYA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan lashed out at building contractors in Turkey as the death toll from a collapsed apartment building climbed to 17. "This is entirely a technical failure ... As long as the sanctions for these kinds of things aren't heavy, citizens will pay the price with their lives," he said. Rescue teams worked around the clock Tuesday (3 February) looking for survivors. About 30 people were taken out of the rubble alive, but there may be another 40 to 100 still trapped in the debris.

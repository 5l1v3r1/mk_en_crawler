ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic met on Monday (20 September) with representatives of Croatian minority communities living abroad. He pledged the country's support for improvement of minorities' positions in other countries and for their integration. Presidential adviser Igor Dekanic said afterwards that the minority communities represent a "bridge of co-operation" between Croatia and its neighbours in the EU integration process. 
Also Monday, a Croatian court reopened the trial of a former military police officer accused of killing 13 Serb prisoners of war in 1991. The retrial of Mihajlo Hrastov was ordered by the country's Supreme Court, reversing a lower court acquittal. (HINA, HRT, AFP - 20/09/04)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament's lower house, the chamber of deputies, unanimously approved a series of draft constitutional amendments at its session Monday (30 June). The changes envision an extended five-year term for the president, guarantees for private property, abolition of the obligatory army conscription, and use of the mother tongue in court and in public administration. Afterwards, Prime Minister Adrian Nastase thanked the parties for their support, stressing that approval of the document is fundamental to the EU pre-accession process. The draft moves to the senate in August. (Rompres, ACT Media, Nine o'Clock - 01/07/03; Rompres - 30/06/03)

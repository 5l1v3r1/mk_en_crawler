BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Serbia intends to apply for EU membership by the end of the year, Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic announced on Thursday (November 5th). Speaking to members of the European Parliament Foreign Policy Committee, Jeremic said that his country is aware of reservations some bloc members have on the issue, but said it is time to move forward. He added that Belgrade is co-operating fully with the UN war crimes tribunal, a precondition for progress towards EU integration.
While in Brussels, Jeremic met with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who praised Serbia's progress but declined to say whether he agreed with Belgrade's intention to apply for membership so soon.
In other news Thursday, the Serbian government approved a draft law on determining the jurisdictions of Vojvodina province. The cabinet says the measure harmonises jurisdictions of the province with the constitution, and implements the decentralisation process and concept of broad autonomy, without elements of statehood. The draft law and Vojvodina Statute move next to parliament for debate. (B92, Tanjug, Blic, RTS - 05/11/09)

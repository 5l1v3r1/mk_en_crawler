ZAGREB, Croatia -- The defence ministry says Croatia could send 20 more troops to Afghanistan by September. Ministry State Secretary Pjer Simunovic said on Thursday (April 1st) that the suggestion will be forwarded to the government. If accepted, it would mean boosting the contingent to 320 soldiers. Thursday marked the first anniversary of Croatia's accession to NATO. Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor noted that by joining, the country has met one of its two strategic foreign policy priorities. The other is EU membership. (Vecernji List, Slobodna Dalmacija, Croatian Times, Poslovni, HINA - 01/04/10)

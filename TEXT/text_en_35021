ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said on Sunday (30 November) that his attendance at the EU summit in Naples last week was beneficial not only because of participation in the general meeting but also because of the bilateral contacts he made with several counterparts from EU member and candidate states. Gul said his meeting with Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen was key, since Ireland assumes the rotating EU presidency in January.

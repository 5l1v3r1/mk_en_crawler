TIRANA, Albania -- The main opposition Socialist Party (SP) again boycotted a session of the legislature on Thursday (30 March), following a new row with the ruling Democratic Party (DP). The controversy emerged over the failure of the two major political formations to agree upon SP's request for changes in the parliamentary regulations. SP deputies left the parliamentary hall, warning that they would not attend sessions until their request is thoroughly discussed and a consensus is achieved. (Albanian News - 31/03/06)

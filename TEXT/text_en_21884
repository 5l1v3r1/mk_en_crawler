ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ali Babacan plans an official visit to the United States next month, government sources told Zaman newspaper. The trip reportedly will take place between June 3rd and June 9th, though no official schedule has been confirmed. Babacan has requested meetings with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Vice-President Dick Cheney and National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley. It will be the first official visit by a senior Turkish government official to the US since the case seeking the closure of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) was launched in March. Babacan is expected to seek US support for the AKP, as well as for Turkey's bid to join the UN Security Council as a provisional member. (Zaman - 20/05/08)

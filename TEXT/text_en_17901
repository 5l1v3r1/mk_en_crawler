SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The ethnic Albanian opposition Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) and its coalition ally Party of Democratic Prosperity (PDP) have again decided to boycott parliament, according to statements from the two formations. Separately at the weekend, the presidencies of DUI and PDP decided that the parliamentary majority continues to violate the so-called Badinter principle. Stipulated in the 2001 Ohrid Peace Accord, it provides that all laws referring to minorities must be passed by Parliament with over 50% of the votes of deputies representing the respective minority. According to PDP deputy leader Ismet Ramadani, DUI and PDP will not return to the legislature until "real dialogue" begins. (Utrinski Vesnik - 22/01/07; Telma TV, A1 TV - 21/01/07)

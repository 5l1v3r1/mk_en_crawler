BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Democratic Liberal Party (PDL) announced on Sunday (March 2nd) that it would like to see local elections held on May 25th. By law, elections must be held within 75 days of being formally scheduled. PDL executive secretary Mircea Toader says that requirement would be met, if the government announces a date, as expected, during its session Wednesday. Elections on May 25th would also square nicely with the four-year mandates of mayors, local and municipal counsellors, whose terms began in June 2004. (Adevarul - 03/03/08; Mediafax - 02/03/08)

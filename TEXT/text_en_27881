BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU representatives on Wednesday (May 19th) praised the work of the EULEX mission in Kosovo and investigations led by the EU Rule of Law Mission's judicial component. Representatives of the 27 EU member states gathered for a Western Balkans working group meeting in Brussels, attended by EU Special Representative for Kosovo Pieter Feith. Sources say many EU member state representatives praised the fact that EULEX has recently begun to boost its profile in terms of prosecuting organised crime and high level corruption "through visible" actions.

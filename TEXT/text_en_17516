SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling wants to remain in BiH after his mandate expires at the end of this week, to oversee a special commission established to help BiH politicians reach consensus on key constitutional reform. According to a report Monday (June 25th) by Dnevni Avaz newspaper, Schwarz-Schilling has notified the international community of his decision, although it lacks strong approval.
In a last ditch attempt to push ahead with reforms, Schwarz-Schilling imposed a new Law on the Centre for the Srebrenica-Potocari Memorial and Cemetery. It transfers management of the centre from the Srebrenica-Potocari Memorial Foundation to the Council of Ministers. The RS government met in emergency session and condemned the move, saying Schwarz-Schilling had breached the Dayton Peace Agreement.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO troops in Kosovo will defend the UN-recognised solution for Kosovo's future, the Alliance's secretary general told reporters Monday (8 May). Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said NATO's forces would move against anyone who violates the peace and resists implementation of the solution on the province's final status. He added that it is up to envoy Marti Ahtisaari and his team of UN negotiators to decide when NATO's security role in Kosovo would be discussed between Serb and ethnic Albanian negotiators.
Ahtisaari visited Sofia on Monday, as part of a regional tour related to the status settlement process. During talks with Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev and Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin, Ahtisaari reiterated his hope that the matter would be resolved by year's end.

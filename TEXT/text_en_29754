SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) outgoing President Borjana Kristo withdrew a motion Tuesday (March 29th) that she had filed at the Constitutional Court against the formation of the upper house of parliament and election of president and vice-presidents. She handed over her mandate to High Representative Valentin Inzko, but said in a letter that Inzko had violated the rule of law by suspending decisions by the State Election Commission (CIK) which deemed the newly established FBiH parliament and the FBiH president and vice-presidents illegitimate. The House of Peoples was constituted on March 17th, despite a boycott by the two main Croat parties. (Fena, RTRS, Srna, BHRT - 29/03/11)

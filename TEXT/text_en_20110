OSLO, Norway -- Justice ministry officials announced on Tuesday (January 15th) that Norway will extradite a Croatian national to Serbia, where he will stand trial for the murder and torture of Croat detainees in Vukovar in 1991. Damir Sireta, 44, is also wanted in Croatia where he has been sentenced in absentia to 12 years in prison for the murder of a prisoner. Norwegian officials say they had decided to send him to Serbia because he will face more serious charges there. He will be extradited after four weeks unless he appeals the decision and requests a pardon from King Harald. (Reuters, AFP, AP, Fena - 15/01/08)

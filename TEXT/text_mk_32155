THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- On Thursday (10 September), the UN war crimes tribunal fired a member of the team of lawyers appointed to ensure that Slobodan Milosevic gets a fair trial. The judges ruled that Michail Wladimiroff of the Netherlands damaged Milosevic's defence when he said in an interview that the former Yugoslav president would be convicted if the jury were to make a decision now. He told a Dutch newspaper that prosecutors had produced enough evidence to secure a conviction in the Kosovo phase of the trial. Wladimiroff maintains he was misquoted. He was one of three "friends of the court." British lawyer Steven Kay and Branislav Tapuskovic of Yugoslavia will stay on in this capacity. (AP, AFP - 10/10/02)

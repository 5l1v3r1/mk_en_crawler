TIRANA, Albania -- An ongoing hunger strike by a dozen lawmakers is a call to improve election standards in the country, President Bamir Topi said on Tuesday (November 11th). On Monday, a group of 12 lawmakers from small parties in parliament started their strike inside the parliament building to protest the exclusion of small parties' representatives from election committees under the new election code. Topi explained the main reason for the protest is a lack of political dialogue, something cited in the European Commission's progress report on Albania last week.

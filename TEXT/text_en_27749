BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Emil Boc announced on Saturday (June 26th) that the government has decided to raise the VAT from 19% to 24% as of July 1st, in order to narrow the budget deficit. The decision is in response to Friday's ruling by the Constitutional Court, rejecting parts of the government's fiscal austerity package. In particular, the Court ruled that the 15% cut in pensions, as well as the reduction of higher pensions in certain professions, are unconstitutional. All this has prompted the IMF to delay disbursement of the next tranche under Romania's agreement with the institution. "The fund is assessing the impact of the constitutional court's ruling on fiscal measures proposed by the government," the IMF's mission head to Bucharest, Jeffrey Franks, said in a statement Friday. A planned meeting by the IMF board on Monday has been postponed. (Mediafax, Agerpres, AFP, Bloomberg, BBC, Reuters - 26/06/10)

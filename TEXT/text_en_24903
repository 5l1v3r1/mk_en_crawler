SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative and EU Special Representative Valentin Inzko underscored the importance of dialogue and compromise at his first meeting with BiH presidency members Nebojsa Radmanovic, Zeljko Komsic and Haris Silajdzic, on Tuesday (March 31st). "There is no alternative to political negotiations, however difficult they may be. Last week's communique of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) also explicitly welcomed the principle of agreement and compromise, the very principles on which the EU is based, which must be the guiding principle for taking BiH forward and into the EU," Inzko said after the talks. He reiterated that the EU wants to transfer the Office of the High Representative to an EU mission, as soon as BiH authorities meet all conditions set by the PIC.

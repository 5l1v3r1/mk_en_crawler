ATHENS, Greece -- Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis has rejected an initiative by Macedonian counterpart Antonio Milososki aimed at improving strained relations between the two neighbours, media reported on Monday (March 30th). In a letter to Bakoyannis on March 13th, Milososki suggested that the two countries should overcome their differences by signing a joint declaration of friendship and co-operation and a framework proposal for progress in bilateral relations. In her reply, Bakoyannis described the ideas as "declarative statements of questionable benefit and efficiency", Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Giorgos Koumoutsakos said. Bakoyannis also stressed Athens wants "concrete action and not words to impress the world". 
She also denounced what she described as Macedonia's "extreme and fanatical positions". Skopje's stance is also hampering its EU and NATO ambitions, she added. (Express, Vecer - 31/03/09; ANA-MPA, Naftemporiki, In.news, Makfax - 30/03/09)

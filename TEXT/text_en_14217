ANKARA, Turkey -- European Commission Ambassador to Ankara Hans Jorg Kretschmer criticised on Monday (12 December) Turkey's continued failure to comply with European norms concerning the military's role in public life. According to the envoy, the country generally has advanced in meeting the political criteria for EU membership but however, but has not done so with regard to the military. He urged that such gaps be addressed in as soon as possible. 
In other news Monday, local NTV reported that the army's general staff opposes a government plan which would allow army conscripts to pay a fee to reduce the length of compulsory military service. The army reportedly rejected the idea, citing the continuing fight against terrorism. (NTV, Reuters - 12/12/05)

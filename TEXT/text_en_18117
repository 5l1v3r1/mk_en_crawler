ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he expects President Ahmet Necdet Sezer to approve the recently adopted constitutional changes that would allow Turkey's president to be elected via direct popular vote, rather than by Parliament. Speaking after a meeting Monday (May 14th) among leaders of the ruling Justice and Development Party, Erdogan declined to comment on the possibility that a referendum might have to be held on the constitutional amendment package, should Sezer veto it.
In other news, EU security chief Javier Solana warned in an interview that the EU should not suspend membership talks with Ankara. Having Turkey on its side is vital to Europe's security, he told Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper, adding that the country might look for other partners if rejected.

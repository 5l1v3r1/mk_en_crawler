TIRANA, Albania -- About 60 tonnes of crude oil was dumped into a channel that connects the coast of Vlora with the Ionian Sea, causing significant environmental damage, police said Wednesday (June 3rd). Three people were arrested, including the head of the Arkand Junior company. Investigators say the material was intentionally dumped from an Italian-flagged carrier, which was transporting oil from Canada. (Koha Jone, Shekulli, Gazeta Shqiptare, Balkan Web - 04/06/09)

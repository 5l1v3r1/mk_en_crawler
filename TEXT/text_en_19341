ANKARA, Turkey -- At least 15 members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) were killed in the latest attacks by the Turkish army on PKK camps in northern Iraq, Turkey's General Staff said in a statement on its website Saturday (March 29th). The military says troops used long-range missiles Thursday to prevent a group of PKK guerrillas from crossing the border with Turkey. On Friday, Turkish aircraft followed up with strikes on targets in the same area. (Hurriyet - 30/03/08; CNN, AFP, BBC, Bloomberg - 29/03/08)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The opposition National Liberal Party and Social Democratic Party on Friday (October 29th) filed a fresh joint no-confidence motion against the government in an effort to prevent it from turning education reform into law, bypassing parliament. Prime Minister Emil Boc, whose government just survived a no-confidence vote Wednesday, addressed parliament Thursday, insisting on launching an accountability procedure on the education law, which would enable the cabinet to adopt it without parliamentary debate or voting. The law could enter into force in two weeks, during which time parliament could propose amendments. The vote could take place in parliament as early as next week.

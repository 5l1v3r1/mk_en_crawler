TIRANA, Albania -- The Serious Crimes Court sentenced a man to life in prison Thursday (December 17th) for killing two policemen in March. Afrim Hasani was found guilty despite attempts by his lawyers to prove he "was psychologically troubled" at the time. The two policemen were sitting in a caf√© waiting for their evening shift to start in the Shen Meri village of Kukes, when Hasani shot them with an automatic rifle. He was arrested 12 hours later by special police forces. (Balkan Web, Top Channel, Alsat, Telegrafi - 17/12/09)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament approved on Tuesday (May 15th) a law on equal regional development, aimed at creating an appropriate legal framework to provide balanced development and boost local self-government. The country would be divided into eight planning regions -- Skopje, Pelagonija, Polog, Southeast, Vardar, East, Northeast and Southwest. The law also obligates the government to allocate at least 1% of GDP for promotion of equal regional development. (MIA - 15/05/07)

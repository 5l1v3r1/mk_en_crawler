BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- On Monday (14 April), the president of Republika Srpska ordered the closing of the entity's military intelligence service, following the discovery that it had spied on SFOR and international officials. President Dragan Cavic ordered a total restructuring, within two months, of what is known as the 410th Military Intelligence Unit. He promised court-martials for several officers. Cavic said the move signals the government's dedication to preventing activities that violate the Dayton peace accords. He added that the RS Army Headquarters would be in charge of establishing a new intelligence unit in line with SFOR regulations. (OHR Sources - 15/04/03; AP, AFP, RTRS, PBS BiH - 14/04/03)

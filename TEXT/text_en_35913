SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria's military intelligence was notified about the risk of possible terror attacks against several diplomatic missions in country in the first ten days of 2004, military intelligence chief General Plamen Studenkov said Saturday (17 January) in an interview for Darik Radio. Although this deadline has passed, Studenkov said, it is not clear whether the terror threat remained. He also acknowledged the possibility that terrorist groups might try to use Bulgaria as a base for organising attacks in Western Europe, and said authorities should not underestimate such a scenario.

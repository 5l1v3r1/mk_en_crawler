TIRANA, Albania -- The interior ministry announced new data Thursday (May 21st) regarding the production and issuing of new electronic ID cards. More than 1 million citizens have applied for the cards, while 830,000 cards have been produced since the process began in December. ID cards and passports are the two valid documents voters must present before casting their ballots at polling stations for the June 28th parliamentary election. Until now, voters had to present a birth certificate. The introduction of the electronic ID cards has suffered problems and delays. (Shekulli, Ora News, VoA - 21/05/09)

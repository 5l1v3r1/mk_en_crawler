BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn confirmed on Wednesday (14 September) that Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) would not be able to start Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) talks with the EU this year because of the deadlock over police reform. "I regret that the chance to celebrate 10 years of peace by opening a new phase of European future has now been lost", added Rehn. His statement followed news that the Republika Srspka (RS) Parliament had again rejected the concept of police sector restructuring based on three key EU principles. The Office of the High Representative also issued a statement Wednesday, blaming RS and the ruling RS Serb Democratic Party for BiH's missed opportunity. 
In an interview with Dnevni Avaz on Thursday, BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic also held Serbia responsible, charging that Belgrade has encouraged RS's obstructionist policy. (Dnevni avaz - 15/09/05; EU Observer, OHR Sources - 14/09/05)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Emil Boc told local ProTV channel on Tuesday (December 28th) that a total of 1,274,000 people are employed in the country's public sector, which is less than stipulated in Bucharest's bailout agreement with the IMF. Two years ago, the sector employed 1,397,000 people, and under the IMF deal, their number had to be reduced to 1,290,000 people. Finance Minister Gheorghe Ialomitianu explained that in 2011 further cuts will be made in sectors with unreasonably high expenditures, including institutions under the interior and finance ministries.

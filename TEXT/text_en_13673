ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said on Monday (19 September) that the attack on the British Embassy in Zagreb was aimed at damaging Croatia's bid for EU membership. He told reporters that there were "people who wish to slow Croatia's path towards the EU". A letter bomb exploded in the mailroom of the embassy earlier on Monday injuring a Croatian employee. President Stipe Mesic condemned the attack as a terrorist act. British Minister for Europe Douglas Alexander pledged to work with Croatian authorities to identify and prosecute the perpetrators.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Interior Minister Ioan Rus said Thursday (9 October) that the nationwide referendum to revise the constitution would take place over two days, 18 October and 19 October, instead of just 19 October, as previously planned. Among other things, the changes would extend the presidential term from four to five years and would permit ethnic minorities to use their mother tongue in court, under specific circumstances.
Also Thursday, both houses of parliament approved a request from President Ion Iliescu to send about 60 additional troops to Iraq. They would be deployed in divisions under British and Polish command. (ACT Media - 10/10/03; Rompres, Mediafax - 09/10/03)

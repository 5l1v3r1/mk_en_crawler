PRISTINA, Kosovo -- About 11,000 ballots for municipal mayors and 50,000 ballots for municipal assemblies were declared invalid by the Central Elections Commission (CEC) on Thursday (December 3rd), though the exact reason is not clear. "I don't know why these ballots were declared invalid. I don't think it was because of lack of information on how to vote, because we had a public campaign explaining that," said CEC head Nesrin Lushta. The CEC has not yet certified the November 15th municipal election results. Another round of voting will be held on December 13th in 21 municipalities where the candidates failed to secure more than 50% of the vote in the first round.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Central Election Commission (CEC) rejected on Saturday (April 14th) a request by the Order, Rule of Law and Justice party to register the five Bulgarian nurses sentenced to death in Libya as candidates in the upcoming European Parliament election. The CEC cited a legal requirement stipulating that candidates must have resided in Bulgaria or another EU member state during the past two years. 
The party says it will appeal the decision to the High Administrative Court. Bulgaria elects its EP deputies on May 20th. (Novinar - 16/04/07; Mediapool - 15/04/07; Standart - 14/04/07)

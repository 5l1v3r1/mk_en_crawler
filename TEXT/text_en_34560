ZAGREB, Croatia -- On Wednesday (1 October), the ruling coalition met to review answers to the lengthy European Commission (EC) questionnaire before submitting it to Brussels next week. Prime Minister Ivica Racan says the cabinet will also discuss the questionnaire at its Thursday session and forward it to parliament. Racan is to meet with UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte on Friday in Zagreb, to discuss the case involving fugitive indictee General Ante Gotovina. Co-operation on that front is expected to figure prominently in the EC discussion on Croatia's readiness to join the Union.

STRASBOURG, France -- The Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers urged Turkey on Thursday (1 December) to follow an order of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and grant a new trial to a former Kurd militant sentenced to life imprisonment. The ECHR decision was issued in 2003, when the court ruled that Hulki Gunes, convicted of separatism and jeopardising Turkey's national security, did not receive a fair and impartial trial due to procedural violations.

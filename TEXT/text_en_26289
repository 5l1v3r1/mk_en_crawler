TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi on Saturday (February 13th) hosted a round-table that brought together the leaders of the government and the main opposition Socialist Party (SP) in an effort to help overcome the current political stalemate. SP lawmakers have been boycotting the work of parliament since September of last year, insisting they would not come back unless a thorough investigation is conducted into the June 2009 general elections, which they insist were manipulated. Prime Minister Sali Berisha of the Democratic Party (DP) and SP leader Edi Rama met at the president's office in Tirana and agreed to continue talks. "We agreed that the president will continue to explore for convergence points," Topi said after the meeting. He also thanked the EU, the US and international institutions for getting the talks started. (Zeri, BalkanWeb, Top Channel, Shekulli, AP, AFP - 13/02/10)

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Budva Mayor Rajko Kuljaca and his deputy Dragan Marovic, who are in custody over the so-called Zavala affair, have resigned from their posts, the daily Vijesti reported on Tuesday (April 5th), citing sources from the local branch of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists. The two were arrested in December along with several other municipal officials for suspected abuse of office, stemming from illegal construction on the Zavala peninsula. Prosecutors say the suspects siphoned off more than 11m euros. (Vijesti, Tanjug, RTCG - 05/04/11)

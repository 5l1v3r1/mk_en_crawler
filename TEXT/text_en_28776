ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu urged Israel on Tuesday (August 10th) to admit its responsibility for the May 31st attack on a Turkish-led aid flotilla to Gaza that left nine people dead. "There is a very clear situation that Israel killed civilians in international waters. First of all, they should bear that responsibility," Davutoglu said. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel had reacted in accordance with international law during the attack. He criticised Ankara for failing to stop the flotilla and announced that Israel will not co-operate with an UN-led investigation into the raid if Israeli soldiers are summoned to testify.

VIDIN, Bulgaria -- The completion of a second bridge over the Danube River between Bulgaria and Romania at Vidin-Kalafat is being delayed another year, to 2010. Transport ministers Petar Mutafchiev and Radu Bercanu met in Vidin on Tuesday (27 June) and said that while construction would begin next year, technical concerns have made completion by the end of 2009 unlikely. The European Commission recently opened the procedure for selecting a contractor, and the bidding deadline expires on 15 September. The winner will be announced at the end of this year.

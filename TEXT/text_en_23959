ZAGREB, Croatia -- Rade Miljevic, a former member of Serb rebel forces, received a sentence on Wednesday (December 17th) of 12 years in prison for war crimes committed during the 1991-1995 conflict. Miljevic, 64, was found guilty of murdering four Croat civilians in Glina in 1991. A court convicted him as early as 2007, but the Croatian Supreme Court intervened, citing procedural errors. Miljevic saw a reduction on Wednesday of his original 14-year sentence due to a lack of clear evidence he had direct involvement in the murders. (AFP, HRT, Vecernj List, Index - 17/12/08)

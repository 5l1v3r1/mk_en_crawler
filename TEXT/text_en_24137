BELGRADE, Serbia -- The army will experience the consequences of the global economic crisis but this will not affect ongoing reforms within its ranks, Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac said on Tuesday (April 14th). He told RTS state television such reforms generally would cost nothing to implement in certain sectors; the only exception would be purchasing new weapons, Sutanovac said. He added he expects the Serbian army will complete professionalisation by 2011, as scheduled. As for the country's Euro-Atlantic integration, Sutanovac said past negative experiences with NATO should not be a hurdle to Serbia's eventual accession into the Alliance.

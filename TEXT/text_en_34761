SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The managing board of the BiH Central Bank re-elected Peter Nichol as bank governor on Monday (11 August). The local consensus is that he has maintained a successful monetary policy for the past five years, kept the local currency stable, managed foreign reserves prudently, and retained the bank's independence from political influences. Nichol, a citizen of New Zealand, received the post in accordance with the Dayton Peace Agreement, which stipulated that the first central bank governor should be a foreigner. Earlier in the year, local authorities gave him BiH citizenship. (Onasa, SRNA, BHTV1, HINA - 11/08/03)

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- The majority of Slovenians, 58%, approve of the government's decision to lift the blockade on Croatia's EU accession talks, according to a survey published by the Ljubljana-based daily Delo and cited by Croatian media Sunday (September 20th). On the flip side, 35% disagree, the rest are undecided. Zagreb will resume its EU accession talks at an intergovernmental conference on October 2nd, now that Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor and Croatian counterpart Jadranka Kosor have agreed to continue negotiations on resolving their countries' long-standing border dispute. The deal was clinched after Croatia decided to withdraw all documents submitted to the European Commission that may pre-judge the border conflict. (HRT, HINA, Dnevnik - 20/09/09)

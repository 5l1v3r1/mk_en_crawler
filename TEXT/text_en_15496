ZAGREB, Croatia -- The agriculture ministry reported new cases of swine fever Wednesday (23 August), on the heels of an outbreak last month. Ministry spokesman Mladen Pavic said the new cases surfaced in the Borovo and Bijelo Brdo settlements near Osijek. A total of 470 pigs, in which the virus was detected or suspected, were destroyed on Wednesday. In late July, nearly 770 pigs were destroyed in the eastern Vukovar-Srijem County.

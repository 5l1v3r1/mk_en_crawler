BELGRADE, Serbia -- In separate statements Thursday (March 20th), Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica denounced US President George W. Bush's decision to allow US military assistance to Kosovo. "It is bad news and comes at a very sensitive moment for Serbia and the Serbs in Kosovo, and I can in no way support it," Tadic is quoted as saying by B92. Kostunica said this is "another deeply wrong move by the United States" concerning Kosovo. "Kosovo does not need new weapons, but new negotiations," he added. 
Visiting Tel Aviv, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the US move would violate international law, particularly the UN resolution that specifically prohibits providing weapons to Kosovo, except to the UN forces in the area. 
Also on Thursday, the Serbian Foreign Ministry issued a statement protesting the decision of neighbouring Hungary, Croatia and Bulgaria to recognise Kosovo. "This is a blow, it's a step backwards," Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said. Belgrade is withdrawing its envoys from the three countries.

ATHENS, Greece -- An estimated 72,000 spectators in the Olympic Stadium and a television audience of billions around the world watched Fridayâ€™s (13 August) opening ceremony. In a bright display of colour Athens went back to its roots, highlighting its stature as the cradle of Western civilisation. Gods, mythical heroes and Greek philosophers were featured in a rich dramatisation of Hellenic culture and history. Greek President Costas Stephanopoulos opened the Games under a large olive tree, the universal symbol of peace. In all, 10,000 athletes from 202 nations marched into the stadium, as dozens of heads of state looked on. 
Weak ticket sales continue to be a concern for officials in Athens. On Saturday, the local organising committee said that just 2.8 million of 5.4 million tickets have been sold, despite a pickup in recent weeks. Weak revenues were attributed mostly to the fall of the US dollar and soaring hotel rates in Athens. 
The drama involving Olympic, world, and European 200m sprint champion Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou, a silver medallist from Sydney, continued Saturday when the pair was withdrawn from their team pending an International Olympic Committee investigation. Late last week, they missed a doping test and then had a mysterious motorcycle accident. The International Association of Athletics Federations, meanwhile, has confirmed that they evaded a doping test in the United States earlier in the week.
Turkey had its first triumph in the Summer Games when Nurcan Taylan, a 20-year-old student, won the gold in the 48kg division of women's weightlifting, setting world records in the process. Taylan also became the first Turkish woman to win Olympic gold.

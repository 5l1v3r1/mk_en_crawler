BUCHAREST, Romania -- The draft report by the European Council on Romania and Bulgaria's accession was discussed Monday (12 June) in Luxembourg, at the Council of General Affairs and Foreign Relations meeting. The draft urges both countries to step up efforts for accession. The EC is expected to deliver its final monitoring report on 26 September. 
Romanian Foreign Minister Mihai Razvan Ungureanu, meanwhile, called on European leaders to request that member states continue ratification of the Accession Treaty with Bulgaria and Romania. But the Danish Foreign Ministry announced that parliament will postpone work on the treaty until October, after the EC recommendations are released.

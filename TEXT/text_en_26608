BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic says police have detained seven people, including three minors, for allegedly threatening B92 television journalist Brankica Stankovic. Dacic said Tuesday (December 8th) that others are being sought in connection with death threats directed at the prominent journalist via Facebook. They began appearing after Stankovic reported last week on criminal activities involving leaders of football fan groups in Serbia. (Tanjug, Politika, B92 - 08/12/09)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci on Tuesday (June 2nd) invited all displaced Serbs to return to their homes. "The process ... is a humanitarian and humane process and as such, it should not be politicised," Thaci said during a visit with a Serb returnee family in a village near Pristina. He added that his government will eliminate all obstacles in the process.
In other news, local media quoted NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer as saying on Wednesday that withdrawing KFOR troops from Kosovo would be premature, given the current situation. NATO defence ministers will discuss the mission when they meet in Brussels next week. (Epoka e Re, Telegrafi, Kosovalive - 03/06/09; RTK, Kohavision, Klan, Telegrafi - 02/06/09)

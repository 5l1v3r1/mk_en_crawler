ZAGREB, Croatia -- Hague war crimes indictee Mladen Markac, who is on trial along with generals Ivan Cermak and Ante Gotovina for war crimes against Serb civilians in the 1995 Operation Storm, has violated rules for house arrest, Croatian media reported on Wednesday (December 26th). Pictures have surfaced that apparently show Markac hunting wild bear over the weekend, together with Interior Minister Ivica Kirin and other senior officials. Authorities, however, claim the photos were actually taken four years ago. (B92, Tanjug, Javno.com, HRT - 26/12/07; Index.hr, 24 Sata - 25/12/07)

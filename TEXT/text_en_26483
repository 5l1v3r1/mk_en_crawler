NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Authorities pressed charges Thursday (October 8th) against three people suspected in the deaths of three newborns, as a result of Legionnaires' disease in a Nicosia clinic. The three clinic employees are charged with failing to take additional measures to maintain good hygiene and protect patients in the institution. In all, 11 babies were contaminated with Legionnaires' disease at the Ippocration Hospital in January. Eight survived. The clinic was closed after laboratory analysis proved a high concentration of the dangerous bacteria was in the water-supply and the maternity ward. (Famagusta Gazette, BTA - 09/10/09)

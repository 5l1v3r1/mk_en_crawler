BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Belgrade prosecution announced on Sunday (27 November) that it has ordered a police investigation into alleged attempts to bribe deputies in the Serbian Parliament. Prosecutors say money was offered in exchange for a vote against the government's draft budget for 2006 that is to be discussed by the legislature this week. On Saturday, Democratic Party of Serbia member Milos Aligrudic accused Bogoljub Karic, leader of the non-parliamentary Power of Serbia Movement, of trying to "buy" votes. 
In other news, the Serbian government has withdrawn poems glorifying war crimes indictees Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, which would otherwise have been sent to UNESCO for possible inclusion in its world heritage list. The poems, mostly historical epic verse, were recorded by the Serbian Cultural Institute, an independent group. (Politika, Danas, Blic- 28/11/05; Beta, RTS, BBC - 27/11/05)

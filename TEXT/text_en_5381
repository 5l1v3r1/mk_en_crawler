The first direct elections for Serbia's Minority Council were held earlier this month. More than 400,000 members of different ethnicities went to the polls, and officials are hailing the vote as a major step forward. Some minority representatives, however, say they are not fully satisfied with how the elections were organised. Biljana Pekusic reports from Belgrade.

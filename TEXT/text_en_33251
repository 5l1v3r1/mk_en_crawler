BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The UN war crimes tribunal confirmed that there is a "certain level of consent" to allow local Serbian courts to try low-level war criminals. Mathias Hellman, a tribunal co-ordinator, told Beograd 202 radio that while the tribunal handles more important cases, Serbian courts could easily conduct the trials of low-ranking officials and others.
In other news, the Supreme Defence Council met on Tuesday and decided to pursue full war crimes co-operation. The panel will demand that all local authorities adhere to the war crimes co-operation law. (FoNet, B92, BBC, Beta, Beograd 202 - 10/06/03)

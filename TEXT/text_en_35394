ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Turkey-EU Joint Parliamentary Commission Co-chairman Joost Lagendijk said on Sunday (18 April) that religious diversity would strengthen the EU and that Turkey's membership would be helpful in this respect. The issue of the Union's primary religion has been discussed in relation to the EU Constitution. Lagendijk said that most politicians and decision-makers seem to agree that religion is a private issue, unrelated to politics. (Anadolu Agency, NTV - 18/04/04)

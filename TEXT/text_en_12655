BUCHAREST, Romania -- The vice chairman of the European Socialists Group at the European Parliament, Jan Marinus Wiersma, said Friday (4 March) that he expects Romania to seal the EU accession treaty in April as scheduled. Wiersma, who met with representatives of the main opposition Social Democratic Party in Bucharest, said that he did not view the introduction of the safeguard clause for Romania as a discriminatory practice. Rather, he said, it is a guarantee that reforms would be implemented. (Rompres - 04/03/05)

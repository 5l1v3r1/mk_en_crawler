PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme said on Tuesday (March 9th) in Pristina that visa liberalisation depends on the recognition of Kosovo's independence by countries in the Schengen zone. "Independence needs to be recognised by all countries," Leterme said. Belgium assumes the rotating EU presidency from Spain on July 1st and Leterme has said the Balkans will be a priority.

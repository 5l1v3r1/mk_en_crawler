SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling said Tuesday (21 March) that he plans to overturn predecessor Paddy Ashdown's sackings of public officials. "Removals have played an important role in helping BiH emerge from the aftermath of war," said Schwarz-Schilling. "However, as BiH moves towards Euro-Atlantic integration, [and] as judicial and democratic processes strengthen, there are compelling reasons why these bans should be lifted," he added. The new measures would not apply to those who obstructed BiH's co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
Also Tuesday, Schwarz-Schilling warned that a failure of the BiH Parliament to adopt crucial constitutional changes would represent a major step backwards for the country. On Monday, three small Bosniak parties said they would not support reforms finally hammered out by the seven main parties at the weekend.

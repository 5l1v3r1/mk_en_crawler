TIRANA, Albania -- Ships and helicopters scoured the Albanian coastline Monday (12 January), using a break in the weather to search for more victims of a boat incident that killed at least 21 illegal immigrants attempting to reach Italy. The government stepped up rescue efforts, tripling the number of ships involved in the search to 12, amid reports that at least seven, and as many as 16 people, were still missing after Friday's accident near Vlora. The accident occurred when the engine of the boat failed, leaving it stranded amid 20-foot waves. The boat was not located until Saturday morning. Most of the 21 known victims died of exposure, and were found in or near the craft. But others have been reported missing, and relatives insist that authorities keep searching. The government declared Monday a day of national mourning for the victims. At least four senior police officers have been suspended or arrested in the ongoing investigation.

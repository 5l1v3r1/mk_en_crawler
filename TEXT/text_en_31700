BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- The director of the Yugoslav tyre and rubber company, Trajal, told a local news agency on Saturday (11 January) that his factory exported gas masks to Iraq. Zavisa Jovanovic explained that the state had received some $16.5m from the deal and demanded that the money be transferred to his firm so that it could pay off its debts. He did not specify whether the exports were made before sanctions were imposed on Baghdad in 1991 or whether the UN had authorised the exports. (AP - 11/01/03)

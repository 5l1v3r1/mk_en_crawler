PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Michael Steiner announced Thursday (15 May) that the province's president, assembly members and government officials will not be allowed to attend several NATO and EU meetings. The announcement came after lawmakers approved a declaration that said the Kosovo Liberation Army fought a "righteous war against Serb military, police and paramilitary forces for the liberation of Kosovo". Steiner characterised the declaration as "divisive" and said it undermined parliament's reconciliatory spirit. Serb deputies walked out in protest of the declaration.
In other news, UN police reported the arrest of a war crimes suspect wanted for atrocities committed in the Pec area in 1999. The man's identity was not revealed. (AFP, KosovaLive, BBC, Tanjug, B92, FoNet - 15/05/03)

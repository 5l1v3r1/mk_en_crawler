SOFIA, Bulgaria -- An ad-hoc committee of parliament, formed to assess whether there are legal grounds for criminal charges against Volen Siderov, leader of the ultranationalist Attack coalition, decided on Wednesday (31 May) that Siderov's immunity must be lifted to allow the probe to proceed. The full legislature must now vote on the matter. At issue is a highway incident in April, in which Siderov allegedly urged his driver to assault a fellow motorist, then lie about it.

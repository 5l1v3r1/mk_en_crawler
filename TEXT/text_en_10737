THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Slobodan Milosevic calls his first witness before the UN tribunal on Tuesday (7 September). The court session is expected to become a turning point in the trial, as it will be the first one in which court-appointed lawyers will conduct the questioning. Milosevic has vowed to appeal the appointment of the two British barristers, but tribunal officials said no formal complaint had been lodged as of Monday night. (AFP - 06/09/04)

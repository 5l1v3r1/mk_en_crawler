BITOLA, Macedonia -- A group of Kosovo Roma stormed the Macedonian-Greek border on Thursday (17 July) in an attempt to cross into Greece. They clashed with police, throwing stones and bottles at officers, who in turn swung rubber batons and fired into the air. Around 70 Roma were injured. Hundreds set up a temporary camp near the Medzitlija border crossing two months ago, awaiting crossing. (Dnevnik, VEST - 18/07/03; MIA -17/07/03)

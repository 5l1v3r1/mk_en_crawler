BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU reportedly has asked the UN to consider two candidates for the post of UN representative in Kosovo, currently held by Michael Steiner. According to a report Tuesday (17 June), the candidates are Sweden's permanent representative to the UN, Pierre Schori, and Italian diplomat Antonio Armellini. The EU is entitled to appoint the next UNMIK chief because it is the biggest donor to Kosovo.
Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic, meanwhile, told the French daily <I>Le Figaro </I> that Belgrade and Pristina would not be able to find a solution regarding the status of Kosovo on their own. "Only the strong involvement of the EU and the United States can make a solution emerge," he said. (Reuters, AFP - 17/06/03)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged allies to make good on promises to combat the terrorist organisation Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in northern Iraq, during a speech to an international business forum in Istanbul on Wednesday (July 4th). "We want them to move from words into action," said Erdogan, adding that it was not sufficient to just designate the PKK a terrorist group. Ankara has repeatedly voiced disappointment with what it perceives as reluctance on the part of Iraqi and US authorities to mount large-scale operations against Kurdish rebel bases in northern Iraq. 
In other news, the former commander of the Turkish Naval Forces, Ilhami Erdil, got a prison sentence of 2.5 years, for illegally acquiring wealth and damaging the military. Proceedings began after he was unable to prove the origin of $1.25m he used to buy two luxury apartments in Istanbul in 1999. (Vatan, Hurriyet, Milliyet, Zaman, DHA - 05/07/07; NTV, AP - 04/07/07)

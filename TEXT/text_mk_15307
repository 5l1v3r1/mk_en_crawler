BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A witness who testified about the murder of Serbian warlord Zeljko Raznatovic, also known as "Arkan", was shot dead by a gunman in Belgrade on Thursday (27 April). According to media reports, former Loznica police chief Vojislav Jekic, 58, was gunned down in front of a cafe on a crowded Belgrade street. The killer, described by witnesses as a young man, ran away. Local media reports say the slaying is likely connected with Jekic's testimony regarding a triple murder at the Intercontinental Hotel in January 2000 -- when "Arkan" and other two men were shot dead.

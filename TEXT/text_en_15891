NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Sunday's (21 May) parliamentary elections in Cyprus suggest growing support for the centrist Democratic Party (DIKO) of President Tassos Papadopoulos, which has threatened to block Turkey's efforts to join the EU. According to official results, election turnout was 89 per cent of 501,024 eligible voters. DIKO was backed by 17.91 per cent of the voters, a level of support more than 3 percentage points better than in the last parliamentary elections in 2001. Although DIKO was actually third -- after the communist AKEL with 31.16 per cent and the right-wing DISY with 30.33 per cent -- the party will gain extra seat in the 56-member parliament.

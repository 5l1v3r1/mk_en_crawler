SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The state anti-corruption commission announced on Tuesday (22 August) that denationalisation deals involving real estate in the Skopje region resulted in losses to the state totalling 5m euros. In a statement, the commission said the affair involved tax, cadastre and denationalisation officials, as well as notaries during the period 2001-2006. No names were disclosed publicly but the anti-corruption panel has approached prosecutors regarding the matter. Denationalisation is a process aimed at returning property seized during the communist era to its rightful owners. (Vecer - 23/08/06; Makfax - 22/08/06)

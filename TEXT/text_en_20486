SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Raffi Gregorian, principal deputy high representative in BiH, said on Monday (December 10th) that the numerous raids on the homes Radovan Karadzic's relatives, prove that -- contrary to their claims -- they have been in contact with and are helping him. The former Bosnian Serb political leader, charged with genocide and war crimes by the UN tribunal in The Hague, has been a fugitive for 12 years. 
Meanwhile, the UN tribunal sentenced former Bosnian Serb General Dragomir Milosevic to 33 years in prison Wednesday. Milosevic was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity for directing the 44-month siege of Sarajevo that resulted in more than 10,000 deaths during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
Also at The Hague, a US expert on propaganda testified at Serbian nationalist leader Vojislav Seselj's trial Tuesday. Anthony Oberschall, who said he had analysed 400 texts and speeches by the defendant, testified that Seselj incited xenophobia and violence against non-Serbs. Seselj is charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity including murder, torture, deportations and cruel treatment of non-Serbs in BiH, Croatia and Serbia's northern province, Vojvodina.

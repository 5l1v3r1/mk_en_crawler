ATHENS, Greece -- New Employment and Social Protection Minister Fanni Palli-Petralia was sworn in on Monday (December 17th) after her predecessor, Vassilios Magginas, resigned last week amid a series of scandals. Media reports indicated that Magginas hired illegal immigrants to work in his house and had built a second house in an Athens suburb in violation of city planning rules.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The head of the European Commission Liaison Office, Renzo Daviddi, called on Thursday (October 29th) for better public procurement practices in Kosovo. During a meeting with parliamentary, government and public procurement officials, Daviddi said "the European Commission (EC) has identified public procurement as a big concern. I am happy that Kosovo authorities are trying to address the negative findings of the EC progress report." According to Daviddi, current procurement legislation falls short of European standards.

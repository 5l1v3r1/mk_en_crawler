SKOPJE, Macedonia -- After more than two weeks of debate, parliament voted Wednesday (11 August) to adopt a new decentralisation law that would grant greater powers to local governments. In all, 61 lawmakers in the 120-seat chamber supported the bill and seven deputies voted against it. The opposition walked out in protest. The new law would also redraw the borders of several districts and give greater powers to ethnic Albanians in the municipalities in which they are a majority. They would be able to use their language in transactions with the local administration in these areas. The new law is viewed as a major step towards full implementation of the Ohrid Accords. Lawmakers are expected to continue debating the remaining bills in the decentralisation package Thursday and Friday. (Makfax, A1 TV, Dnevnik - 12/08/04; AFP - 11/08/04)

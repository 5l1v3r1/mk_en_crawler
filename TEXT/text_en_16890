CEYHAN, Turkey -- Engineers have begun final tests of the first pipeline to carry Caspian oil to the Mediterranean. The British Petroleum-led Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline will be opened formally on 13 July, but it began pumping Azeri oil into a British tanker on Friday (2 June). The $4 billion project, part of an effort to create alternative oil routes and ease dependence on sources in the Middle East, was launched in 1990 and is running one year behind schedule.

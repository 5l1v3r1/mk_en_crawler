SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A Bosnian court pressed charges Monday (December 31st) against former Serbian General Novak Djukic for his alleged involvement in mass murders during the 1992-1995 conflict. Prosecutors say that on May 25th 1995 he supervised the shelling of Tuzla in the northwest part of the country. A single round fired by the Republika Sprska army hit the centre of town, killing 71 mostly young people and injuring dozens of others. Djukic, 52, was arrested two months ago in Banja Luka.

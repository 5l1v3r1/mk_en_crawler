BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Adrian Nastase has asked all ministers to present concrete, radical measures for combating corruption, according to government spokesperson Despina Neagoe. The request came as European Commission delegation chief Jonathan Scheele echoed comments by outgoing US Ambassador to Romania Michael Guest, who said Romania continues to be plagued by widespread corruption. In a press statement Thursday (8 July), Scheele said Romania lacks a clear perception that no one is above the law. He praised Guest for his role in the anti-corruption campaign.

VIENNA, Austria -- The OSCE/Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) has launched its monitoring mission for the July 22nd parliamentary elections in Turkey, the daily Zaman reported Saturday (June 30th). The 13-member mission, led by the Brit Julian Peel Yates, has already held talks with the main parties. Normally, such observation missions are launched approximately one week before the actual vote. OSCE/ODIHR reportedly decided to begin earlier because of extraordinary circumstances in Turkey â specifically, the Turkish legislature's failure to elect a new president, and the recent escalation of Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) terrorism.

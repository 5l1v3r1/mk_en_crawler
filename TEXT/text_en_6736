The Kokino megalithic observatory in Macedonia was discovered in 2001 by archeologist Jovica Stankovski, and is believed to be almost 4,000 years old. 
The name Kokino comes from the closest human settlement on Mount Tatic Rock. The term "megalithic" is coined from "mega" or large and "litos" or stone, which reflects Kokino's large and magnificent rocks. 
In 2005, the site was listed as the world's fourth megalithic observatory, according to NASA. 
It is not known who created the observatory, but its existence could have enormous significance. 
The site is being searched for a written alphabet, which, if found, will offer much needed clues in explaining early human civilisation and organisation. 
The observatory is made of spiky rocks of volcanic extraction, positioned step-like on several levels. Archeologists say that at the observatory's peak there are thrones facing east for the most important people in the settlement to observe the heavens. 
Close to the thrones is an "aim" consisting of two vertical rocks with a vertical crack between them. The early inhabitants followed the movements of the sun through the aim. 
Archeologists discovered other aims which had different uses than the main one. One of the aims is located to the right side of the thrones and enabled a person to view the sun in a standing position during particular days. 
There are several pathways built to move around the early observatory and a "room" naturally fenced off at the observatory's very peak where the aim is located.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Finance Minister Trajko Slaveski announced on Monday (January 29th) that Macedonia would begin early repayment of its debt to the Paris Club of creditors. The first $50m would be paid to the United States and Kuwait. The debt servicing is to be completed by April, when bilateral agreements with 13 member-states would be signed. Slaveski says the move would result in considerable savings to the state budget over the next five years. The total Paris Club debt accounts for 13.7% of Macedonia's external debt.

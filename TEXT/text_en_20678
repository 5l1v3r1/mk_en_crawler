ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday (January 8th) he will ask Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinejad to resume natural gas supplies to Turkey. The supplies were cut earlier this week due to cold weather and a decline in natural gas flows from Turkmenistan. The cuts have caused serious gas shortages in many parts of Turkey.

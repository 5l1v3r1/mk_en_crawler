PRISTINA, Kosovo -- KFOR will protect Kosovo's cultural heritage, Commander Erhard Buhler said during a visit to Mitrovica on Tuesday (November 9th), where he met with the Muslim community to discuss the security situation. Buhler refused to comment on rebuilding a mosque that remains destroyed since the war in 1999, but confirmed KFOR's commitment to protect all cultural heritage sites. As for possible consequences of the increased presence of KFOR, EULEX and Kosovo police in northern Kosovo, Buhler said it is too early to discuss results.

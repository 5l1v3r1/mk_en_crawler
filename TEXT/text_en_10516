BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Bosnian Serb police launched an operation in Bijeljina on Saturday (16 October) in search of an unidentified war crimes suspect. The police said in a statement that officers raided several homes in the town, acting on a tip-off from the UN war crimes tribunal. No one was arrested in the operation. Local media reported that one of the searched apartments belonged to Ljubomir Borovcanin, a Serb commander who is wanted for his role in the Srebrenica massacre. 
Meanwhile, SFOR troops searched a hotel in Banja Luka which belongs to the Bosnian Serb military. A spokesman for the peacekeepers said the raid was carried out "in accordance with SFOR's mandate and mission to ensure a safe and secure environment in BiH". 
In other news, Republika Srpska (RS) spokesman for Prime Minister Goran Radivojac said Friday that he is not satisfied with the work of the entity's secretariat for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal and expects newly-appointed acting director Janko Velimirovic to improve the level of co-operation. RS President Dragan Cavic, meanwhile, again urged all war crimes indictees to turn themselves in, saying RS needs to free itself from the burden of non-co-operation with The Hague.

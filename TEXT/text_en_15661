SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The launch of the new ferryboat line Nikopol-Turnu Magurele between Bulgaria and Romania will be postponed from this month to next April, the project's chief engineer on the Bulgarian side, Krum Yanev, announced on Saturday (19 August). He explained that high water levels on the Danube had delayed construction. The EU is financing 75 per cent of the 5m-euro project under the PHARE programme for trans-border co-operation.

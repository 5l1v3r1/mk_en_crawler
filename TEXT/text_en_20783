BUCHAREST, Romania -- Conservative Party (PC) leader Dan Voiculescu announced his resignation from the Senate on Thursday (September 6th) saying he could not implement projects he promised to his constituents, including a series of proposed social measures. Voiculescu says he plans to retain his PC post and remain in politics.
Also Thursday, severe flooding in parts of eastern Romania claimed at least four lives. Several other people are listed as missing. Hundreds of houses were damaged in the Vrancea, Bacau and Vaslui districts, where emergency crews have been dispatched to provide food and water. Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu visited some of the villages, saying damage was far greater than anticipated. (Mediafax, Hotnews.ro, Reuters, AFP - 06/09/07)

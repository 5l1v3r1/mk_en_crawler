BUCHAREST, Romania -- A bitter row between the president and prime minister has brought Romania to the brink of early elections. Late Wednesday (January 17th), President Traian Basescu showed journalists a note Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu wrote him in 2005, asking Basescu to intercede with prosecutors on behalf of a prominent businessman accused of tax evasion and fraud. "The prime minister suggested a partnership with the oligarchs to lean on the justice system, which was unacceptable to me," Basescu said. 
Tariceanu in turn accused the president of lying and of being "surrounded by interest groups that control the public works". He also accused the president of attempting to destroy Tariceanu's government and party. Basescu's Democrats are coalition partners with Tariceanu's National Liberal Party. Experts now expect that an election could be scheduled to coincide with the European Parliament vote in May. 
The opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) is demanding that both the president and prime minister resign. It has threatened to launch impeachment proceedings against Basescu and a no-confidence vote against Tariceanu if they refuse.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Police announced on Saturday (June 12th) the arrest of Albin Kurti, leader of the Vetevendosje (Self-Determination) movement. Kurti faces charges stemming from a protest in February 2007 that turned violent, leaving two protestors dead and dozens injured. His trial has been postponed eight times over his failure to appear in court, to protest international missions that don't recognise Kosovo's independence. He was arrested after a Saturday press conference in Pristina, where he said his movement will participate in next year's parliamentary elections as a political party. Protests after his arrest injured 12 police officers and three activists, and damaged several police and EULEX vehicles. (Tanjug, B92 - 12/06/10)

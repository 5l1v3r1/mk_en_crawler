PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX staff members will soon begin relocating to Serb-dominated northern Kosovo, the EU rule of law mission announced Wednesday (January 27th). The process is part of a strategy drafted by the government and the International Civilian Office to retain institutional control over a part of the country where Belgrade-backed "parallel structures" are in place. EULEX spokesperson Karin Limdal said the goal is to return local judges and prosecutors to Mitrovica's district court. (Zeri, Koha Ditore, Kosova Sot, Express - 28/01/10)

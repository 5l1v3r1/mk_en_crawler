ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Supreme Court on Wednesday (June 3rd) lifted a ban that prohibited the use of marijuana for treating post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a disease that is fairly common among veterans of the 1991-1995 war. The decision automatically acquitted a Croat national who was sentenced to one year in prison for growing a small amount of marijuana in the town of Virovitica, about 100km from Zagreb. The court weighed the fact that the man suffers from PTSD and that marijuana eased his psychological problems. Between 10,000 and 18,000 Croats who fought in the country's independence war are diagnosed with PTSD. (Vecernji List, DPA, Croatian Times - 04/06/09)

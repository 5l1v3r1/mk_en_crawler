BUCHAREST, Romania -- The opposition filed a no-confidence motion against the cabinet on Wednesday (March 9th) after the government decided to initiate an emergency procedure over the labour code. The no-confidence vote will take place on March 16th, Deputies Chamber leader Roberta Anastase announced on Tuesday. Mircea Dusa, leader of the Social Democratic Party's group in parliament, told a press conference Wednesday that the motion "criticises the abusive manner in which the Boc government tries to pass this draft law .... which is not urgent at all". Prime Minister Emil Boc addressed parliament Tuesday, asking for a confidence vote on this accountability procedure and obtained it though opposition lawmakers refused to participate.

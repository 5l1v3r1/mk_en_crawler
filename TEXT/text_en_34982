GENEVA, Switzerland -- Attending an IT forum on Wednesday (10 December), Croatian President Stipe Mesic said the government plans to extend the duration beyond New Year's the visa free regime for citizens of Serbia-Montenegro. The liberalised tourist traffic initially was designed to boost summer tourism, as well as December holiday trips. Mesic, however, explained that both the outgoing government and Prime Minister designate Ivo Sanader agreed to extend the regime to avoid problems with return trips in January.
In other news Wednesday, IMF mission chief in Croatia Hans Flickenschild said he expects Sanader's government to maintain good relations with the Fund. The current standby agreement with Croatia expires next year. (HINA, HRT, Vjesnik - 10/12/03)

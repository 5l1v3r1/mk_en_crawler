Like mushrooms in a forest, Enver Hoxha's bunkers still stand as a reminder of the country's communist past. One can find beach bunkers, gun pillboxes, mountain bunkers and underground facilities throughout Albania. 
More than 600,000 concrete bunkers were built between 1950 and 1985 to protect the Stalinist regime. The bunkers were placed in the most remote places. They served not only as a possible defence for enemy attacks, but also as a constant reminder of the country's dictatorship. 
The bunkers were built to be strong and mobile so they could be placed by a crane or a helicopter in a hole. The prototype of the bunker was developed in the 1950s. According to some records, the engineer of the bunker was inside while it was attacked by a tank to test its strength. The engineer survived and the bunkers were put into mass production. 
In 2004, the Albanian government found a stockpile of forgotten chemical weapons hidden in one of Hoxha's bunkers. The weapons were eventually destroyed with the help of the United States. 
Now, the bunkers have little military use but often serve as a place to store farm equipment or as a private meeting place for lovers.

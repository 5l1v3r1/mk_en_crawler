SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- European Parliament (EP) Rapporteur on visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans Tanja Fajon urged BiH authorities on Thursday (October 1st) to work harder to meet the remaining conditions in the country's EU visa liberalisation road map. Passing amendments to the criminal code and the laws on the Court of BiH and the Prosecutor's Office are among the tasks. Fajon told a press conference in Sarajevo that she will submit a report to the EP on BiH's progress towards meeting the criteria. She wants BiH and Albania included in the visa-free regime that is already being offered to Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro. (Dnevni Avaz, Srna, BHRT, Fena, Sarajevo-x.com - 01/10/09)

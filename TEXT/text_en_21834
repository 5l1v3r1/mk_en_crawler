NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat on Sunday (November 23rd) warned Russia to refrain from any initiatives that would harm ongoing negotiations aimed at reunifying Cyprus. He was referring to a memorandum of understanding signed last week by Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and his Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev. The document underscored "the need for a comprehensive, just and viable settlement [to the Cyprus question] on the basis of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions". Russia is a permanent member of the Council. Talat said that by signing the memorandum, the Greek Cypriots had breached their promise not to deviate from the line reached before the talks.
Meanwhile, UN special envoy for Cyprus Alexander Downer expressed optimism about prospects for reunification. In an interview Sunday with the daily Politis, he stressed that both Christofias and Talat want to realise the model of a bi-zonal federation.

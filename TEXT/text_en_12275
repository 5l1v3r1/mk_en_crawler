BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro will establish a panel to investigate the deadly shooting of an ethnic Albanian teenager in the Presevo area, Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic said Wednesday (12 January). It will include senior government, army, police and local officials. Ljajic said he hoped ethnic Albanian representatives would join the panel. Reports in local media, meanwhile, say NATO has praised the way Belgrade authorities responded to the weekend incident.
In other news, Serbia's Supreme Court ordered a retrial for a former Serb police officer who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for war crimes. Sasa Cvjetan was convicted for his role in the slaying of 19 ethnic Albanians, including women and children. (AFP, Beta, B92 - 12/01/05)

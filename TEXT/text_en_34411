SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government's junior partner, the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), agreed that the Macedonian Army should operate across the country and support police in security or anti-terrorist missions. Agreement was reached at a Friday (17 October) meeting of DUI General Secretary Gezim Ostreni, Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski and Brigadier General James Baxter, director of NATO's advisory team to Macedonia. DUI's consent enables the government to adopt the Strategic Defence Contract, a key document related to Macedonia's bid for NATO membership. (Dnevnik - 18/10/03; MTV1 - 17/10/03)

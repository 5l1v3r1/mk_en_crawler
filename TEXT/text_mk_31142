TIRANA, Albania -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele is confirming that Albania has been denied candidate status because of its longstanding political stalemate. The ruling Democratic Party (DP) and the opposition Socialist Party (SP) have been wrangling since the June 2009 general elections, which the SP insists were manipulated and require a thorough investigation. But the DP refuses to conduct them under such broad conditions. "It is one of the main political criteria, the Copenhagen Criteria, which is linked with the political stalemate that affects the functioning of democratic institutions, such as the parliament," Fuele told the BBC on Tuesday (January 4th). Commenting on accusations exchanged between the two sides, Fuele said that responsibility lies with both of them. (News 24, Balkan Web, NOA, Telegrafi - 04/01/11)

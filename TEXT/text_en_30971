PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The vacant post of the EU Special Representative (EUSR) in Kosovo will be filled by one of 13 candidates on a short list, the Koha Ditore daily reported on Wednesday (May 4th). However, there is limited interest among European officials, and according to the newspaper, some have even turned down the offer to run for the post. The EUSR is expected to also cover the European Commission Liaison office in some capacity. (Koha Ditore, Kosova Sot, Express, Lajm, Zeri - 04/05/11)

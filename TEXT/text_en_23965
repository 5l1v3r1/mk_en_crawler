ATHENS, Greece -- A small anarchist group, calling itself Conspiracy of Fire Nuclei, claimed responsibility on Friday (July 17th) for a bomb attack targeting former Deputy Interior Minister Panagiotis Hinofotis, media reported. A small homemade bomb exploded on July 11th outside Hinofotis' home in the Athens district of Paleo Faliro. The blast damaged cars parked outside the building, but caused no injuries. In a statement published on the internet, the militant group said the attack was designed to avenge police violence against street rioters during last December's unrest triggered by the killing of a teenager by a police officer. The group threatened new attacks, and warned that the newly appointed head of the National Intelligence Service, Dimitris Papangelopoulos, could be its next target. 
In other news, police in Thessaloniki said on Saturday they have detained the head of a major international human trafficking ring. The suspect, a 51-year-old Greek national, was arrested early Saturday, along with an accomplice and eight Chinese illegal immigrants. Police officers described the operation as the largest anti-human trafficking action in the Balkans. (ANA-MPA, In.news, Naftemporiki, Kathimerini, AP - 18/07/09; ANA-MPA, Naftemporiki - 17/07/09)

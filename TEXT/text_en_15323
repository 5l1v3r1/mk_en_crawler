BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The first phase of the EU screening of Croatia's legislation under the Transport chapter of the acquis chapter began in Brussels on Monday (26 June). During the four-day talks, European Commission representatives will acquaint the Croatian side with the relevant legal framework, standards, markets and infrastructure issues. Stage two of the screening is expected in September. 
In other news, governors of Croatian counties and municipalities backed the cabinet's plan to launch public and private partnerships in regional infrastructure projects. Prime Minister Ivo Sanader says the involvement of private investors in projects of public interest -- such as building hospitals, schools and sports facilities -- could save the country up to 552m euros a year.

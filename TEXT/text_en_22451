PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci says his government will open Kosovo's first three diplomatic missions abroad in New York, Washington and Brussels immediately after the new constitution takes effect on June 15th. He told reporters Thursday (April 10th) that the government intends to open 20 embassies this year, most of them in Europe.
On Thursday, the government held a session in Mitrovica focusing on the security situation there. Thaci insisted that his cabinet would not allow northern Kosovo to become an oasis for crime. (Express, Zeri, Koha Ditore - 11/04/08, BBC - 10/04/08)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The tripartite presidency ordered the military Wednesday (10 March) to send a mine-clearing team to Iraq. It will be the first time soldiers from the two entities will take part in a mission abroad together. The 36-man team will be deployed by 1 September.
In other news, High Representative Paddy Ashdown criticised the Bosnian Serb government for nominating "joke" candidates to the post of state defence minister. Two have already been disqualified because of their war records. The third candidate, Nikola Radovanovic, was nominated on Tuesday. He must be vetted by Ashdown's office, SFOR and the UN war crimes tribunal before being formally appointed. Ashdown also warned that BiH is jeopardising its chances for membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace programme and the EU. On Wednesday, he met with the new EU Police Mission chief Bartholomew Kevin Carty. They stressed that there could be no European future for BiH without a professional and independent police force.
Meanwhile, SFOR has released retired General Bogdan Subotic, a former aide to fugitive Radovan Karadzic. In a statement, however, SFOR said it would continue to investigate the former Bosnian Serb defence minister's links to Karadzic's network of supporters.

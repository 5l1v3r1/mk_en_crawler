SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Security Minister Barisa Colak told the Sarajevo daily <I>Dnevni Avaz</I> that "any criminal from Serbia trying to hide in BiH will be arrested." In an interview Tuesday (22 April), Colak and BiH State Border Service Chief Nijaz Spahic said concerns expressed by US Ambassador to BiH Clifford Bond are justified. Bond worries that criminals from Serbia might try to hide in BiH once the state of emergency in Serbia is lifted. The two top BiH security officials said that all necessary measures have been taken to prevent criminals from crossing into the country.
In other news Monday, the head of the Republika Srpska (RS) Army HQ, Maj Gen Cvetko Savic, said that the disbanding of the controversial 410 intelligence unit has been completed. RS President Dragan Cavic ordered the move earlier this month, after SFOR raids turned up evidence of illegal spying. (Dnevni Avaz, OHR Sources - 22/04/03; RTRS - 21/04/03)

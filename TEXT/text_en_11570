LONDON, United Kingdom -- EUFOR Commander Major General David Leakey said Saturday (22 January) that the force will intensify the hunt for indicted war criminals in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), cracking down on their support network and conducting search operations "on an industrial scale". Up to 2,000 troops would participate in each EUFOR operation, he said. On Friday, EUFOR set up a checkpoint near the Croatia-BiH border and inspected all vehicles passing through.

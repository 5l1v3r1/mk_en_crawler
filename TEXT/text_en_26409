ZAGREB, Croatia -- Outgoing President Stipe Mesic walked out of a TV interview Thursday (February 11th), visibly angry with the line of questioning regarding his relationship with state prosecutor Mladen Bajic. The interview with journalist Ivana Brkic -- taped for the RTL channel -- was to be broadcast on Sunday. When Mesic was asked if he supports the re-election of state prosecutor Mladen Bajic "since [Bajic] has a grip on him", the clearly infuriated politician stood up and left the set. Mesic leaves office next week. (DPA, Index.hr, Vecernji List, Jutarnji List - 11/02/10)

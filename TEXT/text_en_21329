SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- War crimes prosecutors announced on Tuesday (August 26th) the indictment of Zoran Tomic for genocide, stemming from his alleged role in the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre. Tomic, 37, also known as Zgembo, was arrested in early June near the town of Zvornik in eastern BiH. He was a member of a special police unit in Republika Srpska that was active in the Srebrenica region. According to the indictment, as a member of the unit, he participated in operations aimed at deporting Muslims from villages in the Srebrenica area and capturing thousands of Muslim men and boys who tried to escape imprisonment. Tomic also allegedly participated in the murders of about 1,000 Muslims in a warehouse. (Beta, B92, Reuters - 26/08/08)

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal said on Wednesday (19 April) that it is waiting for Belgrade to fulfil its promise to hand over top indictee Ratko Mladic by 30 April. Prosecution spokesman Anton Nikiforov noted that Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica made a pledge to chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte in late March.
In other news Wednesday, the lawyer for a former Republika Srpska Army colonel suspected of aiding Mladic says his client must be either formally indicted next week or released after three months in detention. Jovo Djogo and another former Bosnian Serb officer, Sasa Badnjar, were arrested at the end of January. (B92, UPI, FoNet, Beta - 19/04/06)

VIENNA, Austria -- Croatia could join the EU in 2011 or 2012, Austrian Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger said on Saturday (May 2nd) in an interview with Austrian newspaper Tiroler Tageszeitung. There is hope that Croatia's accession negotiations with the EU could be unblocked soon, while, until recently, this was impossible due to the country's border dispute with Slovenia, the minister said. Spindelegger said all Western Balkan countries should be considered for EU membership, but the timeline for their accession is very broad. (Tiroler Tageszeitung, Makfax, Focus - 02/05/09)

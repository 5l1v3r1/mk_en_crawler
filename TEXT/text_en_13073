THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal's trial chamber rejected on Friday (24 February) a request by Slobodan Milosevic for provisional release while he undergoes medical treatment in Moscow for high blood pressure and heart problems. According to the tribunal judges, there are insufficient guarantees that the former Yugoslav president, standing trial for crimes against humanity in Croatia and Kosovo and genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), would return to The Hague.
In other news Friday, former Bosnian Serb paramilitary commander Milan Lukic made his first appearance before the tribunal, pleading not guilty to charges of crimes against humanity. The charges stem from a series of atrocities committed in eastern BiH in 1992-1994. Earlier in the week, Lukic was extradited to The Hague from Argentina, where he was detained last summer.

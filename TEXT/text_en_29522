ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Supreme Court on Monday (May 31st) started discussing an appeal of the sentence handed down to former parliament member Branimir Glavas. In May of last year, he was sentenced to ten years in prison for war crimes against ethnic Serbs in the city of Osijek in 1991. Soon after his conviction, Glavas fled to neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina. Both the prosecution and the defence are appealing the sentence: the former arguing ten years is too short, the latter arguing it is too long. The Supreme Court is expected to rule in a month.

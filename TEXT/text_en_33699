ANKARA, Turkey -- Stability in Iraq is more important to local citizens than to Turkey and Turkey will participate in achieving it only at Baghdad's invitation, said Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul. His comment Thursday (4 September) was in response to one by his Iraqi counterpart, Hoshyar Zebari, who said Iraq's administration does not welcome peacekeeping forces from neighbouring countries. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Zebari's view is not conducive to co-operation. (Anadolu Agency, NTV, TRT 2 - 04/09/03)

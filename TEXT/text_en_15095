SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Bosniak member of the BiH presidency, Sulejman Tihic, officially took over the rotating chairmanship of the institution from Croat counterpart Ivo Miro Jovic on Tuesday (28 February). Tihic will chair the presidency for the next eight months. He said his priorities are the EU Stabilisation and Association Agreement negotiation process and BiH's bid to join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme. 
In other news, the leaders of the main eight parties were expected to meet again on Wednesday to hammer out an agreement on crucial constitutional reforms. United States Deputy Assistant of State Rosemary DiCarlo, whose country is mediating the effort, was expected to attend.
Meanwhile, the Federation of BiH Parliament elected three new cabinet ministers on Tuesday, ending a government crisis that has dragged on for weeks. The vacancies resulted in no cabinet meetings for more than a month, delaying adoption of the 2006 budget. (Nezavisne novine, Dnevni avaz - 01/03/06; Fena, PBS BiH - 28/02/06)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Democratic Party (PD) leader Emil Boc and Democratic Liberal Party (PLD) chief Theodor Stolojan announced plans late Monday (December 3rd) to merge their two main opposition parties into "a strong centre-right party" -- the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL). This is a reversal for the parties, which had ruled out any such alliance before the November 25th elections for seats in the European Parliament. The ruling National Liberal Party and the Hungarian Democratic Union in Romania say President Traian Basescu helped orchestrate the merger.

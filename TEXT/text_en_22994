VIENNA, Austria -- A court announced on Friday (May 2nd) that retired Croatian General Vladimir Zagorec will be extradited to Zagreb. His lawyers now have 14 days to appeal that decision to a higher court. They say there is new evidence that should be introduced. Zagorec has been living in Austria for the past eight years and was arrested in Vienna in March 2007, based on an international arrest warrant issued by Croatia, where his is on trial in absentia. Prosecutors say he stole 5m euros in government funds and pocketed a number of diamonds that were to be used to guarantee an illegal arms deal during the 1992-1995 conflict.

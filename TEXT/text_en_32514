SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Deputy Foreign Minister Lubomir Todorov admitted Tuesday (11 March) that the pace of EU entry talks has slowed. He attributed the failure to complete certain tasks in negotiations to slow work by local administrators: judicial reforms have been particularly affected, he said. Todorov insisted, however, there is no link between the government's position on Iraq and the pace of EU talks. (Monitor, Trud - 12/03/03, BTA, Mediapool - 11/03/03)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Conservative Party (PC) has decided to remain a junior partner in the ruling coalition for now, but will suggest to their partners a re-negotiation of the coalition agreement. This was the conclusion of a PC national council session Sunday (25 June). The PC Council also decided to replace its current party representative to the coalition government, Dan Voiculescu. He was accused recently of being an informant to the former Securitate service.

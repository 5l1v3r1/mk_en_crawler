NEW YORK, United States - UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the Pristina television station RTV 21 on Wednesday (May 30th) that the UN Security Council would make a final decision on Kosovo's status as soon as possible. He said that delays would not improve the current situation, as neither the ethnic Albanians nor the Serbs appear willing to change their positions. Throwing his support behind special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's blueprint, Ban said it contains all the necessary elements to build Kosovo's future. (Telegrafi, RTK, B92, RTS - 30/05/07)

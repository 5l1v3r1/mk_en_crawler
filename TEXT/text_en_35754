TIRANA, Albania - The Tirana District Court decided Tuesday (1 June) that Fatos Klosi, the former chief of Albania's Intelligence Service (SHISH), is not guilty of abuse of power. At issue were public tenders conducted at SHISH. A parliamentary commission established by Prime Minister Fatos Nano had been investigating Klosi since August 2002. He has consistently maintained his innocence, arguing that the charges were politically motivated. (Albanian Daily News, ATA - 02/06/04)

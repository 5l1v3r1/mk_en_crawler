SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The international community's High Representative to BiH, Paddy Ashdown, visits Banja Luka on Wednesday (2 March) to discuss police reform with Republika Srpska's (RS) leadership. Aides say Ashdown will again emphasise the importance of the reform as a pre-condition for opening talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. RS authorities have objected to certain aspects of the police-restructuring concept, particularly the abolition of entity structures. 
In other news, RS President Dragan Cavic met on Tuesday with Interior Minister Darko Matijasevic and demanded urgent improvements within the ministry, especially in terms of employees' social and economic status. (RTRS, NTV Hayat - 01/03/05)

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Bosnian Serb Parliament on Thursday (29 July) changed the names of 13 towns in the entity following a Constitutional Court ruling that the old names violated the rights of Muslims and Croats. The towns had the word "Serb" added to their names during the 1992-1995 war. Parliament decided to instead add "Republika Srpska" to the names. Thus Srpsko Sarajevo was renamed Sarajevo of Republika Srpska. Muslim lawmakers complain the changes are merely cosmetic. (Reuters, AFP - 29/07/04)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Around 13,000 police officers went on strike Thursday (February 3rd) demanding a 40% hike in salaries. Independent police union leader Velimir Barbulov said that policemen will perform the legally recognised minimum duties. "We will not do field work, except in cases of major disturbances and for rescue efforts," he pointed out. The other trade union representing police did not support the strike. Last week, teachers across Serbia walked off their jobs demanding a 24.5% hike in salaries. Doctors and pharmacists are also considering work stoppages. (B92, Beta, RTS, DPA - 03/02/11)

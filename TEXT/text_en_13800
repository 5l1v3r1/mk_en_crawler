SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The country's new justice minister, Georgi Petkanov, is optimistic that the amended penal code would be fully adopted by the end of September. Petkanov told national radio on Sunday (21 August) that he is confident that the legislation, drafted by the previous administration, would pass the parliament in the first reading by the end of August. He did not exclude the possibility of including some draft changes proposed by the Socialist Party, however. The enforcement of a new penal code by November is one of the main pre-accession obligations undertaken by Bulgaria, which expects to join the EU in 2007.
In other news, authorities in Sofia announced on Saturday that police have seized more than 250kg of amphetamines worth $40m. Three arrests were reported. (Mediapool - 22/08/05; BNR, AFP - 21/08/05)

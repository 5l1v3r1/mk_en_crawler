BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The Macedonian name issue is a long-standing issue, one best settled at the UN, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana told the European Parliament on Tuesday (April 8th). Solana expressed hope that Skopje and Athens would resolve the dispute before the end of this year. It scuttled Macedonia's bid for NATO membership at the Alliance's summit in Bucharest last week.
In response to that failure, the main ethnic Albanian opposition party in Macedonia, the Democratic Union of Albanians, officially submitted a proposal Tuesday to dissolve parliament and hold early elections. (Makfax, A1 - 08/04/08)

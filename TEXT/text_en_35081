BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament voted on Thursday (26 February) to approve the treaty on accession to NATO in April. Prime Minister Adrian Nastase called it "a historic step" and underscored Romania's contribution to the Alliance's peacekeeping efforts. Bucharest has 700 troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Afghanistan and Kosovo, as well as more than 700 soldiers in Iraq. According to Nastase, that is more than any other candidate country.
Also Thursday, Nastase submitted an action plan aimed at speeding up EU integration to Union authorities in Brussels. This was in response to recent criticism by the European Parliament about the pace of accession reforms. The government meanwhile announced that Romania's economy grew by 4.9 per cent in 2003. Construction provided the biggest boost, with a growth rate of 7 per cent. (AFP, Adevarul, Rompres - 26/02/04)

COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov and Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou met informally Thursday (December 17th) in Copenhagen on the sidelines of the ongoing Climate Change Conference. Ivanov praised the established dialogue between the two countries on their name dispute and stressed that this should help boost mutual confidence. He stressed that the problem Greece has with Macedonia's name stems from past prejudices, adding he hopes Athens will stop blocking Macedonia's EU bid.
Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Bundestag lawmakers on Thursday that the EU's accession talks with Macedonia and Iceland are expected to start in 2010. She briefed them on talks at last week's EU summit in Brussels, as well as at the Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. (MIA, A1, Sitel - 17/12/09)

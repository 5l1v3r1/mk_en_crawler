SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The NATO HQ Commander in BiH, US Brigadier General Louis Weber, says war crimes indictees Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic are probably not in BiH. In an interview in Saturday's (21 January) edition of the Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje, Weber said that he was almost certain the fugitives were elsewhere. He added that NATO is working continuously to resolve the matter.
On Friday, Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic said Belgrade would invite UN investigators to join local authorities in the hunt for Mladic. UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte insisted again on Thursday that Mladic is in Serbia. (Oslobodjenje, RTRS - 21/01/06; AP - 20/01/06)

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias once came out against the creation of two states in Cyprus and supported a bi-communal federation, local media reported on Sunday (December 7th). In a speech during an event organised by his Communist Party (AKEL) and the Turkish Cypriot Republican Turk Party in the town of Dherynia, Christofias stressed Greek Cypriots would reject "the logic that suggests the presence of two states on the island" and the presence of Turkish troops in its north. "We cannot put the existence of our country in danger with the permanent presence of thousands of invading troops and thousands of settlers," he said. Christofias also expressed concern over the progress of ongoing reunification talks with Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat, saying the first months of direct negotiations have failed to meet his expectations.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Former public prosecutor Rade Terzic was arrested on Friday (July 20th) as investigators try to determine whether he abused his powers by intervening on behalf of two members of the Zemun Clan, a criminal gang. Police believe Terzic ordered the release of two members, who later allegedly helped assassinate Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic in 2003. Terzic resigned shortly after Djindjic was killed.

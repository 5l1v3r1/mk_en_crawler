SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Boris Trajkovski vowed Friday (4 July) to implement defence and security reforms in the next 12 months. Speaking at a meeting on border security, he also presented a project that transfers border control responsibility from the army to the interior ministry.
Also Friday, Trajkovski sent a letter to EU security chief Javier Solana, requesting that the mandate of the EU peacekeeping mission to Macedonia be extended until the end of the year. It was set to expire in October.
In other news, the main opposition party, VMRO-DPMNE, is demanding transparency in drafting the new law on territorial division. Public debate on the issue is necessary to prevent tensions, VMRO-DPMNE argues. (MIA - 05/07/03; MIA - 04/07/03)

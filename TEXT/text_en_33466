BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A Serbian court handed down 15-year to 20-year sentences Monday (29 September) to four Serbs convicted of crimes against civilians. Milan Lukic, Oliver Krsmanovic, Dragutin Dragicevic and Djordje Sevic were found guilty of kidnapping, torturing and executing 16 Muslims in 1992. The victims, all of whom were Serbian citizens, were captured in Sjeverin, taken to Visegrad in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and killed on the banks of the Drina River. Their families welcomed the sentences but called on authorities to find and prosecute those who had ordered the slayings. Two of the defendants, Lukic and Krsmanovic, are still at large and were tried in absentia. Lukic is also wanted by the UN war crimes tribunal. (AP, Deutsche Welle, AFP - 29/09/03)

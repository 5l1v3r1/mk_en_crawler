BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU has accelerated preparations to assume the 450-strong mission in Macedonia from NATO, a spokeswoman for security chief Javier Solana said Monday (20 January). She announced that the EU has received a letter from President Boris Trajkovski, inviting the new European force to deploy in March. Solana is to meet Tuesday with NATO Secretary General George Robertson to discuss the details of the transfer. The foreign ministers of the 15 EU member-states are to meet early next week to approve the mission's mandate. In an interview for Radio Skopje on Monday, however, Macedonian Ambassador to NATO Nano Ruzin suggested there could be a delay in the transfer of duties, due to some technical and organisational problems.

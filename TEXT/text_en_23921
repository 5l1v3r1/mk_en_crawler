ANKARA, Turkey -- Police detained five people on Tuesday (March 17th) as part of a probe into alleged killings of Kurds by Turkish security forces in the 1990s, media reported. They made the arrests after investigators found nearly 20 pieces of human bone at an excavation site in the south-eastern town of Cizre. Authorities believe the remains belong to several Kurds who went missing in the area during an insurgency led by the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in the 1990s. Among the five detained are two sons of the former mayor of Cizre and three residents of a nearby village. Police are also looking for the former mayor, a suspected member of a Kurdish militia that helped the Turkish Army fight the PKK.
In other news Tuesday, the European Court of Human Rights ruled against Turkey in the case of two teenage girls who claimed they suffered physical and sexual abuse at the hands of police in 1999. Police arrested Nazime Ceren Salmanoglu and Fatma Deniz Polattas, who were 16 and 19 at the time, on suspicion of supporting the PKK. Convicted of belonging to an illegal group, they received 12- and 18-year prison sentences. In 2005, a Turkish court ruled there was insufficient evidence to convict police officers accused of torturing the two girls.
Also Tuesday, a military training aircraft crashed in the central province of Konya, killing one pilot and injuring the other. The cause of the crash is under investigation. (Anadolu news agency, Hurriyet, Zaman, NTV, HaberTurk, Dogan news agency, AFP, Reuters, Xinhua - 17/03/09)

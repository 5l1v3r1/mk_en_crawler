TIRANA, Albania -- British Ambassador to Tirana Richard Jones, whose country assumed the rotating EU presidency on 1 July, is calling for the intensified pursuit of EU-related reforms in the coming months. In an interview with Albanian News, published Tuesday (5 July), the British diplomat said that the next crucial time for Albania would be early November, when the European Commission releases its next assessment report. That document will evaluate the conduct of Sunday's parliamentary elections, the speed of establishing a new government, as well as the country's commitment to political stability and EU integration-related reforms, Jones said.

The opposition Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) walked out of parliament Monday (August 17th) as promised, joined by the smaller ethnic Albanian New Democracy party. DPA member Imer Aliu said it is because the government failed to implement legislation derived from the Ohrid Framework Agreement, and is neglecting the rights of Albanians. 
The Agreement, signed in 2001, put an end to military conflict between Macedonians and ethnic Albanians, and gave ethnic Albanians greater representation in the country. 
 One of DPA's chief demands is making Albanian an official language. 
 Deputy Prime Minister Abdilacim Ademi calls such demands a ploy to "score some political points". 
The EU and the United States, which supported the signing of the Ohrid Agreement, and helped draft it, were quick to say Ohrid should not be changed, but fully implemented. 
 "The EU continues to support the implementation as the best instrument for supporting the stability and multi-ethnic character of the state," said EU Ambassador Erwan Fouere. 
Former minister of local self-government, and political analyst Rizvan Sulejmani says the Ohrid Framework Agreement is only partially implemented, and in order to bring about long-term political and security stabilisation, the agreement has to be in full gear. 
 "Its implementation should be imperative," said Sulejmani. 
Sulejmani also told Southeastern European Times that language usage is extraordinarily important in a multi-ethnic state. 
A celebration marking the 8th anniversary of the Ohrid Framework Agreement was held Thursday at Hotel Radika in Mavrovo.

ATHENS, Greece -- Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis on Wednesday (July 23rd) conveyed a new message to Macedonia's government over its recent demand for recognition of a Macedonian minority in Greece. "The Balkans do not need more nationalist tensions but a modern European vision," she said after meeting Croatian counterpart Gordan Jandrokovic, who was visiting Athens. Greece will continue its international campaign on the name dispute and will participate constructively in talks with Macedonia under UN auspices, Bakoyannis added. "The decision 100% depends on the Macedonian leadership's stance," she noted. Bakoyannis described Croatia as an "example of sobriety" as it moves ahead with EU integration.

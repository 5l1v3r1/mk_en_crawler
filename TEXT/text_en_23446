LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Prime Minister Borut Pahor has invited his Croatian counterpart, Ivo Sanader, to discuss a plan to unblock Croatia's EU accession negotiations, media reported on Tuesday (December 23rd). At last week's EU-Croatia intergovernmental conference, Ljubljana vetoed the opening of 11 of the 35 EU policy chapters in its neighbour's negotiation process over the border dispute. "I have an idea, and I would like to present it to Sanader," Pahor told Slovenia's state TV broadcaster late Monday. He did not elaborate on the initiative but warned "time is running out" for Zagreb if it wants to conclude its accession talks in 2009. (EU Business, AFP, STA - 23/12/08)

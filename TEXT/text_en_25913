BUCHAREST, Romania -- Subway workers must return to their jobs Thursday (November 19th), after a court ruled their strike is illegal Wednesday. The walkout snarled traffic in the capital for two days. Workers are demanding better pay and a new collective labour contract, since the previous one has expired. Discussions with outgoing Transport Minister Radu Berceanu have failed twice. (AP, Agerpres - 18/11/09)

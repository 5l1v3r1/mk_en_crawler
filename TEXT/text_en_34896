ANKARA, Turkey -- Local media reported Saturday (20 December) that one of the men charged in connection with last month's Istanbul bombings has admitted al-Qaeda financed the attacks. Adnan Ersoz told interrogators that he had breakfast with Osama bin Laden in Kandahar, Afghanistan, sometime before 11 September 2001. The terrorists decided to attack US targets in Turkey, particularly the military base in Incirlik. Ersoz also revealed that he took $50,000 from an Iranian man and forwarded it to Turkey by courier. The Turkish unit of al-Qaeda was supposed to get another $100,000 for the attack, but it was unclear whether the money was ever delivered. Ersoz said he was stunned to hear that the attackers had changed the original target. As a result, most of the victims were Turks. Ersoz identified the leader of the terrorist structure in Turkey as Habip Aktas, who remains at large. (AP, AFP, Reuters - 20/12/03; Anadolu Agency, AFP - 19/12/03)

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia -- Parliament unanimously adopted a government plan Tuesday (October 26th) to withdraw Slovak military personnel serving with KFOR. A total of 140 troops will leave by the end of the year. Slovakia has not recognised Kosovo's independence and has had a military presence on its territory since 1999. The defence ministry says that the move will enable Slovakia to send more troops to Afghanistan, where 300 Slovak soldiers are serving under NATO.

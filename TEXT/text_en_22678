THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A ruling Thursday (July 10th) by The Hague District Court effectively blocks a civil lawsuit filed against the Netherlands and the UN on behalf of about 6,000 relatives of those killed in the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre. The court confirmed the UN's immunity from prosecution in any country's national courts. "The court's inquiry into a possible conflict between the absolute immunity valid in international law of the UN and other standards of international law does not lead to an exception to this immunity," the judges wrote. Plaintiffs accuse the UN and the Netherlands of failing to prevent the massacre, which began after Bosnian Serb forces seized the Muslim enclave.
On Friday, thousands gathered at a memorial in Srebrenica to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the massacre. The remains of more than 300 newly identified victims were buried there as part of the ceremony. (Nezavisne Novine, BBC - 11/07/08; RTRS, Fena, DPA, AKI - 10/07/08)

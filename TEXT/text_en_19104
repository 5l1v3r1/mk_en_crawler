PODGORICA, Montenegro -- President Filip Vujanovic said in a press interview that 2007 would be a year that tests how prepared domestic institutions are to implement the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU, which will likely be signed soon. In the interview, published in Sunday's (December 31st) Pobjeda daily, Vujanovic also described 2006 as an historic year, in light of Montenegro's independence and closer perspectives for EU and NATO membership, via the finalisation of SAA talks and admission to the Partnership for Peace programme. Now, he said, the country should focus on implementing set reforms and obligations it has undertaken. (Pobjeda - 31/12/06)

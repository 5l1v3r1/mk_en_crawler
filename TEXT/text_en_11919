BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn chatted online Wednesday (13 July) with young people from countries engaged in the Stabilisation and Association process -- Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro. The chat focused on EU enlargement and prospects for membership, education in the EU, and other related topics. Commenting on the prospects of Serbia-Montenegro, Rehn said the state union is close to starting negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, but that full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague remains a prerequisite for EU accession.

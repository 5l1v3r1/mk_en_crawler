ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on Wednesday (April 1st) that he is mulling changes in the government after his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) suffered its worst election result in seven years. The AKP won 39% of the votes in Sunday's local elections, falling well below expectations. "There is always an option of making government changes. We are in a process of analysing right now, but it would not be right to connect a certain change with the election result," Erdogan told a press conference.

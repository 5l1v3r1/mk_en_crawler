ATHENS, Greece -- Workers at the Olympic Stadium in Athens started Monday (10 May) to assemble the facility's roof -- a 9,000-tonne arch that slides into place. It will take about four days for the giant structure to move a distance of 60m. The second arch will be moved ten days later. Meanwhile, technical experts from the International Olympic Committee Co-ordination Commission visited several venues Monday and said they were impressed with progress made so far.
In other news, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge said that more must be done to ensure the security of the Summer Olympics in Athens. He praised organisers for the "tremendous amount of progress" they have made in this effort, adding that his department would respond to any requests for assistance from Greece.

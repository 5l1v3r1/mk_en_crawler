VIENNA, Austria -- The sole problem with Bosnia and Herzegovina's admission to the NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme is Republika Srpska's (RS) lack of co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, says OSCE mission chief for BiH Robert Beecroft. In a speech Thursday (13 May) to the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna, Beecroft said BiH is otherwise ready to join the PfP, given the significant progress achieved over the past three years. But in an interview with Nezavisne novine, European Commission delegation chief Michael Humphreys hinted he is not optimistic about BiH's entry in the PfP next month. He too blamed RS's failure to co-operate with The Hague tribunal. (OHR Sources, Nezavisne novine - 14/05/04; Federal TV, RTRS - 13/05/04)

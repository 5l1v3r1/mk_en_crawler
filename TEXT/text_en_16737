SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The OSCE Mission chief in BiH, Ambassador Douglas Davidson, called on voters Wednesday (6 September) to participate in the 1 October general elections, saying this was especially important in light of plans to close the Office of the High Representative next year. He urged voters to carefully consider each party's campaign promises and choose candidates who would lead the country towards a better future.
British Ambassador to BiH Matthew Rycroft issued a similar appeal Wednesday. In particular, he urged young voters to cast their ballots and help determine their own future. 
Also Wednesday, BiH Election Commission member Lidija Kovac warned candidates that any remark suggesting a secession referendum in Republika Srpska would be unconstitutional. She stressed that the commission would penalise any candidate who make statements counter to BiH's sovereignty and laws. (PBS BiH, Pincom.info - 06/09/06)

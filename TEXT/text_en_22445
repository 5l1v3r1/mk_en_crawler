SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Police announced on Thursday (November 13th) they have tightened measures to guarantee the security of two senior Federation of BiH (FBiH) politicians who have received "serious" death threats. Sarajevo media reports say Mirsad Kebo, the vice president of FBiH, received "verbal threats" earlier this week. The Oslobodjenje newspaper reports Kebo was told someone is offering a large bounty for his murder and that of Sulejman Tihic, leader of the main Muslim party in BiH, the Party of Democratic Action.

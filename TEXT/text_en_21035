ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government announced on Thursday (August 2nd) that it has rejected Slovenia's initiative to settle the dispute over delineation of the shared sea border before the OSCE Court of Conciliation and Arbitration in Geneva. Cabinet spokesperson Ratko Macek said that while Croatia agrees the dispute should be referred to an international arbitrator, it would prefer the Hamburg-based International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. 
Also Thursday, details emerged about a dispute between Croatia and neighbouring Serbia. At issue is ownership of 70 prized Lipizzaner horses, brought to northern Serbia from Croatia in 1991 during the Balkan conflict. Croatia now wants them back, accusing Serbian vets of providing sub-standard care. But on Thursday, Serbian Agricultural Minister Slobodan Milosavljevic visited the farm in Novi Sad where the horses have been kept and said they appear to be in good shape.

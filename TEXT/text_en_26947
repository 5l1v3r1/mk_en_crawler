ATHENS, Greece -- Protesting farmers scaled back their blockades of some of the main roads across the country Saturday (February 6th) but kept their tractors at a main border crossing with Bulgaria. A total of 13 roadblocks in the central and northern parts of the country were lifted, but tractors remained at the Promahon-Kulata crossing, causing long queues of cars and trucks. Some of the protestors, who insist on receiving their unpaid EU subsidies and higher income, said they realise that the government is in no position to subsidise them, given Greece's grave financial situation. Still, they insist on some level of support, and mentioned better terms for bank loans as one option. (Kathimerini, UPI, AP, SKAI - 06/02/10)

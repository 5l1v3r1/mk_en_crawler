WASHINGTON, United States -- US President George W. Bush will sign a law normalising trade relations with Yugoslavia within two weeks, according to US Congressman Benjamin Cardin. On Saturday (5 October), he told the Voice of America that the United States never intended to block the renewal of normal trade relations with Yugoslavia. Cardin said he was impressed with the steps Belgrade was making to improve relations with the international communities, and even withdrew an amendment he had filed that would have interrupted the normalisation process.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Despite opposition from ethnic Albanians, UNMIK is allowing Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica to visit Kosovo on Wednesday (28 June). He will attend a ceremony marking the 1389 Serb defeat in the battle of Kosovo Polje, which set the stage for 500 years of Ottoman rule. UNMIK considers the function a private and religious one and has urged Kostunica to refrain from engaging in political acts while in the province. On Tuesday, Kostunica was in London, wrapping up a two-day working visit. (Politika - 27/06/06; AFP, Reuters, RTS, Tanjug, Beta, KosovaLive - 26/06/06)

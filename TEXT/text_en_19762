SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Security Ministry General-Secretary Bakir Dautbashic says his country will resume talks with the EU this spring about further easing the visa regime and even lifting Schengen visas for BiH citizens. Speaking on Sunday (January 20th), he added that BiH experts will meet European Commission Justice and Security Commissioner Franco Frattini to discuss a roadmap for the removal of the visa regime. This is to start with the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement and the introduction of biometric passports. He said the document would also contain commitments to fighting organised crime.
In other news, former Mujahedeen commander Ali Ahmed Ali Hamad, who is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence in BiH, warned of a growing al-Qaeda presence in the country. In an interview Sunday with Reuters, Ali Hamad said there were several al-Qaeda members active in BiH who have committed no crimes there, because their true goal is to attack Western Europe. Ali Hamad, also known as Ubejda, was convicted in 1998 of involvement in a Mostar car bombing. (Dnevni Avaz - 21/01/08; RTRS, PBS, Focus - 20/01/08)

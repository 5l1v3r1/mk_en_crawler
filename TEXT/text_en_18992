SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Following months of talks, the main BiH parties finally struck a deal on Wednesday (January 3rd) on forming a state-level ruling coalition. They also backed a proposal to hold the constitutive meeting of the BiH Parliament's House of Representatives on January 11th. BiH Presidency Chairman Nebojsa Radmanovic, who convened the meeting, said the parties had agreed to nominate a Serb for the post of BiH prime minister.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Luxembourg Foreign Minister and EU Council Chairman Jean Asselborn is meeting with chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte in The Hague on Friday (4 March) to discuss del Ponte's final assessment of whether Croatia is fully co-operating with the tribunal. Her opinion is expected to have a decisive influence on the EU's decision on whether to launch accession talks with the country on 17 March, as scheduled. Croata has come under repeated criticism for failing to extradite retired General Ante Gotovina, a top war crimes indictee. (Vecernji List - 04/03/05; HINA - 03/03/05)

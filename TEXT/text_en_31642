BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Ion Iliescu warned on Friday (11 April) that the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq would be followed by a very difficult phase of re-organising political, social and economic life. Iliescu said he recognised that taking control of Baghdad was a crucial moment from a military point of view, but he reminded the international community of Romania's experience in December 1989, when the communist regime was removed. Removal of an oppressive regime is followed by both an outburst of popular support and revenge, he said. (Nine O'Clock 11/04/03)

TIRANA, Albania -- The government will revise a 1999 concession deal concluded with the Italian firm, Beg, for the Kalivac hydropower plant because of the contractor's failure to meet its obligations by a 2003 deadline, the ministry of industry and energy announced on Friday (17 June). The deal -- worth some 80m euros -- is one of the largest-scale projects in the energy sector. (Albanian News - 18/06/05)

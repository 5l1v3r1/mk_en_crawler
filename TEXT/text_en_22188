BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan said on Monday (September 15th) that Turkey's membership would strengthen the EU's diplomatic and political influence. "With Turkey as a member, the EU would play a leading role in the world," he told a press conference after a Turkey-EU Troika meeting in Brussels. Babacan added that Turkey has fulfilled its promises by passing nearly 30 pro-EU measures and would continue to do so. Also at the press conference was EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who said the Union once again acknowledged Turkey's strategic importance during the recent conflict in Georgia.
Before the Troika meeting, Babacan had complained that the EU was taking accession talks with Turkey slowly, having opened only two of a total of 35 chapters during each six-month presidency term.

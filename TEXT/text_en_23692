BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) on Friday (March 20th) refuted the Bulgarian government's claims for additional compensation for the decommissioned units of Bulgaria's Kozloduy nuclear plant. According to EC spokesman Mark Grey, the Commission had only promised to review the issue, with the final decision to be taken by the EU members. Earlier Friday, the Bulgarian government stated EC President Jose Manuel Barroso backed Bulgaria's demands. The EU has already promised Bulgaria some 550m euros in compensation until 2009, but Sofia insists the compensation should continue until 2013.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The council for protection of vital interests within Republika Srpska's (RS) Constitutional Court decided on Wednesday (January 19th) to allow a complaint filed by the Bosniak caucus in the RS upper house against the appointment of the new RS government. The council decided that objections raised by the Bosniak caucus have legal grounds since they are related to a constitutional procedure and therefore will be reviewed by the Constitutional Court. The court is set to discuss it on January 31st. The Bosniaks insist they have been discriminated against since none of the key positions in the entity -- parliament president, prime minister, House of Peoples president, Constitutional and Higher Court presidents, and chief prosecutor -- has been given to a Bosniak.

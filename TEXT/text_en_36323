BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer implied Monday (24 May) that BiH might have to wait until after the Istanbul summit in June for an invitation to join the Partnership for Peace programme. "At this stage there is very little likelihood of a decision at Istanbul," said de Hoop Scheffer, following a meeting in Brussels of the North Atlantic Council with the Political and Security Committee of the EU. BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic and Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic also attended the session. According to media reports, BiH's failure to fully co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal may be to blame. (Dnevni avaz - 25/05/04; AFP, Pincom.info, PBS BiH - 24/05/04)

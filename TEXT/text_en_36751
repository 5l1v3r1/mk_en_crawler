ANKARA, Turkey -- At least 36 people were killed and dozens injured when a high-speed train derailed Thursday (22 July) evening in a rural area near Pamukova, about 150km west of Istanbul. The express train was travelling from Istanbul to Ankara with 234 passengers and 12 crewmembers aboard. One passenger was still unaccounted for Friday. Though authorities could not immediately establish the reason for the derailment, terrorism and sabotage have been ruled out. Investigators are focusing on allegations that the train was running at 140km per hour rather than the usual 80. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan cancelled a trip to Bosnia and Herzegovina because of the accident. The government launched the high-speed service in June, cutting travel time between Istanbul and Ankara from eight hours to five.

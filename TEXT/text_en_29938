ZAGREB, Croatia -- Several hundred fishermen rallied on Saturday (January 22nd) at nine different ports to protest regulations in the sector. They accused the agriculture and fisheries ministry of allowing the Italians to "destroy resources and the future of the Adriatic Sea and the Croatian fishermen". The fishermen want an economic zone declared and establishment of Croatian sovereignty over 23,000sq km of sea. They also demanded lower prices for their boat fuel and threatened to block ports unless these demands are met in two weeks. (HRT, Radio Free Europe, tportal.hr - 22/01/11)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament adopted changes in the penal code Wednesday (9 July) despite a rift between the ruling coalition and the opposition, whose representatives boycotted the vote. Vladimir Seks, of the Croatian Democratic Union, said the opposition would ask the constitutional court to determine whether the vote was legitimate. A simple majority of 76 votes was needed in the 151-member parliament, not the simple plurality of 58 votes, Seks said. The opposition, as well as the Croatian Peasant Party, disagrees with text that decriminalises the possession of small quantities of drugs for personal use in a bid to ease the burden on courts.

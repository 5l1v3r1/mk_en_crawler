SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In Prijedor on Thursday (August 27th), the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) arrested two Bosnian Serbs suspected of war crimes committed in 1992 at Koricanske Stijene in the Vlasic Mountain. Prosecutors say Petar Civcic, who is a police officer, and Branko Topola were members of a Bosnian Serb unit that killed more than 200 Muslims and Croats at the cliff in central Bosnia. Their bodies were thrown down a deep ravine.
In 2004, The Hague war crimes tribunal sentenced Darko Mrdja, a former member of the Bosnian Serb special police, to 17 years in prison for his involvement in the crime. Just last month, a Bosnian court sentenced Damir Ivankovic to 14 years after he pleaded guilty to war crimes at Koricanske Stijene. (Dnevni Avaz, Fena, Onasa, BHRT, Srna, DPA - 27/08/09)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic says he expects all ministers will attend the next government session scheduled for Tuesday (1 February). In a press statement Monday, Terzic again stressed that the ministers must discuss important issues, including a report on the pace of implementing measures recommended by the European Commission in the Feasibility Study for BiH, as well as the draft law on the public broadcasting system. Members of the Serb Party of Democratic Progress resigned from the cabinet last month in the wake of measures High Representative Paddy Ashdown imposed on Republika Srpska.
In other news, a regional ministerial conference on returns and displaced persons started in Sarajevo on Monday. Government officials from BiH, Croatia, and Serbia-Montenegro are attending, as well as representatives of the European Commission, the UNHCR and the OSCE.

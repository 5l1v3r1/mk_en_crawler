TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister Ilir Meta expressed support Tuesday (18 March) for military intervention against Iraq. He said Saddam Hussein's regime was to blame for the current situation, as UN Security Council's resolution 1441 offered the last chance to solve the crisis peacefully. He reiterated that while a military solution was not the best one, the continuing impasse was even worse.
In Bucharest Tuesday, the Supreme Defence Council vowed to support the US ultimatum against Iraq. Romania has offered to send units trained to handle chemical and biological decontamination, engineering and medical assistance, and military police to a border nearby.

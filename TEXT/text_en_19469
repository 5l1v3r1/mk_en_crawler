SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country's chief negotiator with the EU, Igor Davidovic, says BiH will sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the Union in March. In an interview with the SRNA agency, Davidovic explained that what Brussels requires before that is a police reform package. In addition, three other conditions are reform of the public broadcaster PBS, public administration reform and full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. Davidovic added that although the EU has criticised the present constitutional order, it has never made constitutional reform among the criteria required for the SAA. 
Meanwhile, Council of Ministers Chairman Nikola Spiric said a working group on police reform is progressing well. The group has a February 15th deadline to prepare all laws related to the establishment of state-level police in BiH. (SRNA, RTRS, NTV Hayat - 24/01/08)

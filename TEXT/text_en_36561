TIRANA, Albania -- The head of the Central Elections Commission (CEC), Ilirjan Celibashi, said Thursday (6 May) he was ready to resign his post if the government approves proposed changes to the commission's structure and composition. The changes were drafted with the help of the international community, particularly the OSCE, the ODIHR and the Venice Commission. They find fault with the composition of the CEC, particularly the dominance by major parties. (Albanian Daily News - 07/05/04)

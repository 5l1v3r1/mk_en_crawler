BELGRADE, Serbia -- A US student who was allegedly beaten into a coma by a Serbian student testified via video link Wednesday (December 2nd). Prosecutors say Bryan Steinhauer, 22, of Brooklyn, sustained skull fractures and a severe brain injury after a fight with Miladin Kovacevic in May 2008. It happened in a bar near Binghamton University in upstate New York. Kovacevic is accused of assaulting Steinhauer and then instigating abuse of power and document forgery, because with the help of the Serbian consulate in New York, he managed to flee the United States and return to Serbia. 
Belgrade is also investigating former Serbian Consul General in New York Slobodan Nenadovic and former Vice Consul Igor Milosevic, who provided Kovacevic with travel documents, though he had been banned from leaving the country. The Serbian government has paid $900,000 to Steinhauer's family for his treatment. (Beta, Tanjug, B92, AP - 02/12/09)

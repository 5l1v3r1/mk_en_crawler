KRANJSKA GORA, Slovenia -- Janica and Ivica Kostelic, Croatia's star skiers, made history Sunday (5 January) when they became the first brother and sister to win World Cup races on the same day. Victory was doubly sweet for Janica, who celebrated her 21st birthday Sunday. She won a slalom in Bormio, Italy and then watched on TV as her brother won a slalom race in Slovenia.

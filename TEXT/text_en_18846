SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Bulgarian Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) announced on Monday (February 5th) that it has permanently grounded around 160 planes and helicopters due to safety concerns expressed by the EU. CAA Director Zahari Alexiev said most of the aircraft are Russian-made and cannot meet the Union's safety standards. The European Commission has refused to grant to Bulgarian carriers full access to the European aviation markets in light of concerns over safety standards. (AFP - 05/02/07)

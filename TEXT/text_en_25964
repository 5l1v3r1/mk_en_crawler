VIENNA, Austria -- Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger announced on Sunday (January 17th) that he will launch an initiative with Greek officials this week to bring the Western Balkans closer to the EU. In an interview with Austrian TV ORF, Spindelegger voiced hope that all countries from the region will become part of the bloc by 2020. Specifically, he expects that Croatia will wrap up its accession talks this year, and said Austria would like to help mediate the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece, in a bid to resolve it by spring. As for Kosovo, Spindelegger concedes there is still much work to be done. (RTS, Tanjug, B92 - 17/01/10)

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal Appeals Chamber turned down on Thursday (April 1st) a request by former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to delay his trial. Karadzic lodged an appeal on March 10th against the tribunal's refusal to postpone his trial. He made an opening statement in early March but asked the court to wait until June to hear from the prosecution's first witnesses. The hearings will resume on April 13th.

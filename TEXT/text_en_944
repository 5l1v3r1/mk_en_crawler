A team of English and Greek scientists says they have discovered the workings of a 2,000 year-old computing device. They say the Antikythera Mechanism, dating from the 1st century BC, was probably used to calculate the astronomical cycles of celestial bodies. The device features an intricate array of cogs and gears that could be manipulated via a simple user interface. According to the team, it was "technically more complex than any known device for at least a millennium afterwards". The Antikythera Mechanism also was the focus of a conference held in Athens last week.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- UN judges entered a plea of not guilty on behalf of Savo Todovic, a Bosnian Serb charged with 18 counts of war crimes. The defendant was initially given 30 days to study the case. In his second appearance before the court Thursday (17 February), Todovic again refused to enter a plea. He is accused of selecting victims for killings and beatings at the Dom prison camp in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Milorad Krnojelac, the warden of the same camp, was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2003.
Also Thursday, six Bosnian Serbs were charged in Banja Luka with looting the property of Bosnian Muslim returnees. A police spokesman said the gang carried out at least 22 robberies in and around the town of Zvornik between 2002 and 2005. None of the six is in custody. (Reuters, AFP - 17/02/05)

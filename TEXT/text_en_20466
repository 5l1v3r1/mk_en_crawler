NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkey's response to deals Cyprus wants to make involving offshore oil and gas exploration in its exclusive economic zone in the Mediterranean could have serious consequences for Ankara's EU accession bid, Cypriot Foreign Minister Erato Kozakou-Marcoullis warned on Saturday (August 11th). She was referring to reports that Turkey has sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, complaining about tenders Cyprus wants to hold for licenses involving oil and gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean. Turkey insists that northern Cyprus is entitled to part of the proceeds. 
Cyprus is working on deals with Lebanon and Egypt. Earlier this month, meanwhile, Turkish Petroleum Corporation began prospecting natural gas off Turkey's southern coasts. (CNA, Phileleftheros - 11/08/07)

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Former Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, leader of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists, says he plans to visit Srebrenica and pay his respects to the memory of genocide victims there. He stressed on Saturday (February 3rd) that the July 1995 events in Srebrenica were a tragic issue for the whole region that should never be repeated. He also vowed that Podgorica would offer compensation to relatives of Bosniaks who were deported from Montenegro during the former Yugoslav conflicts. At the same time, he said Montenegro must be removed from the genocide case that Bosnia and Herzegovina has launched before the International Court of Justice against the former state union of Serbia-Montenegro.

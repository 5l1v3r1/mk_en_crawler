PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The country has achieved "quite impressive" results on its road to EU membership, Leopold Maurer, the head of the European Commission delegation to Podgorica, said on Sunday (April 26th). He added that while progress in the visa liberalisation process is obvious, more remains to be done. "Member states should decide in the European Parliament whether Montenegro has fulfilled all standards, and after that there are good chances of visa liberalisation from the start of next year," Maurer said.
In other news Sunday, Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic expressed reservations about an initiative by Albania and Croatia to build a nuclear power plant at Skandar Lake, near the border with Montenegro. In an interview with Vecernji List, Djukanovic said Podgorica is interested in participating in talks on the project, which are in an initial phase. "The initiative should be viewed in the context of its proximity to the lake," Djukanovic said, pointing out that the project should not threaten the environment. Another concern is the level of seismic activity in the area. (B92, Vecernji List, MIA - 25/04/09)

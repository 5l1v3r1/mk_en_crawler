BUCHAREST, Romania -- The interior ministry announced on Thursday (November 11th) that Bucharest Police Chief Gavrila Pop has been fired for failing to prevent a police march from reaching the presidential palace during a recent protest. The September 24th rally against a 25% cut in public wages brought together thousands of police officers. It resulted in the resignation of Interior Minister Vasile Blaga and prompted both President Traian Basescu and Prime Minister Emil Boc to refuse to use the police detail that usually guards them in public places.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said on Tuesday (May 17th) that Serbia can obtain EU candidate status without arresting wartime fugitives Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic. After meeting with Serbian counterpart Vuk Jeremic in Belgrade, Asselborn noted that Croatia was granted candidate status before the arrest of retired General Ante Gotovina. He noted progress in Serbia's co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal. As for the issue of bogus asylum applicants from Serbia, Asselborn said that the government has taken important measures to curb the influx. He stressed that the EU visa liberalisation regime is an important step for Serbia, one Luxembourg supports. Jeremic said that Belgrade is working to meet criteria related to the EU visa free regime and said he expects that visa liberalisation will not be suspended. (RTS, Tanjug, Beta - 17/05/11)

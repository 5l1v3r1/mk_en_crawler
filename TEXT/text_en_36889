ZAGREB, Croatia -- The OSCE urged Croatia on Tuesday (6 July) to speed up the reform of its judiciary and to do more to ensure defendants' rights to fair and impartial trials. Peter Semneby, the OSCE mission chief in Zagreb, told reporters that a backlog of 1.5 million court cases remains a major problem. He noted, however, that the current government has made substantial progress in encouraging the return of ethnic Serb refugees and in co-operating with the UN war crimes tribunal.

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar said on Monday (May 24th) that any possible rejection of the arbitration agreement with Croatia during a June 6th public referendum in Slovenia will not affect Zagreb's EU membership bid. In an interview with daily Delo, Zbogar pointed out that Croatia continued accession negotiations even before the arbitration agreement -- regarding a maritime border dispute -- was struck. This may be a moot point, as recent public opinion polls suggest most Slovenians favour the agreement. (STA, HRT, Vecernji List - 24/05/10)

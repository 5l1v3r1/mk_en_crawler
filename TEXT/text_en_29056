BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU interior ministers decided unanimously on Monday (November 8th) to lift visa requirements for citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH) and Albania, as of December 15th. The EU Justice and Home Affairs Council also decided that monitoring mechanisms will be applied for the two countries to verify whether they respect the rules. BiH and Albania missed the first wave of visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans -- in which Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro were included in the so-called White Schengen list -- as of late December 2009.

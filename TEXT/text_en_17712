BUCHAREST, Romania -- Eight people were killed and 24 were injured when a train rammed into a bus near the southern town of Targoviste early Sunday (July 22nd). The bus driver, who was among those killed, apparently ignored signals from the train and warnings from passengers, and tried to cross the track rather than wait for the train to pass. The bus was carrying 40 people who had just attended a wedding. (Nine o'clock, Hotnews.ro, Zaman, MWCNews - 23/07/07; AP, Rompres, Realitatea TV - 22/07/07)

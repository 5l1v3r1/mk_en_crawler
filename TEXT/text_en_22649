THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague announced on Friday (October 10th) that it has received Serbia's official request for the institution to determine the legitimacy of Kosovo's self-proclaimed independence. Similar cases have taken about a year for a ruling. The UN General Assembly decided on Wednesday to send the matter to the ICJ. Around 50 countries have recognised Kosovo's unilaterally declared independence so far. (AFP, AP, RTS, Beta, Blic - 10/10/08)

ATHENS, Greece -- The cabinet passed a draft law Friday (16 September) aimed at protecting Olympic Airlines from its creditors, who would be barred from taking any actions against the national air carrier until the end of February 2006. Last week, the European Commission ordered the airline to return over 500m euros of state aid deemed illegal. (Kathimerini - 17/09/05; ANA, MPA - 16/09/05)

BUDAPEST, Hungary -- The Danube Commission announced on Wednesday (25 June) that navigation along the river has been fully restored. The announcement came as workers removed the last debris from three bridges in the Novi Sad area that were destroyed during the 1999 conflict. Stanko Nick, the Croatian ambassador to Budapest and head of the commission, said that this was now the safest area for navigation on the Danube. Debris clearing began in January 2001; navigation was partly restored by the end of that year. (AFP - 25/06/03)

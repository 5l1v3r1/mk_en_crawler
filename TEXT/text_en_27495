TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition parties led by the Socialist Party (SP) will stage a protest late Friday (April 30th) against the government, which according to them is pushing the country into a crisis. SP lawmakers are asking the cabinet to honour their request to investigate the transparency of the June 2009 elections. "The protest will be the biggest the country has ever seen, but there will be no violence," SP official Namik Dokle said on Thursday, leading his colleagues out of parliament.

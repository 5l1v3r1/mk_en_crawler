MITROVICA, Yugoslavia -- No decision has been made yet on whether Serbs will participate in Sunday's (26 October) local elections in Kosovo, according to Milivoje Ribac, who represents a group of 18 Kosovo Serb election co-ordinators. He said Monday that a document proposed by UNMIK chief Michael Steiner is not backed by appropriate guarantees. Earlier in the day, Steiner invited all leaders of large political parties and coalitions from Kosovo to a meeting on 1 November, where he will detail plans for the decentralisation of Kosovo and a plan to resolve problems in Mitrovica. EU foreign ministers on Monday urged all residents of Kosovo to vote Sunday. (Tanjug - 21/10/02)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Constitutional Court on Wednesday (October 8th) deemed an amendment to the law on prosecutor-naming procedures adopted by the senate in September as unconstitutional. The court explained passage of the amendment violated constitutional provisions regarding legislative procedures. The court's decision is final and binding. The adopted amendment stripped the president of powers to name the chief prosecutors in the Anti-Corruption Prosecution Office, the Organised Crime and Terrorism Investigations Department and the Prosecution Office of the High Court of Justice. Under the amended law, the Supreme Council of Magistrates would handle these nominations. (Mediafax, Agerpres, Ziare - 09/10/08)

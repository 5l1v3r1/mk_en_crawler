ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan commented on Monday (May 7th) that he hopes France's newly-elected president, Nicolas Sarkozy, would soften his position on Turkey and would do nothing to jeopardise its EU integration path. During the campaign, Sarkozy opposed Turkey's joining the EU outright, proposing instead some form of privileged partnership. 
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso sided with Erdogan on Monday, urging Sarkozy not to block Turkey's EU entry. He said it would be a mistake to suspend the integration process. 
In other news, NTV reports that the trial against 19 men charged with involvement in the murder of prominent Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink will open at the Istanbul Court on July 2nd.

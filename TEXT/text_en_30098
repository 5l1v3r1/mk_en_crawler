BELGRADE, Serbia -- Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Ivica Dacic reiterated on Wednesday (May 18th) that a division of Kosovo could be one possible solution to the status issue, stressing this is his personal view, one he had not discussed with President Boris Tadic, leader of the senior member of the ruling coalition, the Democratic Party. The former Serbian province of Kosovo declared independence in February 2008. Though Belgrade refuses to recognise its independence, 75 countries have. (Tanjug, B92, RTS - 18/05/11)

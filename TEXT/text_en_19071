SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Deputy Justice Minister Margarit Ganev is seeking access to the Libyan prison where five Bulgarian nurses are being held. They were sentenced to death again last month on charges -- widely disputed outside Libya -- that they infected hundreds of children with HIV. On Wednesday (January 3rd), the Bulgarian embassy in Tripoli said Ganev plans to discuss the defence strategy in the next phase of the trial, the appeals process. Some of the nurses, who were convicted along with a Palestinian doctor, reportedly want changes in the defence team. 
On Tuesday, the European Parliament's rapporteur for Bulgaria, Geoffrey Van Orden, urged Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi to pardon and immediately release the six medics. Speaking at a news conference in Sofia, Van Orden implied that the trial outcome could affect efforts to boost political and economic relations between Libya and the EU.

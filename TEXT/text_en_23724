SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria's parliament on Friday (January 23rd) approved plans to ask the EU for permission to relaunch two closed nuclear reactors at the Kozloduy nuclear plant. Lawmakers voted 140-48 to give the government a mandate to start talks with the European Commission (EC) on the possible restart of the reactors. The two 440-megawatt reactors were shut down in 2007 as part of Bulgaria's EU accession treaty. (BTA, BNR, bTV, Darik, Sofia News Agency, BGNES, Reuters, AP - 23/01/09)

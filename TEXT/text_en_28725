LUXEMBOURG, Luxembourg -- Eurogroup President Jean Claude Juncker issued a statement Monday (October 11th) aimed at stopping a controversy created by comments he'd made in Washington on Friday. They suggested that the EU was aware of the impending Greek economic crisis and that an unspecified Greek prime minister had admitted to widespread corruption. "Mr Juncker said that a few years ago, when Greece's competitiveness figures indicated that it would find itself in a very difficult economic and fiscal position, everyone in the rest of Europe knew that the country faced a very serious corruption problem," Juncker's spokesperson, Guy Schuller, said. "Despite that, as president of the Eurogroup, he was not in a position to speak publicly because there would be a terrible outcry," he added. "To show that the attitude of Greek authorities to the problem has now changed, he referred to what George Papandreou said after the general election of 2009 about there being a serious corruption problem in Greece," Schuller added. Former prime ministers Costas Simitis and Costas Karamanlis have both denied ever claiming Greece was corrupt. (Kathimerini - 12/10/10; ANA-MPA - 11/10/10)

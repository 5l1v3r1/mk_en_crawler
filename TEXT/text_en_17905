BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government received official notification Wednesday (July 18th) from Ukraine regarding the toxic yellow phosphorus cloud released by a train derailment in western Ukraine late Monday. Officials say there is no risk of the cloud reaching Romania. Environment Minister Attila Korodi still criticised Ukraine's delayed reaction, saying it was not normal behaviour for a European country. Korodi announced that Romania, Poland and Hungary -- also threatened by the disaster -- have decided to approach the EU about the issue. Romania has also offered to help Ukrainian authorities respond to the toxic spill. (Nine o'clock, Xinhua - 19/07/07)

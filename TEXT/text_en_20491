BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The second round of direct talks between Belgrade and Pristina on Kosovo's final status opens Sunday (October 14th) at UN headquarters in Brussels. Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic and Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic are heading the Serbian delegation, while President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Agim Ceku are leading the Kosovo delegation. The talks will be mediated by the international troika, comprised of envoys from the EU, Russia and the United States.
On Saturday, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Rosemary DiCarlo said a plan drafted by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari should be adopted if the two sides fail to reach an agreement by December 10th. This is the deadline imposed by the UN Security Council for the current negotiations process. (BBC, Reuters, DW - 14/10/07; B92, Beta, Reuters, AFP - 13/10/07)

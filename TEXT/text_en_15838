SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The IMF's European Department Director, Michael Deppler, says the Fund is concerned about the level of fiscal discipline in BiH. The concerns stem mainly from the way in which the public revenues are being allocated and spent, he said in remarks quoted by Dnevni avaz. According to Deppler, the main challenges for BiH include maintenance of strict financial discipline and acceleration of structural reforms needed for economic growth. 
Also Wednesday, British parliament member David Heath was appointed the head of the OSCE short-term election observation mission for the 1 October vote in BiH. The long-term mission chief is Slovak diplomat Lubomir Kopaj. (Dnevni avaz, Nezavisne novine - 21/09/06; PBS BiH, OSCE website - 20/09/06)

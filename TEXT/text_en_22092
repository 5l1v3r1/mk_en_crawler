PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EU special envoy to Kosovo Pieter Feith said on Tuesday (April 15th) he would actively support the decentralisation process in Kosovo, insisting it would benefit all communities, including Kosovo Serbs. "I consider decentralisation a priority in the implementation of the supervised independence plan of (former) UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari, and we will work together," Feith said after a meeting with Kosovo Minister of Local Government Sadri Ferati.
Kosovo was also a topic of discussion Tuesday in Washington, where Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met with Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel. His country currently holds the rotating EU presidency. He told Rice that by implementing the new Kosovo Constitution, local authorities could assume competencies from UNMIK and establish full control over the new country, something the EU mission in Kosovo wants "as soon as possible", Rupel said.

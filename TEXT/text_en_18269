ZAGREB, Croatia -- As an EU candidate, Croatia is eligible for some 147m euros of EU financing a year under the new Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA). At a news conference Tuesday (December 12th), the European Commission's Ambassador to Zagreb, Vincent Degert, described the IPA programme, which is replacing the current pre-accession programmes PHARE, ISPA and SAPARD. Combined with additional funding extended via regional projects, overall financing could reach 160m euros, said Degert. (Poslovni dnevnik - 13/12/06; HRT - 12/12/06)

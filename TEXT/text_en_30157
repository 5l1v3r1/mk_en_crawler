BELGRADE, Serbia -- A meeting Thursday (April 14th) between opposition Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) leader Tomislav Nikolic and President Boris Tadic, who leads the ruling Democratic Party, failed to produce any result. They discussed SNS's proposal to call early elections after Serbia receives EU candidate status in October. The party plans to organise a mass anti-government rally Saturday in Belgrade.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Saturday (March 29th) that the Union would favour allowing Kosovo Serbs to participate in Serbia's early parliamentary elections on May 11th. Rehn compared Kosovo Serbs to Swedes living in Finland, who are allowed to participate in assembly elections in Sweden. Rehn stressed that the Serbs' right to participate in these elections was incorporated in the status proposal of UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari.
On Sunday, spokesman Gyorgy Kakuk said UNMIK has not decided on whether to allow voting in Kosovo. Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said Kosovo's government will announce its stance on the issue shortly.
The Serbian local and parliamentary elections will be the first since Pristina declared independence on February 17th. Kosovo Serbs have regularly participated in Belgrade-run polls since 1999, but have boycotted elections organised by Pristina authorities. (Lajm, B92, Studio B - 30/03/08)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Romanian government approved the draft law on minorities and tabled it into parliamentary procedure on Thursday (19 May). The law was drafted amid heated debate, but the cabinet said the final version meets all EU requirements. The main innovation in the draft law is the introduction of the cultural autonomy concept. The bill also sets rules for the use of languages in education or in court. There are 20 ethnic minorities in Romania, each of which is represented in parliament. 
In other news, Romanian Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said Thursday that his government wants to renegotiate a 650m euro contract with EADS. The European aerospace giant was contracted by the previous government to build Romania's border control system in time for the country's accession to the EU in 2007. The prime minister said parts of the deal conflicted with other projects that were funded by the EU. (Nine o'clock - 20/05/05; Dow Jones - 19/05/05)

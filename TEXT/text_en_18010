PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Albanian Foreign Minister Besnik Mustafaj arrived in Kosovo Friday (December 15th) for a two-day visit at the invitation of UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker. On Saturday, Mustafaj held talks with Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu and discussed ways to boost bilateral ties. 
Meanwhile, Belgrade media reported that weather conditions led to an unexpected meeting between Serbian President Boris Tadic and Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku at Skopje's airport on Friday. Tadic's and Ceku's planes -- returning from Brussels and Washington, respectively -- had to land in Skopje after heavy fog caused the closure of the airports in Belgrade and Pristina. The two reportedly had a brief conversation in the presence of Ruecker. (Albanian Government Web site, KosovaLive, Tanjug, Blic - 16/12/06)

COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- EU leaders decided Friday (13 December) to start accession talks with Turkey if a December 2004 review finds that the country meets the criteria for membership. Ankara had insisted on the end of 2003 for the start of negotiations. Prime Minister Abdullah Gul initially opposed the decision, but several hours later issued a statement, saying "we have gotten a date a little further than we expected, but we will continue on the road to the European Union." The EU also reiterated its commitment to helping Bulgaria and Romania join in 2007. As expected, members endorsed individual roadmaps for each of the two countries and increased pre-accession financing. Political leaders in Sofia and Bucharest welcomed the outcome as best-case scenarios.

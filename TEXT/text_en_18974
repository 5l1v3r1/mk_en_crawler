ATHENS, Greece -- Macedonia may agree to join NATO under the name of FYROM, Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski said in an interview published by the Greek newspaper Kathimerini on Sunday (June 3rd). "We are ready to join NATO with the same name used at the UN," he said. Crvenkovski made it clear, however, that his country would not back down from its claim on the name Macedonia. He denied allegations by Greece, which accuses its neighbour of hijacking its history and symbols, and said Skopje has no territorial claims against other countries. (AP - 03/06/07)

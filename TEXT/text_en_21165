ZAGREB, Croatia -- Opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) leader Zoran Milanovic and Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) leader Ivo Sanader met on Friday (November 30th) with President Stipe Mesic about progress in forming the country's new government, following general elections last weekend. Both Milanovic and Sanader, the current prime minister, say they have secured a majority in the future parliament. But Mesic says neither has the necessary 77 seats. "Everything depends on the support of the Croatian Peasant Party and the Social Liberal Party," Mesic said. Observers expect the talks to continue for another two weeks. 
Separately Friday, the SDP decided to nominate Milanovic for the post of prime minister instead of its original candidate, Ljubo Jurcic, a respected economist. (Vecernji List, HRT, Index.hr, Javno.com - 01/12/07; AP - 30/11/07)

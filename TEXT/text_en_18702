PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prime Minister Zeljko Sturanovic, Parliament Speaker Ranko Krivokapic and the heads of the various parliamentary caucuses sealed a declaration Thursday (February 8th) on the minimum principles that should be included in the country's new Constitution, so it is acceptable to the Council of Europe (CoE). Krivokapic said given the political consensus regarding constitutional reforms, he hopes the proposal for CoE membership would be submitted in April, with acceptance in Europe's oldest organisation by the end of June.

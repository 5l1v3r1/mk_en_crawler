BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- George Katsirdakis, head of defence co-operation at NATO, told the newspaper Blic Friday (13 May) that NATO is not interested in bases in Serbia-Montenegro or in stationing troops on the country's territory. However, he added, if Serbia-Montenegro becomes a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace programme, some operations could be held on its territory.
In other news, a roundtable discussion was held Thursday in Belgrade on measures needed to get Serbia added to the White Schengen list involving visa regimes. Officials say it is a priority, though it is only indirectly related to eventual EU accession negotiations. (Blic, B92 - 13/05/05; B92, Tanjug, Serbian government - 12/05/05)

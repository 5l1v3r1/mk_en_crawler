TIRANA, Albania -- Every political party in Albania missed initial deadlines set by the Central Election Commission, thus jeopardising the normal timetable for the May 8th local elections. The deadline for submitting the names of members of regional commissions was in January, and the commissions should have been formed last week. OSCE head in Tirana Eugen Wollfarth voiced concern Tuesday (February 8th) and urged all political parties to be part of the process. 
The opposition Socialist Party believes that following the violence that occurred during its January 21st street protest in Tirana, Albania is in no condition to hold elections. The international community has been urging politicians to start dialogue aimed at ending the crisis. (VoA, Balkan Web, Shekulli - 08/02/11)

WASHINGTON, United States -- UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said Tuesday (3 February) that all sides in the Cyprus issue appear ready to resume dialogue on the reunification of the island. He was in Washington for talks with President George W. Bush and has already consulted with Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos, and Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou. The parties face a 1 May deadline. At that time, the Greek part of the island will join the EU, with or without Northern Cyprus. (Reuters, AP, MPA - 03/02/04)

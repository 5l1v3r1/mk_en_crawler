BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Serbia have put off signing the new modernised and enlarged CEFTA trade agreement, the Stability Pact said Friday (November 10th) after a working meeting of the ten future signatories. The delay is reportedly due to BiH's demand for a partial introduction of customs duties on agricultural products from Croatia, and Serbia's insistence on retaining protective measures for its domestic tobacco industry. The updated CEFTA deal aims to replace the existing network of 32 bilateral Free Trade Agreements in the region.

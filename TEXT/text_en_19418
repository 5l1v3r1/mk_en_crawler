LONDON, United Kingdom -- The government announced on Tuesday (October 30th) that it has decided to extend restrictions on the employment of Bulgarian and Romanian nationals until at least the end of 2008. The decision was made after officials established that the number of foreign workers who entered the country in the last ten years was 300,000 higher than official estimates. Britain was one of few EU states to open its labour market to migrants from the ten new EU members admitted in 2004. Officials from both Bulgaria and Romania expressed disappointment with Tuesday's decision.

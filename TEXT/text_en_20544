NEW YORK, United States -- Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic insisted before the UN Security Council on Tuesday (March 11th) that Kosovo's declaration of independence was illegal, violated international law and produced negative consequences. Jeremic also said that UN Security Council Resolution 1244 must be respected. He stressed that while Serbia opposes the transfer of power from UNMIK to EULEX, Belgrade will neither resort to force nor impose an embargo on Kosovo. 
After the Council session, the United States and Russia again offered different views on Kosovo. Washington confirmed its pro-independence position, while Moscow reiterated that final status would never be resolved without an agreement under the auspices of the Security Council.
For his part, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was quoted in Tuesday's edition of the Moscow newspaper Vremya Novosti as saying Resolution 1244 remains in effect and that UNMIK considers it a legal base for applying its mandate on Kosovo's territory.

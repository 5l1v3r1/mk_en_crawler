NICOSIA, Cyprus -- A forest fire raged in southwestern Cyprus on Wednesday (June 18th), forcing local authorities to evacuate six villages between Larnaca and Limassol. The fire destroyed at least three vacation villas and injured at least four firemen who were battling the flames with the help of British and Greek helicopters. Shifting winds complicated the situation. Cyprus is facing one of the worst droughts in its history and has been importing water from nearby Greece. (Reuters, AP, Phileleftheros - 18/06/08)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Croatia closed three more negotiation chapters in the EU accession process on Friday (November 5th), for a total of 25 out of 35. At an intergovernmental conference in Brussels, Zagreb closed the free movement of capital, transport policy and institutions chapters. The institutions chapter regulates Croatia's representation in EU institutions. After joining the Union, the country will have 12 members in the European Parliament, seven votes in the Council, one judge in the European Court of Justice and one representative in the Commission. Croatia hopes to complete its accession talks in the first half of 2011 and join the bloc in 2012. (Hina, Poslovni Dnevnik, DPA - 05/11/10)

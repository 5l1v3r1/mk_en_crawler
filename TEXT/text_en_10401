THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A special panel of judges met Thursday (21 October) to hear an appeal by Slobodan Milosevic's lawyers contesting their appointment by the UN tribunal. Steven Kay, who was tasked with representing the defendant, said he could not mount an effective defence because of his client's hostility and unwillingness to co-operate. A number of witnesses have refused to take the stand because of loyalty to the ousted Yugoslav leader. Milosevic urged the judges to dismiss his lawyers, arguing that he must be allowed to represent himself in what he described as a political trial. Presiding Judge Theodor Meron objected to this statement, saying the proceedings were being held under international law. The prosecution asked the judges not to allow the defendant to run his own trial. No date has been set for the ruling. (AP, AFP, Reuters - 21/10/04)

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- President Filip Vujanovic says his newly-independent country seeks friendship with all the former Yugoslav states. His comment came during a speech Wednesday (12 July) at a reception on the eve of Montenegro's national holiday, Statehood Day. Montenegrin and foreign officials -- including Vujanovic's Croatian and Serbian counterparts Stipe Mesic and Boris Tadic -- attended the event, along with intellectuals and celebrities.
Earlier Wednesday, Vujanovic met separately with Mesic and Slovenian counterpart Janez Drnovsek about boosting bilateral economic and trade co-operation. Podgorica and Belgrade, meanwhile, have completed a disassociation agreement, allowing them to participate separately in international financial institutions.

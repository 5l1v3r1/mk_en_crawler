ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police announced on Saturday (April 4th) that they have busted a group that trafficked people from Asia, the Middle East and the former Yugoslav republics to EU countries. The investigation was a joint one involving the police services of Slovenia, Austria and Bosnia and Herzegovina. At a press conference in Zagreb, police described the traffickers as well organised and able to charge each immigrant between 500 and 1,500 euros to reach their desired destination.
In other news Saturday, media reported that a World War II-era mass grave has been unearthed in Harmica, about 20km west of Zagreb near the border with Slovenia. Caves there are thought to contain the remains of more than 4,500 Croat and German soldiers. Jutarnji List reports the Croats were with the Ustachi regime and the Germans were army officers.

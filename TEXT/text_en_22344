TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI) on Sunday (November 16th) proposed a two-way solution to end the current political crisis and the continuing hunger strike by a group of opposition lawmakers. Last week, 12 lawmakers from small parties in parliament started their strike to protest the exclusion of small-party representatives from election committees under the new election code. Under the SMI's proposal, representatives from all parties in parliament could participate in election commissions. The other proposed option is to authorise a team of independent technical experts to decide on the election code.
A total of 200 intellectuals have signed a petition in support of the hunger-striking lawmakers. It urges the inclusion of and equal opportunities for all parties in the 2009 elections.

They allegedly established a ring in the southern city of Fieri to transport illegal immigrants to Greece, about 95 of them in the past two weeks alone.

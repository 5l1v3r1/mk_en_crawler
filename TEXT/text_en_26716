PRISTINA, Kosovo -- International human rights organisations Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are urging Kosovo and international authorities to halt a recent wave of attacks and harassment targeting Roma communities in Kosovo. "The government actions should include both investigations leading to identification and prosecution of the perpetrators ... as well as measures to prevent any future attacks," the organisations said in a statement Monday (September 7th). The groups warned that a "flurry of attacks against Roma by ethnic Albanians" was registered in Kosovo last month. Neither the government nor the international authorities in Kosovo officially condemned the attacks. (Koha Ditore, Express, Telegrafi - 08/09/09; KLAN Kosova, Kohavision - 07/09/09)

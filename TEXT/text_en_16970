THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The appeals panel of the UN war crimes tribunal decided on Wednesday (3 May) to uphold the sentences of two Bosnian Croats convicted of persecution, torture and the expulsion of Muslims in the Mostar area. Mladen Naletilic and Vinko Martinovic, both former commanders, were convicted in 2003 and sentenced to 20 years and 18 years respectively for war crimes committed in 1993. The judges acknowledged certain errors in the trial but concluded that the sentences were "within a range that any reasonable trial chamber could have ordered". 
Also Wednesday, three terror suspects -- Bosnian citizen Bajro Ikanovic, Turkish citizen Cesur Abdulkadir and Swedish citizen Mirsad Bektasevic -- pleaded not guilty to charges of grave criminal offence before the BiH Court. They were arrested nearly six months ago in the Sarajevo Canton, and have been linked to a purported terror plot in Denmark.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu's call for the withdrawal of Romanian troops in Iraq by the end of the year has been turned down by the Supreme Defence Council, President Traian Basescu said Friday (30 June). He said a reduction in the size of the Romanian contingent is being negotiated, but ruled out a complete pullout by the 890-strong force. Such a move would not be beneficial for the country's interests and reputation as an international partner, Basescu added.
Tariceanu and his National Liberal Party proposed the withdrawal last week, citing security concerns and the cost of the mission. The other partners in Romania's ruling coalition -- the Conservative Party and the ethnic Hungarian UMDR -- have not yet commented on the issue. (Reuters, AP, Rompres - 30/06/06)

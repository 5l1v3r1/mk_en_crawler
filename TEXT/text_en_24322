ANKARA, Turkey -- Interior Minister Besir Atalay on Saturday (May 9th) ruled out the possibility of abolishing state-supported village guard units, despite last week's killing of 44 people at a wedding party in the southeastern province of Mardin. "It is not fair to blame the militia for the tragedy in Mardin. The militia system was built based on Turkey's needs, and it has played an important role in the protection of villages," he said. President Abdullah Gul and Deputy Prime Minister Cemil Cicek have suggested revising or abolishing the guard, as some of the attackers were members of the village guard units. The system was established in 1985 to protect villages from attacks by the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Human rights groups have accused village guards of murders and drug trafficking.
Meanwhile, Atalay said police have arrested one more suspect in the May 4th killings in Bilge. Police do not suspect him of being one of the attackers, but he allegedly had hand grenades and other ammunition. Eight suspects face charges in connection with the crime.

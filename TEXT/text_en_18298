SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The lack of political dialogue in the country seriously threatens the chances of receiving an invitation to join NATO next year, according to Alliance representatives attending the sixth session of the National Committee for Integration of Macedonia into NATO on Tuesday (April 10th). They urged all political parties and institutions to step up efforts for Macedonia to receive broader support for its NATO entry. On the positive side, NATO cited progress in implementing the Ohrid Peace Accord and the government's decisiveness in fighting corruption and organised crime. 
In other news Tuesday, Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska paid a daylong visit to Slovenia. She and counterpart Dragutin Mate reviewed police reforms. (Dnevnik - 11/04/07; Makfax, MIA - 10/04/07)

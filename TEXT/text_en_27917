SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov said on Sunday (November 21st) that discussions at the NATO summit in Lisbon did not cover the deployment of elements of the Alliance's anti-missile defence shield in Bulgaria. "It was not possible to go into such details, because Bulgaria is not among the countries which are in the first ranks to consider this issue. What was important now was to start, to secure agreement in principle," Parvanov said as he returned to Sofia. (TV Evropa, BNR, Darik - 21/11/10)

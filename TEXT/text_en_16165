ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader left for the United States on Sunday (October 15th). He is scheduled to meet President George W. Bush on Tuesday and will also hold talks with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney. 
Observers say the visit indicates both countries' desire for closer co-operation. Sanader is expected to push for Croatia's admission to NATO, saying he expects a clear signal from the Alliance at its summit in Riga next month. He also plans to discuss his country's participation in the war on terror and possible US backing for Croatia's bid to join the EU. (AFP - 15/10/06)

ANKARA, Turkey -- After a four-hour emergency meeting on Tuesday (April 10th), Turkey's National Security Council (MGK), made up of the president, senior ministers and military chiefs, said the country is considering both political and economic sanctions against Iraq in case it fails to respond properly to threats made by Iraqi Kurds. The MGK did not elaborate, but the media is speculating that one scenario would involve closing border crossings to northern Iraq, an important route for food and other goods bound for Iraqi Kurds. 
The MGK met after weekend clashes between Turkish security forces and Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) terrorists in southeast Turkey claimed over 20 lives, more than half of them Turkish soldiers. The Council also wanted to respond to a threat by Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdish autonomous region in Iraq. He warned that Turkish interference in resolving the future of the oil-rich Kurdish town of Kirkuk could trigger insurgence in southeast Turkey.

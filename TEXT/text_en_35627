SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Europe is awaiting the arrest of war crimes suspects in BiH, according to the chief of the European Commission delegation to BiH, Michael Humphreys. In an interview with Nezavisne novine, he said Republika Srpska is expected to launch actions soon to detain those wanted by the UN war crimes tribunal. The issue remains a stumbling block to membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.

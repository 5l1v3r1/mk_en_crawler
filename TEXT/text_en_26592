SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Regional Development Minister Rosen Plevneliev confirmed on Friday (August 7th) that he will take over the controversial national road agency. It manages all road infrastructure projects, and was a catalyst for the EU deciding to suspend substantial funding last year. The agency continues to announce tenders based on procedures that violate EU regulations, a fact noted many times by the European Commission.
Plevneliev said he hopes to work in a far more transparent manner and committed to complete three motorways by the end of the government's term: Thrace, the major southern motorway route that connects Sofia with the seaside; Struma, which connects the capital with the Greek border; and Lyulin, which will offer a better western route from Sofia, potentially reaching the Serbian border.

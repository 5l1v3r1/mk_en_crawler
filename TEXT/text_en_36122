SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov said Monday (15 March) that he sees no need to elect a Great National Assembly, as suggested by the ruling coalition and the right-wing opposition. Following a meeting with experts and politicians, Parvanov said EU integration would require only minor adjustments to the constitution that could be passed by an ordinary parliament, adding that the only legitimate reason for constitutional changes would be if the EU integration process requires them.

ATHENS, Greece -- The foreign ministry explicitly denied on Wednesday (29 June) any possible involvement of Greek Army soldiers in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. Ministry spokesman Giorgos Koumoutsakos said officials are investigating allegations that Greek volunteers -- fighting on the side of the Bosnian Serb military during the war -- might have participated in the atrocity, Europe's worst since World War II. He added that the government and the people of Greece condemn any participation by Greek nationals in paramilitary organisations. 
Also Wednesday, banking sector employees announced that they are ending their month-long strike. Protesting the planned restructuring of the social security system, their walkout led to major disruptions in the payment of pensions across the country.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) warned on Thursday (September 10th) that a record 1.75 billion-euro fine against Turkish media giant Dogan for unpaid taxes may impact the next report on the country's progress towards EU integration. "'When the sanction is of such magnitude that it threatens the very existence of an entire press group, like in this case, then freedom of the press is at stake," the EC said. The next progress report on Turkey is expected on October 14th.

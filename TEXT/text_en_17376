ANKARA, Turkey -- The country's leaders criticised Iraqi Kurdistan President Massoud Barzani of the Kurdistan Regional Government of Iraq on Monday (February 26th) after he called for direct talks with Turkey, but also said countries in the region must recognise the Kurds' right to independence. "Irrational leadership and ... dreaming in the Middle East have always plunged the peoples into trouble," Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul told reporters on Tuesday. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan also denounced Barzani's remarks and voiced concern over what he described as attempts by Kurds to take control of the oil-rich town of Kirkuk. 
In other news Tuesday, a court in Turkey's southeast Diyarbekir province sentenced the mayor of the predominantly Kurdish-populated settlement Kayapinar to pay a fine rather than spend six months in jail, for supporting the terrorist organisation Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). He had allowed the use of a municipal vehicle for celebrations marking jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan's birthday. (Sabah - 28/02/07; NTV, AFP - 27/02/07)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney said he expected the main parties in BiH to strike a deal on crucial constitutional reforms during the current round of political negotiations, which were due to wrap up on Monday (16 January) in Sarajevo. But according to media reports Sunday, the first day of talks did not yield much progress on the thorniest issues, such as the future structure of the BiH presidency. 
In other news, Republika Srpska (RS) President Dragan Cavic denied on Sunday that his Serb Democratic Party (SDS) would try to bring down the BiH Council of Ministers if SDS were removed from power. Cavic said SDS would do nothing to destabilise BiH or threaten its Euro-Atlantic integration process. 
On Friday meanwhile, BiH's High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council appointed 11 new judges and six prosecutors. The assignments cover cantonal and municipal courts and prosecutors' offices across the country, including Sarajevo, Banja Luka and Visegrad.

ANKARA, Turkey -- In an address to the nation Monday (April 30th), Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that what the public needs most are unity, solidarity and stability.He said protecting stability is crucial to maintaining high growth and development, and stressed that the economy has rebounded since the ruling Justice and Development Party took office four and a half years ago. Erdogan did not mention the military's discomfort with Abdullah Gul's presidential candidacy, which some view as a threat to secularism. Since the controversy over Gul's nomination began Friday, both the Istanbul stock market and the lira have taken a pounding.
Commenting on the situation Monday, Terry Davis, secretary-general of the Council of Europe, reprimanded the Turkish military for attempting to interfere in politics. Meanwhile, in a separate statement, the US State Department said it has confidence in Turkey's democratic institutions and constitutional order. 
On Friday, Gul came ten votes short of the two-thirds majority needed for his election by Parliament, and the opposition filed suit at the Constitutional Court on procedural grounds. The court is expected to deliver its ruling Tuesday or Wednesday. (Sabah, Zaman, Hurriyet, Radikal, New York Times, Bloomberg, Reuters - 01/05/07; AP, Reuters, Bloomberg - 30/04/07)

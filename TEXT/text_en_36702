THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Prosecutors in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic filed papers Wednesday (28 July) objecting to a suggestion by the judges that the case be divided into two parts. Chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte argued that the court should appoint a lawyer to represent the defendant because Milosevic's health would prevent him from appearing without the assistance of legal counsel. The prosecution also accused him of trying to "hijack" the trial to suit his own political agenda. The judges must decide on whether to split the trial and appoint a lawyer to represent Milosevic by the time the proceedings are due to resume in August.
In other news, the UN tribunal has granted provisional release to Jovica Stanisic and Franko Simatovic pending the start of their trials. The former senior Serbian security officials were charged with setting up and training militia units in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, which were later involved in atrocities against civilians.

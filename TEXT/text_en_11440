SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Opposition parties in parliament unanimously criticised the cabinet changes announced by Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg on Monday (21 February), condemning what they described as poor choices stemming from political bargaining. Lawmakers were particularly critical of the decision to appoint New Time's Miroslav Sevlievski as energy minister and the largely obscure NMS-II parliament member Nina Chilova as culture and tourism minister. The reshuffle has also come under fire in the Bulgarian media. 
In other news Monday, Irish media reported that the Irish Republican Army tried to purchase a Bulgarian bank and use it to launder money from criminal operations. According to the reports, the bank was to have been used until Bulgaria's accession to the EU in 2007, when more stringent fiscal controls would have been put in place.

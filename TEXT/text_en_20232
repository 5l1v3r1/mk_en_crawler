BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU is taking Bulgaria to court for failing to establish a national 112 emergency telephone number. According to EU telecommunications rules, people in every member-state must be able to call 112 free of charge and operators must be in a position to provide adequate emergency services. Brussels has sent a formal notice to Sofia informing officials that it is launching the so-called infringement procedure for that and five other shortcomings. 
The European Commission said it plans legal proceedings against 22 EU members that have failed to recognise the qualifications of Bulgarian and Romanian professionals, saying they face "needlessly bureaucratic and slow procedures before being able to exercise their right to work anywhere in the European Union". The only countries that comply with the rule are Bulgaria, Finland, Lithuania, The Netherlands and Slovenia. (Sega - 18/10/07; Thomson Financial, AFX, Actualno.com, BTA, Focus, Forbes - 17/10/07)

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic met with his Slovene counterpart Dimitrij Rupel, who is also OSCE chairman-in-office, to discuss Kosovo-related issues Monday (30 May). Draskovic outlined the federal union's position, which calls for basing negotiations on Kosovo's final status on the principle "more about autonomy, less about independence". He said Belgrade is prepared to discuss a compromise solution and expects the same from Pristina.
Also Monday, Serbia-Montenegro and the Czech Republic sealed an agreement on bilateral co-operation in the defence sector. Prague will provide training assistance to boost Serbia-Montenegro's efforts to join Euro-Atlantic structures. (B92, Tanjug - 30/05/05)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan says he will not attend a climate change conference in Greece later this week if his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu is there. Relations between Israel and Turkey have soured since late May, when an Israeli raid on a Turkish-led aid flotilla to Gaza left nine Turkish activists dead. Referring to Netanyahu, Erdogan told the Greek television channel SKAI on Monday (October 18th), "A prime minister who is proud of such an armed intervention is a prime minister with whom I do not agree to talk." Greek foreign ministry spokesperson Grigoris Delavekouras said on Tuesday that Netanyahu is not listed among speakers at the conference. (Zaman - 20/10/10; CNN - 19/10/10)

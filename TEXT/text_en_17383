BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian President Boris Tadic and Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik issued separate statements urging all war crimes fugitives to surrender to the UN tribunal. Tadic said Monday's (February 26th) ruling by the International Court of Justice, which cleared Belgrade of responsibility for genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina, demonstrated that blame lies with individuals who must be brought to justice. Dodik also urged the fugitives to turn themselves in. "Let's finish this storyâ¦ We cannot have all the Bosnian Serbs and all people in Serbia suffer because of them," he said. (AP - 27/02/07)

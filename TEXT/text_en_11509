ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said Tuesday (19 April) there would be more personnel changes in the interior ministry, following the dismissal of Police Chief Dragutin Cestar. Sanader said the shuffles would be aimed at tightening discipline in the sector. According to Zagreb media reports, the shake-ups are the result of recent allegations that war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina fled Croatia in 2001 with a forged passport issued to him by Zagreb police.
In other news, Croatian Parliament Speaker Vladimir Seks was in Prague on Tuesday, where he met with Czech President Vaclav Klaus. Seks says the Czech leader criticised the EU's recent decision to delay the launch of membership talks with Zagreb, and expressed full support for starting the negotiations as soon as possible.

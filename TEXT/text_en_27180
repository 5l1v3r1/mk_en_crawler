BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) hopes to receive a NATO Membership Action Plan at a meeting of the alliance's foreign ministers in Tallinn next month, Prime Minister Nikola Spiric said Wednesday (March 3rd). He was speaking at a joint press conference with NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen in Brussels. 
Spiric said a NATO delegation will visit BiH later this month to determine if the alliance should push for closer ties. He added that integration into the EU and NATO -- along with solid regional co-operation -- is a foreign policy priority. In December, NATO postponed a decision on offering BiH the membership plan due to the country's political stalemate and stalled reform process. (RTRS, Dnevnik.ba, DPA - 03/03/10)

ATHENS, Greece -- The captain of a Greek cruise ship that struck rocks near the island of Santorini last week blames a strong current for the accident. The unnamed captain and five crewmembers were indicted on charges of causing a shipwreck through negligence, violating shipping safety regulations and polluting the environment. All have been released. In his deposition, the captain claimed that a strong current had pushed the ship off-course, prompting him to order a sharp turn. He says the vessel hit a reef before the manoeuvre was completed. Two French passengers remain missing. (AP - 07/04/07)

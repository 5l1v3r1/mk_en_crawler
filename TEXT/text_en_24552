BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police arrested on Wednesday (May 6th) the father of Serbian-born Australian tennis player Jelena Dokic for allegedly threatening to attack the Australian Embassy in Belgrade with a rocket launcher. The threat, published by the Kurir newspaper, came after Dokic told Australian magazine Sport and Style on Tuesday that her father, Damir Dokic, abused her both physically and psychologically. Explaining the arrest, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said, "We must guarantee the security of foreign diplomats in our country." Police say Dokic was calm during his arrest and even showed police officers the legally registered weapons he keeps in his home. (BGNES, Beta, Tanjug, B92, ABC, AP, DPA - 06/05/09)

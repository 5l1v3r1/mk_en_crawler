SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO troops raided early Thursday (March 22nd) the Sarajevo home of Slobodan Zupljanin, a relative of war crimes fugitive Stojan Zupljanin. Authorities believe Slobodan Zupljanin is helping Stojan evade capture and extradition to the UN tribunal in The Hague. This was the second such raid in as many weeks.
In other news, prosecutors in Tuzla filed war crime charges Wednesday against two former Bosnian Serb army members, whose names were not released. They are accused of the 1992 murders of three Bosniak civilians in Kozluk. (RTRS -- 22/03/07; PBS BiH, NTV Hayat, Fena - 21/03/07)

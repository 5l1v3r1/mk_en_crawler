BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) President Dragan Cavic, who leads the Serb Democratic Party (SDS), said on Monday (1 May) that those who rejected the BiH constitutional changes last week made a "terrible" mistake. He predicted that the draft amendments would eventually pass the BiH Parliament. Last Wednesday, the BiH lower house rejected the amendments, coming up just two votes short of the required two-thirds majority.
In other news, BiH Chief Prosecutor Marinko Jurcevic has called for changes that would speed up the processing of war crimes cases. "We cannot work on war crimes cases 100 years. Crimes do not get older but it is a factor that people biologically die", Jurcevic said in an interview published in Tuesday's edition of Dnevni avaz. If current obstacles are eliminated, prosecutors could resolve at least two-thirds of war crimes cases within ten years, he added. (Dnevni avaz - 02/05/06; RTRS, Srna, PBS BiH - 01/05/06)

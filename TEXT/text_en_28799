NEW YORK, United States -- High Representative Valentin Inzko told the UN Security Council on Thursday (November 11th) that BiH authorities have become more divided and do almost nothing to advance the country's EU and NATO bids. "Sadly, national agendas inside the country have continued to prevail over co-operation and compromise," Inzko told the UN, calling for a change in the politicians' thinking and a readiness for dialogue and compromise. He warned BiH cannot afford another four-year stalemate. He was also very critical of Republika Srpska politicians who continue to speculate over the possible secession of the smaller entity and refuse to negotiate a new constitutional solution for BiH, saying it is "an impossible state".

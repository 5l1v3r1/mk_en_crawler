SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The rising Danube flooded hundreds of homes in Serbia and Bulgaria on Friday (14 April) and threatened production at one of the Balkan's biggest power plants. The Djerdap hydroelectric plant, located on the Danube in eastern Serbia, could be partly shut down if the river rises above the dam, Serbian state television reported. Power production at the plant is already reported to be at one of its lowest levels because of the flooding.
The Danube reached record-high levels in Romania, Serbia and Bulgaria on Thursday. Bulgarian authorities declared a state of emergency in all 22 communities along the country's 450km stretch of the river. Vidin, a city of 50,000, is ready for possible evacuation. Soldiers were working round the clock to shore up dikes. In the Bulgarian town of Kozlodui, the Danube submerged the port, and in the port city of Lom, the river swamped a hotel and city administration buildings. 
In western Romania, hundreds of people fled their village homes early Thursday. Swollen rivers topped a dam on the Borcea tributary, the second to overflow in as many days, and rescue workers evacuated people and livestock from the area. 
In Serbia, rescue crews staged evacuations and shored up barriers in the towns of Titel, Zabalj and Zrenjanin, along the Tisa River, where a state of emergency was declared. In Belgrade, both the Sava and Danube were nearing record highs, and some streets in the city are reportedly underwater.

TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi on Monday (September 17th) urged Prime Minister Sali Berisha and the leaders of all political parties to join in a roundtable discussion about necessary reforms in the judicial system. In his speech during Monday's plenary session of parliament, Topi also urged lawmakers to draft reforms and to co-operate in passing them, as the judiciary is considered one of the most problematic institutions in Albania.

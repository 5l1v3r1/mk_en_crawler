SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov asked the Constitutional Court on Thursday (2 January) to interpret constitutional provisions regulating military co-operation, according to a statement by his press office. The provisions require the National Assembly to approve participation of Bulgarian military forces in operations abroad, as well as the presence or transit of foreign armed forces on Bulgarian territory. Parvanov said that he would propose amendments to the constitution, should those provisions hinder the successful and prompt execution of Bulgaria's duties as a NATO member. The envisioned change would streamline the process by empowering the chief executive to decide such matters without the approval of the National Assembly.

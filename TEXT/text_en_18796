BUCHAREST, Romania -- Rallies in support of suspended President Traian Basescu were held at the weekend in Romania and Spain, ahead of the May 19th referendum on impeachment. According to press reports, thousands of people gathered at the rallies, organised on Saturday (May 5th) in the Spanish cities of Madrid and Castellon, where huge Romanian communities live, as well as in Constanta, Romania on Sunday. Parliament approved an opposition-led initiative for Basescu's impeachment last month, accusing him of numerous constitutional violations. By law, impeachment must be confirmed in a public referendum. (Romania Libera - 07/05/07; Rompres, Mediafax - 06/05/07)

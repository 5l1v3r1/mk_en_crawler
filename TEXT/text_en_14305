SALZBURG, Austria -- UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen praised the recent progress in Kosovo on Saturday (11 March), reiterating the need for continued efforts to build a multiethnic, democratic society there. He was addressing an informal meeting of the EU and Western Balkan countries' foreign ministers in Salzburg. According to Jessen-Petersen, the "political landscape of Kosovo has changed fundamentally in these last days". He cited last month's democratic election of a new president as a proof that "qualitative transformation" was achieved in the province. 
In other news, Pristina media reported on Sunday that Jessen-Petersen has promoted the deputy commander of the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC), General Lieutenant Sulejman Selimi, to new KPC chief. Selimi, 36, succeeds Agim Ceku, who has been named prime minister. Selimi headed the local headquarters of the former Kosovo Liberation Army in Drenica during the 1998-1999 conflict.

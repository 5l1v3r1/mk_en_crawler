ATHENS, Greece -- Two Bulgarian military officers and their driver were sentenced in Greece on Friday (August 29th) to 15 months in prison for spying. Earlier in the week, a soldier at the northern Ormenio military base noticed two people taking photos of the barracks. He wrote down the plate number of their car, which was registered in Bulgaria, and reported the case to his commanders. Half an hour later, police arrested the three Bulgarians, two men and a woman, at the Ormenio border check point. An investigation revealed that the trio had been spotted at other Greek military facilities as well. Photos of military facilities in the northern region of Evros, bordering Turkey, were found in their digital camera. All three have denied the spying charges. They say they were in Greece as tourists and took the photos for a Bulgarian military magazine. (Standard, Novinar, Duma - 30/08/08; Vima, Dnevnik, ANA-MPA, Avriani, BTA, EFE, News.In - 29/08/08)

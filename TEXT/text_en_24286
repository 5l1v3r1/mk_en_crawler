SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Police officers in almost all major cities held a silent protest on Saturday (December 13th) demanding higher pay, better working conditions and social benefits. Representatives of the protesters said that they have repeatedly presented their problems to the interior ministry but are not satisfied with the response. The largest demonstration was in Sofia, drawing more than 3,500 people.
Under Bulgarian law, police officers don't have the right to strike. Participants instead gathered to "smoke a cigarette" and quietly discuss their problems with their colleagues. (Dnes, Netinfo, Standart - 13/12/08)

ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis predicts that next month's Olympics will go down in history as the safest and most successful Games ever. In an interview published in the Italian daily Corriere della Sera on Tuesday (27 July), Karamanlis said Greece is fully prepared for the event. The country has allocated $1.2 billion for security, roughly five times the amount spent in Sydney four years ago. Dozens of Patriot missiles have been put in place around Athens as part of the security operation. Three police helicopters and a blimp packed with electronic equipment are monitoring the capital. By the 13 August opening of the Games, authorities will have 70,000 security personnel and thousands of surveillance cameras in place. NATO AWACS surveillance planes will patrol the skies.

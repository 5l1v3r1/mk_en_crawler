BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prosecutors are appealing the sentences of three men who were videotaped gunning down six Muslim prisoners in the Srebrenica area in the summer of 1995. A local court sentenced one of them to three to 13 years in prison and another to five years, while a third defendant was acquitted. The commander of the unit and his deputy, who were also filmed firing at the prisoners, were both sentenced to 20 years. Their sentences will not be appealed. The release of the video caused an uproar in Serbia, where many still refuse to believe that the Srebrenica massacre took place. (Channel 4, AP - 17/09/07)

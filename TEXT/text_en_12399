SREBRENICA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Security measures have been taken to ensure that nothing jeopardises next week's commemorations in Potocari of the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, High Representative Paddy Ashdown said Wednesday (6 July). Earlier this week, 35kg of plastic explosives and fuses were discovered in the town, following an anonymous tip to EUFOR. Federation of BiH police detained one person in connection with the case, but released him Wednesday evening after questioning. 
Also on Wednesday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told the European Parliament that building a better future for the Western Balkans would be the best way to honour the victims of Srebrenica. He also said it is unacceptable that fugitive war crimes indictees Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, believed to bear the greatest individual responsibility for the massacre, are still at large.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic and visiting Albanian counterpart Bamir Topi vowed on Wednesday (May 20th) to boost bilateral co-operation and strengthen economic ties. As part of Topi's three-day visit to Croatia, the two leaders met and agreed that after completing NATO accession, EU integration is now a strategic goal for both countries. "We are aware of the fact that the road towards the EU is long", Topi said, pledging Albania will implement all necessary judicial reforms to meet EU standards. Mesic, in turn, noted Croatia's border dispute with Slovenia has blocked Zagreb's accession process. Croatia favours arbitration to end the row. (HRT, Vjesnik, Javno, HINA - 20/05/09)

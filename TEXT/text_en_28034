BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Visiting Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on Monday (May 17th) for the settlement of the longstanding Nagorno-Karabakh dispute, saying his country won't ratify two documents to normalise ties with Armenia until it is resolved. The two protocols, paving the way for opening the border and restoring diplomatic ties between Turkey and Armenia, were signed in October, but have not been ratified by either country yet. While in Azerbaijan, Erdogan met with President Ilham Aliyev to discuss bilateral co-operation, including the issue of Azeri gas exports to Turkey. The deal has been under discussion for two years now. A signing ceremony expected on Monday was postponed until June, when Aliyev will visit Turkey.

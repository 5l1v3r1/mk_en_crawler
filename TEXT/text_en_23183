ATHENS, Greece -- Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis says Greece views Macedonia's membership in NATO as a very important issue that must wait until after Skopje normalises relations with Athens by resolving their long-standing name dispute. In an article appearing in the Washington Times on Tuesday (April 29th), Bakoyannis wrote that Macedonia's NATO membership will contribute to regional security. She added that therefore, all members of the Alliance, especially Greece -- due to its geographic proximity -- support membership. However, she wrote, during the NATO summit in early April, "the Alliance made it abundantly clear that accession is contingent upon respect for NATO-shared values and principles; that alliances and partnerships can be forged among countries only when there is good will, mutual trust and good neighbourly relations."

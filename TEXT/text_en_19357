PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Albanian President Bamir Topi said on Friday (January 25th) that his country would like to be the first to recognise Kosovo's independence. Topi, who was in Pristina for meetings with UNMIK officials and Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu, downplayed the significance of a possible economic blockade of the breakaway province, which Belgrade has threatened to impose in case of a unilateral independence. Topi said Kosovo can rely on economic aid from Albania and the international community. (AFP - 26/01/08; AFP, EuroNews, RIA Novosti, Fonet, Focus, ITAR-TASS - 25/01/08)

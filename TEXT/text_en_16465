THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The trial of Croatian journalist Josip Jovic opened at the UN war crimes tribunal on Tuesday (11 July). The editor of the newspaper Slobodna Dalmacija is charged with contempt of court for allegedly revealing that President Stipe Mesic testified as a protected witness in the 1997 trial of Bosnian Croat General Tihomir Blaskic. Jovic admitted that he violated the court order but argued that he was not aware that it applied to media outside the Netherlands.
Also Tuesday, Mesic met with visiting Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev in Zagreb and signed an agreement on international transportation. Mesic said Croatia is particularly interested in transporting crude oil and oil derivatives from Kazakhstan. (Vjesnik, Novi list - 12/07/06; AP, AFP, HINA, HRT - 11/07/06)

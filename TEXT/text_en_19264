SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Council of Ministers (CoM) met on Thursday (November 29th) and approved the disbursement of 950,000 euros to finance next month's presidential elections in Republika Srpska. It was the first meeting of the state-level cabinet since October 16th, and follows severe criticism by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak, who warned that passage of several key measures is being blocked. Lajcak reminded caretaker Prime Minister Nikola Spiric that although Spiric has resigned, he is obligated to ensure the CoM continues functioning.

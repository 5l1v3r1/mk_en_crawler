D. THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 

1. Please provide brief information on legislation or other rules governing the judicial system. 
The basic acts that regulate the judicial system in the Republic of Macedonia are: the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 1/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03); the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the  Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/03); the Law on the Court Budget (“Official Gazette of the  Republic of Macedonia”, No. 60/03); the Law on the Judicial Council of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the  Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 80/92, 50/99 and 43/03); the Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office (“Official Gazette of the  Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04); the Bar Law (“Official Gazette of the  Republic of Macedonia”, No. 59/02); the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the  Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02 and 74/04), the Law on Litigation Procedure (“Official Gazette of the  Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 33/98 and 44/02), the Law on the Execution Procedure (“Official Gazette of the  Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 53/97 and 59/00); the Law on Non-Contentious Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia”, No. 19/79); the Notary Service Law (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/96, 25/98 and 6/02) as well as other secondary legislationAll these regulations govern the organisation and competence of judicial bodies, as well as the status of judicial function holders.  Pursuant to the Constitution (Article 98), the judicial power in the Republic of Macedonia is exercised by courts. Courts are autonomous and independent state bodies that deliver judgements on the basis of the Constitution, laws and the international agreements ratified in accordance with the Constitution. There is a single form of organisation for the judiciary and extraordinary courts are prohibited. The position of the judiciary is regulated by the Law on Courts and the Law on the Judicial Council of the Republic of Macedonia. The Law on Courts regulates the general principles upon which the objectives and functions of the courts are performed; organisation and competence of courts; election, removal and dismissal of judges, lay judges and presidents of courts; their rights and obligations; judges’ immunity; matters in the field of judicial and court administration; issues related to court administration, position of the court police and other issues pertaining to the operation of courts and the judicial system. The Court Rules of Procedure regulate the courts’ internal organisation; court register and other book keeping; management of documents and forms; proceedings on international legal assistance and proceedings upon complaints; election and allocation of lay judges; appointment of official court translators; interpreters and experts, statistics and record keeping and professional staff training; as well as other issues of significance for the operation of courts. The Supreme Court’s Rules of Procedure regulate the organisation of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia and its operation, the work of its President, court chambers, judicial departments, joint session of judicial departments and session of judges and the General Session. The Law on the Court Budget regulates the procedure of preparation, determining and implementation of the Court Budget and the establishment and operation of the Judicial Budget Council. The Court Budget provides funds for the judiciary in the Republic of Macedonia. The Law on Judicial Council of the Republic regulates the Council’s organisation (election of its members and President, termination of office); issues within its competence (proposal, election and dismissal of judges, deciding upon disciplinary liability of judges, evaluation of the judges’ professionalism and ethics, proposing judges to the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia); its staff service; as well as issues relating to the funds for the Council’s operation. The Judicial Council’s Rules of Procedure regulate the issues of its operation and its procedure. The Rulebook on the Judges Disciplinary Liability Procedure regulates the procedure to determine a judge’s disciplinary liability for a major disciplinary violation. In accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (Article 106), the Public Prosecutor’s Office is the single and autonomous state body that prosecutes perpetrators of criminal acts and other punishable offences as stipulated by law and performs other duties stipulated by law.  The Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office regulates the establishment, organisation and competence of the Public Prosecutor’s Office, determines the areas of jurisdiction and the main offices of public prosecutors, stipulates the terms and proceedings of appointment and dismissal of public prosecutors and their deputies, regulates the establishment of the Public Prosecutors’ Council and Supreme Court’s Rules of Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 13/98);   Judicial Council’s Rules of Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 10/94, 34/00 and 3/04);   Rulebook on the Judges’ Disciplinary Liability Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 7/98). the Unit for Prosecution of Perpetrators of Criminal Acts in the Area of Organised Crime and Corruption, as well as other issues related to the operation of the Public Prosecutor’s Office. According to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (Article 53), the Bar is an autonomous and independent public service that provides legal assistance and conducts public competence in accordance with law. The Bar Law regulates the provision of legal assistance on the part of the bar to natural persons and legal entities in exercise and protection of their rights and legally based interests in proceedings before courts, state bodies and other legal entities. Furthermore, it regulates the implementation of public competences as determined by law; organisation of the bar; conditions for performance, termination and rendering the bar inactive, as well as lawyers’ rights and obligations. The proceedings before courts are regulated by the Law on Criminal Procedure, the Law on Litigation Procedure, the Law on Non-Contentious Procedure and the Law on Execution Procedure. The Law on Criminal Procedure sets forth the rules ensuring that no innocent person shall be convicted further ensuring that the person pronounced guilty will be criminally sanctioned under conditions defined by the Criminal Code and based on a lawful procedure.  The Law on Litigation Procedure determines the rules for the procedure based on which the court deliberates and decides in disputes arising from intra-personal, family, labour relations, as well as property and other civil law relations of natural and legal persons, unless some of the referred to disputes are under the competence of another state body, in accordance with a separate law.  The Law on Non-Contentious Procedures defines the rules of the proceedings according to which regular courts deliberate upon and decide in personal, family, property and other legal states and relations, determined by this or another law.  The Law on Execution Procedure defines the rules according to which the court may coercively act to execute a court decision for fulfilment of obligations, and for securing claims. The Notary Service Law regulates the provision of notary services, stipulates the terms and procedure for establishment of a notary and for appointment of notaries and determines the scope of activity of the Notary. 
2. Please indicate:  a) The number of courts (by type of court); b) The main competencies and functions of each type of court; c) The number of judges, prosecutors, defence lawyers, bailiffs, public notaries, court clerks etc.; d) The proportion of female judges and of judges belonging to ethnic minorities and, if data are available, the proportion of the other legal professions mentioned under c) belonging to ethnic minorities. 
a)  Article 98 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 1/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), provides that the judiciary has a single form of organisation and that extraordinary courts are prohibited. Furthermore, the Constitution stipulates that the types of courts, their competence, establishment, abrogation, organisation and composition, as well as the procedure they follow, shall be regulated by a law adopted by a two-thirds majority vote of the total number of Members of the Assembly.  The Second Chapter of the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 6/95, 45/95 and 64/03), elaborates on the organisation of the judiciary. Namely, it is envisaged that, as a part of a single judicial system, the judicial power is exercised by 27 basic courts, 3 appellate courts and the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia. An appellate court is established for a territory of several basic courts. 
b)  
The competence of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia The Constitution defines the Supreme Court as the highest court in the country that ensures the uniformity in the application of laws on the part of courts. It exercises the judicial power on the entire territory of the Republic of Macedonia, and its main office is in Skopje. The Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia is consisted of 25 judges. Among the Supreme Court’s judges, a President is elected for a term of four years, with a possibility of one re-election for another four year term. The election of the Supreme Court's President is carried out by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, upon a proposal submitted by the Judicial Council of the Republic. The Supreme Court has a Secretary, three court departments (Criminal, Civil and Department for Administrative Disputes), IT Centre, Case Law and Training registry and Service of the Court.  The Supreme Court’s competences include: deciding in second instance on its Chambers’ rulings pursuant to a law; deciding in third and final instance upon appeals on appellate courts’ rulings and its Chambers’ rulings brought in second instance pursuant to a law; judging upon extra-legal remedies against final court judgments and rulings of its Chambers pursuant to a law; judging upon conflicts of competence between basic courts falling under jurisdiction of different appellate courts, between appellate courts and basic courts and between different appellate courts, as well as deciding upon handing over the territorial jurisdiction from one court to another. At its general sessions, the Supreme Court:   Determines general positions and principle legal opinions on issues of importance for ensuring harmony in the application of laws on the part of courts;   Provides opinions on draft-laws and other regulations that govern issues pertaining to the operation of courts;   Considers issues pertaining to the operation of courts, application of laws and judicial practice;   Adopts the Supreme Court’s Rules of Procedure;   Adopts the Court’s working programme;   Delivers opinion on election and on existence of reasons for dismissal of judges;   Decides upon requests for protection of legality against its Chambers’ rulings, and   Considers reports on its performance and the performance of other courts. The competences of appellate courts Appellate courts are second instance courts. They are competent to decide upon appeals on rulings of basic courts. Besides this primary prerogative, appellate courts are empowered to decide in conflicts of competence between basic courts falling under their jurisdiction and to perform other duties determined by law. The competences of basic courts All basic courts are first instance courts and they are empowered to decide in first instance in cases of judicial competence in criminal, civil and non-contentious matters; execution and security; verification of title deeds; misdemeanours (unless provided by law that other bodies decide upon specific types of misdemeanours in customs, foreign exchange, foreign trade and tax issues). Sixteen basic courts, besides the above mentioned competences, in the territory for which they are established, pursuant to Article 32 of the Law on Courts, are also competent to:   Adjudicate in first instance and conduct matters in criminal proceedings upon criminal acts for which a sentence of over 10 years of imprisonment is prescribed, and   Act upon business misdemeanours; property or other civil law disputes in which involved as a party to the dispute is a municipality, the city of Skopje or the Republic of Macedonia, enterprises or other legal entities, shop owners or other individuals who perform registered economic activity; decide in disputes between domestic legal and foreign natural persons, between foreign natural and legal persons; decide in bankruptcy procedures, forced settlement and liquidation and disputes arising therein, disputes concerning status changes (division, merger, incorporation and reorganisation) and execute these court rulings.  They also decide on the legality of single acts in administrative and accounting disputes, on protection against illegal activities and on recognition and permission to execute foreign courts’ judgments. Finally, these courts conduct activities of international legal assistance unless other body’s competence has been stipulated by law. Only three basic courts are authorised to keep court registers: the Basic Courts of Skopje, Bitola and Štip. In order to ensure single records of the registered entries, a collective court register has been established for the entire territory of the Republic of Macedonia kept by the Skopje I Basic Court. The three aforementioned basic courts are also authorised in cases of perpetrated crimes against the armed forces. 
c)  Within the court system, the judicial power is currently exercised by 632 judges. Twenty four of them are in the Supreme Court, 83 are in appellate courts and 525 judges are in the basic courts. There are 2127 clerks employed in courts. Out of this number, 31 are secretaries; 644 are independent court advisors, court advisors, expert associates and interns; 642 are minuting clerks; 650 are other employees (court executors, archivists, delivery staff) and 160 are members of the court police. In the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the number of public prosecutors and deputies is as follows:   In the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia, besides the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia, there are 10 deputy public prosecutors;   The three Higher Public Prosecutor’s Offices include three high public prosecutors and 24 deputies and   In the 22 Basic Public Prosecutor’s Offices, there are 22 basic public prosecutors and 132 deputies. In the Public Prosecutor’s Office, there are also 174 civil servants and other administrative and technical personnel, 56 of whom are associates, 54 are minuting clerks, and 66 are administrative personnel. Currently registered in the Bar Association are 1314 lawyers, 7 expert associates and 337 intern lawyers. The number of notaries in the Republic of Macedonia is 124.

As part of the efforts to implement the Constitutional provisions on equitable representation of members of all the ethnic communities, amendments have been made to the Law on Courts, incorporating a provision under which in the process of election of judges and lay judges, equitable representation will be ensured for citizens belonging to all communities, while respecting the legally prescribed criteria. 
3. Independence of the judiciary: Is independence guaranteed by the Constitution? How are the rights of the judiciary protected? Please describe the selection, promotion and disciplinary procedures of judges and prosecutors and indicate how they relate to the accountability and independence of the judiciary. 
Independence of the judiciary Article 93 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 1/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), guarantees the independence of the judiciary. It stipulates that courts are autonomous and independent and act on the basis of the Constitution, laws and the international agreements ratified pursuant to the Constitution. The Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/02), includes a number of provisions which guarantee the independence of the judiciary. In performance of their functions and goals, courts are bound only by the Constitution and laws and the international agreements ratified pursuant to the Constitution. In application of the law, a judge is not bound by a superior court’s legal opinion. A judge renders unbiased rulings on the basis of his/her free judgement of evidence and application of law. Any form of influence over a judge is prohibited in relation to proceedings upon specific cases and, in particular, public statements aimed at exerting influence over the course and the outcome of a court procedure. No restrictions, influences, incentives, pressures, threats or direct or indirect interference are allowed in decisions rendered by a judge. No one is entitled to restrict in any manner or prevent a judge’s right to freely pronounce a ruling. A re-consideration of court rulings or changes in a court’s composition aimed at influencing their judgement may not be allowed by a law or by an act of the state authority. Every state authority is obliged to refrain from committing or tolerating actions which prevent bringing of judgements or enforcement of court decisions.  The independence of the judiciary is also ensured with the provisions of the Law on Courts which provide for the inviolable effect of a legally valid court decision, as well as with the provision under which a court ruling may be changed or abolished only by a competent court and in a procedure stipulated by law. Furthermore, court decisions are binding for all natural and legal persons and are superior in authority in relation to any other body’s decisions. The enforcement of a final and effective court decision shall be conducted as promptly and efficient as possible, and may not be prevented by any other state body’s decision. The judicial function is incompatible with any other public office, profession or membership in a political party. Public offices that are incompatible with the judicial office, pursuant to the Law on Courts, are the following: Member of Parliament, i.e. Member of a Municipal Council and official in a state body, municipal body or a body of the City of Skopje. In addition, the Constitution, in Article 100, paragraph 3, explicitly prohibits political organisation and activity in the judiciary. A judge may not be a member of a political party and may not conduct political office in a political party, or perform party or political activities. Judges may establish associations in order to exercise their interests further their professional education and protect the independence and autonomy of the judicial office.  Judges are granted immunity. The immunity of judges is decided upon by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia. A judge or a lay judge may not be held accountable for an opinion expressed or a ruling made in rendering judicial decisions. A judge may not be detained without an approval of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, unless caught while perpetrating a criminal act punishable by imprisonment of at least five years. The procedure of deciding upon judges’ immunity is urgent and is conducted following a prior opinion of the Judicial Council.   Significant for ensuring the independence of the judiciary are also the provisions of the Law on Courts under which a judge, while performing the judicial office, may not accept gifts from parties in a procedure or from persons having direct or indirect interests in a trial. Similarly, significant is the provision which prohibits an indemnity or another lawsuit against a judge or a lay judge instituted by a party dissatisfied with a court ruling. Pursuant to the Law on Courts, the police may not enter the court premises. Police may enter the court premises only if necessary, in order to prevent a general threat or upon a request by the president of the court, or by a request of a judge in case of president’s absence so as to prevent a punishable act. Security of courts’ facilities, property, persons and keeping of order is provided by the court police. Apart from the fact that the independence of judiciary has been guaranteed as one of the postulates of the rule of law, the right to an independent and impartial court is also guaranteed as an affirmative and personal right that every person enjoys in the course of criminal proceedings or upon decisions made in relation to a person’s civil rights and duties. The independence and impartiality of the judge in the course of decision-making upon a concrete case is ensured through the application of the principle of derogation.  Pursuant to Article 36 of the Law on Criminal Procedure, a judge or a lay judge may not perform judicial office if, ) he/she has been an injured party in the criminal offence; b) the defendant, the plaintiff, their legal representative or authorised person is his/her marital i.e. non-marital partner, a lineal relative by blood of any degree or collateral relative up to the fourth degree; c) he/she has been in a relationship of a foster-parent, foster-child, adopter, adoptee, guardian, sustained, with either the defendant, his/her attorney, the plaintiff or the injured party; d) has performed investigative proceedings in the same case or has participated in the examination of the defendant prior to the main hearing, or has participated in the procedure as a prosecutor, defending attorney, legal representative or authorised person, or has been examined as a witness or an expert and e) if he/she has participated in rendering of judgement by the lower-instance court in the same case. Similarly to the above, in civil proceedings the judge may be derogated in the event of grounds for suspicion that he or she will not be impartial (Articles 65-70 of the Law on Litigation Procedure). The rules on distribution of cases in accordance with objective and previously defined criteria ensure the right to the so-called “natural judge.” Election of judges Pursuant to the Constitution and the Law on Courts, judges are elected to a permanent term of office. Judges are elected and dismissed by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, upon a proposal by the Judicial Council. The establishment of this body was the final stage of the process of ensuring the independent position of the judicial authorities, as it ensured that assessment in the most sensitive segment (election and dismissal of judges) is done by a professional rather than a political body.  The procedure of election of judges commences by the publication of a public announcement in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia on selection of a judge at the respective court. The number of judges in each court is determined by a decision of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, upon a proposal put forward by the General Session of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia. The number of lay judges in each court is decided by the Assembly, upon a proposal of the first-instance courts and courts of appeals.  Elected as a judge may be a citizen of the Republic of Macedonia who fulfils the general, legally prescribed conditions on employment in a state administration body; who is a graduate lawyer; and who has passed the bar examination and enjoys an adequate reputation for performing the judicial office. Apart from these conditions, for a judge in a first-instance court, the candidate is required to have a working experience of over 5 years with proven results in legal matters after he/she has passed the bar examination. For a judge in a court of appeals, the candidate is required to have such experience of over 9, whereas for a judge at the Supreme Court the candidate’s experience must be over 12 years. A full or a part-time university professor who has been teaching a legal subject related to the judicial practice for more than 10 years may also be elected as a judge at the Supreme Court. A court president is elected under conditions, in a procedure and manner applied for election of judges, for a term of four years and from among the judges at the respective court, with a possibility of one re-election to another four year term. If not re-elected, the outgoing president of a court shall continue to work as a judge in the respective court. The conditions for election of a lay judge are the following: to be a citizen of the Republic of Macedonia of legal age and to have completed at least high school and to enjoy adequate reputation for performing the duty. Lay judges are elected for a four year term with a possibility of re-election.  The Judicial Council nominates for election the person with highest professional and working merits among the candidates fulfilling the prescribed criteria. In that, particularly taken into account shall be the data on the working performance of the candidate, upon a provided opinion on the professional and working merits of each of the candidates from the court, the body or other legal entity in which he/she has been employed, by the court to which elected, a higher-instance court and the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia. On the Council Session at which a proposal is determined for election or dismissal of a judge, opinion is given by the Minister of Justice and the President of the Supreme Court. In order to further the independence of the judiciary in the Republic of Macedonia, the system of election of judges will be changed. The foreseen changes have been clearly defined in the Judicial Reform Strategy (for more details see I_Annex_02). Namely, it has been proposed that the election of judges will be excluded from the competence of the Assembly as it is a political body. Election (appointment) will be transferred to the Judicial Council that will be composed primarily of judges. Hence, its members will be selected from the judiciary itself, which will be the primary guarantee for the respect of the independence of the judiciary. Another important novelty shall be the introduction of an initial training of candidates for judges that will last between 12 and 15 months and will be performed by a School for judges. The introduction of these changes will also establish a system of career promotion, under which the Judicial Council will decide on the appointment of a judge to a higher court, on the basis of clearly defined objective criteria. Dismissal of judges A judge may be dismissed in cases determined by the Constitution and in a legally prescribed procedure. Pursuant to the Constitution, a judge is dismissed, ) upon his/her request; b) if he/she becomes permanently incapacitated to perform the office, which is determined by the Judicial Council;  c) if he/she fulfils conditions for retirement; d) if sentenced for a criminal offence to an imprisonment of at least six moths; e) if he/she commits a serious disciplinary offence, as stipulated by law, which makes him/her unsuitable to perform the office as decided by the Judicial Council and f) owing to unprofessional or negligent performance of the office, as decided by the Judicial Council in a procedure stipulated by law.  The following are considered serious disciplinary offences which make a judge unsuitable for performance of the office and owing to which he/she may be dismissed: a) serious breach of public order and peace which damages his/her reputation and reputation of the court; b) party or political activity; c) performance of another public office or profession; d) serious disturbance of relations within the court that have serious effect over the performance of the office and e) serious violation of the rights of parties and other participants in a lawsuit, with damaging effect over the reputation of the court and the judicial office. The Council institutes a procedure for determining disciplinary liability of the judge if there are well-founded suspicions that the judge has committed a severer disciplinary violation as defined by law, which makes him/her unsuitable for performing the post of judge. Prior to the initiation of the procedure, the Council requests from the judge to plead with regard to the allegations against him/her in the proposal for the initiation of a procedure. Until the procedure is initiated, the proceedings are confidential in order not to damage the judge's public reputation. The Council decides on the disciplinary responsibility of judges pursuant to the factual situation determined by the Commission on Determining a Disciplinary Liability of Judges. The Commission comprises three Council members of which one chairs it. The Council appoints members of the Commission and an equal number of deputies for a three-year term. A proposal for instituting a procedure for determining the disciplinary liability of a judge may be filed by the Court President, the President of the higher court and the General Session of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia.  As an exception, a proposal for instituting a procedure for determining a disciplinary liability of a judge in the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia may only be filed by the General Session of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia. The proposal for instituting a procedure for determining disciplinary liability of a judge is filed within 15 days from the day of detecting the severe violation. The procedure for determining disciplinary liability of the judge is instituted within 30 days from the receipt of the proposal. The instituting and processing of disciplinary procedures becomes obsolete after a certain time frame pursuant to provisions pertaining on initiating and processing of disciplinary procedures in the Law on Labour Relations. The judge is given the proposal on the initiation of a procedure for determining his/her liability as well as a summons to attend the Commission’s debate. The submitter of the proposal is also invited to attend the debate and he/she represents the proposal. The Commission interrogates the judge, collects the necessary documents, inspects and examines other documents in order to determine facts and circumstances related to the disciplinary liability of the judge. The procedure for determining disciplinary liability of a judge is conducted legally and meticulously and in a manner that does not damage the reputation and dignity of the judge. The Council makes a decision with a two-thirds vote from the total number of members.The Council President appoints one of the Council members as a rapporteur on the disciplinary liability of the judge. Following the determined disciplinary responsibility of a judge, the Chamber may pronounce disciplinary sanction written rebuke (reprimand) or temporary reduction of the salary of up to 15% of its monthly amount, for a period of one to six months.  A judge shall be temporarily suspended from the performance of the office while in custody. A judge may also be temporarily suspended during an investigation for criminal offence, when a disciplinary procedure has been initiated, or when a procedure has been instituted for his/her dismissal.  Appointment of public prosecutors and deputy public prosecutors The operation of the Public Prosecutor’s Office in the Republic of Macedonia has been regulated with the Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04). The procedure of appointment of public prosecutors and deputies commences by a public vacancy announcement in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia. The appointment of a public prosecutor, i.e. a deputy public prosecutor is conducted by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, upon a proposal by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, following a prior affirmative opinion provided by the Public Prosecutors Council. If the Government does not approve of the opinion provided by the Public Prosecutors Council, it may request its re-consideration. If the Public Prosecutors Council, following the re-consideration of the proposal, gives another affirmative opinion by a two-thirds majority, the Government is obliged to accept the opinion.  Public prosecutors are appointed for a term of six years. Important novelty introduced with the new Law on Public Prosecutor’s Office (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04), is the establishment of permanent term of office for deputy public prosecutors in accordance with the Recommendation (2000) 19 of the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers. This provision contributes for the strengthening of their independence. The Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office prescribes the necessary conditions for a person to be appointed as a public prosecutor or deputy public prosecutor. Namely, elected as a public prosecutor or a deputy may be a citizen of the Republic of Macedonia who fulfils the general, legally prescribed conditions for employment in a state body, and is a graduate lawyer who has passed the bar examination and enjoys adequate reputation to perform the office. In addition, a candidate for a basic public prosecutor or deputy is required to have a working experience of over 5 years with proven results in legal matters after he/she has passed the bar examination. A candidate for a high public prosecutor or deputy has to have such experience of over 9 years. For a state public prosecutor or deputy, a candidate has to be a prominent legal expert with a working experience of over 12 years, with proven results in legal matters. Another important novelty is the provision under which a public prosecutor in a basic or a high public prosecutor’s office shall be, as a rule, elected from among the deputy public prosecutors in that office or from among the public prosecutor or deputy-public prosecutors in another prosecutor’s office. This provision has significantly enhanced the operation of the public prosecution and has considerably limited the possibility for external influences in the process of appointment of public prosecutors. Additional guarantee provided for a public prosecutor who shall not be re-appointed, is the provision under which he/she shall continue to perform the office of a deputy public prosecutor in the same public prosecutor’s office.  The Public Prosecutors Council is a newly established body introduced with the Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office. It comprises nine members. Ex officio members to the Public Prosecutors Council are the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia, who chairs the Council; high public prosecutors and the Skopje Basic Public Prosecutor, two members determined by the Collegium of the Public Prosecutor’s Office and two members determined by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, upon a proposal put forward by the Minister of Justice. The Public Prosecutors Council is authorised, among other, to give a positive opinion on the appointment of a public prosecutor, i.e. deputy public prosecutor; to decide in second-instance in a procedure for determining disciplinary responsibility, unprofessional performance of duties or unsatisfactory results in performance of duties. It also performs other duties stipulated by law. Termination of office and dismissal of public prosecutors and deputy public prosecutors The conditions for dismissal of a public prosecutor or deputy public prosecutor have been stipulated by the Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office. They shall be dismissed upon their request; if they permanently lose their mental and physical capacity for performing the office, which is determined by the Public Prosecutors Council on the basis of a finding and opinion by a competent medical committee; when they fulfil the conditions for old-age retirement; if sentenced for criminal offence in abuse of the office or for other criminal offence to imprisonment of more than six months; if sentenced to imprisonment of shorter duration or to other criminal sanction for a criminal offence which make them unsuitable for performance of the office;  when it shall be determined that they have committed serious disciplinary violation of the office, as stipulated by law, thus damaging the reputation of their office; and when determined that they have performed their office in an unprofessional manner or have yielded unsatisfactory results in their office. The proposal for dismissal of deputy public prosecutors in the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia and such proposals for the basic and high public prosecutors and their deputies are submitted before the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia by the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia. A proposal to dismiss the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia is submitted to the Assembly by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. The law determines what is to be regarded as a disciplinary violation of the office, and what shall be regarded as unprofessional manner of performance of the office or unsatisfactory results in the office. The Law determines the following conduct as a serious disciplinary violation of the office, a) serious violation of the public order and peace damaging his/her reputation and the reputation of the public prosecutor’s office; b) performance of another public office or profession; c) serious violation of the rights of parties and other participants in a procedure, damaging the reputation of the public prosecutor’s office; and d) dishonest behaviour towards individuals, state bodies or other legal persons, both in performance of the office and beyond. The law determines what is unprofessional manner of performance of the office or unsatisfactory results in the office of a public prosecutor - failure to carry out duties; negligent or unprofessional performance of official duties; unjustified refusal of official duties, i.e. failure to act upon guidelines given in accordance with this Law; and violation of the regulations on protection of a state or professional secret. A procedure to determine responsibility for serious disciplinary violation, unprofessional manner of performance of the office or unsatisfactory results in the office shall be initiated upon a proposal of the Government for the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia; the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia for all public prosecutors and deputy public prosecutors; a high public prosecutor for basic public prosecutor, deputy high public prosecutor and deputy basic public prosecutor; and a basic public prosecutor for a deputy basic public prosecutor. The Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office stipulates the following disciplinary sanctions: public reprimand; a fine in the amount of 20% of a monthly salary paid in the month immediately preceding the committing of the offence; and dismissal from the office. A procedure to determine disciplinary responsibility, unprofessional performance of duties or unsatisfactory results in performance of the office is conducted by a five-member Committee, whose composition shall be determined by the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia. Prior to the procedure, the Committee shall request from the respective public prosecutor i.e. deputy public prosecutor to respond to the allegations in the proposal for initiation of procedure. The second-instance authority in the procedure is the Public Prosecutors Council. Following its decision, the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia shall submit to the Assembly a proposal for dismissal of the prosecutor in question. A public prosecutor i.e. deputy public prosecutor shall be temporarily suspended from performance of the office while in detention. He/she may also be temporarily suspended during an investigation for criminal offence, when a disciplinary procedure has been initiated for serious disciplinary offence, for unprofessional performance of duties or unsatisfactory results in performance of the office. A decision on suspension is adopted by the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia, following a prior response on the allegations by the public prosecutor i.e. deputy public prosecutor. The decision for the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia is adopted by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, upon a proposal by the Minister of Justice. 
4. What could be the obstacles preventing judges from enjoying the necessary discretion when deciding a case? 
The judge is not bound by a higher court’s legal opinion. In the principle, case law is not considered as a source of law in the Republic of Macedonia. According to the traditional approach the role of judges is considered to be interpretation and not creation of laws. However, the case law has an influence on the work of courts, which to a lesser of greater extend, base their decisions of the case law. Decisions in more important or characteristic cases are regularly published in collections of court decisions, by which the case law contributes to the correct and uniformed application of the law. Uniformity in the application of laws is also ensured by the Supreme Court, as the highest instance court in the Republic of Macedonia. At its general session the Supreme Court defines positions on the principle and principled legal opinions, which are of great importance in the application of laws by courts.  Despite the fact that legal positivism is evidently strong in the Republic of Macedonia, under which courts are bound by legal norms, it is understandable that positivism cannot consistently resolve complicated cases, the resolution of which requires referring to legal theories and general principles of law. Therefore, it is clear why judges rely on moral principles to complement the principles of law. The law overall requires judges to accept, as much as possible, that the law is a structure of coherent sum of principles of justice, fairness and procedural correctness, requiring also that these principles are applied in the cases that shall be deliberated by judges. In respect of complicated cases judges are referred to apply principles, as the principles of justice and fairness, in light of their importance and weight that rules are lacking. Judges rely on these principles to complement the rules. A certain policy, a standard which defines the goals of the community of economic, political or social nature, can also be used.  The basic principles of the Law on Courts prohibit any influence on the judge in connection with deliberating in a specific case prohibiting especially any public statement aimed at influencing the course or outcome of the court proceedings. A court decision may be changed or derogated only by a competent court in a procedure prescribed by law.  A judge may not be taken liable due to an opinion or a decision made when judging. No restriction, influence, encouragement, pressure, threat or direct or indirect interference in the procedure are allowed over a judge when deciding in a case. The judicial function is incompatible with any other public office or profession. A judge may not be a member of a political party. He/she may not perform political office in a political party nor carry out party or political activities. A judge may not receive presents from parties or other persons with direct or indirect interest in a trial. The independence of judges has been ensured by their permanent office (a judge is elected to a permanent term of office) as well as by the immunity set forth in Article 100 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. In addition, procedural laws, include provisions that point to the inviolability of the discretionary rights of judges when deciding. Namely, Article 8 of the Law on Litigation Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of MacedoniaNos. 33/98 and 44/02), stipulates that a Court decides on the basis of its own judgement on the evidence that shall be taken as proven, based on a conscientious and careful evaluation of each evidence individually and of all evidence jointly, as well as on the basis of the results of the entire procedure. Article 339 of the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02 and 74/04), provides that a Court makes its ruling only upon facts and evidence presented during the principal process. The Court is obligated to assess conscientiously each evidence individually and in relation with other evidence and on that basis to draw conclusion on whether certain fact has been proven.  Judges decide based on free assessment of evidence and application of laws. This implies that a Court is not bound by any formal evidence rules, but evaluates evidence freely and in accordance with its conviction. However the Law on Criminal Procedure envisages strict evidence related prohibitions in connection with evidence gathered in an illegal manner or by violating the rights and freedoms, set forth by the Constitution, law and ratified international treaties, and the ensuing evidence. Such evidence may not be used and the court decisions may not be based on such evidence. In the Republic of Macedonia all constitutional and legal pre-conditions have been put in place for impartial ruling and for prevention of any kind of pressure over court's judgement. However, the transition, implementation of privatisation, redistribution of power, and occurrence of organised crime increase the potentials for pressures on judges. What’s more, judges’ salaries are not proportionate to the status, dignity and responsibility of their office.  An indirect obstacle to full discretionary ruling by judges could be the existing manner of election and promotion of judges, facilitating political influence. Aimed at resolving this problem, the Judicial Reform Strategy defines an appropriate solution (for more details see I_Annex_02

6. What is the average duration of cases for (a) civil and (b) criminal decisions? In case of delays in handling cases, which problems are they mainly linked with? (For example: complex summoning process; intentional delays by attorneys; prolonged period for collection of evidence; police evidence not being accepted in courts; failure by witnesses to appear; failure by judicial experts to appear; workload associated with enterprise registration; workload associated with high number of appeals; absence of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms; complex case management; lack of technical equipment.) 
The average duration of cases for civil and criminal decisions is presented in the chart bellow: 
Average duration of cases 2001 2002 2003 2004 (first 6 months) basic courts 10 m. & 10 days 10 m. & 1 day 8 m. & 26 days 9 m. & 16 days appealed civil cases (second instance proceedings) 30 days 1 m. & 11 days 1 m. & 9 days 1 m. & 24 days Civil Cases Supreme Court 1 y. & 6 m. & 22 days 1 y. & 6 m. & 26 days 11m. & 10 days 7 m. & 15 days basic courts 9 m. & 13 days 9 m. & 24 days 8 m. & 27 days 9 m. & 7 days appealed criminal cases (second instance proceedings) 1 m. & 1 day 28 days 26 days 26 days Criminal cases Supreme Court 1 m. & 12 days 2 months 1 m. & 29 days 2 m. & 6 days Source: State Statistical Office The analysis of the performance of the judicial system in the Republic of Macedonia demonstrates that the delivery of court summons or documents has been one of the main reasons for delays in the proceedings. The legal provisions that govern this matter leave large space for abuse on the part of the involved parties by avoiding to receive court summons or documents, or by indicating incorrect or concealing the accurate address. The principle of personal delivery that has been accepted in the procedural legislation (both criminal and civil) as a condition associated with individual freedoms and rights, does not correspond consistently with the other regulation (for residence registration) that would allow greater civil obedience and functioning of a so-called “mail box” system. Furthermore, laws allow for an abuse of the institute of exemption (in practice, besides the request for exemption of the sitting judge, and after a negative ruling upon such a request, an exemption could also be requested for the Court’s President and even for the Court itself, and even more on several occasions during the same proceedings upon a single case).  Frequent delays of trial hearings also occur as a result of the failure of the involved parties, attorneys, witnesses or court experts to appear before the court, despite having been orderly summoned. Such occurrence has been typical in particular for cases involving larger number of parties, i.e. defendants and attorneys.  The existing legal provisions which allow new facts and evidence to be presented in proceedings upon appeals, directly contribute to the delays in proceedings (if a party is not satisfied with the Court’s ruling, by presenting new facts and evidence in the appeal, it exercises a possibility that the decision may be revoked by a higher court and the case be remanded to the court of first instance for re-trial and re-assessment).  Regarding the alternative resolution of disputes, until now there has been no such system developed in the Republic of Macedonia. Mediation has been stipulated neither in civil nor in criminal proceedings. The Law on Litigation Procedure, in Chapter 30 (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 33/98 and 44/02), regulates the procedure before selected courts; however its scope of application has been very limited.  Additional reasons for delays in procedure are the non-existence of adequate registers and records, as well as the low level of technical equipment available to the courts in their handling of cases. Namely, there is still lack of an integrated and authorised access to good-quality information, as well as of generation and storage mechanism for all documents from the initiation up to the permanent filing of a case (inappropriate document management).  At the same time, the flow, organisation and analysis of data are a slow process. 
7. Please provide statistics (separate figures for civil, criminal and administrative cases) on the number of pending cases over the last five years. 
The enclosed charts include figures on the received new cases in procedure, decided cases in the course of the current year, total cases in procedure and the backlog of cases at the end of the year. The provided figures are for the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia, Appellate Courts and Basic Courts in the Republic of Macedonia. If administrative disputes are set aside the figures lead to the conclusion that the Supreme Court is efficient in deciding upon civil and criminal cases. Similarly efficient in deciding are the appellate courts. In basic courts, majority of cases are in the domain of misdemeanours. Furthermore, a large number of the newly received cases for procedure in the courts are enforceable civil (general and commercial) cases. An analysis of the performance of courts in the Republic of Macedonia points to the fact that per year, they manage to decide a number of cases almost equal to the number of the received cases.

8. Are there plans to reduce the backlog of cases? If so, please provide details. 
A conclusion may be drawn from the information given in the answer to the question I_D_7 that the largest backlog of cases has been in the basic courts. Taking into account the inflow of cases and the dynamics in their resolution, the appellate courts have been efficient in their procedure. If the structure of the backlog of cases is analysed, we see that the three most serious bottlenecks in courts are misdemeanours, enforceable civil cases and administrative disputes.  The reasons for backlogs of cases in courts are complex. Partly, they are of a subjective and partly of an objective nature. Most typical are the difficulties with the delivery, abuse of procedural powers by the involved parties, certain weaknesses in the procedural laws, organisational position of courts etc. In addition the large number of court cases is due to the privatisation process, the layoffs resulting from the economic reforms, the emergence of certain forms of organised crime and other phenomena typical of transitional societies.  In order to overcome the problem with backlog of cases in courts, the Republic of Macedonia has undertaken serious measures and actions defined in the Judicial Reform Strategy (see I_Annex_02). The enhancement of the efficiency in the judiciary is a short term priority within the judicial system reform and it shall be fulfilled by taking action in several directions. Simplification of procedures, changes in the organisation and competence of courts, completion of the process of installation of IT in courts and introduction of a system of measures for alternative resolution of disputes are the crucial points at which action shall be taken as part of the reform of the judiciary in the Republic of Macedonia. The effects of these reforms should be - increased efficiency of courts and their enhanced independence.  Namely, amendments will be proposed to the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/03), in respect to the responsibility and the obligation for case management and organisation of court delivery service or engagement of specialised delivery services. In parallel with this activity, appropriate amendments shall be proposed to procedural laws that govern the delivery process. Simplification of judicial procedure is a basic precondition to increase the efficiency of the judiciary. In that direction, reforms of the criminal procedure law have been envisaged, and in a short time the adoption of a new Law on Litigation Procedure (passed first reading in Parliament) and Law on Execution and Security (second reading is ongoing), that will include novelties which will allow for an efficient enforcement of civil judgments, is foreseen.  In the sphere of legislation governing criminal proceedings, and in order to speed up the proceedings, solutions have been incorporated in the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02 and 74/04), and Law on Misdemeanours (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97 and 35/97), based on European standards for accelerating the procedure and for exercising the right to a trial within a reasonable time. Amendments refer to the efficiency of delivery, elimination of the abuse of procedural rules by the involved parties aimed at its intentional postponement, reduction of terms, reassessment of legal remedies and the manner of deciding upon them. In the new Law on Litigation Procedure, changes have been envisaged in the following direction: ensuring clear position of court and parties in the case; more order and discipline in procedural actions; making sure that the requests and proposals submitted to the court are clear, accurate, well- argument and submitted in the determined time frame so as to allow the Court to accurately apply the law and make the decision. The new law will also revise the principle of substantive truth - the burden of proof will pass on to the parties; the principle of concentration of procedure will be strengthened; presentation of new facts and evidence in proceedings upon appeals will be prevented; conditions and procedure of disqualification will be revised; financial sanctions for abuse of procedural powers on the part of the involved parties will be introduced; a new mechanism of delivery will be developed; the institute of inactivity of proceedings will be abandoned and certain extra-legal remedies will be redefined. As far as the alternative dispute resolution mechanisms are concerned, given that the extra-judicial resolution of disputes by the application of the institute of mediation contributes most directly to reducing the number of cases and in that way relieving the judiciary from the burden of acting upon cases that could be resolved in this manner, the Strategy recognises the need to draft a Law on Mediation that would regulate the various forms of mediation and reconciliation, the arbitral resolution of conflicts, as well as the legal effect of acts and rulings reached in such an extra-judicial procedure. With regard to the workload in courts associated with enterprise registration, the Strategy envisages that the registration is to be conducted out of courts, and that courts only determine the facts of registration. The objective that is to be achieved is to relieve the courts from acting upon purely administrative matters related to registration of enterprises and thus accelerate and simplify the registration procedure itself.  In the sphere of administrative disputes, it has been stipulated that they are derogated from the competence of the Supreme Court and that they pass into the competence of basic courts. Reforms aimed at reducing the backlog of misdemeanour cases have been envisaged to be carried out in two stages. In the first stage, a new Law on Misdemeanours will be adopted that will stipulate a prior procedure of mandatory sanctions and mediation and settlement between the body competent to initiate the misdemeanour procedure and the perpetrator of the misdemeanour, and in that way alleviate the pressure of misdemeanour cases on courts. The second stage will include initiation of amendments to constitutional provisions which stipulate an exclusive court competence over misdemeanours as punishable acts. The new constitutional solution should provide for a competence of administration to decide upon specific minor misdemeanours in traffic, customs, finance and business, providing at the same time constitutional and legal guarantees for legal protection of citizens against illegal acts of the state administration.  With regard to the measures and activities pertaining to the changes in the courts’ organisation and jurisdiction, particularly important is the introduction of a double system of first instance competence by establishing higher courts of first instance and transformation of certain courts of “minor competence” into departments within other courts. In order to simplify and speed up procedures before courts and handle court cases more efficiently, the implementation of the Judicial IT project will be intensified in the forthcoming period by implementing its sub-projects in all segments of the judiciary as a follow-up to the already completed project of introduction of IT in courts. Namely, this project has started with the PHARE 2000 and will be finalised with CARDS 2003 Programme. 9. What is the rate of enforcement of civil and criminal decisions (in percentage)? How much time elapses, on average, until the enforcement of judgements? Is there any plan to improve enforcement? What part of the backlog is connected with the enforcement of civil judgements? 
Average time period between the delivery and the execution of rulings in civil and criminal cases 
2001 2002 2003 2004 (first 6 months) Civil  Cases 11 months & 11 days 6 months & 18 days 6 months & 23 days 7 months & 12 days Criminal Cases 2 year & 9 months & 16 days 3 year & 1 months & 5 days 2 year & 3 months & 21 days 1 year & 11 months & 29 days Source: State Statistical Office The area of enforcement of civil judgments represents one of the most serious problems in the judiciary. Namely, at the end of 2003 there was a backlog of 175.000 enforceable general cases and around 35.000 enforceable commercial cases. (For more details see I_D_6 and I_D_7The already identified weaknesses in the system of enforcement of civil judgments, such as: the inappropriate legal framework, favouring of the debtor at the expanse of the creditor, which is a residue from the previous political system, lack of adequate registers and records and the low level of the available technical equipment, funds and personnel in the court’s enforcement units, will be to a great extent overcome by the adoption of the new legal framework.  The new Law on Execution and Security, that is in parliamentary procedure (second reading), will shorten the deadlines for using the appeal and petition rights, will substantially reduce the grounds for using these institutes and will develop a concept whereby the position of favouring the debtor will be abandoned. Furthermore, the new law will create a basis for proper staffing and provision of funds and technical capacities in courts’ enforcement units and will develop a system of enforcement of rulings out of courts that will be conducted by authorised persons who will be issued a working licence by the Minister of Justice.  In order to improve the use of certain records and registers in the country and thus make the information on debtors, necessary in the execution procedure, available to the competent judicial bodies and trial parties, changes will be proposed to the laws governing the central register, banking, cadastre and court register. On the basis of the aforementioned, the difficulty with the enforcement of civil judgments has been identified in the Judicial Reform Strategy as a priority that should be tackled in short term. (For more details see I_Annex_02
10. Please describe the procedure for executing civil judgements. Is a separate execution decision by a judge normally required? 
The Law on Execution Procedure (“Official Gazette of Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 53/97, 59/00 and  64/03), regulates the rules according to which the courts may act to enforce a ruling imposing obligations, and to secure claims. (Article 1)  Execution and security procedures are initiated upon the proposal of the creditor or ex officio when so determined by law. Execution and security is approved and performed by the court (Article 3). The court is obliged to act urgently in carrying out execution and security procedure. For execution of decisions in civil matters, the judge needs to adopt a separate execution decision, which is passed in an execution procedure.  An individual judge conveys the first-instance execution procedure, while a council of three judges conveys the second-instance ones. The rulings are adopted in a form of a decision or a conclusion. By a conclusion, an official person is ordered to enforce certain action(s). The execution conclusion also contains decisions on other issues related to administering the procedure.  The court allows the execution of procedures on the basis of execution documents (court decision, court settlement, a decision or settlement in an administrative procedure if it refers to securing claims, notary documents) or valid documents (invoice, bill, cheque, public document, excerpts from certified business records, a personal document certified pursuant to law, a document signifying a public document). The proposal on execution must specify the creditor and the debtor, the legally valid or authentic document, the obligation of the debtor, the method and subject to execution and other data relevant for the execution. More creditors, who realise their claims from a single debtor and in the same matter, shall be disbursed in the order in which they have acquired the right to disbursement in that particular matter.  The court adopts a decision on the proposal, which includes the same elements as the proposal. The execution decision shall be delivered to both, the creditor and the debtor, while a decision rejecting the proposal shall be delivered only to the creditor.  Following the execution decision, the judge may undertake execution measures for enforcement of a ruling imposing obligations, as well as for securing claims. The execution is conveyed within the limits prescribed by the execution decision. The execution procedure provides for the following legal remedies: appeal, as a legal remedy against a first instance execution decision adopted on the basis of a legally valid document; and plea as a legal remedy against an execution decision adopted on the basis of an authentic document. An appeal shall be filed within 8 days from the day of the delivery of the first instance decision. No revision or re-opening of the procedure is allowed against a legally valid decision adopted in the execution and security procedure. In case the execution document has been legally annulled, amended, abrogated or repealed; if the debtor has disbursed the creditor’s claims during the execution procedure; if the execution decision has been legally annulled or amended; if the execution conveyed over the funds registered at a debtor’s account within the holder of the payment operations or by cash payment has been declared inadmissible, then the debtor may file a proposal with the court for counter-execution, requesting that the creditor pays back what he/she has been given with the execution. Execution aimed at recovery of claims may be carried out through: execution over movable objects; execution over financial claims of a debtor; execution over claim to hand over or deliver movable objects or hand over a real estate; execution over shares; execution over other property rights and execution over real estate. Execution over movable objects is performed by an inventory and assessment of the objects; by selling the objects and disbursing the creditor out of the acquired amount. The Law includes separate provisions governing the execution over property of legal entities in order to provide for recovery of outstanding money claims. Execution to recover non-financial claims shall be performed through: hand-over and delivery of movable objects; clearing and delivery of real estate; obligation to act, obligation to be a subject to an action or obligation to refrain from acting; return of an employee at work; entry of rights in a public register; division of objects and making a statement of will. The Law separately regulates the security procedure. As security measures only the following may be allowed: right to lien on property; establishment of rights to lien on real estate and movable objects, upon an agreement between the parties; prior measures; and temporary measures. The Law on Execution Procedure in Article 12 prescribes execution and security restrictions to foreign state properties in the Republic of Macedonia. Namely, such execution or security may be allowed only by prior consent from the Ministry of Justice. This consent shall not be necessary if the foreign state has explicitly agreed on the execution or security. 11. How do you ensure that natural and legal persons from EU Member States have access to your courts free of discrimination compared to your own nationals? 
The principle of equality of the citizens before the courts derives from the general principle of equality of the citizens as stipulated in Article 9 of the Constitution (“Official Gazette of the  Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), according to which the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia are equal in the freedoms and rights regardless of their gender, race, colour, ethnic origin or social status. The citizens have equal rights before the Constitution and the law. The rights of foreign citizens are determined by Article 29 according to which they enjoy freedoms and rights in the Republic of Macedonia guaranteed with the Constitution, under conditions determined by law and international treaties. The constitutional provisions for equality are materialised with the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/03). According to Article 7 of this Law, everyone has a right to equal treatment in front of the courts for the protection of his/her rights and his/her legally based interests. Everyone has a right to a fair trial within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial court established by law.No one may be denied access to courts due to lack of material means. The right to a fair trial in the Republic of Macedonia is guaranteed to each person accused for a criminal act, regardless of the fact whether he/she is a citizen of the Republic of Macedonia, foreigner, or a stateless person. Moreover, foreigners have additional guarantees, as in circumstances when they are detained or deprived from freedom. In such cases they have access to the consular and diplomatic representative offices as well as a right to a free assistance of an interpreter during the police and court procedure. Concerning the civil procedure the Law on Resolving Conflict of Laws with Regulations of Other Countries in Specific Areas (“Official Gazette of SFRY”, Nos. 43/82 and 72/82), Article 82, stipulates the obligation for the foreign citizens when submitting appeals to the Macedonian courts to give cautio iudicatum solvi (securing the costs of due process at the request of the defendant party). Due to this obligation, the foreign subjects must be released, if the Republic of Macedonia has established diplomatic or factual reciprocity with the country of origin of this subject. With the Member States of the European Union, the Republic of Macedonia has established diplomatic reciprocity in terms of exemption from giving cautio iudicatum solvi, through the ratification of the following international conventions:   Civil Procedure Convention, of Hague, 1 March 1954 (“Official Gazette of the SFRY”, No. 06/62); and   Convention on International Access to Justice, of Hague, 25 October 1980 (“Official Gazette of the SFRY”, No. 04/88).   With these two Hague Conventions, legal and natural persons from the European Union are guaranteed the right to exemption from paying the court costs in case of poor financial state. Member states of the European Union which are not members of the aforementioned Hague conventions are exempted from paying cautio iudicatum solvi on the basis of factual reciprocity. The Republic of Macedonia has ratified the European Convention of Human Rights with the additional protocols and the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Macedonian constitutional and legal provisions are in compliance with these instruments. The Republic of Macedonia guarantees all persons under its jurisdiction (including foreign natural persons and legal entities) the right of access to the courts and the right not to interfere in the private property, as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention and Protocol No.1 to the European Convention on Human Rights. This convention is part of the domestic legal order and is self-executing (Article 98 and 118 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia). 12. Pre-trial detention: a) What is the average duration of pre-trial detention? b) Please describe the rules and procedures governing pre-trial detention and, in particular, the rules on extending it. c) How are human and secure conditions for detainees (in respect of international human rights standards) ensured by the police, justice, prosecution and penitentiary systems? What measures are taken if such standards are not respected? d) Do police, prison and other officers receive training on human rights, including training on the rights of women and of minorities? e) What measures have been put in place to prevent or prosecute the occurrence of torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment? 
a)  The average duration of detention in 2001 was 39 days, in 2002 - 41 days, in 2003 - 44 days, whereas in the first six months of 2004 it was 46 days. (Source: State Statistical Office) 
b)  Pursuant to Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 1/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), a person’s liberty is inviolable. No person’s liberty may be restricted except by a court decision and in cases and procedure prescribed by law. A pre-trial detention before indictment may last, by a court ruling, up to 180 days from the day the person has been deprived of liberty. Once the indictment have been submitted to the court, detention may be extended or decided upon by the competent court in cases and in a procedure determined by law. Pursuant to Article 1 paragraph 2 of the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the  Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02 and 74/04), the freedom and rights of a defendant and of other persons, prior to a final ruling, may be restricted only to a necessary extent and under conditions prescribed by law. One of the measures that may be taken against a defendant in order to ensure his/her presence and successful conduct of the criminal proceedings is detention.  The Law on Criminal Procedure in Article 183 sets forth that detention may be ordered only under conditions stipulated therein. A pre-trial detention must be reduced to the shortest necessary duration. All bodies involved in criminal proceedings and those that provide legal assistance are obliged to act with particular urgency if the defendant has been in detention. Throughout the proceedings, the detention shall be vacated as soon as the reasons for the detention cease to exist and the detainee shall be released. Pursuant to Article 184 of the Law, detention may be ordered of a person for whom there is a reasonable suspicion of having committed a criminal offence and if:     He/she has been hiding;    His/her identity may not be determined or in case of other circumstances which point to a risk of his/her escape;    A reasonable fear exists that he/she may destroy traces of the criminal act or if there are specific circumstances pointing  that the person may hamper the investigation by influencing witnesses, accomplices or conceivers;    Specific circumstances justify the fear that he/she may repeat the criminal act, attempt a crime or commit a criminal act which he/she has threatened to commit.  Detention is mandatory in case of a reasonable suspicion that the person has committed a criminal offence punishable by a sentence of life imprisonment. 
Detention is ordered and vacated by an investigating judge. The detained person may appeal to the Chamber against the detention order within 24 hours from its delivery. If interrogated for the first time after this deadline has expired, the defendant may appeal while being interrogated. The appeal, along with the interrogation minutes in cases in when the detained has been interrogated, and the detention order, shall immediately be submitted to the Chamber. The appeal shall not postpone the enforcement of the order. The Chamber which decides upon the appeal has to pass its judgement within 48 hours. 
Detention by a judge’s order or a detention ordered by a Chamber (consisting of three judges) for the first time during an investigation may last up to 30 days from the day of the deprivation of liberty. Any deprivation of liberty shall count to the duration of detention. In the course of an investigation, the Chamber may prolong the detention for a term not longer than 60 days. If the crime in question is punishable by imprisonment of at least 5 years, after the expiry of the 60 days period, a Chamber of the immediately superior court may extend the detention by up to 90 days. The total duration of pre-trial detention may not be longer than 180 days. Upon expiration of this period, the detainee must immediately be released. During investigation, the investigating judge may cancel detention (Articles 189 and 190). Once charges have been brought and until the completion of the main hearing, detention may be ordered, extended, or cancelled only by a Chamber’s decision, either ex officio or upon request by an authorised plaintiff. The so determined detention may last up to one year (for crimes punishable by sentence of up to 15 year) and up to two years (for crimes punishable by a life imprisonment). After 30 days elapse from the validity of the latest detention order, the Chamber which has decided on the detention is obliged, even without the parties’ request, to deliberate whether reasons for detention still exist and rule on its cancellation or extension. If the defendant flees, a detention period starts again (Article 191). Prior to bringing charges in summary proceedings, detention may last as long as necessary to conduct investigation, but no longer than 8 days. Once charges have been brought and until the completion of the main hearing, detention may last up to 60 days (Article 419). 
c)  Treatment of detained persons has been regulated by the Law on Criminal Procedure. Basic principles are the following: during detention, the personality and dignity of the defendant may not be offended and only such measures are allowed against him/her which may be necessary to prevent an escape or a plan that could be harmful for a successful conduct of the proceedings. The rights of the detainees have been regulated in detail in a number of provisions of the Law where their rights have been elaborated. Detainees are recognised the right to 8 hours of uninterrupted rest over 24 hours and the right to stay at least two hours per day in open air within the prison. These rights are unconditional. Furthermore, detainees are entitled to a diet at their own expense; may bring their own clothing and use their own linen; supply at their own expense books, newspapers and other objects that serve their usual needs, providing that this may not be harmful for a successful conduct of the proceedings, a matter decided upon by the investigating authority.  Following an approval by the investigating judge who conducts the investigation and under his/her supervision, a detainee may, within the house rules, be visited by his/her close relatives, or by a physician or other persons, if so requested by him/her. Particular visits may be denied if they may be detrimental to the course of the proceedings. By knowledge and under supervision of the investigating authority, a detainee may correspond with persons outside the prison. The right to send and receive letters and other parcels may be forbidden if they are detrimental for the conduct of the proceedings. No ban, though, may be imposed on submission of petition, appeal or complaint.   Foreign citizens that have been detained following an approval of the investigating judge may be visited by heads of diplomatic and consular missions in the Republic of Macedonia. Visit approval shall be requested through the Ministry of Justice. In addition, detained persons may, upon approval of the investigating judge, be visited by members of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment as well as by members of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Upon the Committee’s request, the investigating judge is obliged to approve them a visit and communication with detainees. These visits may not be supervised. In case of a disciplinary offence, the investigating judge i.e. the president of the Chamber may pronounce disciplinary sanction to restrict visits. However, this sanction does not apply to the defendant’s communication with his/her attorney. Against the pronounced disciplinary sanction, appeal may be filed before court’s Chamber. (Articles 193 - 196) A provision in Article 197 of the Law on Criminal Procedure regulates the supervision over detainees. This supervision is conducted by the Court’s President or a judge appointed by him/her. Appointed to conduct such supervision, though, may not be an investigating judge. The Law stipulates that they are obliged to visit the detainees at least once a week. During the visits, with no presence of a warden or a guard, they are to become acquainted with the dietary details, the way detainees are supplied with other necessities and the way they are being treated. If irregularities are observed, the court’s president or a judge appointed by him/her is obliged to take measures for their elimination. A public prosecutor may be present during such visits. As regards disciplinary liability of the security services staff and of the prison staff in general, the Law on Execution of Sanction (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 3/97, 23/99 and 74/04) refers to general regulations governing labour relations and to the Law on Organisation and Operation of State Administrative Bodies (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 58/00 and 44/02), Articles 205-212, which envisage disciplinary proceedings against employees for violation of employment obligations and for other violations of the work discipline when perpetrated by fault of the employee, and especially if the employee does not fulfil the entrusted tasks conscientiously and in an orderly manner, if he /she does not abide by the law and other regulations or by the rules of conduct in the course of work or in relation to the work.  Cases of unprofessional conduct by police officers are examined by the Sector for Professional Standards (at the Ministry of the Interior). Non-fulfilment of prescribed procedures implies disciplinary and/or criminal liability of the police officers. In 2002 the Internal Control and Professional Standards Sector at the Ministry of the Interior has received 220 applications, which resulted in 66 disciplinary proceedings. In 2003, 770 applications were processed, 273 of which ended in disciplinary proceedings (item 28 of the Report of the Committee for Prevention of Torture - CPT of July 2004). The CPT Report recognises progress in respect of important issues: as compared with the previous visits, the Delegation has received fewer allegations for ill-treatment of persons deprived of freedom (item 7). However, it has been established that there remain serious problems in the system of responsibility.  On more details concerning legislative and administrative measures aimed at prevention of occurrence of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in state institutions, prisons or police stations; on their compliance with international human rights standards; on measures that enable inspection of the premises hosting persons deprived of liberty or police stations and on the legal remedies intended for victims, please see question I_H_12
d)  Incorporation of human rights in the training of the Macedonian police is a process that has been accepted by the Ministry of the Interior as a necessity aimed at effective and efficient fulfilment of working assignments. Human rights and freedoms have been part of the continuing professional training at the Police Academy which includes a separate subject in the curriculum: “Human Rights and the Police”. There have also been additional training programmes and special courses for retraining and professional upgrading. During the seminars on Human Rights and the Police and Policing in a Democracy, which the Ministry of the Interior has organised together with the OSCE and the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, special attention was dedicated to the protection of human rights in police custody.  In order to enhance the respect of the rights of persons held in custody, in every police station a poster has been placed, featuring a question "Do you know your rights?” On the poster, which is to be found in the most prominent part of every police station, the 6 (six) basic rights are written in seven  languages - namely, 1 – the right to be immediately informed in a language he/she understands of the reasons for being deprived of liberty and of any criminal charges against him/her; 2 – right to remain silent and to choose not make a statement against him/herself or against his close persons; 3 – right to be advised by a lawyer and to have an attorney during interrogation; 4 – right that his family or other person of his/her choice be informed; 5 – right to be examined by a physician; 6 – right to be brought before a judge within 24 hours. Every police officer assigned to work with apprehended persons or those held in custody must inform and read out these rights to them. If a person held in custody invokes any of these rights, the police officer has to enable that right i.e. do everything in order to ensure respect and protection of the human rights and freedoms of the apprehended i.e. of the person held in custody, when he/she has been restricted freedom of movement. The International Committee of the Red Cross has been engaged to organise humanitarian law seminars for the members of the Special Police Unit “Tiger” and of the Special Police Unit for Rapid Deployment, as well as other police officers of the Ministry of the Interior. Similarly, a number of domestic and international governmental and non-governmental organisations have continuously organised seminars, forums, workshops etc. Topics include human rights in all aspects, and in particular conduct of the police while enforcing policing authority. All members of the Ministry of the Interior have been actively participating in these events. As part of the additional and continuous training of employees of the Ministry of Interior and within the Police Training Reports, special emphasis has been given to the respect and protection of human rights while enforcing police authority. Particularly highlighted have been the following topics: Introduction to human rights and basic human rights issues; deprivation of freedom; arrest and detention within the context of restriction of the right to freedom of movement; use of force, coercion means and use of firearms within the context of protection of the right to life; human rights during interrogation in terms of ensuring a possibility for a fair trial and presumption of innocence; non-discrimination in policing on any grounds with special emphasis on the rights of vulnerable groups (children, women, elderly and persons with special needs); arbitrary interference in private life in terms of protection of the right to privacy and correspondence; policing in a democracy with an emphasis on the basics of democracy; multi-ethnic society and police; rights of minorities, their representation; and police ethics as a brief police constitution for their conduct.  The Ministry of the Interior, in cooperation with the non-governmental sector (Peace and Democracy Initiative and the Frederich Ebert Foundation – Office Macedonia), has carried out a project Partners in Peace and Prevention. The Project promoted the concept of conflict prevention and early warning by raising awareness among actors at the local level. Fifty police officers were anonymously surveyed on the project. This project’s objective was also to obtain feedback on the new decentralisation process that will raise the level of responsibility of local authorities including the police. With regard to multi-ethnic tolerance and policing in multi-ethnic environment, workshops have been organised on the Police in Multiethnic Environment, as a result of cooperation between the Ministry of the Interior and the non-governmental sector (the Citizens’ Association - Centre for Open Communication), with an emphasis on the challenge of policing in multiethnic environment. In 2004 changes to the Criminal Code (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.19/04), domestic violence have been defined (Article 122). Within the additional police training on the rights of women, they have been treated as part of human rights Particular emphasis was put on the rights of vulnerable groups like children, elderly people and persons with special needs. Furthermore, the Ministry of the Interior in cooperation with UNICEF, Foundation Open Society Institute Macedonia and NGO’ s, has organised a series of seminars and workshops on domestic violence, sexual abuse of women and children, trafficking in human beings, attended by the Ministry of the Interior personnel. This kind of additional training has been planned for 2005, as well. (For more details, see I_F_10)  Similarly, the Police Academy provides higher education and conducts scientific and research activities, practical work, as well as continuous training. The Police Academy provides training for the personnel of the Ministry of the Interior and other bodies, institutions and legal persons that operate in the field of security. In addition, the Academy provides continued education of persons with already acquired degree of knowledge by providing elementary police education, special training, and education and training in security management. At all levels of education, all educational components of the human rights  are being incorporated, including rights of women and minorities (Constitutional law, police and human rights, police ethics and deontology, victimology, international law and international relations, conflict management, European law, police law and authority enforcement, policing in multi-ethnic society, gender difference awareness). With regard to the prison personnel, a Prison Personnel Training Centre has been established which provides for their comprehensive education, further training and assessment of knowledge. 


In the prison system in the Republic of Macedonia, the right to human treatment of detainees has been guaranteed, as well as the principle to ensure that their personality and dignity are not offended.  In order to protect the psychological and physical integrity of detainees and ensure the respect of human personality and dignity the Law on Execution of Sanctions (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 03/97 and 23/99), forbids any form of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, collective punishment, and coercion. For violation of the rights of detainees on the part of the prison personnel, a penal procedure, disciplinary or criminal, is initiated against the official who has violated these rights. Detainees who have been victims of torture and other forms of inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment may exercise their rights pursuant to Article 50 of the Constitution according to which, every citizen may invoke the protection of freedoms and rights set forth in the Constitution, before courts of law and the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia, in a procedure based upon principles of priority and urgency.  In cases when torture and other forms of inhuman treatment have elements of a criminal offence, detainees may exercise their right to protection by filing criminal charges to the public prosecutor.  Acts subject to a private lawsuit may be filed to the court of law. For criminal offences subject to ex officio prosecution, in case the public prosecutor has dropped the charges, the victim i.e. the injured party has a right to take over the prosecution as a subsidiary prosecutor. If a person has suffered damage as a result of a criminal offence, he/she has a right to file a damages claim, and if he/she is referred to a lawsuit the case shall be resolved in a civil suit in accordance with general provisions on indemnity.  In cases of torture or other forms of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, protection may be sought from the Ombudsman (Articles 24, 31, 32 from the Law on the Ombudsman), who, in accordance with the Constitution, protects the freedoms and rights of citizens when they have been violated by an act or activity of state administrative bodies or bodies and organisations with public authority. If the Ombudsman detects violation of constitutionally and legally guaranteed rights of detainees, he/she may propose an initiation of a disciplinary measure against the official person, or may file to the public prosecutor a request on initiation of criminal proceedings against that person. Furthermore, Article 20 of the Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office (“Official Gazette of the  Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04), states that when implementing the prosecution of perpetrators of criminal and other legally determined punishable offences, the public prosecutor is authorised to ensure consistent implementation of sanctions pronounced for punishable acts and protection of persons who have been detained.Concerning the application of international standards on the prevention of torture and other inhuman or degrading behaviour for more details see I_H_12
13. Detention: a) What is the ratio of prison sentences compared with alternative sentences? b) Are inquiries into cases and allegations of ill treatment of detainees followed up? If so, how is this done? What is done to ensure a thorough, transparent and independent process? c) What is the average number of prisoners per cell? Are prisons over-crowded? d) Is special attention devoted to female prisoners and young offenders? If yes, please provide a detailed description. e) Are alternative measures to imprisonment being developed or in place? If yes, please describe the measures. 
a) Pursuant to Recommendation Number R (92)16 of the European Rules on Community Sanctions and Measures, adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on 19.10.1992, the Republic of Macedonia has incorporated in its domestic legislation alternative measures with the adoption of the Law Amending the Criminal Code (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 19/04), passed on 30.03.2004. Taking this into consideration, there are still no indicators as to the ratio between prison and alternative sentences. However, even before the 2004 amendments to the Criminal Code, the system of sanctions had included probation, probation under supervision and court reprimand as alternative sanctions. Since these sanctions were pronounced in lieu of prison sentences, serving as indicator may be the statistical data on the ratio of the pronounced prison sentences compared with probations and court reprimands as distinct criminal sanctions, which have now, with the amendments to the Code, been transformed into alternative measures. Thus, in 2003, 5796 persons were sentenced to prison, probation was pronounced to 2831 and court reprimand was imposed on 183 persons. It follows that the ratio of pronounced criminal sanctions probation and court reprimand (which under the new Criminal Code are alternative measures) compared with the prison sentences was 52 %.  
b)  Taking as the starting point the Constitutional provision that no one may be restricted freedom, except by a court decision and in cases and procedures prescribed by law (Article 12), as well as the endorsement in the Law on Execution of Sanctions, (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 03/97, 23/99 and 74/04), of international standards set forth in the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and the European Prison Rules, persons that are subject to sanctions are treated in a humane manner, with respect for their human dignity and by protecting their physical and moral integrity. Any form of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is prohibited. Article 184 (paragraph 1) and 185 of the Law on Execution of Sanctions regulate the use of coercion and firearms. On the use of coercion or firearms information shall be provided to the Sanctions Enforcement Authority, which shall assess the justification of the application of these methods. If unlawful use of coercion has been determined, against the official who had used the coercion or had ordered such a use, a penal procedure, disciplinary or other, shall be initiated, depending on the extent to which the competence had been exceeded.  Pursuant to Articles 163-167 of the Law on Execution of Sanctions, the convicted persons are entitled to file complaints and other submissions to protect their rights to competent authorities and other institutions, and they are entitled to be given answers. A convicted person is entitled to an oral or a written complaint to the head of the institution, who is obliged to consider it and decide on it within 15 days. Against this decision or in case the head of the institution does not pronounce any decision on the complaint, the convicted person is entitled to file an appeal to the Directorate for Execution of Sanctions, the decision of which is final and after which the convicted person has a right to court protection. The Ombudsman of the Republic of Macedonia, too, follows the developments in the area of protection of the rights of detained and apprehended persons or persons serving prison sentences. They are entitled to file submissions to this body. The Ombudsman may perform visits and inspections anytime without prior announcement or approval; he/she may talk to persons deprived of liberty without the presence of official persons. In respect to this question, for more details see I_H_12 and I_D_12
c)  In the prisons in the Republic of Macedonia, there are on average 3 to 5 persons per cell, with the exception of the premises in the two wings of the Closed Unit of the Idrizovo Penitentiary where there are 20 persons per cell, but rooms are spacious and the standard of 9 m3 per person is fulfilled.  Activities are currently underway for the complete refurbishing of one of the two wings, which shall include division of rooms into smaller cells. In the third wing of the Closed Unit of the Idrizovo Penitentiary that has already been refurbished, each cell houses 2-3 persons.  Taking as the standard the criterion of 93 per person for housing of prisoners, the following prisons are over-crowded: the Skopje Prison (semi-open institution) which hosts 56 prisoners beyond its capacity (out of whom 43 are convicted, 10 serve misdemeanour sentences and 3 are detained) and the Tetovo Prison (semi-open institution) that hosts 13 prisoners beyond its capacity (including 3 convicted, 9 detained and one person serving misdemeanour sentence), which makes a total of  69 prisoners. It should be noted that in the Tetovo Prison, activities are currently underway for an extension of the Prison’s building. Despite the fact that the aforementioned prisons are over-crowded, each of their inmates has his own bed, linen and locker in the cell where accommodated. The over-crowded accommodation refers to the fewer cubic meters than the prescribed 93 per person. The other semi-open or open institutions as well as the closed institution in the Republic of Macedonia are not over-crowded and their capacity is not filled if the 9m3 per person standard is taken into account, as there is room for more than the currently accommodated prisoners.

d) There is a separate female wing in the Idrizovo Penitentiary. Female persons serving prison sentences are accommodated in this wing. In a separate segment within the same wing, minor females serve juvenile prison sentences.   In addition to the aforementioned categories, a separate segment within this unit is the one for females to whom a correctional measure has been pronounced.  It should be noted that the number of younger female juveniles is small. Namely, currently there is only one person in this category, but there are periods with no such offenders. Particular attention is dedicated to pregnant prisoners and mothers who are provided the necessary professional medical care. Before and after giving birth, pregnant inmates and mothers are provided a diet in accordance with the type and quantity prescribed by a physician. Pregnant inmates, upon a proposal by a physician, are transferred to the maternity unit. As a rule, the transfer is done six weeks before delivery, but it may be done earlier if so proposed by the physician. Pregnant inmates give birth in specialised health care institutions. Mothers stay in the maternity unit until the infant is one year old, unless released earlier from serving the sentence. All costs for nurturing and health care of the child are borne by the prison. Once the child has become one year of age, the Social Centre shall take the necessary measures for its accommodation. The Birth Register must not include information that the child was born in prison. With regard to the work leave during pregnancy, childbirth and maternity, the general conditions apply.   In all other aspects, female prisoners are entitled to equal rights and obligations as male prisoners. Pursuant to the legal provisions in the Republic of Macedonia, to younger prisoners juvenile prison sentences may be pronounced of up to ten years. Male individuals serve juvenile prison sentences in a separate institution. Correctional measure may be pronounced to younger individuals and they may be placed in correction institution. A pronounced correctional measure may last from one to five years. Male individuals serve pronounced correctional measure in a separate institution. On reception in the institution, young offenders are evaluated by an expert team that includes psychologist, pedagogue, social worker, physician, as well as other experts if need be. Applying special scientific methods, the team conducts a social, medical, psychological and pedagogical examination of the person and designs an individual programme. Methods of corrective work with the offender are determined and these activities are coordinated with school lessons in primary and secondary education and with engagement in the workshop where practical training is conducted. Measures are also proposed for an enhanced correction process. On the basis of the results from the examination, classification is done and an correctional programme is designed so as to ensure active participation of the young offender during his/her stay in the Institution. Personal deficiencies are detected for the purpose of their elimination through individual work. In accordance with the requirements for their re-education, a type of work is determined for the inmates by taking into account their physical and intellectual capacities and the institution’s available resources. When determining a type of work, individual wishes of the inmate are taken into account. An inmate who shall obtain specific qualification in the Institution shall be given a certificate which must not indicate that it had been obtained in the Institution.  At least once a year a comprehensive medical examination of the inmates is conducted. They are offered possibilities for spare time activities, such as culture, amusement and sport. They are regularly visited by the Social Centres staff. Frequent visits are enabled to their families and close persons. Disciplinary measure of sending to a solitary confinement may last from 3 to 7 days for minors to whom corrective measure has been pronounced and up to 10 days for minors serving a juvenile prison sentence. No measure of isolation may be pronounced to minors. A daily diet of at least 14.600 joules per person is provided to minors. Their daily stay in open air may not last less than two hours. In all other aspects, young offenders are entitled to equal rights and obligations as other prisoners. 
e) Alternative measures were introduced in the Republic of Macedonia by the Law Amending the Criminal Code (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 19/04). Types of alternative measures: 1. Probation; 2. Probation under supervision; 3. Conditional dismissal of charges; 4. Community service; 5. Court reprimand; 6. House arrest. Alternative measures are executed once the court ruling by which they have been pronounced becomes final/ enforceable. The aim of these measures is not to use punishment for lighter crimes against a criminally responsible perpetrator when this is not necessary and when it may be expected that the purpose of the punishment may be achieved by a warning with a threat of punishment (probation), by a warning itself (court reprimand) or by measures of assistance and supervision of the perpetrator’s behaviour while free. 
1. Probation 
Probation as an alternative measure is pronounced by court when it determines a sentence of imprisonment for a perpetrator of crime and at the same time determines that the sentence shall not be executed in case the perpetrator does not commit further crimes over a period to be determined by court, which may not be shorter than one or longer than five years. Probation is provided in cases when a sentence of up to two years of imprisonment or a fine has been prescribed. When deciding upon probation, the court is guided by the offender's personality, his/her previous life, his/her conduct after the perpetration of the crime and other circumstances. Should the offender commit further criminal offences during the controlling period, the probation shall be revoked. 
2. Probation under supervision 
Probation may also be pronounced under supervision to be conducted by the Social Centre. Probation under supervision entails that the criminal offender shall have specific obligations to fulfil such as undergoing medical treatment, ban on use of narcotics and alcohol, family obligations, acceptance of a job etc. If the offender does not abide by the determined obligations, the court may extend the duration of the probation or revoke it. 
3. Court reprimand 
Court reprimand is pronounced for criminal acts punishable by prison sentence of up to 1 year. When deciding upon the reprimand, the court takes into consideration the offender's personality, his/her previous life, his/her conduct after the perpetration of the crime and the degree of criminal responsibility. In practice, this para-penal sanction has been pronounced in criminal acts such as defamation, insult, disclosure of personal or family circumstances, and other acts which contain elements of reduced social threat. 
4. Conditional dismissal of charges This alternative measure may be pronounced to a perpetrator of a criminal act punishable by a fine or by a prison sentence of up to one year. In such a case, once the defendant and the injured party have been interrogated and the injured party has given consent, the court may interrupt the proceedings, providing that the defendant does not commit further crimes during the period for which the proceedings have been dismissed (controlling period). The procedure may be dismissed for a period of up to one year, during which the period of limitation does not run. Providing that the offender does not commit further criminal acts during the controlling period, the court shall stop the proceedings. When deciding upon the use of this alternative measure, the court shall in particular take into consideration the expressed regret on the part of the offender, removal of the consequences of the criminal act, consequences suffered by the victim and compensation of the damages caused by the criminal act. 
5. Community service 
Community service is pronounced for a criminal act punishable by a fine or a sentence of imprisonment of up to three years. The court may pronounce this alternative measure with consent by the offender, if the crime has been perpetrated under mitigating circumstances and if the offender has not been previously convicted. This measure may be pronounced for duration of 40 to 240 hours, and it imposes on the offender an obligation to render service, with no financial compensation, in a state body, public enterprise, public institution or a humanitarian organisation. Community service is organised during state holidays, Saturdays or Sundays, with duration of at least five hours per week in a period of up to 12 months. The court conducts supervision over the execution of the responsibilities on the part of the offender. The court shall issue a written reprimand in case the offender fails to fulfil his/her responsibilities. If he/she continues with such conduct, there is a possibility that the hours of community service be extended, or that the unfulfilled part of the service be replaced with a fine or imprisonment, whereby for every three hours of community service a day of imprisonment is calculated or a daily fine i.e. an equivalent of 20 EUR in MKD. 
6. House arrest 
The alternative measure house arrest may be pronounced if a perpetrator of a criminal act, punishable by imprisonment of up to one year, is an elderly or exhausted person, i.e. is seriously ill or is a pregnant woman. Upon his/her prior consent, the court may decide that he/she serves the sentence in house arrest. The Court may replace a prison sentence with house arrest if conditions exist to control with modern electronic or telecommunication devices the enforcement of the house arrest. Supervision over the enforcement of house arrest shall be conducted by the court, which is also entitled to decide on specific measures of supervision to be undertaken by the police in the place where the house of the convicted is located, with an obligation for regular reports on the conducted supervision. If the offender violates the ban on leaving his/her house, the court may decide that the sentence be entirely served in a punitive institution.
14. What is the annual budget of the judiciary? Please provide a breakdown for the last five years. What is the procedure for deciding the budget? 
Financing of the Judiciary By the adoption of the Law on the Court Budget (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 60/03), a new way of judicial authority funding was introduced that contributed to the enhancement of the independence of the judiciary of the Republic of Macedonia. Under this law, the judicial budget is a part of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, classified as a separate “Court System” section. This part of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia is determined in its total amount, in accordance with the criteria decided by the Court Budget Council, on the basis of the fiscal policy and the main categories of projected revenues and expenditures. The Court Budget Council allocates these funds to the courts.  The Court Budget Council plays a key role in the financing of the judiciary. It constitutes of a President and eight members. Presiding over the Court Budget Council is the President of the Supreme Court, while its members are as follows: the President of the Judicial Council of the Republic, the Minister of Justice, Presidents of the Appellate Courts in Skopje, Štip and Bitola and three presidents of basic courts at a rotation system. The President of the Court Budget Council actively participates in the drafting and the approval of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. He/she represents the judiciary at the Government session when the Draft Budget is approved and at the working bodies’ sessions and the plenary session of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia on which the Budget is discussed.  The Court Budget Council has a substantial competence in the sphere of financing of the courts’ system. This body sets the criteria and methodology for drafting of the Court Budget, allocates Court Budget funds to courts, takes measures aimed at prompt execution of the Court Budget and approves funds for new jobs in courts within the determined Court Budget’s total salary amount. A service unit has been established as an internal organisational entity within the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia assigned with the Court Budget Council’s administrative matters. The Law on Court Budget fully prescribes the procedure of drafting, determining and execution of the Court Budget. The drafting of the Court Budget is made on the basis of the fiscal policy and the main categories of projected revenues and expenditures for the next fiscal year, as well as the internal criteria and methodology established by the Court Budget Council. The Court Budget Council submits to the courts a circular letter including the main guidelines for drafting courts’ financial plans. It also includes the methodology for drafting of the courts’ financial plans (key parameters, procedure and the deadline to draft the financial plan), as well as the indicative total expenditure for each beneficiary, within which a projection has to be made by types and the necessary data that are to be attached to the budget. On the basis of the above-mentioned guidelines, courts submit to the Court Budget Council, by 01.06 of the current year at the latest, the following data:   Projection of the expenditures for the fiscal year, by expenditure items and sub-items;   Projection of the expenditures for the next two fiscal years, by expenditure categories;   Review of the required expenditures for necessary new employments;   Proposals that include the future liabilities or several-year expenditures, including investment projects indicated separately; and   Expenditures for each of the following years indicated separately. Besides the indicated data, courts are obliged to submit to the Court Budget Council an explanation on the level of amounts needed per position. Once the Court Budget Council receives proposals, it drafts the Draft - Court Budget and, along with the explanation on the level of amounts, submits it to the Ministry of Finance. Before submitting the Draft Budget of the Republic of Macedonia to the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, the Minister of Finance shall necessarily harmonise the “Court System” section of the Draft Budget with the President of the Court Budget Council. If no assent is reached, Ministry of Finance prepares a report and submits it to the Government. In the execution stage, the Court Budget Council allocates funds to courts. Each court’s President is responsible for the execution of the court’s financial plan. The Court Budget Council follows the financial plan execution and in case it identifies irregularities or violations in the process on the part of a court’s president, it shall notify the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia, the Ministry of Justice, the Judicial Council, the Ministry of Finance and the State Audit Office. The Law on the Court Budget is fully in line with the Law on Budgets and other regulations in the area of finance. It also provides for an internal audit over the financial plan execution in courts that shall be done by an internal auditor appointed by the Court Budget Council. Financing of the Public Prosecution Offices The new Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04), introduced novelties in financing of the public prosecution organisation. The main characteristics of the financing of the public prosecution offices follow the positive trends and experience acquired in the implementation of the new financing model in the judiciary. Namely, the financing method of the public prosecution offices has been regulated under a separate chapter in the Law on Public Prosecutor’s Office. Funds for the operation of the public prosecution offices are provided from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia through the budget beneficiary – Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia. Funds for the operation of the primary and the high public prosecution offices are provided from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia through the budget beneficiary – Public Prosecutor’s Office. Before the approval and the vote on the Budget in the Assembly, the Ministry of Finance that proposes the Public Prosecution Offices Section in the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia has to submit it for an opinion to the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia. This opinion is necessarily submitted to the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia along with the proposal of the Public Prosecution Offices Section in the Draft-Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. At the stage of drafting of the Budget, the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia drafts a single budgetary calculation based on the calculations submitted by the primary and the high prosecution offices and the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia. The Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia submits to the Ministry of Finance the single budgetary calculation for all prosecution offices and the explanation on the level of the requested amounts. Before submitting the Draft-Budget of the Republic of Macedonia to the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, the Minister of Finance harmonises this part of the Draft Budget with the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia.  In the stage of the Budget execution, the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia, upon a prior consent by the Council of Public Prosecutors, shall allocate to the prosecution offices the funds approved in the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, applying adequate measures and criteria. 158/453 Judicial Budget 1999-2005

15. How is effective access to free legal aid in criminal cases ensured? Can free legal aid also be obtained in civil cases? Please give details on the criteria for receiving legal aid in civil matters. 
The right to defence is a constitutional category, which under the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the  Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) is guaranteed starting with the police procedure. The person charged in a criminal procedure has the right to defend himself/herself in person or by legal assistance of his own choosing and to have legal assistance assigned to him/her, in any case where the interests of justice so require, and without payment by him/her in any such case if he/she does not have sufficient means to pay for it. This right is not absolute in light of the fact that the accused can choose exclusively a lawyer to act on behalf of his/her defence and according to the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02, 74/04), there are cases determined  in which the accused must have a defence attorney, who is appointed by the court, if the accused does not appoint one (in case the accused is a dumb or a deaf person, or incapable of defending himself/herself, or in case of a criminal procedure against him/her for a criminal act for which  a prison sentence of 10 years is prescribed or life sentence is prescribed in the law, if detention has been determined or is tried in abstention). The accused may be exempt from payment of defence lawyer costs if the payment of costs would threaten his/her subsistence or of his/her family. In such cases the costs are covered by the state budget.  The accused my have free legal assistance even when there are no conditions for obligatory defence (Article 67) if the procedure is instituted against a criminal offence for which the law prescribes a prison sentence more than a year.  In such cases the  the accused may be appointed a defence attorney on his/her request, provided that his/her property status would not allow him/her to cover the costs of defence. Deciding upon the request shall be the President of the Chamber, while the President of the Court shall appoint the defence attorney. The appointment of a defence attorney to an accused of poor material status is possible only upon a submitted request. The costs incurred to prove the poor material status shall be covered by the accused. In deciding on granting free legal assistance when this is required by the interests of justice, domestic court follows the criteria established with the jurisprudence of the European Human Rights Court: seriousness of the criminal offence and the severity of the possible sanction, the complexity of the case and the personal circumstances of the accused.  Free legal assistance in, civil law is regulated by the Law on Litigation Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 33/98 and 44/02), which prescribes the so called indigent law as a form of relief for the participants in the procedure. The Law on Litigation Procedure stipulates that the Court shall relieve from paying the costs of procedure a party whose material status does not allow the coverage of these costs without endangering the party and his/her family’s essential personal sustenance. When making a decision to relieve from paying the costs of procedure, the Court shall closely evaluate all the circumstances, and shall in particular take into account the value of the matter of conflict, number of persons sustained by the party and the income of the party and members of his/her family. In these procedures the court may appoint a proxy from the ranks of lawyers. Upon the request of the party to the procedure, when the party is exempt from payment of the costs for the procedure, the court shall determine that the party is represented by a proxy-lawyer is necessary for the protection of the rights of the party to the procedure (Article 160 of the Law on Litigation Procedure).  Taking as the starting point the position of the Bar in the Republic of Macedonia, which is defined as public service that provides legal assistance and performs competences in accordance with the law, free legal assistance is prescribed in Article 6 of the Tariff on Reward and Remuneration for Lawyers’ Services, which stipulates that a lawyer is obliged to provide free legal assistance to a party who may, under law, be exempt from paying the costs in the procedure (indigent law). The Bar Association of the Republic of Macedonia offers free legal assistance through its Project “Free legal assistance, legal culture and socialisation”. The main goal of the Project is to provide regular and adequate services to specific categories of persons unable to pay for the services and whose right to free legal assistance is guaranteed by the Constitution and the laws of the Republic of Macedonia. This group includes all social welfare users, such as: handicapped persons, single parents, family violence victims, child abuse victims and those in need of a free legal advice and protection in particular circumstances. These persons shall submit evidence for their social status by a competent state body. These services are offered in all types of cases: civil, criminal and administrative. Beneficiaries are offered full protection of their legally guaranteed rights, if being denied, violated or endangered. Full protection consists of free legal assistance that includes preparation and drafting of acts, legal advice, as well as a possibility to benefit from free copies of legal texts. Free legal assistance is provided by the lawyers-members of the Bar Association of the Republic of Macedonia, who, to no compensation, represent their clients’ interest in courts and other institutions, as well as in the European Court of Human Rights, in Strasbourg. So far, the Bar Association has opened six offices for free legal assistance in Bitola, Kumanovo, Gostivar, Delevo, Štip and Ohrid, encompassing 70% of all lawyers in the Republic of Macedonia. 
16. Human resources policy: a) Describe the methods and criteria for the selection, appointment and promotion of candidates for judicial office. How are judges and prosecutors recruited (are there competitive exams)?  b) Is the performance of holders of judicial office assessed? If yes, describe the body in charge as well as the relevant methods and criteria. Is there a merit based career system? c) Is there a higher council of the judiciary? If so, describe its composition, role, premises and budget. How are members appointed? How long is their mandate? Can the mandate be renewed? d) Is there an Inspection Service for the judiciary? If so, describe its composition, role, way of functioning and budget. 
a) Pursuant to the Constitution (“Official Gazette of the  Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) and the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/02), judges are elected to an unrestricted term of office. Judges are elected and dismissed by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, upon a proposal by the Judicial Council of the Republic of Macedonia.  Elected as a judge may be a citizen of the Republic of Macedonia who fulfils the general legally prescribed conditions for becoming an employee in a state administration, who is a law graduate, has passed the bar exam,  and has adequate reputation for the judicial office. Besides these conditions, a candidate for a judge to a basic court, once having passed the bar examination, has to have a working experience in legal matters of over 5 years, with confirmed results. A candidate for a judge to an appellate court has to have such experience of over 9 years, whereas for a Supreme Court judge election, the candidate’s experience has to be over 12 years. Elected as a judge to the Supreme Court may also be a full-time or an associate university professor with a tenure related to judicial practice for more than 10 years. A court’s President is elected under conditions, in a procedure and manner applied for the election of judges, for a term of four years and from the judges in the respective court, with a right to one re- election to another four-year term. If not re-elected, the outgoing court’s President shall continue to work as a judge in that court. The Judicial Council nominates for the election the candidate with the highest professional and work-related qualities among those fulfilling the prescribed criteria. In the process, particular account is taken of the information on the achievements of the candidate, deriving from the provided opinions on the professional and work-related qualities of each of the applicants by the court or the other legal entity in which employed, the court to which being elected, a higher-instance court and the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia. At the Council’s session that determines the proposal for election or dismissal of a judge, opinion is also given by the Minister of Justice and the President of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia. The criteria for election of judges have been set forth by the Judicial Council. The general criteria upon which a Judicial Council’s nomination is based are the following: the nominee should be a law graduate from the appropriate study programme, should have the reputation and authority necessary for performing the judicial function, should have undergone prior preparations for successful performance of the judicial function, should have the necessary working experience, independence, competence, diligence and commitment, conscience and impartiality, ethics, professionalism, physical and mental ability and should be a citizen of the Republic of Macedonia. Within the existing system for election of judges in the Republic of Macedonia, there is no direct merit-based career promotion system i.e. a candidate can be appointed to a higher court only through a separate selection process in accordance with the indicated procedure and conditions. Still, in practice, the judges to higher courts are most often selected from those in the lower courts, whereas judges to basic courts are mainly selected from among the expert associates (law clerks) within the courts. So far there has been no special school for judges authorised to provide their initial training. As has been previously indicated, the condition to be elected a judge or a appointed a public prosecutor is to have passed the bar exam. The bar examination is taken following the graduation from a law faculty and a completion of a two-year long internship. The bar examination is conducted in accordance with a specially designed programme enacted by the Minister of Justice, which includes institutes and questions of the various law branches necessary for the professional development of the law graduates. The Law on Bar Examination (“Official Gazette of the SRM”, Nos. 26/80 and 07/88), provides that the bar examination consists of a written and an oral part. The written part includes questions about criminal and civil law, while the oral part includes questions about criminal law, civil law, Constitutional order and Constitutional law, business and labour law. Pursuant to the law, bar examination is taken before a Committee appointed by the Minister of Justice. The manner of taking the bar examination, application for the examination, contents of the minutes and issuance of a certificate for a passed examination have been regulated in detail in the Rulebook on the Manner of Taking Bar Examination (“Official Gazette of the  SRM”, No. 09/89). This examination, however, is not a competitive examination for election of judges and prosecutors. It is only one of the conditions for interested law graduates to apply at the competition. Further on, judges are elected by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, upon the proposal of the Judicial Council.  In order to strengthen the independence of the judiciary in the Republic of Macedonia, improvement of the system of appointment of judges has been envisaged. The improvements have been clearly defined in the Judicial Reform Strategy (see I_Annex_02). Namely, it has been stipulated that the election of judges be exempt from the competence of the Assembly, it being a political body, and be transferred to the Judicial Council, that shall primarily consist of judges. Its members shall be appointed from the judiciary itself, which shall be the essential guarantee for the judiciary’s independence. Another important novelty shall be the introduction of initial training of candidates for judges, to last between 12 and 15 months and to be performed by a School for judges. The entry in the School shall be conditional on taking an entry examination. During the initial training, candidates for judges shall receive adequate financial remuneration provided by the state. The introduction of these changes shall also establish a merit-based system of career promotion, whereby the Judicial Council shall decide on the appointment of a judge to a higher court, on the basis of clearly defined objective criteria. 
b) Pursuant to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, one of the competences of the Judicial Council is to evaluate judges’ expertise and ethics in performance of their office. This Constitutional provision has been further elaborated in the Law on the Judicial Council of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 80/92, 50/99 and 43/03). Namely, the Council evaluates the judges’ expertise and ethics in case the information on the achievements, number of decided cases, working quality and efficiency suggest lack of professionalism, expertise or ethics. The assessment of professionalism and conscientiousness of judges while performing their post may not only be raised by the Council, but also by the President of the relevant court, the President of the higher court as well as by the General Session of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia. According to the current system of election of judges, there is no direct merit-based form of career promotion. However, judges advance in career by way of being elected to a higher court. In these cases, the Council evaluates a judge’s previous expertise and ethics in performance at the office, by exploring the information supplied by the Ministry of Justice on the quality and efficiency in his/her work, participation in training activities etc.   
c) The position, composition and competence of the Judicial Council have been set forth in the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. These Constitutional provisions have been further elaborated in the Law on the Judicial Council of the Republic of Macedonia. The Judicial Council consists of seven Members elected by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia from among the prominent lawyers, to a six year term of office with a right to one re-election. Three of its Members are elected by a majority vote of the total number of Members, within which there must be a majority vote of the total number of Members in the Assembly belonging to the non-majority communities in the Republic of Macedonia. From among its Members, the Council elects a President for a period of three years, with no right to re-election.  The office of a Member of the Judicial Council terminates if he/she resigns. A Council Member shall be dismissed if he/she is sentenced for a criminal offence to imprisonment without probation of at least six months, or in case he/she permanently loses the ability to perform the duties, which is determined by the Council on the basis of the finding and opinion by a competent medical committee. Members of the Judicial Council are granted immunity, decided upon by the Assembly.  The office of a Member of the State Judicial Council is incompatible with performance of any other public office, profession or membership in a political party.  The Judicial Council proposes to the Assembly election and dismissal of judges, decides on the disciplinary liability of judges, evaluates their expertise and ethics in the performance of the office, and proposes two judges to the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia. The Judicial Council has its Service headed by a Secretary General. Number of expert associates and other employees in the service, as well as their activities and tasks, have been set forth in the Job Description and Classification Act.  Currently, the Council’s Service includes 9 employees. A plan for 2005 foresees provision of further staff by employing 15 additional persons, three of whom shall be representatives of non-majority communities in the Republic of Macedonia. Premises and funds available to the Council are sufficient for the time being. Each of the Council Members and each advisor have his/her own office and a computer. The Judicial Council has an electronic data base including all relevant data on the work and training of judges. Furthermore, as part of the digitalisation of the judiciary, preparation of software for the operation of the Judicial Council is in final stage. Next project in this sphere shall be the IT networking of the Council, courts, the Ministry of Justice and the School for judges. The chart bellow presents the Judicial Council’s Budget for the last six years:

d) In the Republic of Macedonia, there is no conventional inspection in the judiciary. Still, within the judicial administration, in the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/03), provisions of Articles 76 – 78, a competence has been stipulated of the Ministry of Justice to conduct inspection over the application of the Court’s Rules of Procedure, i.e. conduct supervision over the courts’ efficiency and their implementation of the Court’s Rules of Procedure.  As part of the forthcoming reform in the judiciary, the establishment of a body that shall perform inspection supervision over the operation of courts has been stipulated. Namely, the Reform Strategy envisages that such body be composed of judges and that results from the conducted supervision have no effect over the judge’s ruling in the actual case that has been supervised.

a)  University Law Curriculum: 
In the Republic of Macedonia, a degree in law is acquired at four Faculties of Law, out of which two are within the State Universities, and two are within the privately financed higher education institutions. The Faculty of Law within the Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje is a higher education institution with the longest tradition regarding education of law professionals. It was established in 1951. The Faculty of Law within the State University in Tetovo is the second state higher education institution, which introduced law studies in 2004. Within the educational system of the Republic of Macedonia, besides the state faculties in the area of legal studies there are two private higher education institutions: The South-East European University - Tetovo, which commenced operating in the year 2001 and the Faculty of Social Sciences (Fakultet za opštestveni nauki – FON) which begun organising law studies since 2004.  The Faculty of Law in Skopje organises four-year undergraduate studies (to obtain a degree - diploma of law); two-years post-graduate studies (for the degree – Master of Law) and doctoral studies (Doctor of Law). In the past period, the curricula were modified and updated, and in 1994 the new curricula were adopted as a result of the need to provide compatibility with the legal studies in other countries, i.e., other legal systems. The curricula of the four-year studies comprise mandatory, facultative and optional modules. In the first two years the general theoretical legal disciplines are studied, while in the higher academic years the focus of the programme, especially through the applied programmes, has the purpose of preparing the students for fast incorporation in the practice. Therefore, in the first academic year the following subjects are studied: Introduction to Law, Roman Law, History of Law, Economics, Constitutional Law, Sociology of Law, Methodology of the Legal Sciences, and a Foreign Language.

The issue of the apprenticeship of the law graduates is regulated by the Rulebook on the Mode for Performance of the Apprenticeship of Graduated Lawyers in the Bodies of the Judiciary (“Official Gazette of the SRM” No. 09/89). Namely, it establishes the mode for performance of the apprenticeship – graduated lawyers in the bodies of the judicial system. The establishment of the mode for performance of apprenticeship has the purpose of empowering the apprentice to perform activities and tasks to which they are assigned and to prepare them for the bar exam.  Pursuant to the Rulebook, the apprentices are alternately assigned to perform certain activities and tasks and in the course of the apprenticeship are introduced to and have their skills developed to perform all activities and tasks from within the scope of the justice system bodies. The Rulebook regulates in detail the area to which the apprentices are assigned in the justice system bodies where they perform the apprenticeship; the period is defined within which they acquire the practice in each of the services within the body, as well as the mode for performance of the practice. For the individual apprenticeship of each apprentice, a programme is prepared, which establishes the specific tasks, which they need to perform, the employee responsible for their apprenticeship, as well as the records maintained of the performed tasks. The provisions from the aforementioned Rulebook are also related to both, volunteers and graduated lawyers, which are sent to practice in the bodies of the judiciary from other bodies and organisations.
d)  School or institute for judges: 
In the Republic of Macedonia there is no system of initial training for judges and  public prosecutors. However, there is a system of continuing education of the judges and the prosecutors, executed by the Centre for Continuing Education (CCE). The CCE was established in March 1999 within the Macedonian Judges Association, as a form of continuity from the Committee for Education, which primarily focuses on continuing education and professional improvement of the judges, law clerks, and the court administration. The programme and the activities of the CCE are directed towards increased competence, professionalism and ethical conduct of the judicial personnel, promotion and strengthening of the judicial independence, public confidence and respect towards the judiciary. A Board composed of nine members with voting rights manages CCE, out of which five are representatives of the Macedonian Judges Association and the President of the Association is a member by virtue of their position. The remaining three members are representatives of the Ministry of Justice, of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia and of the Judicial Council of the Republic. The executive manager of the CCE is present at the Board sessions and is authorised to participate in its work, but has no right to vote. Also, a representative from the Foundation Open Society Institute – Macedonia (FOSIM) and the Constitutional and Legal Policy Institute (COLPI), as well as one representative of the American Bar Association – Central and Eastern European Law Initiative (ABA/CEELI) which financially support this project, participate as Board members, without the right to vote (About the role of the Centre for Continuing Education, its programme and implemented trainings, for more details see I_D_18). The system for election of judges and of public prosecutors is explained in I_D_3, where it is indicated that, besides the other prerequisites, the candidates need to have passed the bar exam. The bar exam can be passed after a completed two-year apprenticeship, after the graduation from the Faculty of Law. The bar exam is taken according to a special curriculum adopted by the Minister of Justice, which contains institutes and questions from certain legal branches, necessary for skills development of the graduated lawyers. The Law on the Bar (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 26/80 and 7/88), establishes that the bar exam consists of a written and an oral part. In the written part, Criminal and Civil law are subjects of examination, and in the oral part Criminal Law, Constitutional Order and Constitutional Law, Commercial Law and Labour Law. Pursuant to the Law, the bar exam is taken before a committee appointed by the Minister of Justice. The mode for taking the bar exam, application for the exam, contents of the minutes and issuance of a certificate for the passed bar exam are regulated in detail in the Rulebook on the Mode for Taking the Bar Exam (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 09/89). Introduction of a system of initial training of candidates for judges and public prosecutors is envisaged as a priority in the Judicial Reform Strategy (see I_Annex_02), whereby the Centre for Continuing Education will grow into a public institution – School for Education of Judges, Public Prosecutors and other employees in the courts and the Public Prosecutor’s Office. The programmes for continuing education will be established by a Board of the School for Education of Judges and Public Prosecutors, where members will be representatives from the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia, the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia, the Ministry of Justice, the Judicial Council, the Council of Public Prosecutors, Macedonian Judges Association and the Association of Public prosecutors, as well as relevant higher education institutions. The introduction of the initial training would raise the level of quality of the judges and public prosecutors, having in mind the fact that they would undergo a planned and systematically structured training before entering the position of a judge or a public prosecutor. Namely, the Strategy foresees that upon a Job Advertisement for candidates for judges and public prosecutors, the candidates should take an entrance exam to enrol in the School for Judges and Public Prosecutors. After the completed initial training, they would take a final exam, and only then would be appointed as judges and public prosecutors. 
18. Training: a) Is there an independent national training centre for the judiciary? What is its role? If there is more than one, is the training harmonised? b) Are specific training courses organised for judges in new areas such as company law, cyber crime, financial crime etc., but also on ethics in justice as well as on human rights and fundamental liberties? Is there any continued training for judges? c) How many and what types of specialised judges and prosecutors are there? d) Is there in-service training? Is it compulsory? Please describe the extent and how often it occurs. e) What percentage of judges, prosecutors and other staff in the judicial sector has received further training over the last 5 years (compared with the profession as a whole)? 

Pursuant to Article 51 of the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/02), judges have a right to and an obligation for continued professional training in the course of their terms of office. The Law on the Court Budget (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 60/03), stipulates that at least 2% of the total funds allocated for the financing of the judiciary shall necessarily be earmarked for professional training of judges, civil servants, court police and other court employees.  The judges’ continued education is conducted by the Centre for Continuous Education (CCE) established in May 1999 within the Judges Association of the Republic of Macedonia, as a follow-up to the Education Committee, primarily focused on the continuous education and professional training of judges, expert associates and court administration. The CCE programme and activities have been focused towards enhancement of expertise, professionalism and ethics of judges, promotion and enhancement of judges' independence, public confidence and reputation of the judiciary. CCE is managed by a Board of 9 Members with a right to vote, five of whom are representatives of the Judges Association of the Republic of Macedonia. The Association’s President is an ex officio Member of CCE. The other three Members include representatives of the Ministry of Justice, the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia and the Judicial Council of the Republic of Macedonia. CCE Director attends Board’s sessions and is authorised to participate in its work, though with no right to vote. In addition, representatives from the Foundation Open Society Institute Macedonia (FOSIM), the Constitutional and Legal Policy Institute (COLPI) and the American Bar Association – Central and Eastern Europe Legal Initiative (ABA/CEELI), that have provided financial support for the project, attend Board’s sessions, with no right to vote.  The Board is responsible for establishing the CCE policy and approving its educational programme, its financial plan and its budget. Similarly, it adopts its rules of procedure and submits reports on the Centre’s activities to the Governing Board of the Judges Association of the Republic of Macedonia. Lecturers at the seminars and counselling sessions organised by the Centre for Continuous Education are domestic and foreign experts. Lecturers from the Republic of Macedonia include judges of the Supreme Court and appellate courts. Foreign lecturers are primarily Council of Europe experts. In order to facilitate full integration in the international legal community and regular international communication and cooperation, CCE has also organised foreign language courses. Within the cooperation with the Peace Corps, volunteers have been teaching English language in a number of courts throughout the country. The Foundation Open Society Institute Macedonia has provided judges from the courts in Skopje with a possibility to attend the English language courses in its educational centre. Furthermore, as part of the cooperation of the Judges Association of the Republic of Macedonia and the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Macedonia with the Embassy of the Republic of France and the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of France, French language courses have also been organised.  In line with the strategic commitment of the Republic of Macedonia, particular emphasis within the Centre’s educational programme has been attached to the computer training of judges, expert associates and administrative personnel. For that purpose, the Centre has been organising computer courses for judges, expert associates and administrative personnel in courts in the Republic of Macedonia. In order to enable free access to legal literature, texts of laws and latest legal publications, CCE and JARM proceeded with furnishing the library that is at a disposal to all judges, expert associates and other interested persons.  The Centre regularly distributes and submits all kinds of material, books and publications relevant for the work of judges and courts. The training of public prosecutors has been conducted through the Public Prosecutors Association. Public prosecutors have also been included in a number of specially designed seminars organised by the Centre for Continuous Education. The issue of the training of judges and public prosecutors has been in detail elaborated in the Judicial Reform Strategy (see I_Annex_02).  
b) In its training programmes, CCE has dedicated particular attention to the training in several fields, such as are commercial law, cyber crime, financial crime, corruption, human rights etc. The enclosed charts give a review of the seminars organised by the Centre for Continuous Education in the period 1999 – 2003, their topics and the number of judges, public prosecutors and other participants.

c) Specialised departments are established in courts that comprise judges who decide in cases of the same legal area. There is no formal system for specialisation of judges in a specific legal area. However, as mentioned, in practice judges are specialised by their assignment to specific departments. Pursuant to the Court Rules of Procedure, every basic court includes a criminal and a civil department. Within the criminal department, the following divisions are established: Criminal, Investigative, Juvenile, Misdemeanour and Military. Within the civil department, the following divisions are established: Civil, Enforcement, Trade, Labour, Non-Contentious, Inheritance etc. The Supreme Court includes three departments: Criminal, Civil and Administrative. Taking into consideration the fact that judges’ specialisation is conducted only in larger primary courts, bellow is the data on the number of judges acting upon specific types of cases: In the Skopje I Basic Court, out of the total number of 76 judges, 12 act upon criminal, 22 upon civil, 10 upon business, 2 upon bankruptcy, 2 upon non-contentious, 1 upon registrations, 5 upon enforceable civil, and 15 upon misdemeanour cases. In the Skopje II Basic Court, out of the total number of 75 judges, 20 act upon criminal cases and investigations, 22 upon civil, 7 upon business, 3 upon bankruptcy, 3 upon non-contentious, 4 upon execution civil and 16 upon misdemeanour cases. In the Basic Court in Bitola, out of the total number of 30 judges, 4 act upon criminal cases, 2 upon investigations, 10 upon civil, 2 upon business, 2 upon bankruptcy, 2 upon non-contentious, 2 upon registrations, 2 upon enforceable civil and 3 upon misdemeanour cases. In courts of appeals, 27 judges act upon criminal and misdemeanour cases and 52 upon civil and commercial cases.  In the Supreme Court of the Republic, there are three departments, namely: Criminal, Civil and Administrative. Certain specialisation for public prosecutors is envisaged in the Law on Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04), according to which a Unit for Prosecution of Perpetrators of Crimes in the Field of Organised Crime and Corruption is established. 
d) Besides the training for judges and prosecutors elaborated in the above segments a) and b) there have been computer courses organised in courts and public prosecution offices. In the beginning of the implementation of the 2001 Integrated Judicial Information System Project, the Ministry of Justice organised basic computer training for employees in the judicial institutions. The group of employees that use hardware equipment in courts includes 2100 persons (judges, expert associates, typists and administration), in public prosecution offices 300 employees (prosecutors, deputy prosecutors, expert associates, typists and administration), in the Judicial Council 20 employees (Members of the Judicial Council, advisors and administration) and in the Penitentiaries 200 employees (managers and administration). By September 2004, basic computer training was organised for the aforementioned employees (for 1500 employees in courts, 180 employees in public prosecution offices, 20 employees in the Judicial Council and for 30 employees in the penitentiaries). Funds for the training has been provided from the Ministry of Justice’ budget and the PHARE 2000 programme. In the course of 2005, computer training is envisaged within the CARDS 2003 Programme for the other part of the employees in these institutions.  
e) In 1999, a total of 19 training activities were organised by the Centre for Continuous Education over 24 working days, attended by 578 participants.   In 2000, CCE organised a total of 21 training activities over 39 working days and with 851 participants. In 2001, CCE organised 14 training activities over 28 working days and with 609 participants (including 421 judges and 74 expert associates). In 2002, CCE organised 21 training activities over 52 working days and with 666 participants. In 2003, CCE organised 27 training activities over 58 working days. They were attended by 480 judges, 28 expert associates, 82 public prosecutors and 107 guests. 19. Clerical staff: a) Give the number of clerical staff. How does this compare with the number of judges and prosecutors? b) Do they have concrete job descriptions? c) Do they receive particular initial and vocational training (on case management, IT, relations with the public etc.)? Which institution is in charge of offering this training? d) Which equipment (computers, e-mail, fax etc.) do clerical staffs have at their disposal to perform their functions? e) Are archives well managed and computerised? Is there sufficient and direct access to legal databases? 
a) The total number of employed clerks in courts and public prosecution offices is 2301. Out of this number, 2127 are employed in the courts, while 174 work in the public prosecution offices. The number of judges in the Republic of Macedonia is 632, whereas the number of public prosecutors and deputy public prosecutors is 122, which makes a total of 754 holders of judicial office (court and prosecution). These figures imply that there are around 3 clerks per every holder of judicial office. 
b) Pursuant to the legal regulations in the Republic of Macedonia, court clerks are civil servants and their status, rights, obligations and responsibilities, salaries and remunerations have been set forth in the Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00, 112/00, 34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04 and 69/04). Depending on their tasks, they have been divided into groups (senior civil servants, expert civil servants and expert administrative civil servants). Description of jobs and their harmonisation with the groups and positions as set forth in the Law on Civil Servants has been stipulated in the Decree of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 93/00). On the basis of the Law on Civil Servants and the Decree, each court has enacted a Job Description and Organisation Rulebook including an accurate description of jobs and working tasks of every civil servant. On the basis of the constitutional separation of powers in the Republic of Macedonia into legislative, executive and judicial, and with the purpose of implementing the judicial independence in this segment, too, the Judicial Reform Strategy stipulates that court clerks (independent court advisors, court advisors, expert associates, court interns, junior court officers, administrative, technical and other court personnel) be exempt from the Law on Civil Servants. A Law on Court Service is envisaged to be adopted, on the basis of which court clerks shall exercise their employment rights. 
c) In the course of 2004, basic computer training was organised for the employees in courts, thus improving their skills and providing for efficient use of the court information system software, which entails successful management of cases in court procedure.  The initial computer training was conducted in the course of 2001 and 2002, when over 300 employees in all courts in the Republic of Macedonia were introduced to the basic computer skills. Over the past two years, intense computer training was also conducted for employees in the basic courts by their IT personnel.  No competent institution has been formally or legally appointed for the implementation of training. However, the Steering Committee set up under the project and comprised of representatives of all judicial institutions, which monitors and evaluates implementation of projects, necessarily provides computer training for court employees (this was conducted under PHARE 2000 and CARDS 2003 Programmes).  
d)  The court personnel have at their disposal computer equipment that satisfies the needs for performing their duties (PCs with Microsoft Office packages, local and network printers, servers, switches, local area network). However, due to insufficient capacity of premises in some of the courts, full installation of additional equipment has not been possible so far.  The Project Team of the Ministry of Justice has analysed the overall state in all courts in terms of premises and staff. Within the implementation of the IT Projects in the period 2002 - 2004, 1209 PCs were installed, as well as 535 local printers, 102 network printers and 57 servers. In that way, around 60% of the total needs of the judiciary were satisfied. With an optimal distribution of the equipment, though, over 90% coverage of the judicial functions has been achieved. In addition, the Project Team has foreseen the future needs in terms of finalisation of the installation of the necessary computer equipment in courts. Expectations are that the optimum implementation of the CARDS 2003 Project, which envisages procurement of additional hardware, will ensure successful finalisation of the process of installation and use of hardware in courts. With regards to the fax equipment in courts, all courts in the Republic of Macedonia have at their disposal sufficient quantities of fax units and separate fax numbers.  Concerning e-mail services and their use by court employees, for the moment this kind of communication has not been enabled in the courts. Two of the basic courts in the Republic of Macedonia (Štip and Struga) have designed their Web pages, though these are not being updated regularly.  All courts in the Republic of Macedonia have at their disposal a local computer network, with a sufficient number of switches (a total of 55). Electronic communication has been enabled among employees of courts situated in the same building (intranet). It is expected that once the CARDS 2003 Project is fully implemented, full electronic communication will be established.   
e) As to the court archives, so far they have not been computerised. However, all prerequisites have been put in place for this to be carried out in the future. Namely, by the installation of the hardware (the process shall be completed in the course of 2005) and by the already installed software in all courts, as well as by completion of the IT training for all court employees and the implementation of the CARDS 2003 Project for establishment of legal databases, computer legal databases will be established, and managed by courts IT staff. Furthermore, in the misdemeanour units within all 27 basic courts in the Republic of Macedonia, as part of the PHARE 1999 Programme, application software has been installed for the operation of these court units. An optimum quantity of hardware has been installed in the aforementioned units, and complete training of their employees has been conducted. Namely, over 200 employees have passed the basic computer, as well as the application software training. The application software is in Macedonian and contains over 300 entering forms, which enables its optimum and efficient use. The application is supported by a Windows SQL7; SQL2000 database and allows for electronic management of cases, their electronic archiving and automatic database creation.  In all courts in the Republic of Macedonia (the Supreme Court, 3 appellate courts and 27 basic courts) application software for court procedures has been installed. The application has been installed on 1500 PCs.  The Ministry of Justice has implemented this part of the project in two stages. The first stage included 3 pilot courts, with over 500 employees (Skopje I Basic Court, Skopje Appellate Court and the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia). Besides the basic computer training, application software training has also been conducted in these courts, thus enabling the operation of the system in practice.  The application software is in Macedonian and contains over 600 windows which enables its optimum and efficient use. Application is supported by a Windows SQL7; SQL2000 database and allows for electronic management of cases, their electronic filing and automatic database creation. Electronic management of cases has only been conducted in these three pilot courts. It should be mentioned that training has been conducted for the court procedure software application in 26 basic and 2 appellate courts for over 1650 employees.  As far as the data filing (back-up) is concerned, in the three pilot courts it has been performed at three levels - firstly, saving of data on the PC hard disc; secondly, after the end of the court’s working hours, archiving at the back-up server; finally, all data of the working week are preserved on the DAT-track which is then deposited in the court’s safe-deposit box.  At the moment (January 2005), every court has its own database which is being built up through the process of court application software training for all court employees and it is expected to be integrated in a single – central database in the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia. Within the installed software application, all PC users in courts are connected by a LAN connection, which enables access to databases by using CDs or floppy discs. After the full implementation of the CARDS 2003 Project, optical connection of courts will be established i.e. installation of VAN connection (IPVPN lines) that is expected to be carried out in the course of 2005. The aforementioned actions are expected to result in sufficient and direct access to judicial databases, making them available to all interested parties.  The Project Team implementing the activities has prepared a Project for Legal Database IT security. 
20. Accountability and discipline: a) Is there a code of ethics for members of the judiciary? If so, by whom has it been set up? What is its legal status? How is it being implemented? b) Are judges irremovable from the start of their career? How is such irremovability implemented and respected? c) What is the procedure for lifting the immunity of a judge? What is done to ensure that this is clear and transparent? Give examples of how this has been implemented? d) What is the salary scale for judges and prosecutors? How does this compare with other professions with similar responsibilities in your country (attorneys, lawyers in private enterprises…) and to the average income? 
a) The Judges Association of the Republic of Macedonia has adopted a Code of Ethics that comprises the most important principles that the judges should be guided by when performing their duties. The Code defines its goals and purposes and the principles of judges’ ethics, as well as the issues of independence, protection of court's reputation, judge’s personality, attitude towards parties, obligations when judging in a case, professional training, immunity and privileges, restrictions related to the performance of the judicial duty, implementation of the principles and liability for their violation. With regard to the implementation of the Code, it has been stipulated that a fair and ethical obligation of a judge is to apply, develop and enhance by personal example the Code’s principles and to guide the others to their respect and application. Furthermore, an ethical liability has been stipulated for violation of the Code’s principles. 

b) Pursuant to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), and the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/02), judges are elected to an unrestricted term of office.  Namely, Article 99 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia provides for an unrestricted term of office of judges. Pursuant to Articles 38 and 39 of the Law on Courts, judges are elected and dismissed by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, upon a proposal by the Judicial Council of the Republic of Macedonia. Notwithstanding the unrestricted term of office and the immunity, a judge may be dismissed under conditions and in a manner prescribed by law. On the procedure for dismissal of judges, for more details see I_D_3.  
c) Pursuant to Article 100 of the Constitution, judges enjoy immunity. The immunity of judges is decided upon by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia. A judge or a lay judge may not be taken accountable for an opinion or a decision in court rulings. A judge may not be detained without consent by the Assembly, unless caught while perpetrating a criminal offence for which imprisonment is prescribed of at least five years. The procedure of deciding upon judges’ immunity is urgent and is conducted following a prior opinion by the Judicial Council.   
d) The average salary of a judge in a basic court is 426 EUR (net amount), i.e. 738 EUR (gross amount). Salary of a judge in an appellate court is 527 EUR (net amount), i.e. 850 EUR (gross amount), whereas salary of a judge in the Supreme Court is 595 EUR (net amount) i.e. 1032 EUR (gross amount). Salaries of public prosecutors correspond to the salaries of judges at the same level. The ratio between judges and public prosecutors’ salaries and salaries in other jobs is the following: the average salary in the Republic of Macedonia in 2003 was 190 EUR (net amount), while the average salary in the public administration and defence for 2004 was 373 EUR (gross amount), in the education 316 EUR (gross amount) and in the health care sector 324 EUR (gross amount). 
21. Mobility of judges: a) What procedure governs the allocation of judges to particular courts and regions? b) Can judges be required to move between courts and regions? 
a) Transfer of judges to work in other courts and regions has been regulated in the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/03). Pursuant to Article 37 of the Law, a judge performs judge’s duties in the court to which appointed. Against his/her will, a judge may not be transferred neither from one court to another, nor from one court department to another. The allocation of judges is conducted by way of an annual schedule for the operation of the court. A judge may request to be reassigned from one court department to another. 
b) The reassignment to another court may only be temporary (six months at most) and refers only to the judges of basic courts and of appellate courts. Upon their consent, these judges may temporarily be transferred to judge in another court of the same instance or in a lower ranking court or from one court department to another, on the basis of clearly determined reasons. Namely, reasons for such transfer may be if the regular court's functioning would be effected, due to inability or derogation of a judge, increased extent of work, or due to complexity of cases. A transfer of a judge from one court to another is exercised by the President of the higher ranking court. A reassignment from one department of a court to another is exercised by the President of the court. As an exception, by a decision of the President of the Court, a judge may be transferred to another court department against his/her will, only if this is necessary due to the scope and the subject matter of the court’s operation.   The Law also stipulates a provision under which a judge may request transfer from one court department to another. Against a decision for assignment to another court department or a decision rejecting the request for assignment to another court department, a judge may submit an appeal to the President of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia, who is obligated to decide on it within 7 days. 
22. Equipment: a) Is case administration in the courts computerised? Are systems and software compatible across the country? (The need to manage the computerisation on the national level calls for a central capacity to define needs, implement computerisation, including procurement of software and hardware, as well as to advise and help computerised courts.) b) Is there a Supreme Court database with case law accessible to courts, legal and judicial professions? c) Are databases of other law enforcement agencies accessible by courts? 

)  The current situation in courts in the Republic of Macedonia has been assessed as partially computerised. Out of the total number of 2.127 employees in courts, 1.209 use personal computers with installed court system application software. In the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia, the Skopje Appellate Court and the Skopje I Basic Court, full IT training has been conducted for all employees, including both the basic computer as well as application software training. Currently, due to the still ongoing application software training in the remaining 26 basic and 2 appellate courts for their 1662 employees, the case management has still not been computerised. Computerisation is envisaged to be introduced following the completion of training for the use of the application software and the additional installation of the necessary hardware, as well as after the enactment of the Rulebook on the Electronic Management of Court Rules of Procedure by the Minister of Justice.  As regards the compatibility of the equipment and software around the country, the equipment in all courts is compatible both in terms of its contemporary brand name (HP–Compaq and Siemens) and in terms of its configuration (Pentium 3). The already installed software application (on a Microsoft platform) proved optimally compatible with the equipment.  Regarding the project for computerisation of the judiciary, a study is now being prepared for the establishment of an Information Technology Centre within the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia, which shall define the organisational, personnel and technical capacities for the legal database management.  
b)  Currently, the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia has at its disposal a case law database (in paper) in a form of periodical collections of case law.  The Project Team, in cooperation with foreign consultants, has already prepared a project by which, in addition to the cases processed to the Supreme Court that have been published as case law, court cases will be selected from all courts in the Republic of Macedonia through an electronic legal database and will be delivered to the IT Centre within the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia. The equipment for electronic case law management has already been installed in the Supreme Court and once the optical link has been installed and the Legal Database Project (CARDS 2003) implemented, an optimum technical level will be achieved that will allow access to case law data by court employees and other legal professions. 
c)  In all courts of the Republic of Macedonia Local Area Network is currently used on each court’s level, and a possibility is allowed for the use of Intranet. However, courts have no access to databases of other law enforcement bodies.  It should be noted that by the completion of the stage of implementation of the Integrated Judicial IT System and implementation of CARDS 2003 Project, by the establishment of legal database, by providing optical link between courts and other judicial institutions and by the installation of the already prepared application software for the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the Judicial Council and the Penitentiary administration, sufficient pre-conditions would be put in place for judicial institutions’ access to databases of other law enforcement institutions, as well as to that of the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia.
23. General working conditions: a) Do judges and prosecutors have sufficient and separate offices, do they have computers, printers, fax machines, secretaries, law clerks? b) Do judges and prosecutors have access to the archives and legal databases? 
a)  The organisational structure of the judiciary in the Republic of Macedonia consists of 31 courts (27 basic courts, 3 appellate courts and the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia) and the public prosecution offices (22 basic public prosecutor’s offices, 3 higher public prosecutor’s offices and the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia). The working conditions are specified below. The premises of the basic public prosecutor’s offices are situated in the 22 buildings of basic courts. In Kavadarci and Strumica, premises of the basic courts and the public prosecutor’s offices are separate and due to the considerable financial investment over the past period, the working conditions of judges and prosecutors have been improved. In number of cities where organisational structure of basic courts exists (Kruševo, Negotino, Vinica and Kratovo), there are no present basic public prosecutor’s offices and in that sense, judges in these courts work in fairly good conditions.  Generally speaking, the Ministry of Justice has, over the recent period and through its own budget, by way of implementation of capital investment projects, resolved the problems of the general working conditions in the Basic Courts in Bitola, Prilep, Struga, Kriva Palanka, Debar. The acute difficulties, however, remain due to the insufficient number of trial chambers in the Basic Courts in Veles, Gevgelija and Kumanovo. It has been estimated that the optimisation of the premises within the buildings hosting the Basic Courts and the Basic Public Prosecutor's Offices in Tetovo, Gostivar, Kievo, Ohrid, Resen, Štip, Sveti Nikole, Koani, Berovo, Delevo and Radoviš, has provided the judges and the prosecutors with good basis for realisation of their working activities. In that sense, the Ministry of Justice and the Judicial Budget have pursued a consistent investment policy aimed at the general improvement of working conditions. The dispersion of the largest court in the country – Skopje I Basic Court, in three different buildings in Skopje has been pointed out as an acute problem. The envisaged structure shall enable the principle of a separate office for every judge – a principle that has already been implemented in the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia, in the appellate courts in Skopje, Stip and Bitola, in the Skopje II Basic Court, as well as in the basic courts in Tetovo, Gostivar, Kievo, Struga, Ohrid, Resen, Bitola, Prilep, Kruševo, Kavadarci, Negotino, Sveti Nikole, Štip, Koani, Vinica, Berovo, Delevo, Strumica, Gevgelija, Kratovo and Kriva Palanka. The Ministry of Justice has over the past four years carried out a number of projects aimed at the improvement of the working conditions for judges and prosecutors. In the period 2001-2003, over 2 million EUR were invested for all courts in the Republic of Macedonia (new building of the Supreme Court was put in operation, superstructure and extension was carried out in the buildings of the Basic Courts in Prilep, Struga, Kriva Palanka, Debar and Bitola). All courts were provided with new electrical installation, central heating and new furniture. In the course of 2003, over 20 digital switchboards and over 20 digital copiers were procured for a number of courts. In 2004 in accordance with the new Law on Public Prosecutor’s Office (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04), the Government enacted the Programme on Public Investment in Public Prosecution Offices under which, over the next several years, digital switchboards, digital copiers and laser fax units will be supplied for all public prosecution offices in the Republic of Macedonia. As regards the insufficient number of clerks in courts and in public prosecution offices, it has been pointed out that their number needs to increase and their status within institutions needs to improve as part of the comprehensive judicial reform.

24. How is co-operation between actors (judges, prosecutors, investigators, clerks, judicial police etc.) in the criminal justice system ensured to facilitate the functioning of the system? a) Do the different actors have clear roles and responsibilities? How is it ensured that an overlap of responsibilities is avoided? How is efficient communication between the different actors ensured? b) Are court procedures supervised by a higher ranking court? Please describe the current appeal procedures. 
a)  The role and responsibilities of all parties involved in criminal cases have been clearly defined both in the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02 and 74/04), and other relevant laws. Namely, the competences of courts and public prosecution offices have been delimited by the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/03), and the Law on the Public Prosecutor's Office (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04). Judicial power is exercised by courts which are autonomous and independent state bodies. The Public Prosecutor’s Office is a single and autonomous state body that prosecutes the perpetrators of criminal and other punishable acts. Types of courts, their competence, establishment, abrogation, organisation and composition have been regulated by the Law on Courts, while the establishment, organisation, competence, territory of jurisdiction and main  public prosecution offices have been regulated by the Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 9 of the Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office, in matters of importance for performing their functions and matters of general interest, public prosecutors cooperate with the bodies detecting criminal and other offences and their perpetrators, as well as with courts and other bodies and legal entities. Pursuant to Article 21 of the Law, the Public Prosecutor’s Office, in order to carry out the prosecution, in co-operation with the investigative and other competent bodies and legal entities, ensures that the measures and actions are taken to detect criminal and other punishable acts and their perpetrators. A public prosecutor guides the work of the authorised officials in the Ministry of the Interior and in other competent state bodies in order to take the necessary measures for detecting a perpetrator of a criminal offence, for ensuring that a perpetrator or an accomplice does not hide or flee, and for detecting and providing traces of a criminal act and objects that may serve as evidence. He/she may request that the Ministry of the Interior and other competent bodies or legal persons collect all information and take other measures to detect criminal or other punishable acts and their perpetrators. A public prosecutor may ask from the Ministry of the Interior that documents and other items of evidence found when detecting the criminal or other punishable acts and their perpetrators be made available to him/her for inspection. A public prosecutor may request from the state bodies, the bodies of the local self-government units, as well as from the organisations with public mandates, that they submit documents, papers, cases or announcements that may be necessary for his/her carrying out the actions within his/her competence. Similarly, he/she may request information from other legal entities and individuals for whom there are reasonable doubts that they possess such data or information, and may also consult or take an opinion by experts in the respective field, which may be necessary to him/her in order to make a decision. Competences of courts have been specifically determined in the Law on Courts (Articles 30 – 35). Within their determined competences, appellate courts decide upon conflicts of competence between basic courts that fall under their jurisdiction. On the other hand, the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia decides on conflicts of competence between basic courts falling under the jurisdiction of different appellate courts, on conflicts of competence between appellate courts and basic courts and such conflicts between different appellate courts, as well as on handing over the territorial jurisdiction from one court to another. Besides being regulated by these provisions, courts’ competences have also been stipulated by procedural laws. Pursuant to Articles 18 and 19 of the Law on Courts, courts are obligated to provide mutual legal assistance. On the request by a court in performing its competence, state bodies and other legal persons are obligated to submit without any delay all necessary information, papers or documents that are available to them and which are needed in the procedure.  The role of the Court Police has been regulated in Article 103 of the Laws on Courts. The Court Police provides security of facilities, property, persons and keeps order in courts.  
b) The right to appeal has been guaranteed in the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. Pursuant to Article 15 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, a right to appeal is guaranteed against individual legal acts issued in proceedings before a court, an administrative body or organisation or other institutions with public competences. The two-instance principle is one of the basic principles of all court proceedings. Pursuant to Articles 350 and 351 of the Law on Criminal Procedure, against a first instance decision, parties, defence attorney, legal representative of the defendant and the injured party may submit appeal within 15 days from the day of the delivery of the judgment. On behalf of the defendant, appeal may be submitted by his/her marital, i.e. extramarital partner, his/her first degree blood relative, his/her adoptive parent, his/her adopted child, his/her brother, sister and custodian.  The Law on Criminal Procedure stipulates the following 4 grounds to appeal a first instance judgment: 1) substantive violation of the procedure; 2) violation of the Criminal Code; 3) incorrectly or incompletely determined factual situation; and 4) a decision on criminal sanctions, deprivation of material gain, criminal procedure expenses, property and legal requests or a decision to announce the verdict in the press, radio or television. Most important essential violations of the criminal procedure rules include: violation of rules on the court composition, violation of rules of compulsory presence at the main hearing, exclusion of the public from the main hearing in violation of the Law, exceeding of the indictment, violation of the prohibition to found the judgment on evidence collected in an illicit manner and by a violation of freedoms and rights as determined by the Constitution, laws and ratified international treaties, violation of the right to an interpreter in the proceedings etc. The second instance court decides on the appeal at a session of the Chamber or on the basis of a conducted hearing (Article 363). Notified of the session of the Chamber shall be the defendant and his/her attorney, the injured party as a plaintiff who, within the time limit prescribed for appeals or answers to appeals, have requested to be notified of the session or have proposed that hearing be held before the second instance court. The Chairperson of the Chamber may decide that parties be notified of the session even when they have not requested it, in case their presence would contribute for the matters to be clarified.  If the defendant has been detained or is serving a sentence and has an attorney, his/her presence would be provided only if the Chairperson of the Chamber or the Chamber finds it worthwhile. The public may be excluded from a session of the Chamber attended by the parties due to the same reasons prescribed for exclusion of the public from a first instance court. (Article 362) Pursuant to Articles 364 and 365 of the Law on Criminal Procedure, a hearing before the second instance court shall be conducted only if, due to an incorrectly or incompletely determined factual situation, this is necessary in order to present new evidence or repeat the previously presented evidence or in case justified reasons exist to not return the case to the first instance court for a renewed main hearing. Summoned to the hearing before the second instance court, shall be the defendant and his/her attorney, the prosecutor, the injured party, his/her legal representatives and agents, as well as witnesses and experts that the Court decides to be examined. If the defendant has been detained, the Chairperson of the Chamber of the second instance court shall undertake all necessary measures to bring him/her to the hearing. At the hearing, parties may present new evidence and facts. The second instance court reviews the judgment in the part that has been challenged by the appeal, however it must ex officio always examine: whether there has been any violation of the criminal procedure provisions on the court’s composition and competence; whether there has been any violation of the rules prohibiting use of illegally obtained evidence; whether the indictment has been exceeded; whether the pronouncement of the verdict has been contradictory, incomprehensible or whether there have been no reasons for the judgment or those reasons have been incomprehensible or contradictory; or whether the main hearing, contrary to the provisions of this Law, has been held in absence of the defendant, or in case of a mandatory defence, in absence of the defendant’s attorney. The second instance court must ex officio examine whether the Criminal Code has been violated to the detriment of the defendant. (Article 367) If an appeal has been submitted only on behalf of the defendant, the verdict may not be changed to his/her detriment in reference to the legal assessment of the deed and the criminal sanction (Article 369). If, in reference to the appeal, the second instance court finds that reasons due to which it has decided in favour of the defendant are also beneficial to any of the co-defendants who have not submitted an appeal or whose appeal had not been in that direction, it shall ex officio act as if such an appeal had existed. (Article 371) The second instance court, may upon an appeal decide as follows: reject the appeal as untimely or not allowed; reject the appeal as unfounded and confirm the judgment of the first instance court (when it determines that there are no reasons to challenge the judgment and that there have been no violation of the law); endorse the appeal, cancel the first instance judgment and return the case to a renewed trial (in case it determines that there has been essential violation of the criminal procedure, or in case it considers that, due to an incorrectly or incompletely determined factual situation, a renewed main hearing has to be ordered before the first instance court); or endorse the appeal and alter the first instance judgment if it determines that the decisive facts have been correctly determined and that in view of the determined factual situation and by an appropriate application of law, a different judgment has to be brought. If in a renewed trial on the same case the second instance court finds that the factual situation has been incorrectly or incompletely determined, it shall hold a hearing and bring judgment. (Articles 372-380) The Law on Criminal Procedure (Article 381) also allows for a right to appeal the judgment of the second instance court only in a limited number of cases, namely:    If the second instance court has pronounced a sentence to life imprisonment or has confirmed the first instance verdict by which such a sentence had been pronounced;    If the second instance court has, on the basis of a conducted hearing, determined different factual situation than the first instance court and has, on the basis of the so determined factual situation, founded its decision;    If the second instance court has altered the first instance judgment by which the defendant had been released from the charges and has pronounced a judgment by which the defendant has been found guilty; Upon an appeal against a second instance judgment, a court decides in third instance at a session of the Chamber, pursuant to the provisions that apply to the second instance procedure. The sole exception is that there may be no hearing before the third instance court.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- EU officials support Bulgaria's initiative to become a regional energy centre, according to officials from the energy ministry cited Tuesday (14 January) in local press reports. The approval would be conditional, however: the EU would require assurance that the function of such a centre would not overlap with those of already existing structures. It would also require Romanian approval.
In related developments, a delegation from the World Bank met Tuesday with Bulgarian Energy Minister Milko Kovachev and reiterated the Bank's commitment to provide technical assistance to the process of privatising the energy sector.
Finally, a 40-member Bulgarian Engineer Platoon left Tuesday to join the Kosovo force, serving its 7th mission there. (BTA, Pari, Mediapool - 14/01/03)

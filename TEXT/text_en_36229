BUCHAREST, Romania -- Deputy US Trade Secretary William Lash urged Romania's businesses to join the Iraq reconstruction effort, given their experience in working in that part of the world. "Romania took part actively in the liberation of Iraq and now has a major role to play in the reconstruction of this country," he said. Prime Minister Adrian Nastase, who attended the meeting, said Romanian firms would be bidding for work on infrastructure, construction, oil drilling and energy.
In other news, local media reported that Nastase has decided to fire Justice Minister Rodica Stanoiu, replacing her with Deputy Foreign Minister Cristian Diaconescu. Stanoiu has been criticised for delaying judicial reforms. (AFP - 04/03/04)

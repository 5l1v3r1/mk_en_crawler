SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In an interview with Euroblic published on Thursday (December 20th), Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said that given the existing consensus among political leaders regarding EU integration goals, it is realistic to expect BiH and the EU to sign the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) in February or March. It was initialled earlier this month. Dodik said EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has confirmed this timeframe is possible. Police reform -- which RS has long rejected -- remains the main condition for signing the SAA.
Also on Thursday, Dodik said that former Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic, who is serving an 11-year sentence for her role in war crimes against Bosnian Muslims in the 1992-1995 conflict, could return home before 2009. Dodik said he has visited her several times at a prison in Sweden and that under the rules of The Hague tribunal, she could be released early for good behaviour. Plavsic is 77.

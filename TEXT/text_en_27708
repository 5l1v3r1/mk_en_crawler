PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Montenegrins head to the polls Sunday (May 23rd) for local elections in 14 municipalities. Polling stations are open from 8am to 9pm. The ruling coalition members -- the Democratic Party of Socialists and the Social Democratic Party -- are partnering up in 9 municipalities, but are running separately in the capital and the other municipalities. The opposition has joined forces and is running under a coalition dubbed "A Better Montenegro". The voting process will not be monitored by foreign observers.

ISPERIH, Bulgaria -- The Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) formally requested more power in the executive branch, specifically a vice presidency, at a ceremony Sunday (May 18th) marking the persecution of ethnic Turks by the former communist regime. In several campaigns, most recently during the 1980s, Bulgaria's communist government tried to eradicate Turkish ethnic identity by changing Turkish names to Bulgarian ones. Remzi Osman, deputy chairman of MRF's parliamentary group, noted that the party has become an inevitable partner in forming a stable government. It has been the kingmaker in three parliaments since 1990. (24 chasa, Dnevnik, Sega - 19/05/08; Mediapool - 18/05/08

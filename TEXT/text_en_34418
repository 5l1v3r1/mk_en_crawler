BUCHAREST, Romania -- Election officials say only 23.2 per cent of the country's 17.9 million registered voters had cast their ballots by noon Sunday (19 October), the second and final day of the referendum on a new constitution. A turnout of 50 per cent is needed to validate the results. The new constitution would provide guarantees for private property, allow foreign nationals to buy land, extend the president's term to five years, and eliminate obligatory military service. It would also allow the country's ethnic minorities to use their languages in court. President Ion Iliescu and Prime Minister Adrian Nastase urged people to go to the polls, insisting the vote for the new constitution is also a vote for eventual membership in the EU.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serb leaders in the northern part of Kosovo said on Friday (August 21st) at a press conference in Belgrade that the EULEX mission should leave Kosovo and will organise a petition next week to that end. They expect Belgrade's support and urged Serbian President Boris Tadic "to admit his mistake and demand the EU mission leave the territory of Serbia". (MIA, B92 - 21/08/09)

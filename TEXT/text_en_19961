ANKARA, Turkey -- The government announced on Monday (September 17th) that it would draft an action plan to ensure vigorous implementation of EU reforms, regardless of whether accession talks on a specific chapter are officially opened or not. The new plan would be divided into three-month periods -- each of them to include priorities and a road map for implementation and supervision, Foreign Minister and top EU negotiator Ali Babacan explained. 
"The most important component of the new reform programme will be harmonising Turkish law with the EU acquis," Babacan said. The European Commission is expected to release a progress report assessing Turkey's reform efforts in November. (Zaman - 18/09/07; CNN Turk, AFP, Milliyet, Anatolia - 17/09/07)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- A team of British defence experts has been invited to head a review of Kosovo's security needs, international media reported Wednesday (15 June). UN chief security adviser Iain Smailes said they would set up a secretariat comprised mostly of Kosovars to study what kind of security institutions the province would require once its final status is determined. Regional capitals, including Belgrade, would be informed of the board's work, but all decisions will be made in Pristina. UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen backed the concept, describing it as appropriate. (Reuters, KosovaLive, Beta, B92 - 15/06/05)

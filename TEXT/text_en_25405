THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal turned down former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic's request on Monday (November 23rd) to lodge an appeal against the court's decision to appoint him a lawyer. The court ruled that Karadzic's arguments are vague and insufficient. He has claimed that three months will not be enough for any lawyer to get up to speed in such a complicated case. He also challenged the fact that the judges did not allow him to choose a lawyer from among those working for the court. Last week, the court appointed a London lawyer, Richard Harvey, to represent Karadzic in court should he refuse to appear. Karadzic's trial has been suspended until March 1st 2010.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A businessman and his three bodyguards were killed in Sofia on Monday (19 January) when a bomb went off in an office building in a posh Sofia neighbourhood. Stoil Slavov, 44, was one of the major shareholders in Interpetroleum and at least 18 other firms. He was among the founders of SIC, an insurance company banned on racketeering charges in 1998. Interpetroleum was reported by local media to have generated more than 50m euros in net profit in 2003. Police say the bomb was planted in an elevator by an insider and activated by a mobile phone. Interior Ministry Chief Secretary General Boyko Borissov said the incident, part of a series of underworld assassinations, would likely spark reprisals.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- The process of dialogue between the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches was the focus of a closed-door meeting between Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I and visiting Pope Benedict XVI in Istanbul on Wednesday (November 29th). They also attended a thanksgiving service at Saint George Cathedral. Earlier on Wednesday, the Pope visited the towns of Izmir and Ephesus. 
He wraps up his three-day visit on Thursday with a tour of the famous Blue Mosque in Istanbul -- another attempt, analysts say, to mend relations with Muslims angry over a quote by a Byzantine emperor that Benedict wove into a September speech. (Vatan, BBC - 30/11/06; Zaman, ANA-MPA - 29/11/06)

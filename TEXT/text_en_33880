BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia dissolved its parliament on Thursday (13 November) when it became clear that the cabinet of Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic might not survive an upcoming no-confidence vote. Acting President and Speaker of Parliament Natasa Micic announced the decision and set 28 December as the date for the elections. "For the work ahead, we need a stable Serbia. Unfortunately, we do not have that at the moment," she said. Zivkovic conceded that his cabinet has become paralysed by infighting and desertions. "We can no longer continue work on important reforms ... This government has made its task to bring democracy to the country and ... seeks renewed confidence from the citizens at the polls," he said. Serbia is also holding a presidential election on Sunday. Two previous attempts failed due to low voter turnout. (AP, AFP, B92, Tanjug, BBC, FoNet - 13/11/03)

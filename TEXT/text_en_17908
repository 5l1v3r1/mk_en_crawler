SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A former Bosnian Serb military policeman, Jadranko Palic, pleaded not guilty to charges of crimes against humanity before the BiH Court on Friday (January 19th). The 36-year old Palic, a Croatian-born Serb and a BiH citizen, was arrested in Brcko last year. He has been indicted for crimes against Bosniak and Croat civilians, including the murder of 14 persons and rape of a woman in the Bosanska Krajina region in 1992. 
In other news, three inmates who have been staging a hunger strike at the Kula prison since January 8th -- Marko Samardjija, Damir Brekalo and Dragan Sujic -- were transferred to hospital Saturday evening after their conditions deteriorated. Dozens of prisoners, facing or convicted of war crimes before the BiH Court, are participating in the strike, demanding that their trials be conducted under the more lenient laws of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRJ). They argue that the SFRJ laws were in place at the time when the crimes were committed. (Dnevni avaz - 22/01/07; RTRS, Srna - 19/01/07)

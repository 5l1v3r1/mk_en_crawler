BELGRADE, Serbia -- Justice Minister Snezana Malovic announced on Wednesday (July 7th) that amendments to the law on campaign financing will be ready in a few days and will be forwarded to parliament in September. According to the amendments, the total amount of money that parties can receive as donations from individuals will not be limited by the amount of financing they receive from the budget. However, there will be a strict limit on the amount each citizen can donate to a party, to restrict individual influence over the party agendas. In addition, political parties must identify all their donors publicly or face stiff sanctions. (B92, Beta, Tanjug, RTS - 07/07/10)

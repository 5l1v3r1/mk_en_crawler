SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Around 70 per cent of Bulgarians disapprove of the proposed "election lottery" aimed at boosting voter turnout in the 25 June parliamentary elections, according to a Sova Harris poll published in Friday's (3 June) edition of the daily Standart. The lottery promises to award small prizes to voters who go to the polls. After harsh criticism from opposition parties, parliament has decided to discuss the matter during an extraordinary session on 9 June. (Standart - 03/06/05)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) on Tuesday (March 2nd) urged authorities in Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia to warn citizens travelling without visas in the EU that free access to the Schengen area does not mean that they can seek political asylum. EC spokesperson Michele Cercone said that Belgian authorities have informed Brussels about an influx of asylum seekers from countries that recently joined the visa-free regime. Cercone pointed out that "the vast majority of these asylum applications are made out economic interests and have really little chance of success."
Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic said on Tuesday that Serbian citizens seeking political asylum in EU member states will be repatriated in accordance with an agreement on readmission, while organisers of the schemes will be punished. In Macedonia, the government decided on Tuesday to establish a committee that would monitor asylum applications filed by Macedonian citizens in other countries.

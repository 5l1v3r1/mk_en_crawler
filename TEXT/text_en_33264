BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Former Serbian State Security chief Jovica Stanisic reportedly left for The Hague on Wednesday (11 June) to face trial for war crimes. The UN tribunal indicted him and Franko Simatovic, a former special operations unit commander, on 1 May. Simatovic was transferred to The Hague on 30 May, but Stanisic's handover was postponed for health reasons. After surgery last week, he was deemed stable enough to fly to the Netherlands.
In other news, Belgrade-based Radio B92 reported that former Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic is also in The Hague, where he will testify against Slobodan Milosevic. (Reuters, Times Online - 11/06/03; Radio B92 - 10/06/03)

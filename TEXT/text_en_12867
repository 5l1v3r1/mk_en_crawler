ATHENS, Greece -- Supreme Court President George Kappos initiated sanctions Tuesday (1 February) against judicial officials for alleged corruption, seeking the dismissal of two judges and an assistant prosecutor involved in a recent bribery scandal. The proposal, as well as further measures against corruption, will be placed on the Supreme Court's session in April. Earlier this week, Justice Minister Anastasios Papaligouras presented a plan for concrete activities aimed at rooting out corruption in the judiciary. (ANA - 02/02/05; MPA - 01/02/05)

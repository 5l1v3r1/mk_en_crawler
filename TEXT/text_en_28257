THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The trial of Radovan Karadzic is set to resume on Tuesday (August 17th) after The Hague war crimes tribunal rejected his request to delay the proceedings by three weeks. Last week, the former Bosnian Serb leader said he needed more time to review recordings found in the apartment of fugitive Ratko Mladic's wife. The so-called Mladic tapes -- 93 audio and ten video tapes, two CDs and eight DVDs -- were found in a March raid on the Belgrade apartment of Mladic's wife and given to Karadzic's defence team on August 4th. Karadzic is charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. (RTRS, BHRT - 16/08/10)

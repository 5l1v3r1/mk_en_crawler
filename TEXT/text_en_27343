BELGRADE, Serbia -- Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac said on Sunday (May 30th) that Serbia plans to send troops to UN peacekeeping missions in Lebanon and Cyprus, possibly this year. "If we want to take care of Serbia's security, we must move outside the borders of our country, because it is clear that no one in the world can take care of the security of their countries only within their own borders," he said. Serbia currently has peacekeepers with UN missions in the Ivory Coast, Liberia, Congo and Chad. (RTS, Beta, B92, Tanjug - 30/05/10)

LISBON, Portugal -- The Portuguese presidency of the EU said on Tuesday (August 14th) that it still hopes Pristina and Belgrade can strike a deal on the future of Kosovo. "The negotiations have just started, so we cannot talk of an impasse and there is no reason to become discouraged," said spokeswoman Clara Borja. She urged both parties to demonstrate the flexibility and goodwill needed to bring the talks to a successful end by December. 
Speaking to the Slovenian paper Delo, meanwhile, former EU external relations commissioner Chris Patten said the international community would sooner or later have to recognise an independent Kosovo because there are no other options. He expressed pessimism over the new round of talks, noting neither Belgrade nor Pristina have modified their earlier positions. Patten is currently deputy chairman of the International Crisis Group.

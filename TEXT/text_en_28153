ZAGREB, Croatia -- The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) on Saturday (May 15th) raised its overall forecast for the economic growth of countries in Eastern Europe this year, although projections for some countries were lowered. According to a document issued during the Bank's annual meeting in Zagreb, economies in the region will register growth of 3.7% this year, instead of the 3.3% forecast in January. At the same time, the Bank warned recovery remains fragile, "with increasing differences in the pace of growth across countries and new risks arising from fiscal pressures and financial volatility in Western Europe". Some of the biggest economies in the region, including Turkey, prompted the upgrade, while forecasts for EU members Bulgaria and Romania were revised downward. (Reuters, AFP - 15/05/10)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The head of the Army's general staff, General Nikola Kolev, described the pace of military reforms in the country at a news conference in Sofia Tuesday (21 December). Following a restructuring, he said, the number of professional soldiers is expected to top 15,000, representing around 65 per cent of the armed forces. Kolev added that 819 Bulgarian soldiers -- about 2 per cent of the military -- are participating in peacekeeping missions abroad. At NATO's request, Bulgaria is expected to increase the number of troops serving in such operations to 8 per cent in the future. In 2006, Kolev said, Sofia would send 350 troops to Afghanistan.

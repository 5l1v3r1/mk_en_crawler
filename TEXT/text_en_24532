SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Sunday's second round of presidential and local elections went in accordance with "most international standards", the OSCE said in a statement Monday (April 6th). "We were pleased to see a peaceful environment and a well-administered Election Day, although some aspects of the campaign period seriously detracted from the overall quality of the election process," said Peter Eicher, head of the OSCE Election Observation Mission.
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana also praised Macedonia for the successful elections and congratulated President-elect Gjorge Ivanov on his victory. EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Macedonia has fulfilled the EU's recommendations, thus confirming its determination to meet all EU standards and to make progress in its accession process.

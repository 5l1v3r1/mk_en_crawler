ATHENS, Greece -- Prosecutors in the trial of 15 members of the November 17 terrorist group on Wednesday (10 December) asked the judges to impose a total of 55 life sentences and 11,000 years in jail for the perpetrators of 23 murders over a period of more than 20 years. Twenty-one life sentences and 2,440 years in jail were requested for the group's leader, Alexandros Giotopoulos. He is believed to have masterminded 19 murders since 1983. Chief Prosecutor Christos Lambrou also requested 13 life terms and 2,446 years imprisonment for Dimitris Koufontinas who was convicted of assassinating British military attach√© Steven Saunders in June 2000. Prosecutors asked for leniency for four of the defendants whose testimony was important to the government's case. The judges are expected to announce the sentences next week. (AFP - 10/12/03)

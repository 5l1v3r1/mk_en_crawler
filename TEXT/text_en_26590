BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU President Herman Van Rompuy said Thursday (February 11th) that leaders of the bloc have agreed to help Greece overcome its severe financial crisis, in an effort to prevent it from spreading to other members of the eurozone. Van Rompuy's announcement followed a two-hour delay to the start of the EU summit in Brussels. The official explanation of the delay was heavy snow, but media speculated the actual reason was efforts by the leaders to broker a deal on Greece. In Brussels, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy. "Greece is part of the EU and we will not leave it to stand alone," Merkel said after the meeting. (DPA, AP, BBC - 11/02/10; BBC, Reuters, AFP, AP - 10/02/10)

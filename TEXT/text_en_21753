VIENNA, Austria -- Police detained three members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) for allegedly helping illegal immigrants cross the country, security officials announced on Thursday (July 24th). Policemen stopped a van carrying nine illegal immigrants in the city of Offenberg. They detained three men for human trafficking and forgery. The three had sought asylum in Austria in the past but were rejected for links to the PKK, which Ankara and most of the international community consider a terrorist organisation.

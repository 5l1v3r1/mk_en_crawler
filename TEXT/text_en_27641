NEW YORK, United States -- Cypriot President Demetris Christofias said on Friday (September 24th) that Turkey should respect the island's independence and play a role in efforts to reunify the Greek and Turkish communities there. "Our vision is a reunited Cyprus, common homeland of Greek and Turkish Cypriots, without any foreign troops or settlers and with the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all its people, Greek or Turkish Cypriots, Maronites, Armenians or Latins, fully respected," Christofias said in his address to the 65th session of the UN General Assembly in New York. As for Turkey's statements suggesting "it wants a solution to the problem by the end of the year ... we are still waiting for their words to be transformed into action," Christofias said. On Saturday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon met with Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu, urging both he and Christofias to "redouble their efforts" to resolve the key property issue in the ongoing reunification talks.

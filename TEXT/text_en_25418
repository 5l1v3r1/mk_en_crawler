TIRANA, Albania -- Lawmakers from the opposition Socialist Party (SP) insisted on Thursday (March 25th) that they will attend parliamentary sessions related to the transparency of elections and skip the rest. The SP recently ended a complete boycott of parliament staged for months over the government's refusal to open ballot boxes and investigate the June 2009 elections. The boycott affected the passage of EU-related reforms. (Top Channel, Shekulli, Alsat, Klan, Lajmifundit - 25/03/10)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission Thursday (1 July) welcomed Romania's decision to introduce visa requirements for citizens of Serbia-Montenegro, within the framework of Romania's commitments as an EU candidate member. "It is clear that Romania will have to align its legislation with EU legislation ahead of accession," said European Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Antonio Vitorino. That includes adopting visa regulations for a list of countries, including Serbia-Montenegro. The new regime took effect Thursday. (EC Web site - 01/07/04)

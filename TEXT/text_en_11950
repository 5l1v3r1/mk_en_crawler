BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign ministers are expected to delay the launch of accession talks with Croatia, according to international media reports Wednesday (16 March). The majority of EU members reportedly oppose starting negotiations Thursday as scheduled, because of Zagreb's failure to arrest fugitive General Ante Gotovina. Florence Hartmann, a spokeswoman for the UN tribunal, said prosecutors have seen "no change in the attitude of Croatia, which has shown no resolve to arrest General Gotovina". Prime Minister Ivo Sanader made a last-ditch effort to sway opinions by visiting Brussels on Tuesday. (AFP, Telegraph, FT, BBC, AFX, Vecernji list - 16/03/05; HINA, HRT, AFP, BBC News - 15/03/05)

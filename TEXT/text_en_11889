BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said Tuesday (15 February) that the government has decided to revise a nearly 1 billion-euro deal with European Aeronautic Defence and Space (EADS) on border security hardware. Tariceanu said the terms and prices would be renegotiated in a bid to bring more transparency to the issue. The deal, signed by the previous administration, was subject to criticism, as the contract was given to EADS without a tender.
In other news, the main opposition Social Democratic Party announced Tuesday that it will nominate Dan Marian Vanghelie as mayor of Bucharest. The election will be held on 3 April. (Mediafax, Rompres - 15/02/05)

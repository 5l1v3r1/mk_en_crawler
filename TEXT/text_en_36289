BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian-Montenegrin Defence Council (VSO) adopted a defence strategy late Wednesday evening (26 May). President Svetozar Marovic, who heads the VSO, described the move as an essential step that would shape the country's bid to enter NATO's Partnership for Peace programme and other international security structures.
In other news, the VSO has sacked the head of the country's military intelligence service over remarks he made about agents infiltrating extremist groups. Colonel Momir Stojanovic said in February that his service had penetrated terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda, in Kosovo and Albania. He claimed they were planning acts against Serbia-Montenegro.
Meanwhile, Belgrade-based B92 Radio reports that the war crimes tribunal at The Hague may transfer some lower level cases to Belgrade for trial. The news comes as Serbian prosecutors indicted an 18th person in connection with the 1991 Vukovar massacre. (Tanjug, B92, AFP - 27/05/04)

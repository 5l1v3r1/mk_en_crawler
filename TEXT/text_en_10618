STRASBOURG, France -- UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen and the Council of Europe Secretary General Terry Davis have agreed to summon a meeting of the Independent International Commission for the Cultural Heritage of Kosovo, in order to resolve a deadlock in the Emergency Action Plan for protection of the cultural heritage of Serbs in Kosovo. Implementation of the protection measures has been blocked because of the Serb Orthodox Church's decision to withdraw from the project. (CoE Web site, Tanjug, B92 - 12/11/04)

ROME, Italy -- Police said on Tuesday (December 28th) that a parcel bomb found at the Greek Embassy in Rome the previous day was sent by anarchists angry over the arrests of two alleged members of a Greek extremist group, Conspiracy Nuclei of Fire. Responsibility for the attack has been claimed by an Italian group calling itself the Informal Anarchist Federation.
"We're striking again, and we do so in response to the appeal sent by Greek comrades of the Conspiracy Nuclei of Fire," the Italian anarchists reportedly said in a note found at the embassy. Two parcels exploded at the Swiss and Chilean embassies on December 23rd, injuring two people. (New York Times, ANA-MPA - 28/12/10)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried reaffirmed his country's commitment to stability in BiH and support for its future in Europe and NATO, as he arrived on a two-day visit Wednesday (April 4th). He met in Sarajevo with members of the tripartite Presidency, government and parliamentary representatives, urging leaders to overcome political differences and move the country forward, instead of blocking crucial reforms involving the constitution and the police sector. He also urged the immediate arrest of the remaining fugitives wanted by the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, insisting this chapter must be closed. Fried next travels to Banja Luka for talks with Bosnian Serb officials. (Dnevni avaz, Nezavisne novine - 05/04/07; RTRS - 04/04/07)

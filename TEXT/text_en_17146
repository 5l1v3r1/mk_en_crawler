BUCHAREST, Romania -- The monitoring report on Romania which the European Commission (EC) is to present in Strasbourg on 27 September would be positive Jonathan Scheele, head of the EC delegation in Romania, said in a radio interview Thursday (31 August). Scheele noted the visible progress achieved in the past several months, but said it is too early to say if the report would contain red flags.
Separately Thursday, in a speech to Romania's diplomatic corps, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said the country must draft a long-term post-accession strategy. He also spoke of the need to develop the technical infrastructure and personnel for utilisation of EU funds. (Nine O'clock - 01/09/06; Rompres - 31/08/06)

TIRANA, Albania -- Five ministries have joined an emergency task force to monitor the situation in the north where the Fierza hydro plant and the Drin River threaten to flood surrounding areas. Heavy rains have pushed levels in both to near maximum capacity, threatening those living nearby. Energy Minister Dritan Prifti said on Tuesday (December 29th) that the government is ready to intervene in case of emergency, adding that shelters have been established in Shkodra, Lezha and Mat and are ready to accept people if necessary.

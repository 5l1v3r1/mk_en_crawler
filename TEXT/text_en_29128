BUCHAREST, Romania -- Crin Antonescu, leader of the opposition National Liberal Party, called on Wednesday (May 5th) for the government of Prime Minister Emil Boc to resign, and said President Traian Basescu should either step down or find an actual solution to the economic crisis. Antonescu suggests a smaller, streamlined cabinet composed of experts in their fields. "The new government should have seven to eight ministries at the most. The expert government can prevent unnecessary costs that were made in 2009," Antonescu said. Victor Ponta, leader of the other big opposition party -- the Social Democratic Party -- agrees that the current cabinet should be replaced, via early elections. The next scheduled parliamentary elections are in 2012. (Evenimentul Zilei - 06/05/10; Realitatea, Ziare - 05/05/10)

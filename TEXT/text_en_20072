SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The State Investigation and Protection Agency arrested Marko Skrobic, 36, on charges of crimes against humanity Monday (December 17th). BiH prosecutors say the former member of Bosnian Croat paramilitary units in the 1992-1995 conflict was an accomplice to the July 1992 murder of a Serb civilian in the town of Kotor.
In other news Monday, the Federation BiH (FBiH) government discussed the case of former Bosnian Muslim commander Rasim Delic and decided there is no evidence suggesting he had breached the terms of his provisional release by the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. The tribunal permitted Delic to go free during the tribunal's Christmas vacation. But shortly after his return to Sarajevo, Delic received almost celebrity treatment by the BiH presidency's Bosniak member, Haris Silajdzic. That triggered an outcry from Republika Srpska and from Hague tribunal prosecutors. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 18/12/07; RTRS, NTV Hayat, Fena - 17/12/07)

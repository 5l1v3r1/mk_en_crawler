TIRANA, Albania -- A new parliamentary group, headed by former Socialist Party (SP) leader Fatos Nano, is set to debut next month. It will be comprised of the six lawmakers expelled from the party earlier this week for backing Democratic Party official Bamir Topi in presidential elections last month. 
"The actions of the Socialist Party prove its inability to think differently ... they should have listened to our arguments as well," one of the six, Durim Lamaj, said on Tuesday (August 28th). According to the newspaper Standard, the final decision on forming the new group will be made during a meeting with Nano on Monday. He has indicated for months now that he may strike out on his own due to quarrels with SP leader Edi Rama. (Standard - 30/08/07; Nova Makedonija - 29/08/07)

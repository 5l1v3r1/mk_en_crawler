BELGRADE, Serbia -- The opposition Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) has won 12 seats in early local elections in Arandjelovac municipality, according to official results published on Sunday (May 2nd). The ruling Democratic Party was second with ten seats, followed by the coalition led by the Serbian Socialist Party with six. G17 plus, the Democratic Party of Serbia and New Serbia won three seats each, and the Liberal Democratic Party won two. The final results of the April 25th vote were delayed pending a revote at one polling station. The early elections were called because the city council failed to function for more than three months due to political deadlock. (RTS, Radio Free Europe, B92, Danas - 02/05/10)

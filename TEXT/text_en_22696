PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker says he hopes Belgrade will not try to organise municipal elections in Kosovo next month, since Serbia says it respects UN Resolution 1244. On Saturday (April 5th), Ruecker noted that all local elections fall under UNMIK's jurisdiction. Serbians will vote in parliamentary and local ballots on May 11th and Belgrade authorities insist elections should be held in Kosovo as well since it is still considered an integral part of Serbia. On Friday, Serbian Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic sent a letter to Ruecker asking him to allow and assist with elections in Kosovo. (Zeri, Koha Ditore, B92 - 06/04/08)

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- An accident at a shipyard in Istanbul's Tuzla district killed three workers and injured 12 others on Monday (August 11th). The 15 workers fell into the sea when the ropes of a vessel snapped during testing. Three of them drowned, Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler told reporters. The Tuzla shipyards are notorious for the number of work-related accidents and deaths in the past few years. Authorities blame noncompliance with safety regulations.

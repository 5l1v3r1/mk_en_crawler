BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Florence Hartmann, the UN war crimes tribunal prosecution spokeswoman, said Sunday (26 October) there are no more indictments of current police or army officials. Her statement follows strong opposition by local authorities to controversial indictments against four top military and police officials, including Public Security chief Sreten Lukic.
Meanwhile in Serbia, Federal Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic said he would schedule a meeting of the joint Hague Co-operation Council of the federal and Serbian governments this week. The focus would be the new indictments. (B92, Beta, BBC - 26/10/03)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The chairwoman of the European Parliament Committee for Southeast Europe, Doris Pack, reiterated Tuesday (3 February) her concerns that Macedonia will choose the wrong moment to apply for EU membership. Pack urged the country to wait, as the Union is currently too occupied with the accession of 10 new members and is still digesting the political and economic implications of this enlargement. She recommends Skopje file the application next year, rather than later this month as planned.
In other news Tuesday, a 14-member team from NATO arrived in Macedonia to evaluate progress in implementing reforms necessary for eventual membership. (MIA, A1 TV - 03/02/04)

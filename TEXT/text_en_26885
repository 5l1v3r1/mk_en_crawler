SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Fifteen Bulgarian tourists died on Saturday (September 5th) when a boat taking them to the St Naum Monastery complex sank in Lake Ohrid. According to survivors and witnesses, the boat was gone in less than four minutes. Three tourists who went missing after the incident were later found alive. In all, 42 passengers were rescued, including four who were seriously injured. All of them have returned to Bulgaria on a special flight organised by the government. All celebrations that were to take place in Bulgaria marking Independence Day on Sunday have been cancelled. Monday has been declared a day of national mourning in Bulgaria. Macedonia is observing a day of national mourning Sunday. The initial investigation suggests overcrowding may have been a factor. Macedonian Transport Minister Mile Janakievski has resigned over the incident. (BBC, Vecer, Utrinski Vesnik - 06/09/09; bTV, Darik, Reuters, MIA, Makfax, AFP, AP - 05/09/09)

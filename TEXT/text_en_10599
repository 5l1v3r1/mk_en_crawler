BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's Parliament on Wednesday (13 October) adopted a resolution describing accession into Euro-Atlantic institutions as a strategic goal. In all, 129 of the total 250 parliament members voted in favour of the move. Members of the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party and the Socialist Party of Serbia boycotted the vote. 
In other news, Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic said in an interview published Thursday that an "international conference on the scale of Dayton" should be held to resolve the Kosovo problem. He told the Financial Times that the two sides have remained diametrically opposed in the last five years. Without pressure from outside, talks could take years to succeed, he said. 
Meanwhile, the 2nd Danube summit is under way in Belgrade. Government and corporate representatives from around the region and the EU are attending the event, which focuses on development of the Danube Corridor and transport logistics in Southeast Europe.

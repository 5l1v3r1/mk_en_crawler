WARSAW, Poland -- Kosovo President Atifete Jahjaga is urging all countries that have not yet recognised her's as an independent country to do so. Addressing participants of the Central and Southeast European Summit in Warsaw on Friday (May 27th), she stressed the importance of the ongoing dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade, both in resolving practical every day issues and in view of normalising relations between the two countries. Serbian President Boris Tadic did not attend the meeting because of Jahjaga's presence. Romanian President Traian Basescu also skipped the meeting, as Romania is among the EU countries that do not recognise Kosovo's independence. (Tanjug, Blic - 28/05/11)

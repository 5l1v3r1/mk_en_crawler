BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic had to scrap a planned trip to Sofia on Thursday (December 2nd), after his plane experienced an unspecified technical problem shortly after take-off from Belgrade. The government said the pilot reported a warning signal about 15 minutes after the Learjet left the capital and returned to the airport. Cvetkovic was to meet with Bulgarian officials and attend the opening of a supermarket owned by a Serbian company. (AP, Standart, B92, Tanjug - 02/12/10)

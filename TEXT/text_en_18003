THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal announced on Monday (March 19th) that it has rejected a challenge to its authority by three former Croatian generals. In a 26-page ruling, a three-judge panel said the court's jurisdiction over such cases was established in previous cases. The generals -- Ante Gotovina, Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac -- are charged with participation in a criminal conspiracy to drive Serbs out of the Krajina region of southern Croatia in 1995 by pursuing a campaign of violence, murder and intimidation. The ruling opens the way for the start of the trial on May 7th. The three defendants face life in prison if convicted. (Vecernji list - 20/03/07; AP, HINA - 19/03/07)

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in BiH, appointed a commission Thursday (29 May) to draft a plan consolidating the intelligence services of the country's two entities. Kalman Kocsis, who oversaw the reform of the Hungarian intelligence service in the 1990s and served as Budapest's ambassador to Sarajevo, will head the commission. It will include six other experts -- three nominated by Republika Srpska and three by the Federation of BiH. The panel would begin work in June and would be expected to submit concrete proposals to parliament by 1 August. (AFP, OHR web site, PBS BiH - 29/05/03)

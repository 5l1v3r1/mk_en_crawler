ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday (December 12th) accused French President Nicolas Sarkozy of being a hypocrite on the issue of Turkey's possible EU accession. "Sarkozy said one thing during our bilateral meetings and another thing behind our back. This is not suitable behaviour for a politician," Erdogan told a meeting of businessmen in Ankara. Sarkozy has long maintained that Turkey is not part of Europe and should not receive EU membership. (Hurriyet - 13/12/07; Anadolu news agency, NTV, Turkish Press, AFP - 12/12/07)

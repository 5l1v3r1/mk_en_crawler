TIRANA, Albania -- Former Prime Minister Pandeli Majko is criticising the government for turning state institutions into political tools and for oppressing debate on elections. Now a parliament member representing the opposition Socialist Party (SP), Majko said on Monday (August 30th) that current discussions on the elections are purely political and are not intended to contribute to electoral transparency. "We are in a political collapse and we risk stagnation," he added. Majko reiterated the SP's stance that the June 2009 general elections must be investigated by a commission with access to all election materials. (Shekulli, Alsat, Vizion +, Top News - 30/08/10)

MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- International community high representative Paddy Ashdown voiced concern Saturday (11 September) that the transfer of war crime trials from The Hague tribunal to the BiH judiciary might be delayed. He blamed parliament's refusal to discuss the bills on conducting war crimes trials in the country. Ashdown added that the refusal might send a negative signal regarding BiH's commitment to fully co-operate with the UN tribunal. He urges parliament to adopt the bills by the end of this month. 
In other news, the Bosnian Croat member of the BiH presidency, Dragan Covic, said on Friday he expects the trial against six Croats indicted for war crimes - Jadranko Prlic, Bruno Stojic, Valentin Coric, Berislav Pusic and generals Milivoj Petkovic and Slobodan Praljak - to be transferred to Croatia.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Former Macedonian security official Johan Tarculovski will make his first appearance before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia on Monday (21 March). He was transferred to The Hague last week after being indicted together with former Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski. Both face charges stemming from the 2001 interethnic conflict in Macedonia. Boskovski, who holds dual Macedonian-Croatian citizenship, has been in Croatian custody since last autumn. (Vest - 19/03/05; A1 TV, Reality Macedonia - 18/03/05)

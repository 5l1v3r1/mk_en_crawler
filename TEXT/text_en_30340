SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The state prosecutor's office asked the Justice Ministry on Tuesday (April 12th) to request the extradition of Bozidar Vucurevic, the wartime mayor of the Bosnian town of Trebinje. Serbian police arrested him on April 4th at a Bosnian-Serbian border crossing based on war crimes charges. Prosecutors insist he has to be prosecuted in BiH as he is Bosnian citizen and is subject to an investigation for war crimes committed in Trebinje. Vucurevic is also wanted by Zagreb for war crimes against civilians committed during the shelling of Dubrovnik in 1991. Croatia has already requested his extradition. (RTRS, Srna - 12/04/11)

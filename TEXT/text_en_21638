THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic is demanding that The Hague war crimes tribunal secure him adequate conditions to prepare his defence and pay his legal advisers' fees, the tribunal announced on Wednesday (November 26th). Karadzic, who plans to represent himself -- with the support of three legal advisers -- thinks the rate of 25 euros an hour, set by the tribunal's Secretariat, is too low. He has provided a financial statement to prove he lacks funds to cover his judicial expenses. The Secretariat has agreed to foot part of the bill for two members of his team until Karadzic's financial status is reviewed. (MIA, BTA, Deutsche Welle, RTS - 26/11/08)

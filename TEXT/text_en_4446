French General Xavier de Marnhac on Friday handed over the command of KFOR to Italian General Giuseppe Emilio Gay, who becomes the 13th chief of peacekeeping troops in Kosovo. 
De Marnhac expressed happiness at having been part of KFOR. 
Addressing the people of Kosovo in a speech, he said, "You have continually demonstrated a high degree of patience and maturity during this historical time in Kosovo's future." 
He mentioned he visited all parts of Kosovo during his tenure, including the minority areas. 
 "It is the spirit of the ordinary people and of the children who give me hope for the future of Kosovo," said de Marnhac. 
Present at the ceremony were Kosovo's highest officials, representatives of international institutions, diplomats based in Pristina and the commander of the NATO South Wing, Admiral Mark Fitzgerald. 
Fitzgerald said NATO will continue to support a peaceful and stable environment in Kosovo, which will promote economic stability and a free and democratic society. 
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu praised KFOR's work. "The period to come represents the next challenge for Kosovo, in which KFOR has its role in supporting the establishment of the Kosovo Security Force," he said. 
"Kosovo is striving to establish its security force, which will serve all its citizens without making ethnic distinctions," said Sejdiu. 
De Marnhac predicted the new commander would be highly successful and would witness many changes in his year-long term. 
Gay is the third KFOR commander to come from Italy. 
KFOR, a NATO-led international force, entered Kosovo on June 12th 1999 under a UN mandate, two days after the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1244. 
The official KFOR website indicates that in 2008, a total of 15,000 soldiers from 34 countries serve on the force.

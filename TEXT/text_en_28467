ATHENS, Greece -- Labour unions representing truck owners announced on Wednesday (September 15th) they will continue to protest government plans to open their sector to competition. The action, which started on Monday, has sparked concerns about fuel supplies now that talks with the government have failed once again. A similar strike in July caused serious fuel shortages, forcing the government to intervene by requiring truckers to end the protest. Since that order remains in effect, the truckers cannot actually declare a strike. The union says they will hold daily protests instead. (AP, AFP - 15/09/10)

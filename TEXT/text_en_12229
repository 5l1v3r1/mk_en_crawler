BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS) presented an hour-long video Saturday (9 July) showing war crimes being committed against Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war. Tomislav Nikolic, deputy head of the SRS, said all crimes must be condemned, including those committed by Serbs. A videotape showing Bosniaks from Srebrenica being executed by Serb paramilitary troops sparked outrage when it was broadcast recently during a trial at The Hague. The Liberal Democratic Faction (LDF) of the Democratic Party criticised the Serb Orthodox Church, whose Patriarch Pavle attended Saturday's gathering. Apart from LDF, G17 Plus and several NGOs also opposed the presentation.
In other news, petrol prices in Serbia jumped by 11.85 per cent on average as of Saturday. Private retailers warn this hike will not affect the diesel shortage, which began about a month ago. But the oil and gas monopoly NIS says the shortage is only temporary, as normal supply has been restored. (Politika, Danas - 10/07/05; B92, RTS, Tanjug, Beta - 09/07/05)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- All parties that won seats parliamentary in the January 21st parliamentary elections submitted their lists of deputies to the Election Commission by Monday's (February 12th) deadline. That clears the way for the constituent session Wednesday, when the mandates of the newly elected members would be verified. This first session also is expected to focus on a new draft resolution on Kosovo, in response to UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan. Consultations between Belgrade and Pristina are to start next week in Vienna. (Beta - 13/02/07; RTS, B92 - 12/02/07)

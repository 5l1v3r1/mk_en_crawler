RHODES, Greece -- The possibility of Turkey invading northern Iraq is a very dangerous possibility, according to Greek Defence Minister Yiannos Papantoniou, who spoke at the EU Armaments General Directors meeting on Friday (11 April), on the Greek island of Rhodes. According to Papantoniou, protection of Iraq's territorial integrity is a precondition for the country's smooth transition to a state of democracy and prosperity. At the same meeting, he stressed the need to further strengthen and accelerate the political and defence unification of EU member states. Greece currently holds the rotating EU presidency.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Political representatives and officials in Kosovo are lined up against a proposal by the International Crisis Group (ICG) that Kosovo should give extended autonomy to its north in exchange for Serbian recognition. Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi said on Tuesday (March 15th) that any proposal that harms Kosovo's territorial integrity is unacceptable. "The Ahtisaari Plan is the biggest and the most painful compromise which Kosovo has made; therefore, anything beyond this package will by no means be accepted by the Kosovo institutions," he said. Ruling parties and opposition representatives alike oppose the ICG idea. Northern Kosovo is still mainly managed by Serb parallel structures despite efforts by Pristina to establish full administrative control.

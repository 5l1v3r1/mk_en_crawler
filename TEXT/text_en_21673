SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The foreign ministry announced on Saturday (October 25th) that Macedonia and Kosovo have reached an agreement on their common border. Joint committees meeting in Ohrid signed off on the demarcation line Friday, the ministry said in a statement. Earlier this month, Macedonia recognised Kosovo as an independent country. The border agreement was a precondition for establishing diplomatic ties between the two countries, which is expected in November. (AFP, Makfax, MIA - 25/10/08)

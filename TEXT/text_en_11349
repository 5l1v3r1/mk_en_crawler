ZAGREB, Croatia -- Ethnic discrimination continues to affect war crimes trials conducted in Croatia, according to Amnesty International's annual report, presented in Zagreb on Wednesday (25 May). According to the human rights group, everyone prosecuted for war crimes in Croatia in 2004 was a Croatian Serb. Moreover, it said, some trials did not meet internationally recognised standards of fairness, and Croatian Army and police members continued to receive immunity for wartime human rights violations. 
In other news, Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader is on a four-day trip to China. In Beijing Thursday, he met with counterpart Wen Jiabao and signed a joint statement on co-operation. The two officials agreed to focus on economic ties, largely stalled for the past ten years. (Vjesnik - 27/05/05; HINA - 26/05/05; HINA - 25/05/05)

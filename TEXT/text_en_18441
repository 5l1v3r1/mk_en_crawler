TRIPOLI, Libya -- Two top-ranking EU officials headed for Tripoli on Sunday (June 10th) to try to negotiate the release of five Bulgarian nurses on death row. The nurses and a Palestinian doctor were sentenced on charges that they infected more than 400 children with HIV. The medics deny the charges and have been backed by top AIDS researchers. EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner and German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier met with representatives of the children's families and members of the Qadhafi Foundation, run by the Libyan leader's son, Seif al-Islam. 
Outgoing British Prime Minister Tony Blair held reportedly successful talks with Libyan leaders last week. Meanwhile, leading Bulgarian media reported on Sunday that they have asked the United States to allocate part of the money under a global programme for fighting AIDS for the construction of a modern health care centre in Libya.

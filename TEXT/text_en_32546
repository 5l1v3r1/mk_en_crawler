SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The international community in BiH took steps Friday (7 March) to undermine the network supporting top war crimes indictee Radovan Karadzic. High Representative Paddy Ashdown launched the campaign by ordering the freezing of bank accounts belonging to two alleged Karadzic supporters, Momcilo Mandic and Milovan Bjelica. The same sanctions were slapped on two BiH businesses -- ManCo Oil Co and Privredna Banka Srpsko Sarajevo. Mandic is believed to be Karadzic's financier, while Bjelica serves as his spokesman. Bjelica was also removed from his position as Chairman of the Srpsko Sarajevo Municipal Assembly. SFOR troops raided his offices on Friday and seized documentation. SFOR personnel also searched Republika Srpska (RS) Parliament as well as the RS Army headquarters in Banja Luka. Documents were also seized in those operations.
A monastery in neighbouring Montenegro, meanwhile, denied claims by UN prosecutors that it was sheltering Karadzic. The priests invited chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte to visit the building.

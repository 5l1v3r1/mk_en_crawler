ZAGREB, Croatia -- A parliamentary committee meets on Wednesday (August 19th) to discuss a request to strip former Defence Minister Berislav Roncevic of his immunity. Prosecutors accuse him in connection with a 2004 deal to purchase 39 military trucks. The questionable terms of the sale cost the state budget nearly 4.6m euros.

ANKARA, Turkey -- In a near repeat of the first round, Turkey's Parliament again failed to elect a new head of state Friday (August 24th). The frontrunner, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, won 337 votes, falling short of the required two-thirds majority. The Nationalist Movement Party's nominee, Sabahattin Cakmakoglu, got 71 votes and the Democratic Left Party's candidate, Tayfun Icli, received 14 votes. 446 votes were cast overall, and 24 ballots were blank.
Gul is expected to prevail in the third round on Tuesday, when only a simple majority is needed. The main opposition Republican People's Party has boycotted the proceedings. It is sharply criticising the other opposition parties for their participation, which has enabled the required parliamentary quorum to be met.

Albania is preparing to issue new driving licenses that will meet EU criteria, the country's transport and telecommunications ministry has announced. Officials hope they will help Albanian drivers travel move easily in foreign countries, including the members of the European bloc. 
The new documents will have 20 safety elements, including description of eye colour and blood type as well as fingerprint information. The existing driving licenses will also be used until the process of replacing them is complete, according to ministry sources. 
Citizens wishing to obtain the new ones can present the required documentation at their regional police departments. Most will receive their licenses within five days. 
A Hungarian company, Bull Hungary Ltd, was contracted by the Albanian government to implement the new licenses. Hungarian Ambassador Sandor Szabo, who assisted in the signing of the contract earlier this year, said the initiative is a positive step for Albania and also for Hungarians seeking a greater investment role in the country. 
For Albanians, one major benefit will be enhanced freedom of movement, as their licenses will be recognised by the EU member states. At present, drivers are subject to onerous limits, such as being double-checked at borders. 
The license initiative is seen as a major step towards having these restrictions lifted.

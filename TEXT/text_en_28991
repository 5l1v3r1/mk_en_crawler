ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor and visiting UN war crimes tribunal President Patrick Robinson agreed on Tuesday (July 6th) that justice will not prevail unless the two remaining war crimes fugitives -- Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic -- are arrested and brought to justice. Robinson also said that the final take on a country's co-operation with the tribunal depends on the assessment of chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz. In Zagreb, Robinson also met with Supreme Court President Branko Hrvatin to discuss work related to war crimes cases and issues related to the UN tribunal's legacy. Robinson wraps up his three-day visit to Croatia on Wednesday. (HINA, HRT, Nova TV, Radio Free Europe - 06/07/10)

ATHENS, Greece -- Farmers vowed to press ahead with road and border blockades for a second week after talks Monday (January 26th) with Agriculture Minister Sotiris Hatzigakis failed to satisfy their demands. At the meeting, farmers' representatives rejected a 500m-euro aid package, which Hatzigakis indicated was the government's final offer.
Roads and borders remain in chaos for the ninth consecutive day Tuesday as protesters continue blocking the main highways and crossings at the borders with Bulgaria, Macedonia and Turkey. Blockades have paralysed freight traffic, as protesters are allowing only perishable goods and medical supplies through. Bulgaria is seeking "urgent help" from the EU to help reopen border crossings with Greece and wants compensation for losses it is incurring.

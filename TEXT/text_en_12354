BUCHAREST, Romania -- The head of the European Commission delegation to Bucharest, Jonathan Scheele, met with Romanian Foreign Minister Razvan Mihai Ungureanu on Tuesday (11 January) and urged the new Romanian government to decisively tackle corruption. Scheele also backed President Traian Basescu's view that corruption and poverty are linked.
Basescu, meanwhile, visited the interior ministry Tuesday -- his second visit in as many weeks. He demanded urgent measures be taken there, including changes in top personnel. (Nine o'clock, Rompres - 12/01/05; Mediafax - 11/01/05)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The senior member of the ruling coalition, the Democratic Party (DS), rejects the possibility of early elections coming any time soon. DS Vice-President Dusan Petrovic said on Sunday (May 10th) the party won't be making any "unreasonable decisions that would drag the country into an election process". He said the DS's main priority now is to guarantee the country overcomes the economic crisis as painlessly as possible. Political stability, he said, is a great advantage in view of the crisis. Petrovic also stressed that while there is no formal initiative to change the constitution, the DS's leader -- President Boris Tadic -- wants to initiate a public debate on the issue. His proposals include reducing the number of parliamentary members from 250 to 150. (Tanjug, Blic, B92, Beta - 10/05/09)

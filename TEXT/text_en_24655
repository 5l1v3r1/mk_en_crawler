ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government will accept EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn's latest proposal on resolving the border conflict with Slovenia, leaders decided during a high-level meeting Tuesday (May 5th). Rehn suggests that a five-member panel of arbitrators decide the issue. Croatia and Slovenia would jointly pick three members, and each of them will propose one more. Should they fail to agree on the first three, the International Court of Justice will appoint them.
Slovenian Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar on Tuesday rejected local media reports suggesting that Slovenia will reject Rehn's plan. He particularly criticised speculation that the proposal amounts to an ultimatum directed at Slovenia, which has blocked Croatia's EU accession bid over the border dispute.

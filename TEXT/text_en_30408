SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Lawmakers from the ethnic Albanian junior coalition partner Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) failed to appear on Thursday (March 17th) at the parliamentary session and did not attend debates in the parliamentary commissions. The ruling VMRO-DPMNE said it respects the decision of its coalition partner and voiced willingness to sit at the table to discuss all issues. DUI sources quoted by media said one of the reasons behind the boycott is the appointment of Dimitar Bogov as the new National Bank governor, without prior consultations with the party. After a meeting of the DUI presidency, leader Ali Ahmeti said that his party will not leave the ruling coalition. (Alsat M, Makfax, Kanal 5 - 17/03/11)

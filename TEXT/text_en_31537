ROME, Italy -- Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase represented his Social Democratic Party (PSD) at the International Socialist Council in Rome on Monday (20 January). He is lobbying for PSD's admission to the organisation, possibly this summer, at the next congress in Brazil. In his speech to the forum, Nastase described the situation in Southeast Europe as rapidly improving. He cited progress countries made towards integration with NATO and the EU as major achievements last year. (Rompres, Nine o' Clock - 21/01/03)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE plans to submit a no confidence motion against the government to parliament Wednesday (15 September). VMRO-DPMNE says the ruling coalition -- consisting of the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia and the Democratic Union for Integration -- has delayed strategic reforms, causing a decline in industrial production and a deteriorated economic situation.

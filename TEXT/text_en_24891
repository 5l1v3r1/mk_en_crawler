SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- During an official visit to BiH on Monday (December 1st), Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said his country plans to apply for EU candidacy this month. "I am sure negotiations will close at the end of the French presidency of the EU, and we expect a positive decision that will allow us to present our candidacy by the end of 2008," Djukanovic said after a meeting with Nikola Spiric, his BiH counterpart. At a news conference later, Spiric said there are no open issues between the two countries but added that co-operation should grow in all sectors. Representatives of the two governments signed four agreements during Djukanovic's visit -- for scientific and technical co-operation, co-operation in culture and education and repatriation of illegal immigrants.

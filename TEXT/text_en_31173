BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Prime Minister Victor Orban says the Balkans as a region is less tranquil than they seem. Hungary assumes the rotating EU presidency on January 1st and Orban said on Thursday (December 2nd) that wrapping up accession talks with Croatia will be a priority early next year. "If Zagreb fails to join the EU, the rest of the Balkan countries will also be deprived of a European perspective," Orban warned. He also stressed the importance of Bulgaria and Romania's accession to the so-called Schengen zone. (MIA, MTI - 03/12/10)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said on Wednesday (May 14th) that new measures Italy plans to take against illegal immigration will not affect EU citizens. That assessment followed what he described as a "positive" telephone conversation with Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini. "[Frattini] informed me that the series of measures regarding immigration that the Italian authorities are preparing are aimed at citizens of countries that are not members of the EU," Tariceanu said. Bucharest is concerned that the initiatives primarily would target Romanian nationals, following a series of high-profile crimes. On Monday, Tariceanu asked Interior Minister Cristian David to visit Rome "urgently" to discuss measures planned by Silvio Berlusconi's government.

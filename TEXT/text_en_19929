VIENNA, Austria -- Following a third round of direct talks on Kosovo's future status mediated by US, EU and Russian envoys in Vienna on Monday (October 22nd), Serbian and Kosovo Albanian negotiators have mixed views on prospects for compromise. Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said the negotiations, while very difficult, appeared to be moving towards a compromise. But Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku reiterated that Belgrade's offer of wide autonomy for Kosovo is unacceptable. "We are just too far apart," Ceku said.
The troika announced that the two sides will meet again in two weeks. The envoys urged Belgrade and Pristina to consider their 14-point proposal, which they say is a potential basis for continued work and a possible breakthrough.

THE HAGUE, the Netherlands -- Former Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) officer Veselin Sljivancanin, who was convicted of war crimes committed in Croatia in 1991, will serve his 17-year prison sentence in Slovakia, media reported on Friday (December 18th). Slovak Justice Minister Viera Petrikova confirmed that her country has accepted The Hague war crimes tribunal's request regarding Sljivancanin, but added it still requires approval by a domestic court. In May, the Hague tribunal's Appeals Chamber ruled that Sljivancanin in effect enabled the 1991 massacre of 194 Croatian prisoners of war and more than tripled his initial sentence from five to 17 years.

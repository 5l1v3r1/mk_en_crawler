ANKARA, Turkey -- During its closed-door session on Friday (February 23rd), the National Security Council reportedly supported the idea of launching contacts with Kurdish leaders in northern Iraq, where Turkey believes members of the terrorist group Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) have bases. Press reports Saturday suggested those attending the meeting agreed that boosting political and diplomatic efforts could contribute to reducing tensions in the border area. 
Also at the weekend, Turkish police detained three Kurdish officials in the southeast cities of Van and Diyarbakir. The three -- members of the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party -- were accused of making comments that reportedly threatened stability in Turkey. One of them, Hilmi Aydogdu, was quoted in several newspapers as saying that the country's 20 million Kurds would consider any attack on the Iraqi oil town of Kirkuk as an attack against them.

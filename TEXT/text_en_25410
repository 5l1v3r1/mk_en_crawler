BELGRADE, Serbia -- Representatives of the European Commission (EC) and European Parliament (EP) told Serbian authorities on Monday (November 23rd) that they should consult with the EC before applying for EU membership. According to the EP Rapporteur for Serbia Jelko Kacin, Belgrade should not hurry to submit its application. EC Director for the Western Balkans Pierre Mirel agreed, adding it would not be possible for the bloc to discuss Serbia's application as long as its interim trade agreement remains frozen. He says the agreement could be unblocked if UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz gives a positive assessment of Belgrade's co-operation in a progress report next month. Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic reaffirmed that his country is co-operating fully with the tribunal and voiced expectation that the interim agreement could be implemented in early December.

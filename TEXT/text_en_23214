BELGRADE, Serbia -- Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic said on Monday (June 30th) he thinks Serbia could obtain EU candidate status at the Union summit that begins on December 11th. At a press conference, Djelic said he was basing his prediction on the fact that the pro-European coalition led by President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party will have a majority in the new cabinet, which may lead to a more clearly expressed EU integration policy. He added he expects the EU to remove entry visas for Serbian tourists and for short business visits by the end of the year. 
Meanwhile, local media continue to report that the formation of a new cabinet is very close, suggesting that a vote of confidence could occur on Friday. (Blic, Vecernji Novosti, Danas - 01/07/08)

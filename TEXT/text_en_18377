SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Thousands of Muslims who survived the Srebrenica massacre gathered in Sarajevo on Monday (June 11th) to demand autonomy for the area, the scene of Europe's worst post World War II atrocity in the summer of 1995. The protesters want Srebrenica to receive the status of an autonomous district, outside of the control of Republika Srpska, which they view as the product of genocide. The demonstrators insist that their secession demand be met by the 12th anniversary of the massacre, on July 11th.
In other news Monday, the UN war crimes tribunal announced that it has transferred a tenth case to the special war crimes chamber in Sarajevo. Milorad Trbic will stand trial in his own country on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and violation of the laws or customs of war for his alleged role in the Srebrenica massacre. He was deputy chief of security of the Zvornik Brigade and commanded a company of military police. (Reuters, AP, BBC, UN press release, VoA, AFP, RTRS, Fena, PBS - 12/06/07; DW, Reuters - 11/06/07)

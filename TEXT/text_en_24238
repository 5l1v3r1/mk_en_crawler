LUXEMBOURG, Luxembourg -- EU foreign ministers are expected to discuss whether to lift visa requirements for Western Balkan countries that have met the necessary conditions at a meeting Monday (June 15th). At least some of the countries are expected to be placed on the so-called White Schengen List, though media reports speculate that others will be left off due to insufficient progress. The decision will be announced at a press conference after the talks. (A1, MIA, B92, Tanjug - 14/06/09)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Foreign Minister Antonio Miloshoski said on Friday (April 20th) that he would gladly meet with Greek counterpart Dora Bakoyannis in Skopje, insisting the two countries should finally reach some sort of compromise in their longstanding name dispute. Greece refuses to acknowledge Macedonia's constitutional name for historical reasons. "Macedonia and Greece are two neighbouring countries and we would be pleased to â¦ talk about co-operation in all fields, especially the economy," Miloshoski was quoted as saying.

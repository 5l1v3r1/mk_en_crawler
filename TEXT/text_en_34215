SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg moved on Tuesday (8 July) to replace the leaders of his party's parliamentary faction. Plamen Panayotov, the Simeon II National Movement's (SNM) floor leader, was replaced by Stanimir Ilchev, chairman of parliament's foreign policy, defence and security commission. The floor leader is the most influential official in the party after Saxe-Coburg, and has a say in the adoption of legislation and the appointment of senior government officials. Two outspoken members of a dissident faction inside the party were elected to the leadership of the parliamentary group. The changes were seen as an attempt to improve the image of the SNM, which has seen a drop in popularity during the two years it has been in power.
Saxe-Coburg also announced Tuesday that he is prepared to make cabinet changes before the start of parliament's summer recess later this month, saying he may offer Panayotov a ministerial position. (Dnevnik, Trud, 24 Chassa, Sega, Pari - 09/07/03; BTA, BNT, BNR, bTV, AFP, Nova TV - 08/07/03)

NEW YORK, United States -- In a report to the UN Security Council on Tuesday (June 5th), Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders to resume talks on reunification. He insisted that the July 2006 accord for two-tier negotiations -- one tackling everyday issues to build confidence, and the other dealing with more serious political disputes including territorial and power-sharing arrangements in a federal state -- should be implemented. He also proposed another six-month extension of the UN peacekeeping mission in Cyprus. (AP, DPA, Turkishpress.com - 06/06/07)

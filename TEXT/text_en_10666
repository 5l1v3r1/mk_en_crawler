SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The International Crisis Group (ICG) has reportedly called on the EU to consider a reserve plan in case the 7 November referendum in Macedonia succeeds and the country's new decentralisation laws are rejected. According to reports in the Skopje press Thursday (9 September), the ICG sent a letter to EU security chief Javier Solana and the chairman of the EU Council of Ministers, Dutch Foreign Minister Bernard Bot, noting that implementation of the Ohrid Peace Accords would suffer a significant delay because of the referendum and that Brussels should have an alternative plan. 
Meanwhile, Macedonian Prime Minister Hari Kostov marked his first 100 days in office Wednesday, acknowledging some delays in the government's economic reforms. He blamed most of them on the three-month debate over the decentralisation laws. (Utrinski Vesnik, Dnevnik - 09/09/04; A1 TV - 08/09/04)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said on Tuesday (20 September) that he plans to initiate consultations on important EU issues with the leaders of parliamentary parties. In particular, he will ask them to negotiate a solution to end a parliamentary stalemate caused by rows between the ruling majority and opposition over the replacement of the two chambers' speakers. Tariceanu says the conflict has delayed the passage of some important EU-related reforms.

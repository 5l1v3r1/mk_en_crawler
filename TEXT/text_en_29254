TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi urged the UN General Assembly on Friday (September 3rd) not to back Serbia's draft resolution on Kosovo at the upcoming session in New York and to instead recognise Pristina's independence. In a message to UN member states, he highlighted the significance of Kosovo's independence and the need for its recognition after the International Court of Justice's July ruling that Kosovo's independence declaration did not violate international law. He said that backing Serbia's document would "negatively affect" peace and stability in the Balkans.
On Friday, the Kosovo Foreign Ministry announced that Honduras had recognised Kosovo as an independent state, the 70th country to do so. (AP, Radio Free Europe - 03/09/10)

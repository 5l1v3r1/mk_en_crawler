BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Emil Boc of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on Monday (February 1st) briefed the Senate on the government's priorities, including laws on fiscal responsibility and education, as well as completing the Civil Proceedings and Penal Proceedings Code. Boc wants the fiscal responsibility measure approved by the end of March. He said the law on education would transform the current school system from "quantity to competency". Another priority is strengthening the electoral system, particularly the way parliamentary seats are apportioned when no candidate wins more than 50% of the votes.

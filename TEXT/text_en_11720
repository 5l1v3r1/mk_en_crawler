TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament on Thursday (17 February) re-elected Ermir Dobjani as the country's ombudsman. Dobjani, whose first term expired on Wednesday, received overwhelming support both from members of the ruling Socialist Party (SP) and from the major opposition Democratic Party (DP). Besnik Dervishi, the only other candidate for the post, withdrew from the race. 
In other news, the SP and the DP are continuing to discuss election-related legislation. The SP is expected to unveil its latest proposal on 3 March. The DP has signalled it favours one from the OSCE, which is mediating the talks. (Albanian Daily News - 18/02/05)

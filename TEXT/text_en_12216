BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- International Community High Representative to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Paddy Ashdown returns to Belgrade on Monday (11 April) to discuss co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. Ashdown will meet with Serbian President Boris Tadic, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic and Patriarch Pavle of the Serbian Orthodox Church. His office says he will again request intensified co-operation, as chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte still maintains that most of the 14 indictees who remain at large are hiding either in Serbia or in the BiH Serb entity, Republika Srpska.

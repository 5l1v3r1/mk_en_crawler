ZAGREB, Croatia -- Former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader was hospitalised in serious condition late on Thursday (August 6th), Health Minister Darko Milinovic announced on Friday. According to Milinovic, Sanader is suffering from a lung infection and high temperature. Local media could not confirm the condition as journalists are not allowed in the clinic where he is hospitalised. Sanader resigned as prime minister last July but stated explicitly the move was not prompted by health problems. (HTV, HRT, Hina, DPA, RIA Novosti - 07/08/09)

ATHENS, Greece -- A moderate quake measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale rattled central Greece early Thursday (June 26th) but caused no injuries or damage, authorities said. Its epicentre was between Agios Konstantinos and Kamena Vourla in the central region of Phtiotida, about 110km north of Athens. 
An earthquake measuring 5.0 rattled central Albania, northwest of Durres, late Wednesday but likewise caused no damage or injuries.
Also Wednesday, a large forest fire erupted in the outskirts of Athens, causing blackouts in the capital and covering some parts of the city with smoke. The fire started in the forest area of Glyka Nera near Athens and spread quickly across the Hymettos Mountains with the help of strong winds. About 200 firefighters, backed by air support, managed to bring it under control several hours later.

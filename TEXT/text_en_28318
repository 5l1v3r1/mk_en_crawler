ATHENS, Greece -- The UN agency for refugees urged Greece on Friday (October 15th) to improve conditions at detention centres holding illegal immigrants at the Greek-Turkish border. After a visit to facilities near the Evros River, an UNHCR team deplored the lack of hygiene and lack of space. "Men, women and children are crammed together," the agency said. It also recommended that authorities provide social, medical and psychological care, as well as interpreters. More than 23,000 people were caught illegally crossing the border with Turkey in the first eight months of this year. (eKathimerini - 16/10/10; MIA, AP, AFP - 15/10/10)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Kosovo institutions are asking the EU and the United States to act as observers during the December 12th snap elections. Acting President Jakup Krasniqi addressed a letter to EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, EU member states and United States on Wednesday (November 3rd) requested international observers and briefed Ashton on fast-moving political developments in Kosovo that prompted the need for elections in December rather than in February. The Central Elections Commission announced on Wednesday that the new timetable allows only ten days of campaigning. (RTK, Kohavision, Telegrafi - 03/11/10)

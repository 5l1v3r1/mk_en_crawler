SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A three-day technical conference jointly organised by the Office of the High Representative of the international community in BiH and the UN war crimes tribunal opened in Sarajevo on Monday (13 January). Tribunal President Claude Jorda and chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte are attending. The conference is focusing on ways to develop BiH's capacity to prosecute war crimes cases not tried at The Hague.
A couple of related notes: the international community's High Representative, Paddy Ashdown, said in an exclusive interview published in Tuesday's <I> Dnevni Avaz</I> that he does not rule out sanctions against Republika Srpska if its leaders continue to refuse to help find indictee Radovan Karadzic. Meanwhile, at The Hague, the trial of Slobodan Milosevic was delayed again Monday for health reasons. Milosevic complained of a fever and flu symptoms.

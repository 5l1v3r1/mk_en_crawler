SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The right-wing opposition party Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) plans to propose a plan for Bulgaria's entry into NATO, ensuring political consensus throughout the process. That was the message delivered in Wednesday's (4 December) meeting between UDF leader Nadezhda Mihailova and US Ambassador to Bulgaria James Pardew. Political consensus will facilitate and accelerate the process of meeting criteria for membership, Mihailova said. UDF will also support a proposal to amend the constitution so that the Council of Ministers would decide on NATO requests for Bulgarian troops or passage through Bulgarian territory. Currently, such decisions rest with parliament. (bTV - 05/12/02; BTA, Mediapool - 04/12/02)

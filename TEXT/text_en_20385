PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci says Kosovo citizens will have their new passports and other identification documents by this summer. The new passport design, blue with Kosovo's map in the middle, was first presented at a government meeting Thursday (March 13th). The cabinet also approved the draft law on new personal documents, including drivers' licenses, and discussed preparations for an upcoming donors' conference in Brussels. 
Also on Thursday, parliament adopted ten fast-tracked measures, which now await approval by UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker. They include laws on foreign affairs, national security, community rights, and co-operation with the EU's new EULEX law enforcement mission. Mission chief Yves de Kermabon arrived in Pristina on Thursday and said deployment plans are proceeding. (Zeri, KohaDitore, Lajm, Express - 14/03/08; KTV, RTK, AFP, B92, Balkan Insight - 13/03/08)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO's HQ in Sarajevo backs the measures imposed by High Representative Paddy Ashdown against Republika Srpska authorities, NATO spokesman Dwight Mood said in Sarajevo on Tuesday (21 December). Mood reiterated that BiH could not join the Partnership for Peace programme until local institutions demonstrate progress in co-operating with the UN war crimes tribunal, including the arrest and extradition of indictees to The Hague. 
Also Tuesday, US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney urged EU member states to consider sanctions against two Bosnian Serb parties -- the national Serb Democratic Party and the Party for Democratic Progress. Last week, Washington imposed travel bans on leaders of the two parties.
In other news Tuesday, EUFOR announced that its troops last week discovered two illegal arms stashes in northeast BiH -- in Zivinice and Han Pogled. The weapons will be destroyed. (Nezavisne novine, Dnevni avaz - 22/12/04; Fena, PBS BiH, NTV Hayat - 21/12/04)

NEW YORK, United States -- Serbs in Kosovo face more infringments on their rights than any other minority in Europe, Serbia-Montenegrin Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic claimed Thursday (15 September) in a speech to the UN General Assembly. He went on to say that the future European status of Kosovo depends on whether the rights guaranteed by the UN Charter are respected.
In other news, the local self-government ministers of Serbia and Kosovo, Zoran Loncar and Lutfi Haziri, are meeting in Vienna on Friday to discuss reforms. The Serbian delegation is expected to insist on issues related to decentralisation and refugee return, while the Kosovo delegation will seek the return of property records seized by Serbian authorities after the UN began administering the province.

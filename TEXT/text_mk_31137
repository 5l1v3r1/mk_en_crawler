BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Bosniak club in Republika Srpska's (RS) Council of Peoples blocked the appointment of the new entity's government on Tuesday (January 4th), claiming their vital national interests were not respected. None of the six vital institutions in RS -- parliament, the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, the prosecutor's office, Council of Peoples or the government -- is headed by a Bosniak. They argue this is in violation of the constitution, which guarantees representation by constituent peoples. The issue will be discussed first by a joint committee of parliament and the Council of Peoples. Should that lead to no agreement, the matter will be brought before the Constitutional Court.

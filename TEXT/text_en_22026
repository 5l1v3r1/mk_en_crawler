TIRANA, Albania -- Authorities started issuing personal certificates to Albanian citizens through a computerised system in civil offices throughout the country. At a ceremony Thursday (August 14th), Prime Minister Sali Berisha described the issuing of new electronic certificates as one of the most important reforms his government has implemented. The OSCE representative in Albania, Robert Bosch, agreed that it is key. The modernisation of administrative services has been a long-standing issue in the debate between the opposition and the government regarding the country's electoral system.

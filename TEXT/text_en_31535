SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The international community's High Representative, Paddy Ashdown, said Monday (20 January) that the only option for BiH is economic reform, adding that trade unions would be a major partner in this process. Ashdown spoke after talks in Sarajevo with the presidents of the two entities' unions - the Federation of BiH's Edhem Biber and Republika Srpska's Cedo Volas. He also said that the first phase of reform would be difficult, and that it should include the establishment of a single customs administration and introduction of a VAT at the state level.

LONDON, Great Britain -- Amnesty International urged Serbian authorities on Thursday (February 24th) to "redouble their efforts" to bring to justice all those guilty of killing Kosovo Albanians and the subsequent cover-up of the crimes. According to Nicola Duckworth, head of the organisation's Europe and Central Asia Programme, authorities in Belgrade should provide more support to prosecutors, given the large number of missing Kosovo Albanian victims of the 1999 conflict. Their relatives "deserve justice and must be told of the fate and whereabouts of their family members", Duckworth said. His statement followed The Hague war crimes tribunal sentencing former Serb police officer Vlastimir Djordjevic to 27 years in prison for atrocities committed against Kosovo Albanians.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Culture Minister Ertugrul Gunay says Turkey plans to re-open the Greek Orthodox Seminary on the island of Heybeliada -- Halki in Greek -- off Istanbul, nearly four decades after it was shut down. He said on Sunday (June 28th) "The seminary does not currently fit into our university system, but another formula will be worked out. [â€¦] There is no political problem." The seminary, the only facility the Eastern Orthodox Church had to train clergy in Turkey, was closed in 1971 after legislation was adopted that brought higher education institutions under state control. Greece and the EU have long demanded Halki reopen, for Turkey to demonstrate it respects the rights of its Christian minority. (Vatan - 29/06/09; Milliyet, Hurriyet - 28/06/09)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission imposed a ban Monday (November 5th) on the export of dairy products and meat, as well as on the transport of animals, from southern Cyprus due to known cases of foot-and-mouth disease on the island. The slaughter of animals was also largely banned. Approximately 300 sheep and goats were killed on Monday in a village in southeastern Cyprus after cases of foot and mouth were discovered at two farms.

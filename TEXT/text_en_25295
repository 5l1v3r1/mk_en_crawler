PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX believes that a "minimum of co-ordination" with Belgrade is necessary to deal with cross-border crime that affects the entire Union, EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon told AFP on Sunday (September 27th). He added that the smuggling of people, drugs, weapons, oil and tobacco has intensified between Serb-dominated northern Kosovo and Serbia. According to de Kermabon, EULEX's recent police co-operation deal with Belgrade is just a "little technical agreement" aimed at fighting crime in the north, where Serbs reject Kosovo authorities and prefer to be ruled by Serbia. "If we want to make any progress in north Kosovo, it should be done with minimum co-ordination with Serbian authorities," de Kermabon said. He added that there was "a misunderstanding" in Pristina as far as the technical agreement with Belgrade is concerned. (Express, Zeri - 28/09/09; AFP - 27/09/09)

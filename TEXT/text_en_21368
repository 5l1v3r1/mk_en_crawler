THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic will make his first appearance Thursday (July 31st) before The Hague war crimes tribunal to answer charges for atrocities committed during the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Judge Alphonse Orie will read the indictment and ask the defendant to enter a plea. Karadzic may choose to delay it and will have the opportunity to address the judge on issues such as the conditions of his detention and arrest. 
Chief war crimes prosecutor Serge Brammertz said the start of Karadzic's trial may be delayed for months given its complexity. Both the prosecution and defence teams will need time to prepare their cases, he said. Brammertz added that in the event of former Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic's arrest, his office will look into integrating the two indictments.
Meanwhile, a group of Greek lawyers announced plans to visit Karadzic in The Hague to offer to help him formulate his defence, the Athens news agency ANA-MPA reported on Wednesday. Karadzic plans to represent himself during the proceedings. 
In Brussels, the European Commission welcomed Karadzic's extradition, describing it as evidence that the new Serbian government "is involved in full co-operation" with The Hague tribunal and the EU.

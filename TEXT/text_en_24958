ZAGREB, Croatia -- The State Attorney Office on Tuesday (March 31st) accused an 86-year-old former member of the Yugoslav People's Army of orchestrating the murders of thousands of people after World War II. Martina Mihordin, spokeswoman of the Attorney's Office, demanded the arrest and investigation of Simo Dubajic, a Serbian national who was a major in the army, for war crimes against prisoners of war and for crimes against humanity. Dubajic is suspected of ordering the murders of around 13,000 people, most of them pro-Nazi Croatian soldiers, in a three-week period between May 16th and June 5th 1945. The murders took place near Kocevski Rog, Slovenia. (AP, HRT - 31/03/09)

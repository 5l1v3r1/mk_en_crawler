SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Peace Implementation Council (PIC) wraps up two days of meetings on Friday (24 June), focusing on BiH's progress on the road to EU accession. According to a press release from the Office of the High Representative, the political directors of the PIC steering board are addressing the difficulties caused by the remaining barriers -- specifically, the failure to agree on needed police reform. Officials are also discussing the challenge of reviving BiH's economy, reducing poverty and creating a more effective and efficient government. BiH Council of Ministers Chairman Adnan Terzic says he will present a plan aimed at launching negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement by the 10th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accord.
In other news, Terzic was in Budapest on Thursday where he met with Hungarian counterpart Ferenc Gyurcsany.

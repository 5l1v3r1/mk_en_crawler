SOFIA, Bulgaria -- In a phone conversation Thursday (December 21st), Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov and US counterpart George W. Bush discussed the death sentences handed down to five Bulgarian nurses in Libya this week. Bush reportedly promised that the United States would continue to support Bulgaria's efforts to resolve the case. The nurses and a Palestinian doctor, in a retrial of their case, were again sentenced to death on charges they intentionally infected over 400 Libyan children with HIV at a Benghazi hospital. The court refused to hear from independent experts who could have cleared the defendants. (24 Chasa, Trud, Sega, Dnevnik - 22/12/06; News.bg, AFP - 21/12/06)

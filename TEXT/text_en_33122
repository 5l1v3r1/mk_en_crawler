ATHENS, Greece -- Two senior Greek officials resigned on Wednesday (18 June) following media reports that they had engaged in major stock deals. Stephanos Manikas, a minister without portfolio, and Michalis Neonakis, a high-ranking Socialist Party official, were found to have traded shares worth 60m euros between 1998 and 2000. The issue is sensitive in Greece because the timing of the deals coincides with the collapse of the local stock market. A government spokesman explained that the resignations were made on ethical grounds and a stock market inquiry had found no evidence of any wrongdoing. Manikas and Neonakis will keep their seats in Parliament until the 2004 elections. (AFP, MPA - 18/06/03)

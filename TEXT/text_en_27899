NEW YORK, United Nations -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Wednesday (May 19th) expressed hope that talks aimed at reunifying Cyprus will continue, yet acknowledged they can't last forever. In an interview with Anadolu news agency, Ban said that February statements by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- in support of the negotiations -- added momentum to the process. Ban said he was also encouraged by newly elected Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu's statements in support of the talks. Negotiations are expected to resume later this month.

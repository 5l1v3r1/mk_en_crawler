BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska Police Chief Dragomir Andan said Tuesday (10 May) that the 11 people responsible for the March 2004 terror attack on trains in Madrid may have fought in the BiH conflict years ago. Andan told a news conference in Banja Luka that intelligence information suggests foreign Islamic fighters who participated in the BiH conflict have been tied to subsequent international terrorism. Andan said at least 450 such fighters obtained BiH citizenship. Efforts are under way to locate them. (RTRS, PBS BiH, Fena, NTV Hayat - 10/05/05)

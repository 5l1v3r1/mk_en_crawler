TIRANA, Albania -- Kosovo's future status was the focus of a meeting between Albanian President Alfred Moisiu and Macedonian counterpart Branko Crvenkovski in Tirana Wednesday (16 November). During a joint news conference afterwards, Crvenkovski said his country's stance is identical to that of the EU, adding that Skopje would back any solution reached during the upcoming status negotiations. Moisiu, meanwhile, voiced support for Kosovo independence, saying such an outcome was in line with the will of most of the province's people.
In other news Wednesday, an investigative judge with the Belgrade District Court said that indictments related to 1999 killings in Suva Reka, Kosovo likely would be filed by the end of this year. Five active members of the Serbian police are among the nine suspects arrested in late October. They were detained in connection with the murders of 48 ethnic Albanians in March 1999.

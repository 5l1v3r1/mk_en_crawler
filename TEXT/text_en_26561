ATHENS, Greece -- Dockers at the country's biggest port in Piraeus decided late Tuesday (November 10th) to suspend their strike, which started on October 1st, a day after the Chinese company Cosco was to take over a 35-year concession of the facility under an agreement signed last year. The decision came as a court in Piraeus ruled that the action, demanding the freezing of Cosco's concession contract, is illegal in a situation where there is no risk of job losses.
In other news, a group of around ten to 15 masked anarchists staged a rampage in Athens' centre on Tuesday. The anarchists, riding motorcycles, broke the windows of a bank office, an exchange office and a bar in the Exarchia neighbourhood. All of them managed to get away.

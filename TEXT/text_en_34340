BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian police reported on Sunday (26 October) that they found an arms cache in the south, near the border with Kosovo. About 30 automatic weapons, grenade launchers, hand grenades and ammunition were recovered from the village of Veliki Trnovac. Police say the arms were hidden by members of the self-proclaimed Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac when their organisation disbanded in 2001. (AFP, FoNet, Beta, BBC - 26/10/03)

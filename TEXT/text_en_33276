ZAGREB, Croatia -- Retired Gen Ante Gotovina recognises the UN war crimes tribunal and is ready to talk to its investigators, but only under certain conditions, according to the Zagreb weekly <I>Nacional</I>. On Monday (9 June), Managing Editor Ivo Pukanic disclosed some details of an interview -- the general's first public statement since the tribunal demanded his extradition two years ago. He said Gotovina wants to be interviewed by investigators in Zagreb, as was retired Gen Petar Stipetic. In response, the interior ministry said police would act in accordance with the terms of the international arrest warrant, adding that the ministry wants to talk to Pukanic about the circumstances surrounding Gotovina's interview. SFOR, meanwhile, conducted a series of raids Monday in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, where Gotovina is believed to be hiding, but did not find him.
In other news Monday, Croatia's Supreme Court rejected an extradition appeal by war crimes indictee Ivica Rajic, thus paving the way for his extradition to the UN tribunal in The Hague. He is charged in connection with the 1993 massacre of at least 16 Bosniaks in the village of Stupni Dol. (HRT1 TV, HINA, FENA, BBC, AP, B92, AFP, Reuters - 09/06/03)

MOGADISHU, Somalia/ANKARA, Turkey -- Somali pirates who held a Turkish cargo ship in captivity for almost three months, released it on Monday (October 5th) against a ransom and let its 23-member crew sail away. The amount of the ransom was not officially revealed though a pirate was quoted by Reuters as saying that they have agreed to accept $1.5 million. In early September, the pirates requested a ransom of $20 million. The Horizon-1, owned by Istanbul-based company Horizon, was seized on July 8th en route from Saudi Arabia to Jordan.

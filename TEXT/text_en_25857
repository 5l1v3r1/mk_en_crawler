TIRANA, Albania -- UN representative Philip Alston is investigating the death of a man who blew the whistle on illegal weapons trafficking. Alston met with Albania's Ombudsman Ermir Dobjani on Tuesday (February 16th) to discuss the case of Kosta Trebicka. The informant died in September 2008 under mysterious circumstances that investigators described as car accident. Trebicka was the whistle-blower in a complex case involving the United States and the sale of old Chinese ammunition. During his weeklong fact-finding mission, Alston will be travelling to the northern town of Shkodra to learn more about the case and to meet with officials from the interior and justice ministries, along with the General Prosecutor's s office.

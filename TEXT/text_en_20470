NICOSIA, Cyprus -- A military exercise that wraps up on Sunday (October 14th) in Cyprus has the government trading accusations with Ankara. On Thursday, Turkey's Foreign Ministry accused the Cypriot government of escalating tension on the island and threatening regional security by holding the wide-scale military maneuvers. On Friday, the Cypriot Foreign Ministry said Ankara's stance is unacceptable. "Each member of the international community has the inalienable right to carry out military defence exercises," the ministry said.
Also Friday, the Cypriot government criticised Syria's decision to launch a regular sea route with Northern Cyprus, describing it as unethical and in no way helping efforts aimed at settling differences between Nicosia and Damascus. Northern Cyprus is recognised only by Ankara. (Politis, Focus, CNA, Phileleftheros, The New Anatolian - 12/10/07)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Ten Bulgarian teenagers are confirmed dead and two are missing following a bus accident late Sunday (4 April) in Serbia-Montenegro. Another 36 high school students and the two bus drivers survived. According to initial police reports, a flat front tire caused the bus to plunge 50 metres into the gorge of the River Lim. The vehicle was almost immediately submerged in deep water with only its roof visible. The group was returning from a holiday in the Croatian town of Dubrovnik.

ATHENS, Greece -- Greece received its first enhanced F-4E aircraft Thursday (19 December). The Greek Air Force has launched a programme to modify 35 fighters of the F-4 series. The major contractors are multinational EADS and the Hellenic Aviation Industry, with the participation of Elbit Systems from Israel for part of the flying equipment. The project is part of the Greek government's programme to modernise its armed forces in line with NATO's fight against world terrorism. The programme should be implemented by the end of 2005.

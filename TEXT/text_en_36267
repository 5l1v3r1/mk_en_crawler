BUCHAREST, Romania -- Foreign investors in Romania plan to call for a higher sovereign credit rating, said Germany's representative of the Committee for Central and Eastern Europe, Klaus Mangold, on Saturday (29 May). The investors may even call on international financial institutions and the rating agencies themselves to boost the rating. Mangold said all obstacles should be removed to open the way to foreign investment. He added that foreign investors would strongly back Romania's accession to the EU in 2007. (Rompres - 29/05/04)

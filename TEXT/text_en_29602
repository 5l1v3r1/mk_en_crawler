PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government has undergone another reshuffle with Behgjet Pacolli's junior coalition partner New Kosovo Alliance (AKR) winning two more ministerial posts. At a meeting Wednesday (April 27th) with Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, Pacolli managed to secure establishing a Ministry for Diaspora, along with a future pick. The AKR, which threatened to break up the coalition if their demands were not met, now holds the posts of two deputy prime ministers, eight deputy ministers, and five ministers. The coalition partners agreed initially to give the presidency to Pacolli. But after the Constitutional Court ruled that election procedures in parliament had been violated, Pacolli pushed for alternative government posts.

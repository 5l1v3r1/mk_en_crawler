TALLINN, Estonia -- Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul told reporters during a visit to Estonia on Thursday (9 September) that he believes the EU's upcoming report on the country will be a positive one. The report, expected in October, will largely determine whether EU leaders decide to launch accession talks with Turkey. Gul argued that Ankara has made significant progress in carrying out democratic reforms and has passed the "critical line". He acknowledged that accession negotiations could take up to ten years, given the size of the country. (PA, AFP, NTV, CNN Turk - 09/09/04)

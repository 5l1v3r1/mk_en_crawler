WASHINGTON, United States -- Deputy State Department spokesman Philip Reeker told reporters Wednesday (2 October) that the US government supports fully the seven-point plan for Mitrovica proposed by UNMIK chief Michael Steiner. He added that the plan would help ease the "lingering antagonism" between Serb and ethnic Albanian residents there. As he unveiled his plan Tuesday, Steiner warned that security and development of the city were impossible without Serb participation in local government.
Marko Jaksic, a senior party member of the Serbian National Council, dismissed Steiner's plan Wednesday. He asserted that the plan was based on "precipitating and conditioning" and that the proposed decentralisation of Kosovo's administration would not favour the Serbs. He stressed that Kosovo Serbs demand a municipality in northern Mitrovica as well as in other parts of Kosovo where the Serbs form the majority. (FoNet - 03/10/02; AFP, B92, BBC, Tanjug - 02/10/02)

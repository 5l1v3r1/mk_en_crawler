PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- A man was killed in the Kosovo town of Pec on Wednesday (25 December) when his car exploded while he was driving it. A UN spokesman said an investigation was underway; no word yet on possible motives.
In neighbouring Macedonia, meanwhile, a powerful bomb went off near a high school in Kumanovo, killing one person and injuring at least four others, including a six-year-old girl. The explosive device had been planted in a rubbish container. Though a special anti-terror squad is investigating, NATO and OSCE envoys to Macedonia demanded an urgent meeting with the defence and interior ministers.

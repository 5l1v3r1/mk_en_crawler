ATHENS, Greece -- A law banning smoking in public places goes into effect on Wednesday (September 1st). The only exceptions will be casinos and music halls, which have until next June to comply, Health Minister Mariliza Xenoyannakopoulou announced on Monday. Smokers who violate the ban face fines of 50 to 500 euros, while owners of facilities could face fines of 500 to 10,000 euros. In case of repeated violations, they could lose their licenses. This marks the second attempt to impose the ban. The first one was launched by the previous government in July 2009, but its effect waned after early elections were scheduled several months later. It is estimated 40% of Greeks are smokers. (Ta Nea, AFP, ANA-MPA - 30/08/10)

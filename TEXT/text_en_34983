ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Simitis pointed out Wednesday (10 December) that a rift could develop among EU member states if debate on the European Constitution drags on too long. This was in response to comments by French and German officials who said they were not prepared to back the draft constitution at any cost, just for the sake of reaching an agreement. Simitis made the statement ahead of the EU summit in Brussels at the end of this week. (MPA, ANA - 10/12/03)

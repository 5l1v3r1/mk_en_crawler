SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov, speaking at a military parade on Tuesday (6 May), said the government should prevent further reductions in the size of the armed forces. However, Parvanov -- who is also the supreme commander-in-chief of the Bulgarian Armed Forces -- also said that he does not want to influence the conclusions of the strategic defence review, which began on 10 April. It reportedly may propose reduction of armed forces to 33,000, from the current level of 45,000. The report's findings will determine the country's military reform strategy over the next 20 to 30 years. (Dnevnik, Trud, 24 Chassa, Pari - 07/05/03; BTA - 06/05/03)

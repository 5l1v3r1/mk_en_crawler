ATHENS, Greece -- The Greek Parliament voted to allow the country's Muslims to build the first mosque in Athens since the end of Ottoman rule. There are several mosques in the city's old quarter, but they have been transformed into tourist attractions and are no longer places of worship. An attempt by the previous government to allow the construction of a mosque near the new international airport was abandoned due to strong opposition from residents in the area. The 200,000-strong Muslim community plans to raise the money for the current project and will not rely on foreign sponsors. (BBC - 18/07/06)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Mustafa Mujezinovic won approval Thursday (June 25th) of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina's (FBiH) parliament to become the entity's new prime minister. The vote was 62 to 13, with nine abstentions. "[My] top priority will be to fulfil the conditions for the signing of the stand-by arrangement with the IMF," Mujezinovic told lawmakers after his election. The IMF recently decided to postpone its decision on the 1.2 billion-euro stand-by loan for the country after FBiH failed to cut its social and welfare budget by 10%, as required. Mujezinovic replaces Nedzad Brankovic, who was charged with abuse of power in April and resigned a month ago. (RTRS, Fena, BHRT, AFP, Reuters - 25/06/09)

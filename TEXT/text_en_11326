SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria's Parliament failed to vote Tuesday (26 July) on the new cabinet proposed by Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) leader and Prime Minister-designate Sergey Stanishev, due to a lack of quorum. All representatives of centre and right-wing parties left the parliamentary hall shortly after the discussions on the new government composition started. They cited discontent with the way Parliamentary Speaker Georgi Pirinski led the session. The remaining 116 deputies from the BSP and its coalition partner, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, were unable to form a quorum and Pirinski suspended the session. It is unclear when the vote will take place. (BNT - 26/07/05)

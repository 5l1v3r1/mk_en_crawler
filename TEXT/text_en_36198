BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Harri Holkeri told reporters that there is no room for any debate on the partitioning of Kosovo, an idea put forward by Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica. "On the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 1244, these proposals are not on the table, but we are willing to listen to the ideas and views of the Serbian government," he said after talks Monday (8 March) with Kostunica in Belgrade. Holkeri added that he had sought clarification from the Serbian government on its call for "substantial autonomy for the Serb community in Kosovo". According to the UNMIK chief, Kostunica suggested a Swiss-like "cantonisation" or "partitioning into entities". (AFP, B92, BBC, Beta, Tanjug - 08/03/04)

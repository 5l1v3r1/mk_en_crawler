PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Police confirmed on Monday (11 September) that they had arrested 12 ethnic Albanians on charges of terrorism. According to the interior ministry, the group was planning to carry out a terrorist attack early on Sunday, hours before Montenegro's first general election as an independent state. The terrorist strike on religious and civil objects in the area, officials said, was aimed at "endangering the constitutional order and security situation in Montenegro, and provoking interethnic tensions". 
The suspects were described as ethnic Albanians from Montenegro and Kosovo. They allegedly were to be reinforced by former KLA guerrillas from Kosovo. Police are hunting for five other suspects, two of them US citizens of Balkan descent. (Pobjeda, Politika - 12/09/06; AFP, Tanjug - 11/09/06)

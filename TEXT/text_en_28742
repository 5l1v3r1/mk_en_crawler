PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The European Commission (EC) will have to soon open the visa liberalisation process with Pristina, European Parliament (EP) Rapporteur for Kosovo Ulrike Lunacek said on Monday (October 11th). Entry in the so-called white Schengen list would enable citizens to travel to the EU countries without visas. Otherwise, Lunacek said, Kosovo will remain a ghetto in the region, now that Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina are to be exempted from the visa regime soon. 
In other news Monday, the Ministry of European Integration and the European Commission Liaison Office (ECLO) launched an online platform that will make all EU donations transparent to the public. Kosovo Minister for European Integration Besim Beqaj described the platform as a model for countries in the region that will enable donor co-ordination and management. ECLO officials say it will provide the public the opportunity to view how donations in Kosovo are managed. Overseeing the platform is the ministry for European integration.

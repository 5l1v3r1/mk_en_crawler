PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Three Albanian citizens were convicted of 11 criminal charges, including trafficking, facilitation of prostitution, rape and forgery of documents on Thursday (21 July). In the course of the investigation, two Albanian women -- lured to Kosovo with false promises of legal work -- were rescued. Two of the defendants, Vladimir Ukaj and Robert Sylaj, were sentenced to 12 years each in prison. The third, Sabri Islami, received 10 years. The sentences were the harshest to be imposed in Kosovo to date. The investigation was the result of a joint effort by UNMIK, KFOR, Kosovo police, Prizren public prosecutors and the justice department. A court panel comprised of one Kosovo judge and two international judges handled the sentencing. (UN News Centre - 21/07/05)

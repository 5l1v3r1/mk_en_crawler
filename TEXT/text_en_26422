ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police detained 23 activists early Thursday (February 11th), protesting a project to turn an old street in downtown Zagreb into a housing and shopping area. The protesters blocked the access to the street with containers. The activists say the project will ruin the historic centre of the capital.

DAVOS, Switzerland -- In an address to the World Economic Forum on Friday (28 January), Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan said Turkey's membership in the EU would help achieve "reconciliation between civilisations" around the world. He cited the EU's common agricultural policy as the biggest challenge to Turkey's accession. While at Davos, Erdogan met with his Pakistani counterpart, Shaukat Aziz. They agreed to step up bilateral co-operation in fighting terrorism. 
In other news, the Turkish media reported Saturday that the new US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, will visit Turkey as part of a regional trip during the first half of February. Rice, formerly National Security Advisor, was confirmed in her new post last week. (Daily Times, Anadolu Agency, TurkishPress.com - 29/01/05; AFP - 28/01/05)

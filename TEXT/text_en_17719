BUCHAREST, Romania -- Sweltering heat continues to blanket Southeast Europe and is blamed for six more deaths in Romania, for a total of 15. In many areas, it was more than 40 degrees Centigrade at the weekend. There was more of the same in neighbouring Bulgaria where many cities, including Sofia, hit record temperatures. Meteorologists predict even hotter weather Monday and Tuesday. Greek authorities say at least 15 people have died of heat-related causes this year. 
In related news, Serbian Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac confirmed Sunday that the government has asked Bulgaria and Greece to help fight forest fires in central and eastern Serbia. However, he said officials are aware that both neighbours are battling similar problems and that Serbia might also turn to Germany, Austria or Russia, seeking additional planes and helicopters. The largest fire, spanning 500 hectares of forest in Stara Planina Mountain near Bulgaria, has been contained. Record high temperatures in the Balkans have sparked a series of wildfires across the region. (Blic, Danas - 23/07/07; B9, RTS, Tanjug, AP, AFP, Reuters, RFE/RL, BNR - 22/07/07)

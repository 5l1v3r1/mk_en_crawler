ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament starts discussing a no-confidence motion Friday (December 11th) against Transport and Infrastructure Minister Bozidar Kalmeta, at the request of the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP). The motion came shortly after the arrests last month of several high-ranking officials at Croatian Motorways, the largest highway operator in the country, for suspected fraud. The SDP says Kalmeta should also bear responsibility for any misconduct. Kalmeta denies all allegations and refuses to resign from his post. The senior ruling Croatian Democratic Union backs that stand. (HRT - 11/12/09; HINA, Nova TV, Javno - 10/12/09)

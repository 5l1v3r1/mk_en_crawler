WASHINGTON, United States -- The new government in Belgrade should be very much aware that its non co-operation on war crimes would have consequences, said US Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues Pierre-Richard Prosper, quoted by Belgrade-based B92 Radio on Tuesday (16 March). He stressed that non co-operation with the tribunal would affect the country's ties with NATO, the EU and the United States, as well as with the international community in general. "You're standing at the door. It's up to you whether you turn the key," said Prosper. (B92, BBC, Tanjug - 16/03/04)

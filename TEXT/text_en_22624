THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Prosecutors Wednesday (August 6th) appealed the acquittal handed down last month against former Macedonian Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski. Prosecutors want him found guilty of all counts, stemming from a police attack against an ethnic Albanian village in 2001. Boskovski's co-defendant, former police officer Johan Tarculovski, received 12 years in prison. The attack in Ljuboten is the only war crimes case in Macedonia being examined by the UN tribunal. Rampaging police officers killed seven ethnic Albanians, detained and brutally treated more than 100 and set at least 14 homes ablaze. It occurred during the conflict between ethnic Albanian guerrillas and government security forces. (Makfax, A1, Dnevnik, Vecer - 07/08/08; Mina - 06/08/08)

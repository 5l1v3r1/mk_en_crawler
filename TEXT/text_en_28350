ATHENS, Greece -- A powerful blast rocked the court building in Thessaloniki on Friday (May 14th), after a warning phoned into the ALTER TV channel headquarters. Police began evacuating the building but there were still people leaving when the bomb exploded. One injury is reported. Police believe this blast and one Thursday outside Athens' biggest prison facility, in Korydallos, may be linked. In that incident a warning was phoned into the newspaper Eleftherotypia. One injury was reported, due to broken glass. Investigators suspect the group Conspiracy Nuclei of Fire is responsible for both blasts.

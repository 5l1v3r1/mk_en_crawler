THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal on Monday (8 May) sentenced former Bosnian Croat militia commander Ivica Rajic to 12 years in prison for war crimes committed in the central BiH village of Stupni Dol in 1993. Rajic was convicted in relation to the deaths of 31 Bosniak civilians -- including women and children -- and the destruction of the village, as well as the detention and inhuman treatment of 250 Bosniaks in the town of Vares. In October, Rajic pleaded guilty to four of the ten charges against him, and is expected to testify for the prosecution in several other cases involving Bosnian Croat officials. 
In other news Monday, the Osijek regional court in Croatia sentenced Croat Serb Petar Mamula to four years and ten months. He was convicted of the 1991 torture and abuse of Croat civilians in Baranja. (ICTY Web site, HRT, AFP - 08/05/06)

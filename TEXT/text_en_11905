TIRANA, Albania -- Wrapping up a two-week visit to Tirana on Tuesday (17 May), an IMF mission called for the country to keep up the pace of reforms in the run-up to the 3 July parliamentary elections. The international community expects guarantees from political parties that they will not depart from the economic policy agreed on under the three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility programme, mission chief Julio Escolano said. The IMF praised Albania for encouraging high economic growth rates and pursuing "prudent fiscal and monetary policies". 
Also Tuesday, the Albanian Economy Ministry and the German Embassy in Tirana sealed three agreements, under which Germany will extend a total of 15.8m euros in loans to Albania for rebuilding and modernising the country's water and energy sectors. The funds will be allocated for the construction of a power transmission line between Albania and Montenegro, as well as upgrading the power supply network, water supply and sewerage system in the southeastern town of Korca.

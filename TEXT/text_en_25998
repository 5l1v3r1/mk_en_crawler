PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The European Commission (EC) progress report on the Western Balkans should not discourage anybody in Kosovo, since there is time for improvement, European officials concluded on Thursday (October 15th), during a debate organised by the Foreign Policy Club in Pristina. EC Director for the Western Balkans, Pierre Mirel, noted the shortcomings Kosovo authorities face and pointed out that without rule of law, it will be hard for the EU to act. 
Earlier on Thursday, Mirel met with Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and urged the government to move from strategies on paper to actual implementation. (RTK, Kohavision, TV21, Klan Kosova - 15/10/09)

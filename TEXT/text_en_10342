BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU foreign ministers have decided that accession talks with Turkey could begin in the second half of next year, according to press reports Tuesday (23 November), following the diplomats' gathering in Brussels the previous day. Although Ankara hoped talks would start in the first half of 2005, the EU foreign ministers reportedly agreed that in the first six months a "scrutinising period" will be finalised. (NTV - 23/11/04)

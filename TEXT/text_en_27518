BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government survived a no-confidence motion on Wednesday (October 27th) filed by the opposition. It had accused the cabinet of failing to deal with the economic crisis. Only 219 lawmakers voted against the cabinet, compared to 236 (50%+1 of all members of parliament) needed to bring it down. There were no votes in favour of the government, as ruling party lawmakers decided to abstain from voting. This was the second no-confidence vote that Prime Minister Emil Boc's government managed to survive. The first was in June.
As the voting was taking place, about 30,000 people joined an anti-government protest outside the parliament building. One group of demonstrators threw plastic bottles and stones at police, who used use tear gas to disperse them. Labour unions said there were provocateurs among the protestors, as they had earlier urged participants to abstain from violence. (AP, Xinhua, Mediafax, Reuters - 27/10/10)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Opposition parties Bulgarian Socialist Party and Movement for Rights and Freedoms, with the support of 76 lawmakers, launched the first no-confidence vote so far against the current government. The parties cited failures in health care policy as the main complaint. According to the constitution, debates should take place between three and seven days after the no-confidence vote has been submitted. The motion needs the support of more than half of the lawmakers, or at least 121 votes, to pass. (Dnevnik, BNT, BNR, BTA - 01/10/10)

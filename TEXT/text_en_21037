TIRANA, Albania -- An annual US State Department report on crime and money laundering sparked heated debate on Monday (March 3rd) among Albanian lawmakers. The report identifies Albania as a transit country for drugs from Central Asia to Western Europe, and says Albanian efforts to combat the problem are hampered by corruption, a lack of professionalism in interior affairs, an antiquated legal system, and the grey economy.
 Opposition MPs said this shows the government is "incapable of fighting narcotics trafficking and corruption" and has failed to keep its promises. In response, Deputy Prime Minister Gazmend Oketa said the opposition had misunderstood the findings, as the level of drug trafficking in Albania has declined in recent years. Minister of Interior Affairs Bujar Nishani said this one "is more positive compared with previous reports".
In other news Monday, Prime Minister Sali Berisha said identity cards and biometric passports being made for Albanian citizens are key government priorities. During a meeting of his Democratic Party parliamentary group, he vowed to make the documents more secure than those carried by citizens of EU member states.

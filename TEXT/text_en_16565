ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Police have arrested four men suspected of planning terrorist attacks for the al-Qaeda terrorist group. A raid in Istanbul's Bagcilar district produced papers detailing the construction of bombs, CDs with what was described as "organisational" material, a fake ID card, a rifle and a handgun. According to police, the four men were part of a group that chanted al-Qaeda slogans and hung posters supporting the terrorist group in Istanbul a day after coalition forces killed Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the top Qaeda terrorist in Iraq.
In other news, Elif Shafak, one of Turkey's best known writers, is due to stand trial on 21 September on charges of insulting the Turkish character. The author, due to give birth soon, had her request for a trial postponement rejected. She could go to prison for up to three years because one of the characters of her book "The Bastard of Istanbul" mentions the alleged genocide of Armenians during World War I.

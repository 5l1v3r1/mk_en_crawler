SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Finance Minister Plamen Oresharski offered an official apology Monday (October 8th) to teachers for a comment he made about weekend negotiations with their unions. He used the term "chit-chat", in an informal conversation with Education Minister Daniel Valchev that was caught on video. Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev quickly rejected a demand for the resignation of the two ministers. The teachers' strike has closed schools for more than two weeks.

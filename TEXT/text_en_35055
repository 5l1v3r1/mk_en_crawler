SOFIA, Bulgaria -- An early pullout of Bulgarian troops from Iraq could occur if security is established sooner than expected, Foreign Minister Solomon Passy said Sunday (27 June). If the situation in Iraq develops favourably, Bulgarian troops could return home before the end of 2005, he said. Defence Minister Nikolai Svinarov pointed out, however, that Monday's handover of power to Iraqi authorities -- two days earlier than scheduled -- would not end the mandate of Bulgarian troops in Iraq. He added that even the most optimistic scenarios envisage coalition forces remaining in Iraq at least until the end of 2005.
In other news Sunday, Bulgarian Regional and Public Works Minister Valentin Tserovski criticised an agreement between Bulgaria and Turkey on the Upper Arda project, which involves the construction of dam lakes and hydropower plants. Tserovski characterised the deal as ineffective. (BTA, BNR, Mediapool, BNT, Dnevnik - 27/06/04)

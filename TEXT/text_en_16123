BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian Agriculture Minister Ivana Dulic-Markovic, from G17 Plus, tendered her resignation on Thursday (15 June). Reportedly, the move aims to create legal conditions for Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica to officially accept her candidacy for the position of deputy prime minister. The parliament is likely to hold a confidence vote for Dulic-Markovic next week. The post of deputy prime minister has been vacant since the departure of Miroljub Labus, who resigned the same day the EU announced that negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement were put on hold.

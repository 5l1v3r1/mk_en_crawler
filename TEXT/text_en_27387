ZAGREB, Croatia -- Mladen Barisic, head of the Customs Administration and Finance Ministry, was detained on Wednesday (September 29th) in Zagreb. He is reportedly suspected of conspiracy to commit crime, illegal brokerage, and incitement to abuse his office in the so-called Fimi Media affair that enabled a local company to gain millions of kunas. The case stems from a 2007 government meeting at which directors of several public companies were allegedly urged to hire the Fimi Media company, owned by Barisic's friend, Nevenka Jurak, for PR and marketing jobs, without holding public tenders. Immediately after his arrest, the government relieved Barisic of all duties. A close associate of former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, he is also the former treasurer of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union party.

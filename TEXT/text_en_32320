BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO reportedly has drawn up plans to continue its mission to Macedonia. This is according to an anonymous alliance official in Brussels who says the EU is unprepared to take over supervision of refugees and co-ordinate the return of Macedonian security forces to regions formerly controlled by Albanian rebels. The EU had planned to take over when NATO's mandate expired on 15 December. Brussels officials say disagreements between Greece and Turkey have hindered formation of an EU rapid response force.

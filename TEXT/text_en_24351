TIRANA, Albania -- The OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) criticised on Saturday (July 11th) the vote counting process, following the June 28th parliamentary elections. In its second report on the elections, the ODIHR mission also criticised the delay in announcing results, saying it resulted in political tensions in some regions, a possible reference to Fieri, where the opposition Socialist Party disputes results.

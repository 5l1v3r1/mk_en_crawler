BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliament will hold an emergency session soon regarding the Kosovo status talks, the newspaper Danas reported on Monday (28 August), citing government sources. It said the session was being called in light of Saturday's bombing in Mitrovica, in which an ethnic Albanian teenager was implicated. The Serbian government has urged the international community to denounce the incident.
Controversial comments by UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari will also reportedly be discussed. The envoy was quoted last week as suggesting Serbia was "guilty as a nation" and might have to lose Kosovo as a result. He later clarified his remarks, saying that "every nation carries a burden for which it has to pay". While the new democratic leadership in Belgrade canât be blamed for the policies of former president Slobodan Milosevic in Kosovo, Ahtisaari said, "leaders in Belgrade must face a historic inheritance and accept responsibility for the past years". Serbia's negotiating team for the status talks was due to meet with Ahtisaari on Monday. (Danas, Tanjug, RTS - 28/08/06)

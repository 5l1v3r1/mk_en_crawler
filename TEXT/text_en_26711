THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Croatia presented arguments Monday (December 7th) in support of Kosovo's independence at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), becoming the only former Yugoslav country to provide an oral statement. Slovenia has submitted a written statement in support of Kosovo. Zagreb's representative at the hearings, Andreja Metelko-Zgombic, said removing Kosovo's autonomy was illegal under the former Yugoslav Constitution and that Kosovo has the right to self-determination.
Denmark's representative added that the declaration of independence of Kosovo in no way violated international law. Cyprus argued the opposite, insisting minorities don't have the right to self-determination. Cyprus considers Albanians in Kosovo as a minority in Serbia.
On Monday, China became the first permanent UN member to present its arguments at the ICJ. Beijing's representative said Kosovo's independence violates UN Security Council Resolution 1244 because the document mentions only substantial autonomy for Kosovo.

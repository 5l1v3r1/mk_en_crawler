PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The office of the EU Special Representative (EUSR) in Kosovo and the European Commission (EC) Liaison office may merge in the coming months, local media reported on Tuesday (December 1st). The Lisbon Treaty, which enters into force Tuesday, foresees a new foreign service of the bloc, and Kosovo will be part of the new policy, according to EU spokesperson Juri Laas. Another EU diplomat told Info Press on Tuesday that the new Union plan will become clearer next year. But EUSR spokeswoman Julia Rueter denied any plan to restructure the office, saying only that it will undergo a review next year. (Info Press, Kosova Live, Telegrafi - 01/12/09)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of the European Commission (EC) delegation to Serbia, Vincent Degert, said on Saturday (November 6th) that authorities should use the upcoming EC progress report on Serbia as a roadmap. He says the report, scheduled for release Tuesday, will hail the country's progress in several fields but will also point out shortcomings. In an interview with the newspaper Vecernje Novosti, Degert also said that the European Commission's questionnaire, due to be submitted to Belgrade on November 24th, will contain about 2,400 questions. As for upcoming dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina, Degert said the talks should start as soon as possible and should find solutions to practical everyday issues.

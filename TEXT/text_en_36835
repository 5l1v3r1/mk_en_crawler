BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian Parliament continues debate Tuesday (13 July) on the government's value-added tax (VAT) bill. Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic says the introduction of such a tax would help lower the price of goods and services, increase government revenue and weaken the grey economy. The new legislation proposes a VAT of 18 per cent to be introduced early next year, replacing the present sales and turnover tax.(B92 - 13/07/04; B92, Tanjug - 12/07/04)

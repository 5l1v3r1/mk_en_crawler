ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, speaking at the Council of Europe (CoE) summit in Warsaw on Monday (16 May), said that a Europe without borders -- once a distant goal -- is today one step from becoming a reality, but new divisions must be avoided. "If we want to build a new European future, which will be different from the past and marked with peace and co-operation, partnership and common values, every European country must have an opportunity to state its position on that future," Sanader said. He noted that, since the last CoE summit, Croatia has gone from being a CoE newcomer to achieving EU candidate status.
Also on Monday, local media reports quoted Croatian opposition parties as suggesting early elections could be held by the end of this year. Although final results from Sunday's municipal vote are not in, early returns indicate that the ruling Croatian Democratic Union lost in the four largest cities. Postponement of Croatia's EU entry talks and continuing economic problems are being cited as reasons for the party's poor showing. 
In other news, Croatian President Stipe Mesic has cancelled preparations for a planned visit to Serbia-Montenegro, a statement from Mesic's office said Monday. Croatian officials' discontent with weekend celebrations of the Chetniks -- a controversial Serb guerrilla force during the Balkan conflicts and WWII -- was cited for the cancellation.

STRASBOURG, France -- Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) got another boost in their visa liberalisation processes after a committee of the European Parliament (EP) adopted an amendment Tuesday (October 20th) that adds the two countries to the so-called "white Schengen list". Officially, only Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro are included in the next liberalisation wave, expected to take effect in January. The EP's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs says its amendment would be enforced only after both the European Commission and the Council of the EU see progress by Albania and BiH in meeting the criteria. 
In other news, authorities in Tirana have started working on the country's questionnaire for EU membership. It includes 4,500 questions on readiness to join. Albania applied for candidate status in April. (VoA - 21/10/09; Top Channel, Shekulli, Balkan Web, Klan, Alsat - 20/10/09)

LONDON, United Kingdom -- Fitch Ratings on Tuesday (February 2nd) upgraded the outlook of Romania's sovereign ratings from negative to stable. At the same time, Fitch affirmed Romania's foreign currency long-term debt rating at BB+. The improved outlook follows stabilising conditions, the adoption of the 2010 budget, resumption of the IMF programme and a considerable reduction in political uncertainty.

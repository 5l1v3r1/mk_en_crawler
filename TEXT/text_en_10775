ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader welcomed on Wednesday (6 October) the newly released European Commission strategy paper on Croatia. In the document, the EC notes the European Council's decision in June to launch accession talks with Croatia in early 2005 and suggests the Council should prepare the negotiating framework by then. No exact date is set. Commenting on the safeguard clause allowing the possible suspension of talks, Sanader said he is not concerned that the EU would treat Croatia any differently than other candidates.

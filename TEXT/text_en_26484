BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliament will discuss two draft resolutions condemning crimes committed during wars in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, according to a report Monday (January 11th) by B92. The first resolution will refer to crimes in Srebrenica, where up to 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were executed in July 1995. The other is broader, condemning all crimes in the region during the conflicts. On Sunday, President Boris Tadic said that despite possible public disapproval, parliament must adopt such language as part of Serbia's commitments to the UN war crimes tribunal.

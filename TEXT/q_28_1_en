1. In order to have a complete picture of the differences between your import regime and the EU import regime, could you please provide us with: a) your national tariffs, World Trade Organisation (WTO) bound and applied, specifying ad valorem, specific and other types of duties, if any (both in one nomenclature; including initial negotiation rights [INRs]; preferably all in one excel document in electronic format. See also Chapter 25 on customs union); b) quantitative restrictions applicable in your country, if any. 
a)  In accordance with Articles 4 and 5 of the Law on Customs Tariff (“Official Gazette of RM” Nos. 23/03 and 69/04), the Government of the Republic of Macedonia adopts the customs tariff for the following year at latest until 30 November of the current year. The customs tariff is harmonized with the obligations undertaken with the accession of the Republic of Macedonia to the World Trade Organization. The customs tariff of the Republic of Macedonia applied in 2005 is published in the Decision on Harmonising and Amending the Customs Tariff for 2005 (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 86/04).  WTO Schedule of Concessions and Commitments on Goods of the Republic of Macedonia – See 26_Annex_01Decision on Harmonising and Amending the Customs Tariff for 2005 (“Official Gazette of the RM” No. 86/04) - See 26_Annex_02Excel table on WTO customs rates (bound and applied), initial negotiation rights and customs rates for 2005 - See 26_Annex_03
b)  The Republic of Macedonia does not apply quantitative restrictions on export or import.

Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) 

Does your country apply a GSP scheme? If yes: a) Please supply the date of the first GSP scheme implementation and of subsequent extensions or renewals, periodicity of validity, duration of the present scheme and the legal procedure for adoption/extension of schemes. b) What is the product coverage and what are the preferential duties applied? c) Please list the top 10 beneficiary countries. d) Is there any graduation mechanism applied? e) Can you please provide the list of beneficiaries and the text on the rules of origin applied to GSP imports? f) Have you already excluded some countries, and if so, on which basis (sanction, level of development...)? g) Do you have a specific GSP safeguard clause? h) How many different GSP regimes (i.e. general arrangement, LDCs, ...) exist in your country’s GSP scheme? i) Do these regimes have specific incentives (like our labour/environmental clause)? j) What is the share of GSP in the total of imports from third countries? k) To the best of your knowledge, what are the main differences between your country's GSP scheme and the EC’s scheme? If no: a) What would, in your opinion, be the impact on your country of the adoption of the EC’s GSP scheme? 
The Republic of Macedonia does not apply a GSP scheme.  Taking into consideration the liberalisation undertaken by the Republic of Macedonia with the WTO accession (April 2003) and the conclusion of several free trade agreements (encompassing 37 European countries) in the period from 1996 to 2003, in this moment the introduction of the EC’s GSP scheme would have negative effect on the Macedonian economy. The Republic Macedonia with the WTO accession accepted 0% customs rates for major part of the raw materials (silk, wool, rubber and alike). The customs rates for finished textile goods will be reduced over a transitional period. It is considered that the Republic of Macedonia would be prepared to apply the EC’s GSP scheme by the time it becomes a member of the European Union.  13/40 C. Export Controls 

1. Do you apply export controls on certain goods, in particular dual-use items and arms? 
The Republic of Macedonia applies export controls in order to fulfil obligations under international agreements, as well as to protect the public security, the life and health of people, animals and plants, to protect the environment, the public moral, and to supervise the export of historic and works of art and precious metals.  The export control of certain goods, including dual-use goods and arms, is applied in compliance with the Decision on Classification of Goods into Forms of Export and Import published in the “Official Gazette of RM” No. 58/04. – See 26_Annex_04 The Decision was adopted based on Article 34 of the Law on Trade (Official Gazette of RM No. 16/04). In accordance with this Decision, export or import of goods is done based on a licence issued by the line ministries. The control of the export of the relevant goods is carried out by the Customs Administration in accordance with the Decision in which the goods are listed according to their tariff codes contained in the Customs Tariff.  According to the Decision on Classification of Goods into Forms of Export and Import such goods are appropriately designated as goods requiring import or export licences issued by the Ministry of Defence with the purpose to encompass part of the goods that could be treated as dual- use goods and technologies, until the adoption of the relevant legislation regulating the export control of dual-use goods and technology. Exports of arms, is carried out in accordance with the aforementioned decision on the basis of a licence issued by the Ministry of Defence or the Ministry of Interior.

Trade Defence Instruments 

1. Please provide copies (in one of the official EU languages) of the relevant legislation in force in your country concerning anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard measures. 
The Law on Trade (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 16/2004) in its Part V on Safeguard Measures contains general provisions on safeguard measures and countervailing duties. – See 26_Annex_06The implementation of the provisions of the Law on Trade is conditioned by the adoption of specific secondary legislation. The related secondary legislation is prepared, but has not been adopted yet. (For more details see 26_I_D_2).  There are no provisions on anti-dumping measures in the Macedonian legislation.  
2. If no such legislation exists yet, please describe the current plans to adopt it, if any. 
Regarding the adoption of secondary legislation on safeguard and countervailing measures we inform you for the following: The Ministry of Economy is preparing a Decision on the Procedures and Manner of Establishing Safeguard Measures for Increased Imports and a Decision on the Procedure and Manner of Introducing Countervailing Duty. They will be submitted for adoption by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia in the first quarter of 2005. These Decisions basically establish the procedure and the manner following which, in conditions of increased import, the Commission on Safeguard Measures would establish whether the domestic industry has suffered serious injury, i.e. whether the subsidised imports caused or threatened to cause serious injury to the domestic industry.  15/40 E. Subsidies 

1. Please confirm that the duty drawback scheme is operated in a manner consistent with Annex II of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM), in line with your WTO accession commitments. 
The duty drawback scheme applied in the Republic of Macedonia does not represent an export subsidy within the meaning of paragraph (i) of Annex I to the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. The Customs Administration of the Republic of Macedonia applies an investigation system and procedure which are in line with Annex II of the said Agreement, which on their part facilitate the Customs Administration bodies to secure that:  -  the imported goods or inputs have been fully consumed in the production of the obtained product; -  the amounts of the inputs in respect of which customs duty drawback is requested are not higher than the amounts of obtained goods that are exported and  -  the amount of customs duty remission is not higher than the amount of the initially paid customs duties.  The conditions for application of the duty drawback scheme, the limitations, the approval procedure and the manner of applying for customs duty drawback are prescribed in Articles 97 to 107 of the Customs Law (“Official Gazette of RM” Nos. 21/98, 26/98, 63/98, 86/99, 25/00, 109/00, 31/01, 4/02, 55/02 and 42/03) and are further elaborated by the more detailed provisions contained in Articles No. 43 to 55 and 73 to 81 of the Decree Establishing Detailed Criteria and Methods of Implementation of Procedures of Economic Impact  (Official Gazette of RM No. 20/00).  
Approval  
The customs drawback system functions on the basis of previous approval for import of goods indented for production of exported goods. The approval is issued upon application by the entity that performs the production operations or that makes arrangements for their performance. The application for approval is usually filed along with the customs declaration for the imported goods at which it is stated that customs duty drawback is requested. The customs office to which the application has been filed is in charge of issuing the approval. The approval may be issued if it has been established that the imported goods have been incorporated in the obtained products. The measures to examine the presence of the imported goods in the obtained products are: taking samples, blueprints and detailed technical descriptions, analysis and detailed examinations, inspecting the records and other documents. The customs office approves the norms for use of the imported goods and the holder of the right is obliged to keep records of the norms applied in the production operations according to specific types of imported goods. The holder of the right must be able to present these records to the customs body in charge of additional controls at any time and must facilitate inspection of the goods in stock. The period for export of the obtained products is a year at most, and in specific justified cases it can be renewed, but not longer than 6 months. A copy of the approval is attached to the customs declaration for export of the obtained goods for purposes of additional examinations, if considered necessary.  
Limitations  
This system may not be used for fuel and other power resources, lubricants and equipment and tools. There is no possibility for coverage of the domestic like goods by the duty drawback system. The holder of the right may not apply for duty drawback for the customs duties paid for auxiliary products which have not been exported and for waste occurring in the course of the production operations. The duty drawback may not be applied for in its entirety or partially, in cases when in respect of the obtained products there has been an evidence issued confirming the preferential origin, based on the free trade agreements containing provisions prohibiting customs duty remission.  16/40 Customs duty drawback 
The holder of the right may apply for customs duty remission if it proves that the obtained products have been exported. The customs duty drawback application is processed by the Customs Administration, following which a decision is issued in a general administrative procedure, in the course of which the Customs Administration may request additional documents for verification of the accuracy and correctness of data. The amount of the customs duty drawback is established by taking into account the share of the imported goods in the obtained products based on the approved and if necessary re-examined norms. The customs administration bodies do not pay interest on the refunded amount.  
Commenced and planned activities 
There are certain inconsistencies between the applicable regulations in Republic of Macedonia with the procedure prescribed in the Council Regulation No. 2913/92, dated 12.10.1992 establishing the Customs Code of the Community and the Council Regulation No. 2454/93, of 02.07.1993 for its implementation, primarily regarding the use of like domestic goods, the treatment of natural loss and the approval procedures in the customs duty drawback system. Those inconsistencies will be overcomed with the new Custom Code and the regulation on its implementation which envisage full harmonization of this procedure with the procedure established in the above mentioned EU regulations. Furthermore, in 2005 there will be reorganization of the Customs Administration which will lead to the limitation of the number of customs administration bodies that are in charge of issuing approvals and examination of the aforementioned procedures. The reorganization is aimed at upgrading the skills of the relevant customs officers and strengthening the administrative control capacities in the context of these procedures, especially in respect of control of records of large clients. The activities for adoption of new regulations and for appropriate reorganization and improvement of the work are assisted by international experts of the EU CAFAO-MAC (Customs and Fiscal Assistance Office to Macedonia).   
2. Does your country provide subsidies contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods (local content subsidies)? Please note that such subsidies are prohibited by Art. 3 of the ASCM. 
The Republic of Macedonia does not provide subsidies prohibited under Article 3 of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures.  
3. Please provide a detailed overview of all specific subsidy programmes presently applied or planned. 
The Republic of Macedonia does not provide or apply subsidies within the meaning of Article 1.1 of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, which are specific in the context of Article 2 of the Agreement, and that have direct or indirect impact on the increase or decrease of imports on its territory, within the meaning of Article XVI :1 of the 1994 GATT.  17/40 F. Services 

1. To what extent are your GATS commitments in line with those of the EC? 
The intention of the Republic of Macedonia to become a member of the EU was taken into consideration during the WTO accession negotiations in services. In the course of these negotiations, due attention was paid that the process of undertaking commitments is in line with the obligations under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the European Communities and their Member States.. The WTO Schedule of Specific Commitments on Services of the Republic of Macedonia, which is a result of the negotiations with the WTO members, based on their requests, if compared with the commitments of the EU member-states, shows higher level of liberalization in some of the service sectors and sub-sectors. These services sectors and sub-sectors include: professional services (accounting and bookkeeping services; taxation services; architectural, engineering and integrated engineering services), currier services, distribution services. In large part of the service sectors and sub-sectors, the commitments that the Republic of Macedonia has assumed are the same as the commitments of the EU member-states: computer and related services, research and development services, other business services (advertising services, management consulting services, technical testing and analysis services, services incidental to fishing, advisory and consulting services relating to mining, investigation and security, maintenance and repair of equipment, building-cleaning services, photographic services, packaging services, printing, publishing), basic telecommunication services (upon completion of the transitional period, the exclusive rights of the JSC Macedonian Telecommunications were terminated on 31.12.2004), value-added telecommunication services, mobile telecommunications, construction and related engineering services, environmental services, tourism and travel related services, news agency services, sporting and other recreational services, financial services. In certain service sectors and sub-sectors the commitments of the Republic of Macedonia are more restrictive compared with the commitments of the EU member-states: other business services (convention services, other translation services, interior design services), services provided by midwives, nurses, physiotherapists and para-medical personnel, health related and social services, educational services: primary education services. WTO Schedule of Specific Commitments on Services of the Republic of Macedonia – See 26_Annex_07
2. What consideration has been given to the work needed to bring your country's commitments in line with those of the Community? Please provide the summary findings of any work on this issue. 
In the process of negotiating the WTO Schedule of Specific Commitments on Services, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia regularly consulted the relevant counterparts in the European Commission working on service sector liberalization. As a result of such consultations, the commitments that the Republic of Macedonia undertook in respect of the major part of the service sectors and sub-sectors have been brought in line with the commitments of the European Union member-states. Only in some cases the commitments of the Republic of Macedonia differ from those of the EU (See 26_I_F_1). 18/40 G. WTO Accession Commitments 

Please provide details on commitments made during your country’s accession to the WTO (commitment to join the plurilateral agreements before a certain date for example).

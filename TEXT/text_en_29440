ANKARA, Turkey -- Israel is repatriating the families of its embassy staff in Ankara, Israeli public radio reported on Wednesday (June 2nd). The decision follows Monday's raid on a flotilla of ships carrying aid to the Gaza Strip, in violation of a blockade. The foreign ministry in Ankara says that four of the nine people killed in the raid were Turkish citizens. Israel says the repatriation of around 50 people from the Turkish capital was prompted by security reasons amid the growing uproar against the flotilla attack. Israel is also advising its citizens to avoid travel to Turkey. Israel has begun deporting activists who were on the six ships, bussing them to Jordan. Hundreds of Turks were among those onboard early Monday. (Vatan, Radikal, Sabah, Al Arabiya, AP, Reuters - 02/06/10)

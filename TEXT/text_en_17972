WASHINGTON, United States -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says trilateral activities by Iraq, Turkey and the United States -- aimed at fighting the terrorist organisation Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) -- should be stepped up. She met in Washington on Monday (June 18th) with Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari to discuss potential measures to eliminate PKK bases in northern Iraq, which Ankara says are used to stage attacks on Turkish targets. Rice told reporters she was assured that Iraqi authorities "do not want â¦ their territory to be used for terrorist acts against their neighbour". (NTV, RFE - 19/06/07)

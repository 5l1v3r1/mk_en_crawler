BUCHAREST, Romania -- The ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) won most of the mayoral races in Sunday's (6 June) local elections, but its victory was overshadowed by its loss in Bucharest. According to partial results released by the Central Electoral Bureau on Monday, PSD won about 41 per cent of the total number of mayoral seats. However, incumbent Mayor Traian Basescu, of the opposition National Liberal Party-Democratic Party alliance, won another term in Bucharest. (Mediafax, Rompres, Nine o'clock - 07/06/04)

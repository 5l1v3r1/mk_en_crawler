ZAGREB, Croatia -- A court in Zagreb on Monday (December 6th) sentenced former Defence Minister Berislav Roncevic to four years in prison for abuse of power stemming from a 2004 procurement deal for military trucks. His assistant, Ivo Bacic, got two years in prison on the same charges. Roncevic and Bacic were convicted of striking a deal with a company that charged more for its vehicles than the other bidder, causing millions of kunas in damages to the state budget. The two will have to pay back 1.3m euros to the state. During the trial, Roncevic and Bacic denied any wrongdoing. The former defence minister vowed to appeal.

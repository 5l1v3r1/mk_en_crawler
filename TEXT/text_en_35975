SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The foreign ministry said Saturday (10 January) it would approach Greek authorities over reported plans to introduce visas for citizens of Bulgaria and other countries during the 2004 Summer Olympics. Local media broke the story, quoting Kosta Angelov of the Bulgarian Olympic Committee. According to Angelov, Greece would temporarily introduce visas during the Olympics for security reasons. Bulgaria was removed from the so-called "black list" of the Schengen countries in 2001 and its citizens were allowed to travel visa-free within the area.

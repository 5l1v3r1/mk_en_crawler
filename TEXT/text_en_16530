ZAGREB, Croatia -- The South East Europe Media Organisation (SEEMO) voiced concerns Thursday (11 May) over recent death threats against two Croatian journalists -- Drago Hedl, editor of the Feral Tribune weekly, and Sasa Jadrijevic Tomas, a journalist with the Slobodna Dalmacija daily. In an open letter to Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and Interior Minister Ivica Kirin, SEEMO urged authorities to investigate the cases. "It is very alarming that threats against journalists in Croatia are increasing," AP quotes the organisation's secretary general, Oliver Vujovic as saying. Hedl reportedly has received several threats, most recently in Osijek on Tuesday. Tomas received a threat on 3 May while working on an article about the exploitation of conscripts in the Split area.

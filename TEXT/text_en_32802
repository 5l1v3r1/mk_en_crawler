ANKARA, Turkey -- Recep Tayip Erdogan, the leader of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party, will head to Copenhagen on Monday (9 December) to lobby for a firm date for the start of accession talks with the EU. He is to meet Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen of Denmark, the current holder of the rotating EU presidency, just three days ahead of the Copenhagen summit of EU leaders. Erdogan will then head to Washington for talks with President George W Bush and is scheduled to join his country's delegation at the summit in the Danish capital on 11 December. In an interview published Sunday, Rasmussen said that Turkey will not be given a date until it has fulfilled all political criteria for membership.

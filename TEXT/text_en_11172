BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro's main political players failed to agree on a date for the next federal parliamentary elections, during a meeting of the Council for EU Integration in Belgrade on Friday (24 December). Talking to reporters later that day, federal union President Svetozar Marovic said it is clear the vote would not be held in February, as demanded by some Serbian parties. However, he said, authorities would work to meet the legal requirements and create the necessary conditions.
In other news, Serbian President Boris Tadic has sent a letter to the management of Kosovo Energy Corporation, urging resumption of the power supply to Serb settlements in central Kosovo. About 4,000 people have spent the last two weeks without electricity after service was cut due to overdue bills totaling about 16,000 euros. According to an aide, Tadic criticised the electricity company's action as "morally unacceptable". (Beta, Danas, Politika - 27/12/04; Mina, Tanjug - 24/12/04)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Central Elections Commission (CEC) has scheduled presidential elections in Republika Srpska for December 9th, in the wake of President Milan Jelic's death nearly three weeks ago. RS Parliament Speaker Igor Radojcic has been handling presidential duties in the interim. The CEC also decided on Thursday (October 11th) that the incumbent Bosniak and Croat vice presidents would remain in office, ending a dispute over their futures that had pitted the Serb parties against Bosniak and Croat parties.

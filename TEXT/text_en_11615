BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro's Defence Ministry issued a statement Wednesday (20 July), denying allegations by former Serbian State Security chief Goran Petrovic, who says the federal army may be still protecting top war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic. The ministry said no active member of the federal army had been in contact with Mladic or any other suspect since the enactment of the law on co-operation with The Hague tribunal in April 2002. In a series of interviews this week, Petrovic insisted that a colonel from the Serbia-Montenegro Army's general staff, Dragomir Krstovic, was responsible for Mladic's security as of the end of 2002 and is likely still assigned to the job.

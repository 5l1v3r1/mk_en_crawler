PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The trial of 18 ethnic Albanians, accused of plotting terror attacks in eastern Montenegro, opened before the Supreme Court in Podgorica on Monday (May 14th). The suspects, including five US citizens, were arrested in September on charges of planning attacks on state institutions and civilian targets in a bid to establish an autonomous ethnic Albanian area on Montenegro's territory. Appearing before the judges Monday, the first defendant, Gjon Dedvukaj, 32, rejected the charges. He said he is a loyal citizen of Montenegro.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- US Charge d'affaires in Bulgaria Susan Sutton urged the country on Tuesday (November 24th) to stop using Soviet-era armaments. Speaking at an International Defence and Security Business Conference in Sofia, organised by the Atlantic Club of Bulgaria and the NATO Information Centre, Sutton said "in these tough economic times, all Allies are facing difficult budgetary decisions. But we must not forget our obligations to the Alliance and its core missions. For all NATO Allies, the key imperatives are deploy-ability and interoperability. One way to free up resources for these important missions is to cut outdated legacy systems that are either ineffective or unsuited to multilateral operations."

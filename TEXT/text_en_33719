BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) --Bosnian Serb police raided the home of an Orthodox bishop in an attempt to catch the UN war crimes tribunal's top suspect, Radovan Karadzic, an unidentified senior officer was quoted as saying on Wednesday (3 September). Acting on a tip from the EU police force, officers searched the home of Bishop Vasilije of Zvornik and Tuzla but did not find the fugitive there. Vasilije lives in Bijeljina near the border with Serbia-Montenegro. The EU police force has not confirmed the report, but the Republika Srpska Interior Ministry has. It vowed to continue efforts to detain Hague indictees.(Reuters, Onasa, AFP - 03/09/03)

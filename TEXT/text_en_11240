LONDON, United Kingdom -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair reiterated his government's support for Ankara's EU bid during a meeting with Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday (27 July). Britain has insisted that accession talks with Turkey must start on 3 October as planned, despite opposition from certain countries. Ankara is expected to soon meet the final condition set by the EU, namely the extension of a customs treaty to include Cyprus. On Wednesday, Blair emphasised that doing so would not constitute formal recognition of Cyprus. Britain currently holds the rotating EU presidency.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on the EU Thursday (9 December) to launch accession talks with his country in the first half of 2005. He was on a two-day visit to Belgium for meetings with Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende, Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso and Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn. Balkenende, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency, said the EU summit on 17 December must adopt "a balanced, sustainable and consensual decision" on whether to open talks with Ankara.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro - Serbs are voting across Serbia on Sunday (27 June) in the presidential run-off between Boris Tadic of the Democratic Party and extreme nationalist Tomislav Nikolic. Polls give Tadic the lead, after all the pro-democracy parties in Serbia endorsed him. Analysts cautioned, however, that a low voter turnout could propel Nikolic to the presidency, because his Radical and Socialist supporters are much more disciplined and will vote in full force. Preliminary results are expected Sunday evening. (Reuters, AFP, Tanjug, BBC - 27/06/04; AFP, Deutsche Welle, VOA, Reuters, AP, BBC, Independent.com - 26/06/04)

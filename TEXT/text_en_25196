PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The EU plans to remain neutral toward the government's new strategy for northern Kosovo and refrain from making public comments on it, said an international source close to the EU presidency, held now by Spain. Friday's (January 29th) edition of the Pristina-based daily Koha Ditore quotes the source saying the EU does not want to damage efforts by the government and the International Civilian Office to implement the strategy. "The EU's position on the North of Kosovo is the same as the one on the whole of Kosovo ... to promote social and economic reforms, to strengthen the rule of law and to contribute to a stable and multi-ethnic environment," the source said. Serb dominated areas in the north are now controlled by Belgrade-backed "parallel structures". (Koha Ditore, Kohavisio, Telegrafi - 29/01/10)

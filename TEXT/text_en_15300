BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said on Thursday (27 April) that withdrawing Romania's military force from Iraq is out of question, despite the death Wednesday of a Romanian soldier. He was killed in an attack on a vehicle transporting a joint Romanian and Italian force in southern Iraq. "Romania must assume its responsibilities as a member of NATO and contribute to ensure security in Iraq," Tariceanu said. Romania has 860 troops in Iraq and 492 in Afghanistan. 
Tariceanu's comments came during a visit to the Netherlands, where he met with Dutch counterpart Jan Peter Balkenende. Their talks focused on Romania's scheduled accession to the EU in January. (Nine o'clock - 28/04/06; Rompres, AFP - 27/04/06)

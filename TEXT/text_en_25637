BUCHAREST, Romania -- Tourism Minister Elena Udrea announced on Thursday (August 20th) that she has filed a legal complaint against members of a parliamentary committee investigating her for embezzlement. She told the panel that she filed because they had abused their positions, adding she will only participate in the inquiry when the current committee members resign. On audio tapes released earlier this week, members are heard criticising Udrea and discussing ways to find her guilty. (AP, Adevarul, BTA - 20/08/09)

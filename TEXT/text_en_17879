BUCHAREST, Romania -- Six of the 322 members of parliament who voted last month to suspend President Traian Basescu are having second thoughts. They issued a statement Thursday (May 17th) saying they were wrong to support the impeachment initiative. The group includes three members of the Conservative Party, two from the Social Democratic Party and one from the National Liberal Party. "Basescu must continue to be the president of Romania, because this is the will of the Romanian people," the statement reads. 
Voters will decide Basecu's future in a nationwide referendum on Saturday. The Interior Ministry plans to deploy 37,000 policemen to guarantee security during the vote. (Evenimentul Zilei, Ziarul - 18/05/07; Mediafax, Rompres - 17/05/07)

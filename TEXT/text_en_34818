ANKARA, Turkey -- Urban warfare presents the greatest risk for prospective Turkish peacekeeping forces in Iraq, according to a risk analysis conducted by the Turkish military. On Wednesday (6 August), the Office of the Chief of the General Staff published the preliminary results of the analysis, which conclude that a peacekeeping mission to Iraq would differ from all other previous missions in that it entails greater risk.
In related developments, the results of the consultative meeting held in the prime minister's office on Tuesday show that a parliamentary motion on sending Turkish peacekeeping forces to Iraq can be expected no earlier than the beginning of September. Prior to submitting the motion, the council of ministers needs to chart a concrete proposal and present it to parliament for approval.

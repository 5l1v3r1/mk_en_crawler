PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- UN Secretary General Kofi Annan is scheduled to visit the divided city of Mitrovica on Tuesday (19 November), one day after he called on the people of Kosovo to build a democratic, multiethnic society. He acknowledged progress in this area, but noted much remains to be done to strengthen the rule of law, democratic institutions, mutual respect and trust. On the first of his two days in the province, he met with President Ibrahim Rugova, Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi, Parliament Speaker Nexhat Daci and ethnic Serb deputy Rada Trajkovic. From Kosovo, he travels to Belgrade. Annan kicked off his tour of the Balkans in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), where he said Monday that the withdrawal of the UN Mission in BiH (UNMIBH) at the end of this year does not mean the end of the UN's engagement in the country. An EU-led police force will assume UNMIBH duties in January. (UN news wire, PBS BiH, Tanjug, FoNet, B92, AP - 18/11/02)

ATHENS, Greece -- Three homemade bombs exploded outside an office of the ruling New Democracy (ND) party early Saturday (August 18th) causing damage but no injuries. Police expect similar attacks in the weeks ahead of early elections, scheduled for September 16th. Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis officially announced the snap vote on Friday after a meeting with President Karolos Papoulias. Parliament's mandate had been set to expire in March 2008. Polls put the centre-right ND slightly ahead of the main opposition party, PASOK. (Kathimerini, ANA-MPA, AP - 18/08/07; ERT, MIA, AP, Reuters, DPA, UPI - 17/08/07)

ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Simitis and the ruling PASOK party met on Thursday (13 November) to discuss plans for a major restructuring of regional local authorities and the introduction of a new administration. Changes to regional structures have been made necessary by developments within the EU, Simitis explained, adding that the government would make no final decisions until after the spring general elections.

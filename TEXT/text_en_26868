SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Dozens of disabled people continued protests for a second day Friday (December 4th) outside of the parliament building in Sarajevo, demanding ratification of the UN's convention on the rights of those with disabilities. Around 80 people, most of them in wheelchairs, were accommodated inside one of the halls and say they won't budge until lawmakers give them more financial assistance. Currently, disabled people in the Federation of BiH get around ten times the monthly aid as those in Republika Srpska. (Reuters, BTA - 04/12/09)

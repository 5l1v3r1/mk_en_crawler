BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Finance Ministry and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) signed an agreement Tuesday (September 22nd) on a 150m-euro loan for construction of a new motorway section along the strategic Pan-European Corridor 10. The funds are earmarked for a 90km stretch between Serbia's second largest town, Nis, and Dimitrovgrad, on the border with Bulgaria. Serbia needs approximately 975m euros in all. Corridor 10 is one of the ten pan-European corridors and Serbia's main transport route. It provides vital links to Macedonia and Greece in the south and to Croatia, Hungary and Western Europe in the north. (RTS, Tanjug, Politika, B92 - 22/09/09)

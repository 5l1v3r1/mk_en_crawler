ATHENS, Greece -- Air traffic controllers have announced a strike Thursday (June 25th) which has travellers bracing for major disruptions. The controllers are demanding more personnel be hired and better healthcare benefits. The action is expected to result in hundreds of flight delays and cancellations for both the private Aegean Airlines and the national carrier Olympic. As a warning measure, the controllers staged four separate three-hour work stoppages Wednesday. (NewsIn - 25/06/09; AFP, DPA - 24/06/09)

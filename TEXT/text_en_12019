BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- During a visit to Banja Luka on Wednesday (13 April), international community High Representative to BiH Paddy Ashdown said political talks on crucial police reform would begin on 24 April, with a solution expected by 19 May. Meeting with Republika Srpska (RS) President Dragan Cavic, Ashdown reiterated that as RS makes tangible progress in co-operation with The Hague tribunal, police restructuring is the last requirement to be fulfilled to enhance BiH's efforts for EU integration. He dismissed as speculative rumours that he would abolish the entity ministries of interior -- something Banja Luka opposes. (Nezavisne novine, Dnevni avaz - 14/04/05; Fena, RTRS - 13/04/05)

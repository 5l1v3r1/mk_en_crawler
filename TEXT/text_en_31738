ZAGREB, Croatia -- The lawyer for Ivica Rajic, who was arrested on an international war crimes warrant last week, said on Monday (7 April) that his client wants to be tried in Croatia. Rajic, a Bosnian Croat, was charged by the UN tribunal for his alleged role in the 1993 slayings of at least 16 Muslim civilians. His lawyer argued that there would be no legal obstacles to holding the trial in Croatia, despite the fact that the crimes were committed in a different country.
In other news, government sources say prosecutors in The Hague may withdraw the arrest warrant issued for Croatian retired Gen Janko Bobetko. Government legal adviser Goran Mikulicic explained the tribunal could freeze investigation proceedings and demand regular monthly updates on the 84-year-old Bobetko's health.

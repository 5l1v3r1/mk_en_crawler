NEW YORK, United States -- In its human development index, published Thursday (15 July), the UNDP ranks Croatia highest among Southeast European countries. The index incorporates life expectancy, education and living standards. Croatia ranked 48th among 177 monitored countries and was the only country in the region included in the category of high human development. Bulgaria ranked 56th, Macedonia 60th, Bosnia and Herzegovina 66th, Romania 69th and Turkey 88th. All six countries were placed in the medium development group.
In other news, Croatia's Helsinki Committee for Human Rights released its annual report Thursday on the human rights situation in 2003. The report notes gradual improvement last year. Most of those who sought help complained about treatment by the public administration and the police. (UNDP Web site, HINA, HRT - 15/07/04)

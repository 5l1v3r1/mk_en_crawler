BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Conservative Party (PC), a junior government partner, submitted a request Tuesday (October 24th) for a no-confidence vote against Deputy Prime Minister Marko Bela, leader of the ethnic Hungarian UDMR. PC deputy chairman Nicolae Popa explained that the party wants Bela dismissed from the cabinet for "anti-constitutional" remarks he made recently in favour of territorial autonomy for the ethnic Hungarian-populated Zseckler County.
In other news, Defence Minister Teodor Atanasiu, suspended by President Traian Basescu one month ago, announced his resignation Wednesday. Basescu refuses to cancel his decree removing Atanasiu from the cabinet, despite the fact prosecutors found no hard evidence that Atanasiu revealed the classified locations of Romanian troops abroad.

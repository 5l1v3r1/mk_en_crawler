SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling and the United States expect BiH's new government to abandon nationalist campaign rhetoric and speed up crucial reforms, according to statements issued on Wednesday (January 31st). Schwarz-Schilling met with US Undersecretary for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns in Washington on Tuesday, agreeing that BiH is expected to address police reforms and constitutional reforms quickly. They also agreed that the overall situation in the region must be assessed before the Peace Implementation Council makes a decision on the future of the Office of the High Representative.

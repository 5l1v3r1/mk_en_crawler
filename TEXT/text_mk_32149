BIJELJINA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR completed a two-day inspection at the Orao Aviation Institute in Bijeljina on Saturday (12 October), with results to be announced later. Orao has been accused of exporting weapons to Iraq in violation of a UN resolution. An investigation by a special Republika Srpska government commission found no such evidence, but did not exclude the possibility of involvement by a third party.
In other news, the BiH Human Rights Chamber, a top judicial body dealing in this field, ruled Friday that BiH authorities acted illegally in January when they handed over six Algerian terror suspects to the United States. The judges ordered that their families be compensated, as Sarajevo extradited them without ensuring they would not face the death penalty if convicted.

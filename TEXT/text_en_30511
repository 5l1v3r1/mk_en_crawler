BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government has completed all 2,483 answers to the European Commission (EC) questionnaire and will submit the final version by January 31st, the cabinet announced on Thursday (January 13th). EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele delivered the questionnaire personally on November 24th. After the EC assesses the answers, it will issue an opinion on Serbia's readiness for EU candidate status.
Meanwhile, the government adopted an action plan to speed up EU integration. State authorities will boost efforts to capture wartime fugitives Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic, a key condition for any further progress. In addition, the EC suggested the government needs to implement further structural reforms to secure a functioning market economy and speed up privatisation plans.

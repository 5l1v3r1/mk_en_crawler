ANKARA, Turkey -- State Security Court Prosecutor Hamza Keles asked Monday (20 January) that Muslim leader Fethullah Gulen be sentenced to ten years in prison. Gulen, 65, is currently on trial, charged with plotting to establish a Muslim state in Turkey. He is the leader of the Nur (Light) Brotherhood, one of the most influential Muslim groups in the country. His trial has sparked broad public interest. Gulen's group has gained influence by opening more than 300 schools in Turkey, Central Asia and the Middle East. Turkish authorities arrested him after a videotape surfaced, in which Gulen reportedly urges civil disobedience and establishment of a Muslim state. He claims the tape is a forgery and all charges against him are fabricated. (Anadolu Agency, AFP, BBC - 20/01/03)

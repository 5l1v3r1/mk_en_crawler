NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The government of Cyprus will recognise the results of a Greek probe into a deadly plane crash, Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos said in a statement Monday (29 August). He said authorities would accept responsibility for the 14 August downing of the Helios Air 737 near Athens if investigators uncover safety lapses. The crash killed all 121 people on board.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Workers employed by the state-run Oil Industry of Serbia (NIS) on Wednesday (10 August) asked the government to provide them with shares in the company and to make sure that their benefits remain unchanged when NIS is sold to private investors. The Serbian Parliament is due to meet later this month to discuss the restructuring and privatisation plans for the state-owned giant. The employees wrote a letter to Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, stressing they would not support the company's restructuring if their demands are not met. The IMF has made the sale of NIS a condition for future loans and co-operation. (AP - 10/08/05)

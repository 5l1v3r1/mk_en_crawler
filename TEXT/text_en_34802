SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnia and Herzegovina and Italy will sign an agreement that will simplify the procedure involved in returning illegal immigrants. Officials in Sarajevo announced on Thursday (7 August) that BiH has also agreed to take third-country nationals who entered Italy illegally via BiH during the past 12 months. Sarajevo has made substantial progress in reducing the number of illegal immigrants travelling to Western Europe. Their number dropped from 35,000 in 2000 to about 600 in 2002. (AFP - 07/08/03)

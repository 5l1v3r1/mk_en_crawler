SKOPJE, Macedonia -- EU envoy to Macedonia Erwan Fouere called on the new government to step up efforts to restructure the judiciary and fight corruption, during meetings Tuesday (5 September) with various cabinet members. He told A1 TV that his chief message was to avoid a vacuum in the reform process. Fouere also noted that the EU would closely follow how the VMRO-DPMNE-led coalition implements its campaign promises regarding the economy and better living standards. 
Also Tuesday, the Brussels-based Web publication EU Observer cited an unnamed diplomatic source as saying that the Union is concerned about "looming instability" in Macedonia, given the rift between the ruling bloc and the main ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic Union for Integration. It was excluded from the government, even though it attracted the majority of ethnic Albanian votes in the July elections. (MRT - 06/09/06; A1 TV, EU Observer - 05/09/06)

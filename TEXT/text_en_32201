ANKARA, Turkey -- On Sunday (10 November), authorities expelled Chechen activist Zelimkhan Arsangereev, who claimed to be Chechnya's representative in Istanbul and boasted of his contacts with the terrorists that took some 1,000 hostages in a Moscow theatre last month. Russian Foreign Ministry official Aleksandr Yakovenko welcomed Turkey's decision, adding that Russia hopes that Turkey would continue to demonstrate intolerance towards the terrorists and their accomplices. It is unclear where Arsangereev was sent. (AFP, BBC, RIA - 10/11/02)

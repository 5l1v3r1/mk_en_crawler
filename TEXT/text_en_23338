ATHENS, Greece -- The health ministry confirmed on Tuesday (May 26th) and Wednesday the country's second and third swine flu cases. Medical tests showed a 21-year-old Greek national who recently returned from Edinburgh was infected with the H1N1 virus. He is being treated at home in the northern city of Thessaloniki, where his family is also under medical supervision. A second young man, who returned from Edinburgh on the same flight, also tested positive for the H1N1 strain and is in hospital in Thessaloniki. The health ministry called an emergency meeting to discuss the two cases, but says it has taken all necessary measures to prevent an epidemic. Earlier this month, Greece registered its first case -- a student returning from the United States. (SKAI, City, AFP - 27/05/09; ANA-MPA, In.news, Kathimerini, Express, AP - 26/05/09)

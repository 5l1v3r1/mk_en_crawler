PRISTINA, Kosovo -- KFOR has restored relations with the Kosovo Security Force (KSF) after almost a week of tension, the NATO-led force announced on Wednesday (March 10th). KFOR suspended ties saying the KSF violated its status of an unarmed organisation by displaying weapons during an anniversary ceremony celebrating the Kosovo Albanian resistance against Serb forces. KFOR said a new agreement was reached by which the KSF ceremonial unit could carry weapons in a manner agreed upon in advance.

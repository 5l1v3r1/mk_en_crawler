SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Twenty-two inmates charged with war crimes are still on hunger strike. They are demanding application of an old law of the former Yugoslavia, under which they could be sentenced to no more than 15 years instead of the maximum 40 years provided under Bosnian law.
On Monday (15 January), the special war crimes court in Sarajevo entered not guilty pleas on behalf of two of the hunger strikers, Mitar Rasevic and Savo Todovic. The two Bosnian Serbs are charged with unlawful imprisonment and persecution of non-Serbs in the Foca area during the 1992-1995 conflict. After initially adjourning the two cases, the court decided to continue with the trials in the absence of the defendants. (Reuters - 15/01/07)

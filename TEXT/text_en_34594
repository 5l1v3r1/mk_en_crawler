ZAGREB, Croatia -- In a letter to the UN Security Council on Friday (29 August), Prime Minister Ivica Racan wrote that his government was calling on fugitive war crimes suspect Ante Gotovina to surrender to the UN tribunal. The prime minister warned the retired general that his attempts to evade justice were hurting Croatia's bids for membership in NATO and the EU. Union members Britain and the Netherlands have refused to ratify Croatia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), citing a lack of war crimes co-operation.(HINA, BBC - 30/08/03; AFP - 29/08/03)

ATHENS, Greece -- Preparations and campaigning for the 7 March parliamentary elections will not interfere with preparations for the 2004 Summer Olympics, said Denis Oswald, the head of the co-ordinating commission for the Games. On Tuesday (13 January), he said neither the pre-election period nor the change in government would affect the Olympics, as those who might assume government positions following the elections will be briefed about developments, projects and tasks.

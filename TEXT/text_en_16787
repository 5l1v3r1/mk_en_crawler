SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The war crimes trial against Momcilo Mandic, the former Republika Srpska justice and interior minister from Radovan Karadzic's government, opened before the BiH Court on Monday (November 6th). Mandic is charged in relation to the April 1992 attack on Sarajevo and the establishment of detention camps in Ilidza and Foca. Prosecutors plan to summon 51 witnesses and present 147 items of material evidence, including transcripts of tapped phone conversations between Mandic and senior Bosnian Serb military and police officials. Last week, Mandic received a nine-year prison sentence for abuse of office and forgery, in a separate trial related to embezzlement at Privredna Banka Srpsko Sarajevo. (RTRS, Srna - 06/11/06)

ANKARA, Turkey -- President Ahmet Necdet Sezer may not call a referendum on the constitutional amendments drafted by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), according to a report in Monday's (23 December)  Milliyet. Last week, Sezer vetoed amendments proposed by AKP that would allow party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan to run for parliament in a special election in the province of Siirt and then assume the post of prime minister. By law, if a bill is backed by more than two thirds of the deputies - 367 votes - Sezer must either sign the legislation or call a national referendum. During the first vote, 440 deputies supported the bill. The election in Siirt is scheduled for early February, but the High Election Board has postponed any final announcement until the constitutional amendments are adopted. Milliyet also reports that even if the adoption is delayed, AKP has planned for three of its deputies from the Rize province to resign, in order to give Erdogan more chances to enter parliament.

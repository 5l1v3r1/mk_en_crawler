SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak reiterated on Wednesday (October 1st) that BiH's EU integration would be impossible without reforming the constitution. "With the current political setup in accordance with the terms of the Dayton Peace Agreement, it is certainly impossible to join the EU," Lajcak told the Croatian daily Jutarnji List. "Everyone knows this setup is untenable in the long term," he added. "BiH cannot be satisfied with it; it has to push further forward." He said he would work to resume constitutional debate and find an acceptable model that would advance the EU preparation process. BiH signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU in mid-June. Talks on constitutional reform are to begin after Sunday's local elections.

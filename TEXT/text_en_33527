ANKARA, Turkey -- The government announced on Tuesday (23 September) that it is lifting a ban on the use of Kurdish and other ethnic names. A letter has been sent to local authorities, saying "all names using the Turkish alphabet that do not offend public opinion or undermine public morals can be used." Kurds and the international community have been pushing for this reform.
In other news, the leaders of two pro-Kurdish parties have been charged with aiding an illegal armed organisation. Tuncer Bakirhan, chairman of the Democratic People's Party, and Ahmet Turan Demir, who heads the Free Society Party, were arrested for attending a festival in Germany allegedly organised by an association linked to KADEK, formerly known as the PKK.
Also Tuesday, Turkish Finance Minister Kemal Unakitan said the government would urge parliament to approve a budget reshuffle involving 600m euros. The changes would expand funding for social insurance institutions by reducing state aid to the business sector. (AFP, Anadolu Agency - 23/09/03)

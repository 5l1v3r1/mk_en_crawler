BELGRADE, Serbia -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz urged Serbian authorities on Monday (November 15th) to boost efforts to arrest and bring to justice the two remaining war crime fugitives -- Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic. Brammertz, who arrived in Belgrade, said he believes the two are in Serbia, but pointed out that the search is being conducted elsewhere as well. He also noted that since his last report on co-operation six months ago, the government has started to correct the pinpointed weaknesses related to the search for the two fugitives. Still, he added, there is room for improvement. On the positive side, Brammertz said he was satisfied with Serbia's co-operation as far as access to documents and protection of witnesses is concerned.
Meanwhile, President Boris Tadic confirmed Serbia's commitment to arrest and hand over the two fugitives but did not set an exact deadline. Serbia's war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic added he expects a positive report, in light of improved regional judicial co-operation, as well as recent progress in the tracking of Mladic and Hadzic. Full co-operation with the UN tribunal remains a key condition for any further progress in Serbia's EU membership bid. (Tanjug, RTS, Beta, B92 - 15/11/10)

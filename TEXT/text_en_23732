PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Two explosions rocked the ethnically divided town of Mitrovica in northern Kosovo late on Saturday (January 24th), media reported. No injuries were reported. Police said the blasts took place within an hour of each other in the Tri Solitera neighbourhood, inhabited primarily by ethnic Albanians. The cause of the explosions is still unknown, but police suspect hand grenades were used, said Kosovo Police Service (KPS) spokesman Besim Hoti. NATO-led peacekeepers and EU police were deployed to secure the area. (AFP, AP, Beta. B92 - 25/01/09)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Minor Offence Court in Zubin Potok, northern Kosovo, has been occupied by Serb parallel structures, media reported on Monday (April 25th). Parallel structures have turned the premises into what is described as a "family medicine unit", according to the Chairman of the Kosovo Judicial Council Enver Peci, who has filed a complaint to the EU Rule of Law Mission EULEX. Peci has asked EULEX to intervene and return judges to the Kosovo institutions' property. Kosovo institutions lost control over the courts in the Serb-dominated north, including in Zubin Potok, three years ago, soon after Pristina declared its independence. Taking over the premises by parallel structures comes at a time that EULEX has promised to start returning local judges to northern Kosovo courts. (Kohavision, RTK, Evropa e Lire, Zeri - 25/04/11)

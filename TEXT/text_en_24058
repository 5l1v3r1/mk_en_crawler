SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev announced on Saturday (January 17th) that Bulgaria will begin receiving natural gas supplies from neighbouring Greece within days. Following a phone conversation with his Greek counterpart, Costas Karamanlis, Stanishev said the deliveries would total about 2 million cubic metres a day. Karamanlis says the Greek gas company Depa has assured him there would be no technical issues. He and Stanishev also discussed building a gas link between Dimitrovgrad in Bulgaria and Komotini in Greece. Karamanlis said Greece would support Bulgaria's request for priority financing from the EU for the project. 
Sofia has been seeking alternate sources since the ongoing dispute between Russia and Ukraine shut down supplies. Their prime ministers reached common ground in a meeting late Saturday night and promised deliveries to Europe will resume shortly. (BBC - 18/01/09; BGNES, Dnevnik, Netinfo - 17/01/09)

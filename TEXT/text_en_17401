SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian forensic experts have uncovered two more mass graves containing bodies of victims of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. Four complete and 44 incomplete remains were found in the Zeleni Jadar area, 15km south of Srebrenica. Five skeletons were discovered at another grave near the Potocari memorial cemetery. Local prosecutors believe the victims had been buried elsewhere, but were later brought to these locations and reburied using bulldozers. (AFP, IRIB radio - 26/06/07)

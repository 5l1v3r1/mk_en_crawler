BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The UN war crimes tribunal will soon charge several former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) members, says Vladimir Bozovic, head of the judicial body within Belgrade's co-ordination centre on Kosovo. On Monday (26 May), he said that UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte has indicated that preparations are in the final stage.
In other news, eight more ethnic Serbs have joined the Kosovo Protection Corps, the successor of the KLA. Commander Agim Ceku said that bodes well for a multiethnic Kosovo. (B92, Tanjug, BBC, FoNet - 26/05/03)

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Miroslav Lajcak, EU envoy for the Montenegrin independence referendum, praised the way in which the campaign for the 21 May poll has been conducted lately, during a visit to Podgorica on Tuesday (9 May). He described significant improvement over what he saw during his last visit, two weeks ago. On Wednesday, he was due to brief EU officials in Brussels. 
Following his meeting with Lajcak in Podgorica, Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic said that after 21 May -- regardless of the outcome of the referendum -- he would initiate a dialogue between the two republics' authorities. Separately, Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic said on Tuesday that the union between Serbia and Montenegro would face an uncertain future after the referendum. He called the plebiscite a "lose-lose" proposition. (Danas - 10/05/06; Tanjug, Reuters -- 09/05/06)

ZENICA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- More than 1,500 people gathered Saturday (February 2nd) in the central Bosnian town of Zenica to protest the decision to revoke citizenship and deport hundreds of former Islamic fighters, known as mujahedin. One of the highest profile cases involves Syrian-born Al Hussein Imad, also known as Abu Hamza. Considered the informal leader of the ex-mujahedin, he awaits deportation on Wednesday. 
Thousands of Muslim fighters joined Bosnian Muslims during the 1992-1995 conflict to help fight Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats. Most of them later left, but some married and decided to stay. Last year, under pressure from the United States, a commission reviewed decisions made during that time and decided to strip more than 660 people of Bosnian citizenship. Most were Muslims of Arab origin. The former fighters were viewed as a threat to national security. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 03/02/08; RTRS, Fena, Reuters, AP - 02/02/08)

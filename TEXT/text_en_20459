LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Authorities have begun exhuming the remains of an estimated 15,000 people killed by the former communist regime shortly after World War II. The mass grave in Tezno, northeastern Slovenia, was discovered by chance in 1999 during construction of a highway in the region of Maribor. Most of the victims are thought to have been Croatian, Montenegrin and Serbian Nazi collaborators who were taken prisoner and executed in May or June of 1945, shortly after the war ended. The government's Commission on Concealed Mass Graves says this may be Europe's worst post World War II massacre. (Makfax, A1, Kathimerini, RTRS, B92, Beta - 11/08/07)

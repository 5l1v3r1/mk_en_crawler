THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The Appeals Chamber of The Hague war crimes tribunal on Thursday (July 17th) upheld the conviction of former Yugoslav General Pavle Strugar for his role in the bombardment of the Croatian town of Dubrovnik in 1991. Strugar, 75, received an eight-year prison sentence in January 2005 for his involvement in a campaign against civilians. Prosecutors say he failed to stop the attack against the town despite having information it would take place. Strugar was in command on the day of the shelling, which killed two people and caused major damage. While upholding his conviction, the judges decided on Thursday to reduce Strugar's sentence by six months due to his age and health issues. (Vecernji List, RTS, Blic, AFP, AP, Reuters - 17/07/08)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- A survey conducted by the Puls agency suggests that the majority of Croatian citizens -- around two thirds -- back the investigation and processing of war crimes cases. The results of the survey, conducted at the request of the Documenta Centre for Confrontation with the Past, were presented at a roundtable discussion Monday (October 30th) in Zagreb. According to the findings, 50% of respondents say the UN war crimes tribunal and the international community were responsible for the launch of war crimes trials in Croatia. Some 10% said the biggest contribution was from NGOs and the media, while the rest credited domestic political parties or politicians. (Poslovni dnevnik - 31/10/06; HRT, HINA - 30/10/06)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The two-day extraordinary congress of the Bosnian Social Democratic Party (SDP) ended Sunday (25 November) evening with the re-election of party leader Zlatko Lagumdzija. Despite wrangling among the different factions, he finally won two third of the votes. Alija Behmen, Zeljko Komsic and Mladen Grahovac were elected as deputy leaders. Dissatisfied with the developments , a group of SDP officials who blame Lagumdzija for SDP's defeat in the latest general elections, decided to split off and form a new party.

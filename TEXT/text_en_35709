ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul warned on Monday (5 April) that his country could seek international recognition for the self-proclaimed Turkish Cypriot republic if the UN peace plan is approved by the Turkish Cypriots but rejected by the Greek Cypriots. At a meeting Monday, Turkey's National Security Council welcomed some aspects of the UN plan, but insisted that certain changes should be made. Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash continues to lobby against the plan, saying it would bring only short-lived peace to the island.
Meanwhile, Greece's two main political parties were busy negotiating with the Greek Cypriots on Monday. Local media is reporting that Athens is leaning towards acceptance of the UN plan. (Bloomberg, AP, AFP, BBC - 05/04/04)

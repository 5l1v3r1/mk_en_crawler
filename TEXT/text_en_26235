ANKARA, Turkey -- New clashes between Kurdish demonstrators and Turkish nationalists broke out Sunday (December 13th) in Istanbul, injuring at least one person. That made three days of unrest in the country following Friday's decision by the Constitutional Court to ban the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) for alleged ties to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). On Sunday, around 100 Kurds threw Molotov cocktails and stones at cars, shops and other buildings. Turkish nationalists and residents of Istanbul confronted them, armed with knives, and in some cases, guns. Police had to use tear gas to disperse the crowd. 
In Diyarbakir, meanwhile, demonstrators clashed with police, while in Yuksekova, gendarmerie members were called to help police deal with demonstrators who barricaded several streets. At least 15 people were arrested in the two cities. (Anadolu news agency, CNN, Reuters, MIA - 13/12/09)

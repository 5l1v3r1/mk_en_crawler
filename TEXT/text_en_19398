PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The Kosovo Journalists' Association (KJA) said on Sunday (August 26th) that local institutions underestimate the work of the journalists by continually breaching citizens' rights to information on all actions by public officials. At a press conference, KJA leaders urged local institutions to be more transparent in their work. The association says that in only 23.5% of cases, have public officials granted journalists the right to look at and use official documents.

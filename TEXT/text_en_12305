BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Former Republika Srpska (RS) Interior Minister Mico Stanisic has decided to surrender to the UN war crimes tribunal, the Serbian government announced Thursday (10 March). He departed for The Hague on Friday to face seven counts of crimes against humanity and three counts of violating the laws or customs of war. Prosecutors say he encouraged, facilitated, and failed to investigate or punish crimes against Bosnian Croats, Bosnian Muslims and other non-Serbs. His decision to go to The Hague reportedly followed talks with Serbian Local Self-Government Minister Zoran Loncar and current RS Interior Minister Darko Matijasevic.

BERLIN, Germany -- The government on Monday (July 12th) banned the Turkish humanitarian organisation Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief (IHH) from activities in Germany. The group headed the flotilla bound for Gaza in late-May that Israeli commandoes ended up boarding and firing on, killing nine people. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the organisation is illegal, based on evidence it is financing the Palestinian Islamist organisation Hamas, which the EU regards as a terrorist organisation. German authorities say the group raised funds from its headquarters in Frankfurt, saying they would be sent to Gaza as humanitarian aid, but were actually diverted to finance Hamas.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the leader of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), was expected to win one of three seats in parliament in Sunday's (9 March) by-elections in the Siirt province. Polls show the AKP will win all three seats, which would propel Erdogan to the prime minister's chair. He was barred from running in November's general election due to legal obstacles that have since been removed. Prime Minister Abdullah Gul has signaled that he would step down to let Erdogan head the government. Political observers predict that he will form a new cabinet, more sympathetic to a US operation to disarm Iraq. Last weekend, parliament narrowly rejected a motion to let more than 60,000 troops deploy in Turkey.
In other news, Turkey and the IMF reached an agreement Saturday that would enable Ankara to get $1.6 billion next month as part of a total loan package worth $16 billion. (AP, AFP, Anadolu Agency, Milliyet - 09/03/03; Reuters - 08/03/03)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Local Serbian media reports that Belgrade is generally satisfied with Monday's (18 August) UN Security Council session, which focused on Kosovo. Speaking at the session, Deputy Prime Minister and Belgrade's Co-ordinator on Kosovo Nebojsa Covic called for a large-scale weapons collection programme, the disbanding of the Kosovo Protection Force, and increased patrols by KFOR. Afterwards, he said he believed his proposals were well received and that concrete results would follow an evaluation of the situation. Covic said the next step is starting talks with Pristina, which should happen "within the next few weeks". (B92, Beta, Tanjug, BBC, AP, AFP - 19/08/03)

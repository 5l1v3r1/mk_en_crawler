BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The EU is likely to postpone completion of the study of Serbia's readiness to seal a Stablisation and Association Agreement until the end of March, Serbia's Deputy Minister for International Economic Relations Ana Trbovic said Sunday (29 February). The rationale behind the delay, Trbovic said, was the difficulty in assessing the political situation in the country. She added that in her view, the real obstacle for the EU is the slow harmonisation of economic relations between Serbia and Montenegro. (Beta, B92 - 29/02/04)

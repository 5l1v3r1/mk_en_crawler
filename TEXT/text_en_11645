ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic voiced his belief Monday (21 March) that the country would start accession talks with the EU by the middle of this year. Speaking on national radio after the EU delayed negotiations with Zagreb last week, Mesic said he based his optimism on statements by senior EU representatives. He also stressed that much depends on fulfilling obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal, including the arrest and extradition of fugitive General Ante Gotovina.

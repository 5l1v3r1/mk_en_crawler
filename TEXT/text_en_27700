Party leaders Jadranka Kosor and Zoran Milanovic presented the compromise in parliament. The HDZ accepted SDP's suggestion that Croats living in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) can vote only at diplomatic and consular missions, and the diaspora will be entitled to three representatives in the Croatian parliament. The expatriate vote has been the main stumbling block between the two parties. Constitutional changes need two-thirds of a parliamentary majority, which requires support from the SDP. On Saturday.

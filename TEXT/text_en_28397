BELGRADE, Serbia -- Two former Serbian diplomats pleaded not guilty Thursday (September 16th) to charges of abusing their positions when they hastily issued travel documents to a Serbian student accused of beating a fellow undergrad at a university he attended in New York. Former New York Consul Slobodan Nenadovic and Vice-Consul Igor Milosevic appeared at a Belgrade court as their trial opened. The student, Miladin Kovacevic, agreed on Tuesday to plead guilty to beating Bryan Steinhauer in May 2008 and to serve two years and three months in prison. Kovacevic left the United States just after the incident and avoided the court system there due to documents provided by the diplomats. They insist that US authorities failed to notify Serbia's consulate of any obstacles to issuing travel documents. The beating left Steinhauer brain damaged. (B92, Beta - 16/09/10)

TIRANA, Albania -- The government announced on Sunday (April 26th) it will submit the country's application for EU candidate status on Tuesday. Prime Minister Sali Berisha will deliver the application to the Czech EU presidency in Prague. During a special cabinet meeting, Berisha said the decision is historic for Albania and was made after consulting with EU leaders. "Albania is applying after all EU countries ratified its Stabilisation and Association Agreement without any reservations," he explained. Berisha stressed the move comes as a result of "reform efforts undertaken over the years". He also praised opposition parties for making contributions and for supporting EU-related reforms in parliament. (VoA, Shekulli, Telegrafi, Top Channel, Balkan Web, AFP - 26/04/09)

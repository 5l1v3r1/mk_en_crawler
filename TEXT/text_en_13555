BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Republika Srpska (RS) government is extending its policy of awarding 25,000 euros to support the families of indictees who surrender to the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, it was confirmed Tuesday (20 September). The policy, set to expire on 30 June, will be extended to the end of the year. The practice of supporting the families of indictees who stand trial at The Hague is also used in Serbia-Montenegro.
In other news Tuesday, Bosnian Serb Sredoje Lukic pleaded not guilty at his first appearance before The Hague tribunal. He surrendered to RS authorities last week after nearly seven years on the run. He is charged with committing war crimes in Visegrad in 1992. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 21/09/05; FENA, PBS BiH - 20/09/05)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- More than 5,000 people turned out in Skopje late Wednesday (February 27th) to protest any possible change to their country's name in light of the longstanding dispute with Greece. Demonstrators marched from parliament to the Greek diplomatic mission in Skopje, pelting the building with stones and bottles. They were later dispersed by police. Athens has threatened to veto Macedonia's EU and NATO bids if Skopje does not agree to change its name. (Makfax, A1, Focus, BGNES, ANA-MPA - 27/02/08)

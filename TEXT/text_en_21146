ANKARA, Turkey -- Security forces arrested four people Tuesday (January 1st) for allegedly trying to join the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Two Turkish citizens and two Syrian nationals were caught while attempting to cross the border between Turkey and Syria, Turkish military sources told Xinhua. Separately Tuesday, the General Staff announced that the army had seized a significant amount of drugs and explosives in an operation in the southeast provinces of Diyarbakir and Bingol. "The connection between explosives and illicit drugs ... is not a new incident. This face of the PKK terrorist organisation has been shown many times," the staff said.
On Monday, CNN Turk reported that members of the al-Qaeda terrorist group have penetrated Turkish territory in an attempt to launch a series of attacks against US and Israeli targets in the country. Reportedly, the Turkish counter-intelligence services were warned about planned attacks by the Israeli special services.

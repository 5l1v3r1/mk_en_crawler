ANKARA, Turkey -- Fifty-six Kurdish mayors went on trial in Diyarbakir on Tuesday (26 September), charged with "knowingly and willingly" helping Kurdish rebels. The mayors are accused of writing a letter to Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, urging him not to close a Denmark-based Kurdish radio station. All of the mayors are members of the largest Kurdish political organisation in Turkey, the Democratic Society Party.

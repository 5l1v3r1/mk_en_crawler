TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi on Tuesday (March 4th) broke his silence regarding recent wrangling over electoral reform between smaller and larger political parties in the country. He urged them to end the debate in order to achieve a positive outcome. A group of ten parties from both ends of the political spectrum announced late last month that they were joining forces to block electoral reforms proposed by the two biggest parties, the Democratic Party (DP) and the Socialist Party (SP). They accused the DP and the SP of delaying the process and working to exclude the smaller parties from participating in it. 
"We encourage dialogue between parties," Topi said on Tuesday, adding debate is good when it is constructive and ends positively. (GazetaShqiptare, Shqip, Shekulli - 05/03/08; Albanian President website, Balkanweb, Top-Channel - 04/03/08)

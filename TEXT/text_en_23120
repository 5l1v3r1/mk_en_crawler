PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A landmine exploded in a field west of Pristina on Tuesday (April 1st), killing one person and injuring three others. The group was collecting scrap metal in the field when they stepped on the mine, probably left over from the 1998-1999 conflict.
In other news, Russia says it is sending $1.7m in humanitarian aid -- mostly food -- to Kosovo Serbs this week, amid concerns over deteriorating conditions. (AP, AFP, RTRS, RIA Novosti, ITAR TASS - 01/04/08)

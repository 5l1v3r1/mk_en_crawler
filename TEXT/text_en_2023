Following a repeated tender for a third mobile operator, Croatia's telecommunications authorities have awarded a combined concession for second and third generation mobile telephony (GSM/DCS1800 and UMTS) to a joint Swedish-Croatian consortium, led by Sweden's Tele2. 
The communications ministry announced on Monday (24 January) that it has cleared last month's decision by the state telecommunications council to grant the concession to the Treca Sreca group, consisting of Tele2 and nine Croatian companies. Two rival bidders had complained of irregularities, forcing a review of the tender. 
Tele2 must now sign a concession contract, worth 23m euros over 20 years, by 2 February. It has pledged to employ 1,400 people and offer prices 20 per cent to 50 per cent lower than those of the country's existing GSM operators -- T-Croatian Mobile, owned by Deutsche Telecom, and VIPnet, an Austrian-led group that obtained a license in 1998. 
 Borislav Skegro, a representative of the Quaestus Fund, said that Tele2's goal is to conquer a third of the mobile telephony market. According to the director of Tele2 in the AB Group, Frank Heijmink, and the co-ordinator of the consortium, Tomislav Matic, the new operator intends to begin commercial exploitation in the next six months. 
The process of awarding the tender has dragged on for months. Treca Sreca's initial offer was rejected by the telecommunications council, which said the consortium had not demonstrated interest in helping Croatia's economy 
Treca Sreca's offer was accepted in the repeat tender, prompting an outcry from the other bidders -- Croatia Mobile and Match Telekom -- which said the council had mistakenly rejected their bank guarantees. 
About 55 per cent of Croatia's population of 4.4 million uses mobile phones, and recent surveys have found that as many as 80 per cent of mobile customers think the current price of services is too high.

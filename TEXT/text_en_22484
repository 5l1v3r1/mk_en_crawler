TIRANA, Albania -- Lawmakers are asking 12 fellow members of parliament staging a hunger strike to leave the parliament building and find a more appropriate location. "We are concerned about the condition of the lawmakers on hunger strike and their health," the heads of political parties represented in parliament said in a statement Wednesday (November 12th). They also described this method of protest as unacceptable. On Monday, 12 lawmakers from small parties in parliament started their strike to protest the exclusion of small-party representatives from election committees under the new election code.

ATHENS, Greece -- The ruling PASOK party elected a new executive bureau at an extraordinary meeting Thursday (3 July). Public Order Minister Michalis Chrysochoidis was elected the new party secretary, replacing General Secretary Costas Laliotis, who declined an invitation to rejoin the government. The leadership shuffle follows a decision by Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who also serves as PASOK president, that executive bureau members could not occupy a position in the government at the same time. Simitis said party leaders must focus instead on preparations for the spring 2004 parliamentary elections. (ANA, MPA - 03/07/03)

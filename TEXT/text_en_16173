BUCHAREST, Romania -- Local media have cautioned that the situation with bird flu in Romania might be escalating, after at least ten new outbreaks were confirmed and 17 suspected cases were reported as of Wednesday (17 May) evening. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu dismissed the head and deputy head of the National Health Veterinary Authority for demonstrating "criminal irresponsibility" and a lack of measures to ensure safety in poultry companies. Avian influenza has been detected in some 60 locations in Romania since October. (Focus, Ziua, Adevarul - 18/05/06; AFP - 17/05/06)

TIRANA, Albania -- As of Sunday (November 1st), Albanian citizens travelling to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) no longer need visas. The same applies for Bosnian citizens travelling to Albania, due to an agreement signed by the two countries in March. Albania plans to start negotiations with Serbia to remove visa barriers for its citizens as well. Albanians already travel to Macedonia, Kosovo and Montenegro without visas.

TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha accused the opposition Saturday (January 22nd) of seeking to overthrow his government through violence and trying to implement a "Tunisia-style" scenario in Albania. He was reacting to Friday's anti-government demonstration in Tirana, at which three people died and dozens were injured in clashes between police and thousands of opposition party supporters. Berisha stressed that violence will not be tolerated, and ruled out the possibility of imposing a state of emergency. Opposition Socialist Party leader Edi Rama rejected Berisha's accusations and blamed the government for the deaths. 
Meanwhile, the general prosecutor's office has ordered the arrest of six members of the National Guard for overstepping their authority in connection with the deaths. 
Both EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele condemned the violence and called on all parties to refrain from provocations. Albania has been in political deadlock since the June 2009 elections, which the opposition says were married by serious irregularities. (AFP, Reuters, BBC, MIA - 22/01/11)

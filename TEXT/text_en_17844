ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan said on Thursday (February 22nd) that the EU is insincere regarding the Cyprus issue. He stressed that Turkish Cypriots had supported former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan's plan for the unification of the island, adding that if Greek Cypriots had done so also, the whole island would now be a member of the EU. Instead, only the Greek Cypriots joined in May 2004. Erdogan was speaking at an economic conference in Istanbul. 
In other news, the newspaper Hurriyet quoted Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul as saying that if Erdogan were elected president, it would not affect the work of the cabinet or the ruling Justice and Development Party. The newspaper interpreted the remark as a clear sign that Erdogan has decided to run for president this year. (Zaman, Hurriyet, Milliyet, Turkish Daily News - 23/02/07)

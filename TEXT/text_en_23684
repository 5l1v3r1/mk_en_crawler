BELGRADE, Serbia -- The opposition Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) have agreed on local and state-level co-operation, SNS chairman Tomislav Nikolic said in a statement Tuesday (June 23rd). He explained that the two parties will join forces to encourage early parliamentary elections, prevent the adoption of a draft measure on Vojvodina's status, and make sure that as voters cast their ballots in the next elections, they simultaneously participate in a referendum on Serbia's NATO membership.

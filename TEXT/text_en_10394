NEW YORK, United States -- Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte is due to appear before the UN Security Council on Tuesday (23 November) to present a report on several Balkan states' co-operation with the war crimes tribunal in The Hague. For Serbia-Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace programme and the start of talks on an EU association agreement hinge on a positive report.

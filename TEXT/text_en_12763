SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The head of the EC Delegation to BiH, Michael Humphreys, said Republika Srpska (RS) must proceed with police reform and co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal in order for BiH to progress towards European integration. Speaking to RS President Dragan Cavic and RS Parliament Speaker Dusan Stojicic on Thursday (3 March), Humphreys said these are the two main factors that would enable the start of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between BiH and the EU.
Meanwhile, the independent board assessing candidates for RS police director recommended East Sarajevo Public Security Centre Chief Dragomir Andan for the post. The position has been vacant since late November.

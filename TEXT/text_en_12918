BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- British Defence Minister Geoffrey Hoon on Tuesday (30 November) urged Serbia-Montenegro and Croatia to arrest and extradite war crimes suspects hiding on their territories. He said he had a frank discussion with Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic about the lack of progress in the hunt for indictees. Separately, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said Tuesday that Serbia would meet all of its international obligations, but did not elaborate. 
Earlier in the day, Hoon told Croatian President Stipe Mesic and Defence Minister Berislav Roncevic that their country, too, has not fulfilled its obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal. According to Mesic's office, Hoon said NATO and the EU were concerned about the negative assessment of Croatia's co-operation contained in UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte's recent report to the UN Security Council.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Days after the UN Security Council extended SFOR's mandate by 12 months, the force is reaffirming its commitment to military reforms in BiH and to bringing indicted war criminals to justice. At a news conference Tuesday (15 July), spokesman James Billings said SFOR has achieved considerable progress in BiH, but added that much remains to be done.
In another development, the EU Police Mission announced that it is assisting BiH police in implementing a new, wider approach to the fight against trafficking and prostitution. A spokesman says the assistance involves collection of data and monitoring areas before police raids.
Also Tuesday, the Office of the High Representative in BiH urged the Party of Democratic Action to reconsider its decision to quit a commission working on the status of Mostar. The panel is only a few weeks away from completing its work. (OHR Sources - 16/07/03; PBS BiH, FENA, BBC - 15/07/03)

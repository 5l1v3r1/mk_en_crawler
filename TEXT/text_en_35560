TIRANA, Albania -- The parliamentary law committee rejected on Thursday (8 April) the draft law on a new administrative and territorial division after two lawmakers with the Socialist Party joined opposition members of the commission. They argued the OSCE and Council of Europe should first examine the draft. The proposal had been proposed by Local Power and Decentralisation Minister Ben Blushi, who said the OSCE and other international institutions had recommended conducting an administrative reform.

MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Court Chairman Meddzida Kreso said on Wednesday (19 October) that legal shortcomings prevent full co-operation with Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro in processing war crimes cases. Kreso, speaking in Mostar at a regional conference on war crimes trials, pointed to the lack of a legal basis for collaboration between prosecutors in BiH, who are entrusted with investigation, and investigational judges, who are tasked with the duties in Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro. The OSCE is helping sponsor the forum to pinpoint such difficulties. 
In other news, Republika Srpska Office for Missing Persons spokesman Milan Ivancevic announced on Wednesday that the remains of Serbian soldiers and civilians have been found at a site in Bosanska Krupa. RS experts have been working at sites in six western BiH municipalities this week. (NTV Hayat, Fena, RTRS- 19/10/05)

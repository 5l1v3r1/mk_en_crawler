BELGRADE, Serbia -- War crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic said on Wednesday (July 29th) that fugitive Ratko Mladic is "somewhere within reach". He added he is optimistic that Mladic will be captured by the end of the year; echoing an opinion recently expressed by Rasim Ljajic, head of Serbia's national council for co-operation with The Hague tribunal. Up until now, Serbian authorities have claimed they had lost track of Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb military leader, in 2006. His arrest -- and that of fellow war crimes fugitive Goran Hadzic -- are the last conditions Serbia must meet to implement the Stabilisation and Association Agreement it signed with the EU in April 2008.

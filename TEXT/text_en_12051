ZAGREB, Croatia -- The OSCE Mission to Croatia voiced concern again Friday (11 February) over the jail time given to journalist Ljubica Letinic for libel, and called for an urgent revision of relevant laws. The OSCE statement followed the recent decision by the Split County Court to uphold the two-month suspended prison sentence given to Letinic last July. The OSCE mission again warned that the possibility of jailing journalists for their work could have "a chilling effect" on the media. (OSCE Web site - 11/02/05)

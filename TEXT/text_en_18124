BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of the Serbian national council for ties with the UN war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, confirmed on Saturday (June 16th) that authorities have been searching Cer Mountain for one of the tribunal's "most wanted", identified by the media as former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic. Ljajic said the action was conducted on the basis of a tip, adding similar operations would continue until Serbia fully meets its obligations to the tribunal. 
On Friday, the national council approved another set of document requests by the tribunal, regarding 13 cases. It also decided to lift an obligation to preserve state secrets from seven witnesses ordered to testify before the tribunal. 
In neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska police searched the Banja Luka homes of Jugoslav Bubic and his sister, Zeljka Jandric, relatives of war crimes fugitive Stojan Zupljanin. Documents seized during Friday's raid are being submitted to the BiH Court, which ordered the searches.

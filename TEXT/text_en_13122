BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Federal Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic said on Monday (26 September) there could be no progress in Serbia-Montenegro's Euro-Atlantic integration process or more foreign investments until fugitive Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic is handed over to The Hague tribunal. Draskovic, who spoke to reporters after his return from New York, also warned that Serbia's positions regarding the resolution of the Kosovo problem could be "dramatically" jeopardised due to the failure to co-operate fully with the tribunal. 
In other news Monday, Serbia's ruling coalition agreed to nominate a former Mladic supporter, Zoran Stankovic, as Serbia-Montenegro's new defence minister. He would replace Prvoslav Davinic, who resigned earlier this month in a procurement scandal. Montenegro must approve the nomination as well. Most recently, Stankovic served as head of a military medical facility in Belgrade. (Danas, RTS - 27/09/05; Blic - 27/09/05; B92, Tanjug - 26/09/05)

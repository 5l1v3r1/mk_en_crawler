ZAGREB, Croatia -- Authorities announced on Friday (24 February) a second case of avian flu, saying that the H5 virus was detected in a dead swan found near the Adriatic coastal town of Trogir. Officials are awaiting the results of further testing to determine whether it was the deadly H5N1 virus strain. Trogir is near Ciovo Island, where a dead swan, infected with H5N1, was discovered a few days ago. 
Meanwhile, Macedonia announced on Saturday that two dead swans found in the southeastern Dojran Lake tested negative for bird flu. Macedonia is one of the few countries in the region that have not yet reported cases of avian influenza. (A1 TV - 25/02/06; HINA, HRT - 24/02/06)

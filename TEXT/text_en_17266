BUCHAREST, Romania -- Justice Minister Tudor Chiuariu said on Monday (May 28th) that he would submit to the government draft changes to the recently adopted law establishing the National Integrity Agency (ANI), aimed at bringing more cases under ANI's supervision. The law, passed by Parliament earlier this month, envisions ANI monitoring asset declarations of all civil servants, including members of Parliament, to screen for irregularities totalling 20,000 euros. Chiuariu says he wants to change that to 10,000 euros.
Also Monday, he said there is no danger the EU will activate safeguard clauses against Romania, when the European Commission releases its next evaluation report on anti-corruption efforts next month. (Nine o'clock - 29/05/07; Mediafax - 28/05/07)

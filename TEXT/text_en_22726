BELGRADE, Serbia -- Vice-President of the European Commission (EC) in charge of transport policy Jacques Barrot was in Belgrade on Wednesday (May 7th) where he gave President Boris Tadic a "roadmap" for the liberalisation of Serbia's visa regime with the EU. Barrot said the document provides "clear and strong" proof of the EU's support for Serbia and its European prospects. He added that implementation of some measures will begin within the next couple of weeks with the issuing of new passports with biometric imprints. Tadic thanked Barrot and said the roadmap is very important to the public, serving as an important sign that Serbia is welcome in the EU. (RTS, Blic - 08/05/08)

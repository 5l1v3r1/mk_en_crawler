TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition leader Sali Berisha of the Democratic Party invited the ruling coalition partners Tuesday (11 March) to a round-table discussion on electoral reform. If the ruling Socialist Party and its allies agree, the talks will be held on Friday. Berisha says the debate is necessary, as institutional reforms are the most important prerequisite for EU integration. (Koha Jone - 13/02/02, ATA - 12/03/03)

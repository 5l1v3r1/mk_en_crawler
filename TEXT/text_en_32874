BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- The Yugoslav federal assembly has scheduled a session for Tuesday (4 February) to start deliberations on the constitution of the new union between Serbia and Montenegro. The debate will be held simultaneously in both houses of parliament. The setting up of a loose union between Serbia and Montenegro is a condition for their admission into the Council of Europe and the possible start of accession talks with the EU. The parliaments of the two republics ratified the constitution last week.(AFP - 02/02/03; 01/02/03)

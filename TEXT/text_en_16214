BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Parliament Speaker Predrag Markovic confirmed on Tuesday (16 May) that he has left the junior government coalition partner G17 Plus and expressed his readiness to resign as speaker, if asked to do so. Moreover, two more deputies from G17 Plus, Branko Bosnjak and Vesna Obradovic, announced on Tuesday their departure from the party, accusing the new leader, Mladjan Dinkic, of conducting a purge campaign. The previous day, two other party members left G17 Plus, with their mandates abruptly terminated. Local media reports suggest the developments are the result of the struggle between G17 Plus founders â Markovic and Miroljub Labus on the one hand, and Dinkic on the other -- after the EU suspended integration negotiations with Belgrade for failed war crimes co-operation with The Hague tribunal. 
In other news Tuesday, the Serbian Supreme Court ordered a retrial in the so-called Ibar Highway case. Four officials of the Serbian Renewal Movement were killed during an ambush on the highway in October 1999. A survivor, Vuk Draskovic, is now Serbia-Montenegro's foreign minister. He criticised the Supreme Court ruling, insisting it was politically motivated, not based on procedural irregularities cited by the court.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The Constitutional Court begins deliberations next week on whether to outlaw the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party, media reported on Thursday (December 3rd). Chief Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya has requested closure of the country's main Kurdish party for maintaining links to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), in violation of the law. The DTP, which holds 21 of the 550 seats in parliament, has said it has "no organic links" to the PKK, but refuses to brand it a terrorist organisation. Support from seven of the 11 Constitutional Court judges would be enough to close down the party. (Anadolu news agency, Hurriyet, AFP, Reuters - 03/12/09)

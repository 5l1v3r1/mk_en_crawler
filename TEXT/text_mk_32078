SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Four workers were taken to hospital following a blast Wednesday (16 October) during the destruction of Scud missiles in the city of Veliko Turnovo. The blast, likely due to a technical problem, temporarily suspended the decommissioning process. It will resume after a special commission appointed to look into the accident produces a final report, most likely by week's end. Defence Minister Nikolai Svinarov called the accident a serious signal that strict safety measures must be taken. (Dnevnik, Sega, Novinite - 17/10/02)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Authorities announced on Tuesday (December 14th) they have smashed an international cybercrime ring suspected of causing losses worth over 11m euros to businesses in the US, the UK, South Africa, Italy and Romania. Prosecutors say the ring involved about 50 people and was headed by two Romanians. A total of 42 people were arrested in Tuesday's operation, in which several computers and hard disks were seized. Ring members alleged stole confidential VoIP data by cracking servers, and then used the data to make thousands of calls to surcharged numbers abroad, getting bonuses for every call. The crackdown coincided with an international forum on cybercrime that wraps up in Bucharest on Wednesday. (AFP, Hotnews.ro, Evenimentul Zilei, Adevarul - 14/12/10)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government announced Thursday (17 July) that it has decided to sell a minority stake in the national oil and gas company INA to Mol of Hungary. Opposition members walked out of parliament Wednesday, insisting that debate should have been held before the decision was announced. The ruling coalition postponed debate instead until Saturday. Mol will receive a 25 per cent stake plus one share. (HINA - 17/07/03; BBC, HINA - 16/07/03)

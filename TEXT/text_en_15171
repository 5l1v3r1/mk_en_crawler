SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The chairman of Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) tripartite presidency, Sulejman Tihic, met on Thursday (29 June) with visiting Serbian counterpart Boris Tadic, who said preserving BiH in its present form is of vital importance to Serbia and to the future of the entire region. Only with stability and progress could Western Balkan countries achieve their Euro-Atlantic integration goals, Tadic added.
The two leaders also talked about the situation in Kosovo and the need for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. In addition, they broached the delicate topic of BiH's lawsuit against Serbia and Montenegro for aggression and genocide.

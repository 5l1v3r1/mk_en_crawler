PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- NATO is prepared to prevent outbreaks of violence of the kind that erupted in mid-March, a top general in the Alliance said Tuesday (20 July). German General Harald Kujat, who heads NATO's Military Committee, told reporters in Pristina that the peacekeepers have adopted measures to stop further rioting in the province. "Kosovo remains a top priority of our business, both of the Military Committee and of course of the political side in NATO headquarters . For the foreseeable future we have no intention to reduce our presence here," he said. Kujat was leading a delegation of military officials from the 25 NATO member states to Kosovo. (AFP - 20/07/04)

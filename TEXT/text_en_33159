PARIS, France -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown called for continued EU financial and infrastructure support for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), at the start of his visit to France on Thursday (15 May). In Paris, Ashdown met with Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin to discuss reforms in BiH and the role of the EU, as well as next month's EU summit in Thessaloniki, Greece. Given its geographical location, Ashdown said, BiH is a natural candidate for EU membership.

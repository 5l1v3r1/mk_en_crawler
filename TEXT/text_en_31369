PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Montenegro's ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) dismissed a proposal to create a second house in parliament. Dragan Kujovic, deputy parliament speaker and a senior DPS official, said Sunday (27 April) that the current legislature is equipped to protect the rights of minorities. He was responding to a proposal by parliament member Ferhat Dinosha, leader of the Democratic League of ethnic Albanians in Montenegro, to set up an additional house to represent ethnic minorities. According to Dinosha's proposal, that house would not have a physical presence but would be allowed to exercise veto power. Kujovic said the introduction of another house would hamper the work of parliament. (FoNet, BBC, Tanjug - 27/04/03)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Teachers walked off their jobs on Monday (September 24th), demanding better wages and more state funding for education. The government says it cannot meet their call for salaries to be doubled. Instead, the education ministry is offering a minimum 21% wage increase in 2008, with the potential for up to 32%.

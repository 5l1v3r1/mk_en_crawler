BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu has asked Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu to dismiss Justice Minister Tudor Chiuariu and Labour Minister Paul Pacuraru, according to media reports Thursday (December 6th). Basescu says the government's image has been tarnished, both at home and abroad, by the two ministers, both of whom are under criminal investigation.
Justice Minister Chiuariu is being investigated for requesting the removal of a top prosecutor in the anticorruption body, over the acquisition of a building in downtown Bucharest by the state-owned Post Office. Labour Minister Pacuraru is being investigated for taking bribes. (Romania Libera, Ziua, Gandul - 07/12/07; Mediafax - 06/12/07)

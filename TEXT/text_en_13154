ATHENS, Greece -- The government on Tuesday (29 November) unveiled a sweeping reform of labour laws that govern the public sector. The move is aimed at bringing civil servant employment contracts into line with those in the private sector. The laws, likely to be adopted by the end of the year, would end the policy of jobs-for-life. Government spokesman Thodoros Roussopoulos said the changes would affect only newly hired workers.

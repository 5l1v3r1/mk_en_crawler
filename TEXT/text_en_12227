PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK moved quickly on Friday (8 July) to reassure Kosovo's Albanians that the deaths of three children in the village of Cabra was the result of an accident rather than foul play. The victims, all under the age of five, were playing unattended in a water-field pit. The drowning of three children in the same village in March 2004 sparked mass rioting that claimed the lives of 19 people. An investigation into that accident also ruled out foul play.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serb police carried out an extensive operation in the village of Celebici on Saturday (26 June), but failed to find Savo Todorovic, a Serb accused by the UN war crimes tribunal of participating in atrocities against Muslims. He is one of more than 20 fugitives believed to be hiding in Republika Srpska (RS). Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in BiH, warned that he would take action if RS fails to arrest any war crime suspects before this week's NATO summit in Istanbul.
The Associated Press reported meanwhile that US intelligence agencies have launched a major operation to hunt down Islamic terrorists in BiH, reportedly to avert bombings in the United States and elsewhere.
On Saturday meanwhile, the political directors of the Peace Implementation Council's steering board wrapped up a meeting in Sarajevo. They welcomed the legislative steps made by the BiH authorities to meet economic reforms, but urged concrete measures be taken to complete the reforms.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO troops raided the homes of fugitive war crimes indictee Radovan Karadzic's son and daughter very early on Tuesday (February 20th). Spokesman Derek Chappell said Sonja and Sasa Karadzic were suspected of participating in their father's support network and that material had been seized for analysis. Similar searches have been conducted in the past. 
In other news, BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric urged the international community on Monday not to renew the mandate of the high representative, the international official who oversees the country's institutions. Spiric says the presence of such an official creates the impression that BiH cannot meet the challenges of Euro-Atlantic integration.

ATHENS, Greece -- The Radical Left Coalition (SYRIZA) party on Saturday (December 27th) condemned an attack on a trade union official, whose face assailants splashed with acid last week. Bulgarian Constantina Kouneva, 44, general secretary of the Athens association of cleaners, lost sight in one eye and has been unconscious since the attack Wednesday. Police have arrested nobody yet. Kouneva had strongly opposed a recent pension system reform and had fought to improve working conditions for cleaners, SYRIZA lawmaker Evangelia Paschalidou-Amanatidou said in a statement.

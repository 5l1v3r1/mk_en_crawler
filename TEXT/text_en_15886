SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Following a meeting with Swiss counterpart Samuel Schmid in Sarajevo on Wednesday (16 August), Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic said EUFOR is expected to be the last military mission in BiH. Radovanovic and Schmid agreed that the EUFOR mandate could be completed in 2008, given the progress BiH has made in strengthening institutions and implementing reforms. During the meeting, Schmid reaffirmed his country's interest in the Western Balkans and willingness to help the region's sustainable development. (Dnevni avaz - 17/08/06; RTRS - 16/08/06)

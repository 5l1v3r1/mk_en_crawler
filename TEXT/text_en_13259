BARCELONA, Spain -- Germany's new chancellor, Angela Merkel, tried to reassure Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Recep Erdogan Sunday (27 November) that she would not block Ankara's accession talks with the EU. Merkel and her Christian Democrats had previously opposed Turkey's bid for EU membership, arguing that the country should be granted the status of a privileged partner instead. Speaking to reporters after her meeting with Erdogan on the sidelines of the Euro-Mediterranean summit in Barcelona, Merkel said agreements must be respected.

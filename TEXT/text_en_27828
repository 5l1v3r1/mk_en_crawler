BELGRADE, Serbia -- Little progress has been made in tracking down and arresting wartime fugitives Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic over the past six months, according to a draft report by UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz, quoted by media Tuesday (November 23rd). In the document, Brammertz suggests that Serbia's efforts have been insufficient, despite the government's stated commitment. 
As for Croatia's co-operation with the tribunal, Brammertz said authorities have failed to provide requested documents. Specifically, prosecutors have not received a single document regarding 1995's Operation Storm. Generally however, Croatia meets the requirements for legal aid and access to witnesses and evidence. Brammertz presents his regular report to the UN Security Council on December 6th. Full co-operation with The Hague remains a key condition for Serbia and Croatia's EU accession.

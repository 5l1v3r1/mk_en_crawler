LONDON, United Kingdom -- The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) formally announced on Wednesday (22 December) that it has suspended Greece's two top runners, Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou, for failing to take several doping tests. The two made headlines just days before the Athens Olympics when they claimed that a motorcycle accident had prevented them from appearing for a test. The IAAF did not find their explanations convincing. Greek prosecutors have charged the duo with faking the accident, and several hospital employees have been indicted for writing false reports on their condition. Kenteris and Thanou also missed tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago in the run-up to the Games. (Reuters - 22/12/04)

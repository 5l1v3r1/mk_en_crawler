TIRANA, Albania -- Turkey will strongly support Albania's efforts to join NATO at the Alliance's summit in Bucharest next week, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday (March 26th) during a visit to Tirana. Albanian counterpart Sali Berisha in turn said the EU would not be complete without Turkey's integration. Both leaders said they want to boost bilateral cultural and economic collaboration. A free-trade agreement is expected to take effect in May that should boost Turkish investments in Albania above the current $620m-level.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Military prosecutors have charged two officers serving in the eastern province of Erzincan with leaking a classified document on the military campaign being waged against the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), local newspapers reported on Tuesday (June 23rd). The two lieutenants were detained last week after a military investigation found the document was leaked from Erzincan to civilian sources, and then published by a press organisation in February. The officers deny the allegations. 
In other news Tuesday, parliament authorised the government to extend the mandate of Turkish troops serving with the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for another year. Currently, Turkey has about 1,000 military personnel in the force, as well as several vessels in its naval component, which aims to prevent Lebanon's Hezbollah militants from receiving weapons by sea.

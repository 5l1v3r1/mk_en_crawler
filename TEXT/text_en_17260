SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi reportedly told Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi that Libyan law was fully observed in the high-profile trial of five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor, according to media reports in Sofia Tuesday (December 26th). Local reports suggest that al-Qadhafi called Prodi on Monday for a long conversation that Prodi later described as very useful. No other details were disclosed. The EU, the UN, the US and Russia have condemned the death sentences, handed down last week in a retrial of the case.
 Prayers on behalf of the medics were read during the Christmas liturgies at all Bulgarian Orthodox churches Sunday. Saturday evening, the lights in Sofia and most Bulgarian towns were switched off for a few minutes, in protest of the death sentences. (Darik, News.bg - 26/12/06; bTV - 25/12/06)

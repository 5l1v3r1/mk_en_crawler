BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Adrian Nastase and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, stressed Thursday (20 November) the need for co-ordinated action by European countries to prevent and combat terrorism. Commenting on Thursday's twin attacks in Istanbul, Nastase said they "point to the fact that terrorism is no longer a distant danger; it can also affect the states of Europe." Later Thursday, the heads of relevant Romanian agencies gathered to assess security needs in light of the attacks.
Ahern, who arrived in the country following a visit to Bulgaria, expressed support for Romania's efforts to join the EU in 2007. Ireland assumes the rotating EU presidency in January. That effort received more support Thursday in Paris, during meetings between French officials and Romanian President Ion Iliescu. (Rompres, Mediafax, AFP, BBC - 20/11/03)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Supreme Court ruled on Thursday (March 10th) that Senate Speaker Dan Voiculescu collaborated with the communist-era secret police service, Securitate. Voiculescu was appealing a finding by a lower court. Thursday's ruling is final and is not subject to further appeal domestically. The founding president of the Conservative Party was formally accused of links to Securitate five years ago. Voiculescu is vowing now to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights.

ANKARA, Turkey -- President Abdullah Gul said on Wednesday (January 26th) that he has reservations about the potential introduction of a presidential system in Turkey. The change from a parliamentary to presidential democracy was proposed recently by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan as part of general constitutional reform. Gul has previously criticised the idea, suggesting it might be too authoritarian and would require comprehensive changes in the checks and balances system. Introducing a five-year non-renewable presidential mandate would prevent him from seeking re-election. (Hurriyet, Milliyet - 26/01/11)

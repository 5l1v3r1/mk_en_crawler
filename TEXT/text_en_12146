TIRANA, Albania -- The US Export-Import Bank has provided $47.56m for the upgrade of Albania's air traffic system. The money will be used to buy an air traffic control navigation system from Lockheed Martin as well as other equipment. The new system will triple the country's ability to handle air traffic over its territory. Albania will pay off the debt with revenues from flights over its territory.

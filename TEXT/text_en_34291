SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov said Thursday (30 October) that the volume of bilateral trade with Switzerland is expected to increase markedly after the signing of a visa lifting agreement between the two countries. He added that the investments should grow too. The agreement on removing the visa requirement is the first of its kind Switzerland has offered to a country in the region. Visiting Swiss President Pascal Couchepin described Bulgaria as a privileged partner in Southeast Europe and promised further investments.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Commissioner for Information Society and Media Viviane Reding warned Bulgaria on Tuesday (June 3rd) that the European Commission (EC) will sue the country unless it begins using the EU's universal emergency phone number, 112, by the end of June. At the presentation of a website designed to inform the public about the benefits of 112, Reding said the phone number is currently accessible only in Sofia and its surrounding area. "Bulgaria is the only EU member state where the universal emergency number does not function according to the requirements," she noted. (Reuters, Dnevnik - 03/06/08)

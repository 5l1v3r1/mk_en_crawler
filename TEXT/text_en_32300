PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- Ibrahim Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) won a majority in 11 out of 30 municipalities in Kosovo, including the capital Pristina. According to results announced by the OSCE on Sunday (3 November) the LDK could control several other towns if it forms alliances with smaller groups. Support for the party has slipped since the previous local elections, when the LDK won control of 20 municipalities. Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo will have a majority in four municipalities and could control at least four more in coalition with smaller parties. Ramush Haradinaj's Alliance for the Future of Kosovo ranked third, but did not win a majority in any of the municipalities. Serb political parties prevailed in five areas. The elections were held on 26 October. (AP, AFP - 03/11/02)

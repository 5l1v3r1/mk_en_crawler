THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte said Friday (12 September) that she wants the top three war crimes suspects from the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia handed over to The Hague tribunal by the end of this year. The international court would not be able to complete its work in time if Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic and Croat General Ante Gotovina are not turned in, del Ponte warned. The tribunal wants to complete all trials by 2008. Del Ponte said that Mladic is hiding in Serbia and must be arrested immediately. She urged officials in Republika Srpska to co-operate in finding Karadzic, while insisting that authorities in Zagreb know where Gotovina is hiding. Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan responded immediately, saying Gotovina has left the country. (AFP, UN Web site, Mediapool - 12/09/03)

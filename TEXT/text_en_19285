BUCHAREST, Romania -- Chamber of Deputies General-Secretary Daniela Popa was elected president of the Conservative Party on Sunday (January 27th), edging out the other main candidate, Florin Anghel. The post was left vacant after former leader Dan Voiculescu announced he would not seek re-election due to the party's weak performance in European Parliament elections last November. Popa's narrow margin of victory led Anghel's supporters to demand a second round of voting, but whether that will happen is unclear. (Nine o'clock, Gandul - 28/01/08; Mediafax, Rompres - 27/01/08)

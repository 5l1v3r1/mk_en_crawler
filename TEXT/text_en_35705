BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The OSCE and CoE are voicing concerns over the way Serbia's military court system operates. OSCE local spokesman Mathias Eick said on Wednesday (2 June) that the constitutional framework of Serbia-Montenegro requires that all military cases be transferred to civil courts. The case at hand involves Vladan Vlajkovic, a civilian accused of revealing military secrets. His trial before the Belgrade Military Court has been adjourned until 22 June due to new evidence. "Serbia-Montenegro has ratified the European Convention on Human Rights and other international documents which insist that some cases must not be dealt with by military courts," said Eick.

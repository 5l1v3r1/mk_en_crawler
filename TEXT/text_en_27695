BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government completed technical talks with the IMF on the sixth review of Serbia's 2.9 billion-euro stand-by agreement, Finance Minister Diana Dragutinovic announced on Thursday (November 25th). She added that the government will accept amendments suggested by the IMF to the draft budget for 2011 and forward it to parliament by December 15th. 
Meanwhile, the cabinet is still struggling with pension reform. It ended up withdrawing its first draft due to pressure from labour unions. Nevertheless, authorities have agreed with the IMF that the minimum pension will be set at 27% of the average wage in Serbia, while the minimum retirement service for women will be gradually increased to 40 years, starting in 2013.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- General David D. McKiernan, commander of US Army forces in Europe, visited the Mihail Kogalniceanu air base and the Babadag Shooting Range on Wednesday (August 29th), where the Proof of Principle joint military exercise is being held. Lieutenant General Ioan Sorin, deputy chief of the Romanian General Staff, accompanied him. 
McKiernan said the ongoing exercise offers a unique opportunity for US forces to train in Romania. The base is not an American one, he stressed. "It is 100% a Romanian base in which our soldiers train alongside their Romanian brothers-in-arms, and they do it in rotations, according to the political agreements signed by the two states," McKiernan said.
He added that the US plans to invest $68m in the modernisation and improvement of military facilities it uses in Romania and Bulgaria. (Nine o'clock - 30/08/07; Rompres, Romanian Defence Ministry website - 29/08/07)

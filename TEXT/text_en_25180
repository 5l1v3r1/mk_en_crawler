ANKARA, Turkey -- Police used tear gas Wednesday (November 25th) to disperse protesting state employees who rallied in the centre of Ankara, demanding higher wages and the right to go on strike. The incident happened when police blocked a group of protestors proceeding to an overpass. Wednesday's action disrupted public transportation, postal service and hospitals, which were only treating emergencies. (Hurriyet, ITAR-TASS - 25/11/09)

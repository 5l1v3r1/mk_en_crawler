 Bulgarian world champion skating duo Albena Denkova and Maxim Staviski won the gold medal in the ice dance event of the 2006 Skate America figure skating in Hartford, Connecticut. Their triumph came despite a collision incident earlier in the day, involving the Bulgarians and the British pair Sinead and John Kerr. Both Denkova and Staviski were injured. A similar incident in 2000 forced the couple to withdraw from the world championships in Nice, after which Denkova underwent several months of medical treatment. Second in the Hartford event were Americans Melissa Gregory and Denis Petukhov, while France's Nathalie Pechalt and Fabian Bourzat were third.

"Varoe's Amazon", by Sofia University rector Boyan Biolchev, won the annual VIK award for best Bulgarian novel. His book, a work of historical fiction, describes the 8th century meeting and "mixing" of the three founding elements of the Bulgarian nation -- the ancient Bulgarians, Slavs and Thracians -- as well as the meeting of three respective drinks -- kumis, beer and wine. Biolchev says he will donate the prize money -- totalling over 5,000 euros -- to the launch of a national poetry and fiction contest for Bulgarian university students.

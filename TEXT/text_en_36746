ZAGREB, Croatia -- Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul met with French counterpart Michel Barnier on Thursday (22 July). Barnier said Croatia can serve as an example for other Balkan nations embroiled in recent conflicts. He also praised the "extraordinary work" done by the government and President Stipe Mesic to bring Zagreb closer to EU membership.
Later, Barnier travelled to Serbia-Montenegro, where he met with President Svetozar Marovic. On Friday, he will hold talks with his counterpart in Belgrade, Vuk Draskovic, as well as with the Serbian and Montenegrin prime ministers, Vojislav Kostunica and Milo Djukanovic. Afterwards, he moves on to Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he will attend the reopening of an historic bridge in Mostar. (AFP - 23/07/04; AP, AFP - 22/07/04)

ATHENS, Greece -- Coast guard personnel Sunday (March 6th) found the bodies of three Bangladeshis who drowned near Crete after they attempted to leave a ship that had evacuated them from Libya. A total of 49 people left the ship using a rope to get into the water, though why is still unclear. Thirty of them have been hospitalised. Authorities are searching for 16 people who may have swum to shore. The Cypriot-flagged vessel was carrying a total of 1,280 people, most of them Bangladeshis evacuated from Libya.

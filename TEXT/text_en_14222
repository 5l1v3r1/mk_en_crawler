BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The doors for Euro-Atlantic integration are open for Serbia-Montenegro, US Ambassador Michael Polt said on Thursday (11 August). However, he stressed that the political requirement for NATO membership is the extradition of UN war crime tribunal fugitive Ratko Mladic. The ambassador presented two documents to the federal union from the United States. One aims to more adequately define the rights of US soldiers in Serbia-Montenegro, while the other relates to the recently signed agreement between Serbia-Montenegro and NATO.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Four children who were placed in isolation late last week turned out to have no symptoms of bird flu and will be released from hospital, a top epidemiologist said Sunday (19 March). "Results of virological analysis confirmed that the four children have not been infected with the disease," said Predrag Kon, the head of the Serbian agency that is dealing with bird flu. Kon told Serbian state television that the four would be released from hospital in the western town of Uzice, but would remain under "constant observation" The lethal H5N1 strain was detected earlier this month in a swan found dead near Serbia's northwestern border with Croatia and Hungary.
Also on Sunday, the local authorities announced that one more dead swan was found near the southeastern Serbian village of Backi Monostor, where several H5N1 cases were confirmed earlier this month.
In Albania, meanwhile, testing is under way on chickens found dead last week in the regions of Peze-Helmes, Berat and Shkodra. Albania reported its first H5N1 case in the southern Saranda area two weeks ago. (Danas - 20/03/06; AFP, Tanjug, RTS - 19/03/06)

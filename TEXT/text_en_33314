ANKARA, Turkey -- IMF First Deputy Managing Director Anne Krueger met on Wednesday (7 May) with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Economy Minister Ali Babacan and other officials. Afterwards, she said Turkey is on track to meet its targets of 20 per cent inflation and 5 per cent economic growth in 2003. The country's high debt burden, Krueger said, is the chief economic policy concern. She advised the government to do more to bring down interest rates, stimulating economic growth. Turkey expects to receive more than $5 billion in loans from the IMF and the World Bank by the end of 2004. (Hurriyet, Milliyet - 08/05/03; IMF Press Release, Anadolu Agency, NTV, AFP - 07/05/03)

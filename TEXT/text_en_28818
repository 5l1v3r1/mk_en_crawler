 ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou said that Greece may have to use a proposed EU-IMF financial aid package. In an interview with the Athens-based daily To Vima on Sunday (April 11th), Papandreou said resorting to the mechanism is not his country's " first option " , but it may be needed. " The question remains whether this mechanism will convince markets ... if it does not convince them, it is a mechanism that it is there to be used, " the Greek prime minister said. Eurozone leaders agreed last month on a potential aid package for Athens, including a combination of bilateral loans from eurozone states and financial assistance from the IMF. 
 On Friday, Italy and France voiced their support for Greece. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said after talks with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in Paris that the EU is ready to activate its finance mechanism the moment Athens asks for it. (Reuters, AP, AFP - 10/04/10)

TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition resumed its anti-government protests with a rally in the town of Elbasan on Friday (November 26th). Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama told the crowd that the protest is against corruption. The opposition also accused the cabinet of failing to convince the EU to grant Albania candidate status. The bloc decided in November to lift visa requirements for Albanians citizens but stopped short of granting candidate status. The opposition bloc, led by the SP, still insists on a thorough investigation of the June 2009 general elections, which they believe were marred by serious violations.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Parliament Speaker and Acting President and Jakup Krasniqi said on Tuesday (October 19th) that resolving the current institutional crisis depends on the will of the parties in parliament. After a regular meeting of the parliament's presidency, Krasniqi confirmed that he had earlier supported extraordinary elections in order to end the crisis "but only if political parties reach consensus on that, not by attempting to impose the elections". 
In other news Tuesday, the International Civilian Office (ICO) urged Kosovo leaders to organise elections in accordance with international standards. The ICO has not taken a position yet on whether it supports the early elections called for February 13th or snap elections before the end of this year. That became a real possibility after former President Fatmir Sedju's Democratic League of Kosovo decided at the weekend to leave the ruling coalition. (BBC, Zeri, Koha Ditore, Epoka e Re - 20/10/10)

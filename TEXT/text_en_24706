ANKARA, Turkey -- The army has submitted a list of objections to President Abdullah Gul regarding a controversial law that limits the power of military courts, local newspapers reported on Sunday (July 5th). Parliament adopted the bill late last month at the request of the ruling Justice and Development Party. The measure paves the way for civilian courts to prosecute military personnel in peace time for anti-government activities, threats to national security, constitutional violations and organised crime. The law also transfers the power to try civilians in peace time for offences currently under the military penal code to civilian courts. The army said the law violates Article 145 of the constitution, which regulates the functioning of the military judiciary. "This article clearly states that the military courts are obliged to deal with all crimes committed by military personnel in military zones," the General Staff said.

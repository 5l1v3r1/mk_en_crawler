PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Several thousand ethnic Albanians gathered in Pristina on Saturday (March 2nd) to protest UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for the future of Kosovo. The demonstration was organised by the Vetevendosja ("Self-determination") group and was peaceful, unlike a previous protest two weeks ago. Vetevendosja wants the government to stop negotiations with Serbia and proclaim Kosovo an independent state. The protesters also demanded an end to the UN presence in the province. Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Agim Ceku had both called for a boycott of the demonstration, arguing that any violence would block the Ahtisaari plan's path to independence.

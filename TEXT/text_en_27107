ANKARA, Turkey -- Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdish autonomous region in northern Iraq, said on Saturday (August 1st) the armed campaign against Turkey could be forced to stop if Ankara extends democratic rights to the Kurdish community. "Anyone knows that this problem cannot be settled through war and violence. More blood will be shed if military options remain the only means to find a solution to the problem," Barzani told the newspaper Sabah. Ankara's plans for reforms extending the rights and freedoms of the Kurdish community will be the key to overcoming the 25-year conflict with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), Barzani added.

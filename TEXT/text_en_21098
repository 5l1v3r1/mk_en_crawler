SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country's tripartite presidency will resume consultations this week on choosing a new state-level prime minister and future government, the presidency's press office announced on Sunday (December 2nd). Council of Ministers Chairman Nikola Spiric resigned on November 1st to protest new quorum rules proposed by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak. The government has since been functioning with an interim mandate, bringing cabinet work largely to a standstill. On Saturday, Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik -- who leads the main RS party, the Union of Independent Social Democrats -- indicated the party might again propose Spiric. Several other parties, including Bosniak ones, seem to support the idea. (RTRS, Fena, NTV Hayat - 02/12/07)

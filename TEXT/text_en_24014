WASHINGTON, United States -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has called on Cypriot leaders to reach a solution reunifying the divided island as soon as possible, US State Department spokesman Robert Wood said on Thursday (April 16th). On Wednesday, Clinton met with Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat to discuss the progress of ongoing direct reunification talks. "She expressed her support for both sides' efforts to build on the momentum," Wood said. Clinton reaffirmed Washington's support for a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation, he added.
Talat said after the meeting that Turkish Cypriots intend to solve the issue by the end of this year and that he would welcome the appointment of a US envoy to Cyprus. Clinton is expected to meet with Cypriot Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou in Washington on Monday.
In other news, campaigning ends on Friday in the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, ahead of Sunday's parliamentary elections. Turkish Cypriot voters are to elect 50 members of parliament. The latest polls gave the right-wing opposition National Unity Party (UBP) a 17-point lead over Talat's ruling Republican Turkish Party. Observers say a victory by the UBP may seriously impede the pace of reunification talks, given its harder-line and nationalist stance on reunification.

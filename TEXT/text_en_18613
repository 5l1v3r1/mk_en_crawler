PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Stoyanka Radovic, special prosecutor for the fight against organised crime, indicted 18 people Thursday (December 7th) on charges of anti-state and anti-constitutional activity and terror acts. Most of the defendants were arrested back in September, on the eve of Montenegro's general election. Prosecutors say the group planned to provoke riots and instability on Election Day, in a bid to create a region in which the Albanian minority would enjoy special status.

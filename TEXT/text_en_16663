ATHENS, Greece -- Immigrant and anti-racist organisations rallied in Athens on Saturday (October 7th), seeking more rights for immigrant children who are born in Greece. They want birth certificates for the children and registration with Greek municipalities, allowing better educational opportunities and living conditions. Local media recently reported that nearly 200,000 children of immigrants in Greece have no citizenship and risk deportation. 
In other news, pre-school and primary education teachers in Greece decided on Saturday to continue their protests for a fourth week. They are demanding a 40% salary hike. The government says it lacks sufficient funding. (Naftemporiki - 08/10/06; ANA-MPA - 07/10/06)

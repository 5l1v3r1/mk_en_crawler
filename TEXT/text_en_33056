ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A suspected gas explosion at a snack bar in downtown Istanbul injured at least seven people Thursday (22 May) and shattered the windows of nearby shops and cars in the Harbiye district. The exact cause of the blast -- so powerful that it threw the snack bar's refrigerators into the street -- was still under investigation, but Mayor Mustafa Sarigul said a leak from a gas canister used to cook food was the most likely cause. The blast came just two days after a suicide bomber blew herself up in a cafe in Ankara. (AP, Reuters - 22/05/03)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Former Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz went on trial Wednesday (16 February) to answer charges stemming from a banking scandal. He and former Economy Minister Gunes Taner are accused of determining in advance who should win the tender for Turkbank and resorting to the services of a mafia boss to scare off unwanted bidders. A defence motion to throw out the charges on procedural grounds was rejected. 
Also Wednesday, the ruling Justice and Development Party announced that it has accepted the resignation of Tourism and Culture Minister Erkan Mumcu and appointed Education Minister Huseyin Celik as a temporary replacement. Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin, however, denied that there was any major rift between Mumcu and the rest of the cabinet.
In other news, the Turkish Human Rights Association asked authorities to investigate what it described as excessive force used by the police against Kurdish demonstrators on Tuesday. Police used tear gas and physical force to break up protests by activists demanding the release of jailed terrorist Abdullah Ocalan. One person was killed.

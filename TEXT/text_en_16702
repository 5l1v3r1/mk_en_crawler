MOSCOW, Russia -- Media reports Friday (9 June) said authorities have extradited a Serb war crimes suspect, wanted by the UN tribunal, to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Former police officer Dragan Zelenovic is charged with the rape and torture of Muslim women at a prison camp in Foca during the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH. He faces seven counts of violations of the laws or customs of war and seven counts of crimes against humanity. He was discovered in Siberia last August while working at construction sites under an assumed name. In a statement to the UN Security Council earlier this week, chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte criticised Russia for "unexplained delays" in his transfer.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The coalition agreement between the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), the Croatian Peasant Party and the Social Liberal Party will likely be signed on Monday (January 7th), sources from the three parties said on Wednesday. The final document should be ready within a couple of days and eventually approved by the three parties' ruling authorities. The HDZ has also started negotiations with representatives of ethnic minorities, who announced they would join any coalition that manages to cobble together a majority in parliament, following inconclusive elections in late November.

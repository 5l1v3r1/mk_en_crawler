TIRANA, Albania -- Socialist Party (SP) undersecretary Ilir Beqja accused the government Thursday (February 14th) of failing to curb inflation and of not reacting properly to surging bread prices. Beqja said his party is concerned by seemingly contradictory positions held by senior government officials regarding the prices: some blame it on global price hikes, while others say the prices are temporary.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian government approved a draft law Thursday (29 May) on the prosecution of war criminals in local courts. Parliament is expected to approve the law in June. It foresees establishing a special prosecution office as well as a detention centre at the Belgrade District Court.
In other news, the district court announced that Franko Simatovic, a former Red Beret commander with the State Security Department, would be handed over to The Hague. He was charged along with colleague Jovica Stanisic with war crimes in Croatia from 1991 to 1995.
Meanwhile, former Bosnian Serb Gen Momir Talic died Thursday of cancer in Belgrade. Talic, a war crimes indictee, was granted provisional release by the UN tribunal in September, allowing him to undergo treatment. (FoNet - 30/05/03; Tanjug, BBC, AP, AFP, RTRS - 29/05/03)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliamentary committees started hearings Wednesday (October 28th) on nominees to the new cabinet proposed by Prime Minister-designate Lucian Croitoru. Six of the proposed ministers have been discussed, but only two got positive votes. Vasile Blaga, nominated to remain as regional development minister, won approval with support from the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians. Blaga is a close friend of President Traian Basescu and is overseeing his re-election campaign. Career diplomat Bogdan Aurescu got high marks for the foreign affairs portfolio. 
The hearings will continue Thursday and Friday if necessary, ahead of a vote by the full parliament next week. Cabinet approval is not expected. (Evenimentul Zilei, Romania Libera - 29/10/09; Mediafax, Hotnews.ro - 28/10/09)

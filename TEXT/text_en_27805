LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- An official request to hold a referendum on the arbitration border agreement with Croatia was submitted to parliament Monday (April 26th), backed by almost all lawmakers. Parliament has now seven days to decide on the motion and to pick a date for the referendum, most likely on June 6th. The Slovenian parliament ratified the document a week ago, months after Croatian lawmakers did. Under the agreement, the maritime border dispute will be subject to international arbitration.

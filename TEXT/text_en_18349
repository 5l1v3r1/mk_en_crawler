BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso called on Romanian leaders Tuesday (June 12th) to ensure political stability for the sake of the country's reforms and international credibility. Barroso met with Romanian Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu in Brussels. Romania, he said, must focus on the restructuring of its judiciary and on fighting corruption. Barroso denied speculation that the judicial safeguard clause might be activated, saying no decision had been made yet. (Ziua, Romania Libera, Adevarul, Evenimentul Zilei - 13/06/07)

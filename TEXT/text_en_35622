ZAGREB, Croatia -- A court in Osijek sentenced a former Croatian soldier to 12 years in prison for war crimes on Thursday (8 April). Nikola Ivankovic was found guilty of murdering 19 Serb civilians in the nearby village of Paulin Dvor in December 1991. Co-defendant Enes Viteskic was acquitted.
In other news, Croatian national television broadcast a videotape on Wednesday showing retired General Ante Gotovina, one of the UN tribunal's top suspects, accusing his troops of being "barbarians and vandals". The tape was shot in Knin on 6 August 1995, a day after the city was overrun by Croatian forces under Gotovina's command. He went into hiding in 2001 when the UN tribunal charged him with war crimes.

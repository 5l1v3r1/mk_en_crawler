SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The EU integration process would be slowed if parliamentary debate on adoption of the decentralisation laws package fails, said outgoing EU Special Representative in Skopje Soren Jessen-Petersen. At a farewell news conference Tuesday (20 July), he urged the opposition to be reasonable and not try to obstruct the passage and implementation of the decentralisation law. He added that authorities and political parties should overcome differences and focus on Macedonia's most acute problem -- the economy. Jessen-Petersen next takes up a post in Kosovo.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Former Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg denied on Tuesday (20 June) that a controversial Italian businessman, Pier Paolo Cerani, had financed Saxe-Coburg's party, NMS-II, a junior partner in Bulgaria's coalition cabinet. Cerani is linked to a corruption scandal in Italy. The Bulgarian channel bTV has reported that Cerani contributed funding to the party last year, in exchange for concessions awarded to his business interests in Bulgaria. It has also broadcast a transcript of a purported phone conversation between Cerani and Saxe-Coburg's cousin, Italian Crown Prince Victor Emmanuel, who was arrested in Italy last week for suspected corruption.

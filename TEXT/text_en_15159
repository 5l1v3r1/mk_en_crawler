HELSINKI, Finland -- The Finnish government, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, is working with Turkey on a deal regarding Cyprus that could avert the threat of suspension of accession talks. Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen told parliament on Thursday (28 September) that he has began an effort to end economic sanctions against the Turkish Cypriots in exchange for Ankara's opening of its ports and seaports to Cypriot traffic. According to media reports, the statement may signal a policy shift. (EUobserver - 29/09/06)

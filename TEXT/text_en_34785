NEW YORK, United States -- Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte told the UN Security Council on Friday (8 August) that creating a separate prosecution office for Rwanda would undermine the independence of prosecutors. According to international media reports, she asked the Council not to endorse a proposal by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan that would establish independent prosecution offices for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The Associated Press reported that following her statement, US Deputy Permanent Representative James Cunningham told the Council that the United States would submit a draft resolution backing Annan's proposal and calling for a renewal of del Ponte's contract as chief prosecutor for the Yugoslavia cases.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The opposition submitted a motion for a vote of no confidence Monday (October 15th) against the cabinet over its failure to resolve the ongoing teachers' strike. It has dragged into its fourth week, despite several rounds of negotiations with unions representing the teachers. The motion is supported by members of the Union of Democratic Forces, Democrats for Strong Bulgaria and Attack. In order for the cabinet to be brought down, the opposition needs 121 votes. It has about half that so far. (Sega, Trud, Dnevnik, 24 Chasa - 16/10/07; Focus, BGNES, Darik - 15/10/07)

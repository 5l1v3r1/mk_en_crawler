BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Milorad "Legija" Lukovic, a former police special operations commander and reputed senior underworld figure, appeared before a court in Belgrade on Monday (14 June) to plead not guilty in the March 2003 murder of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. Lukovic told the judges that he had nothing to do with the assassination and attempted to distance himself from the Zemun Clan crime gang, which the government has implicated in the murder. Separately, he tried to implicate some of Djindjic's closest associates in drug dealing, claiming they had instructed him to sell police-held heroin abroad to raise revenues for the state.

TIRANA, Albania -- The new OSCE head in Tirana, Eugen Wollfarth, has urged the government to start preparing for next spring's local elections. "It is necessary to start early administrative preparations in line with OSCE recommendations," Wollfarth said on Wednesday (September 29th) after meeting with Prime Minister Sali Berisha. Wollfarth promised continued OSCE support for reforms until Albania meets OSCE standards. The German diplomat became head of the OSCE Presence in Albania two weeks ago, replacing Robert Bosch, whose mandate ended. (Lajmifundit, Top News, Balkan Web, Alsat - 29/09/10)

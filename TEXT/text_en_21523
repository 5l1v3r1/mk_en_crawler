PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Newly appointed UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier held his first official meeting with government leaders Monday (June 23rd). "My first step is to understand how UNMIK has been built, and then I will continue with completing the tasks of the mission but always considering the newly created circumstances on the ground," Zannier said after meeting with President Fatmir Sejdiu, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci. Zannier said that he would work closely with the EU's EULEX mission to reconfigure UNMIK. Sejdiu said Pristina is offering institutional support to Zannier. "The process of UNMIK's reconfiguration will be very short, taking only a few months," the president said after the meeting. He reiterated that Kosovo will reject any new status negotiations with Belgrade. (Koha Ditore, Express, Zeri, Lajm - 24/06/08)

TIRANA, Albania -- The nominee for US ambassador to Albania, Alexander Arvizu, said Thursday (August 5th) during his hearings at the US Senate that Albania is a success story, but politicians in Tirana need to look beyond their rivalry and focus on the interests of their country. The diplomat said he would work to improve the relations between the United States and Albania. Albania, as a NATO member, needs to follow the high principles of the Alliance, and show respect for the rule of law and independent institutions, Arvizu said. He also spoke about the difficult 20-year transition of Albania, its engagement in Afghanistan alongside American soldiers, and its role in the Balkans. Arvizu was nominated by US President Barack Obama last month to replace outgoing Ambassador John Withers. (VoA, BBC, Balkan Web, Top Channel, Telegrafi, Lajmifundit - 05/08/10)

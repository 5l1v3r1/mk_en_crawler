The UN war crimes tribunal on Wednesday (October 11th) rejected a request by the Croatian government, which wanted to be appointed amicus curiae (friend of the court) in the trial of Jadranko Prlic and five other Bosnian Croats. They are accused of murder, torture, and persecution of Muslims in southeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
"Most of the matters contemplated by Croatia fell outside the scope of the indictment against the accused," the three judges ruled. Furthermore, they added, "it is not in the interest of justice to authorise a country, whose former political and military leaders are mentioned in the indictment as members of a joint criminal enterprise, to intervene in the procedure." 
The legal phrase amicus curiae refers to someone who is not a party to the litigation, but who believes that the court's final decision might affect its interests. The amicus curiae can present its views and legal and historical arguments, clarifying its role and position during the events in question. 
The Hague's rejection was met with disappointment in Zagreb. Croatia sought involvement because the indictment in both cases refers to the late Franjo Tudjman -- the first president of independent Croatia and founder of the ruling HDZ party -- as planning a Greater Croatia that would absorb a self-proclaimed Croat entity in neighbouring BiH. Croatian leaders, as well as many ordinary citizens, object to the allegations. Zagreb had hoped to engage national legal experts and historians who would dispute them. 
The Croatian government also has asked for amicus curiae status in the upcoming trial of former generals Ante Gotovina, Mladen Markac and Ivan Cermak, who are accused of murdering and expelling Serb civilians during a 1995 military operation. No ruling has been made on that request.

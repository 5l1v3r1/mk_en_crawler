SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The National Security Agency (NSA) on Friday (October 10th) admitted it illegally monitored journalists and wiretapped their phones while investigating leaks of classified information to the media. Surveillance of journalists was "unjustified", NSA spokeswoman Zoya Dimitrova said. "Information has been collected about people, companies and media that can hardly be considered to have any relation to the aim of the investigation," she added.

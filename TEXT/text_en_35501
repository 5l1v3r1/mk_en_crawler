BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serb police on Wednesday (14 April) raided several firms suspected of helping war criminals evade justice. The interior ministry says the operation was conducted on a warrant from a local court. Police raided the premises of the Sveti Jovan radio station, owned by Radovan Karadzic's daughter Sonja, the Jahorina insurance company, and the Srpske Sume forestry company. The court ordered the police to seize all financial documents pertaining to the radio station's operations since 1 January 2003. According to witnesses, police took a computer and several files from Sveti Jovan. The home of a Bosnian Serb Interior Ministry official was also searched. Also Wednesday, the members of BiH's tripartite presidency issued a statement. "We shall do our best to ensure the apprehension of war crimes suspects and we call on them to surrender voluntarily," it read. (OHR Sources, Dnevni avaz - 15/04/04; Reuters, AFP - 14/04/04)

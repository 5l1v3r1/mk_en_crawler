TIRANA, Albania -- Defence Minister Pandeli Majko has called for a larger military budget in light of NATO-oriented reforms, according to press reports Tuesday (28 December). Following the Albania-NATO Third Military Convention in Tirana last week, Majko stressed that implementation of NATO standards is closely linked to the country's security and its chances of joining Euro-Atlantic structures. 
In other news, it appears that efforts to agree on electoral reform by year's end have failed. Weekend negotiations between the ruling Socialist Party and the main opposition Democratic Party resulted in no agreement. The main sticking point is the division of electoral zones.

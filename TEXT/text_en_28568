VIENNA, Austria -- The OSCE urged Turkey on Tuesday (September 14th) to free all journalists serving time in its jails and to enforce amendments to its media law, amid a growing number of media-related lawsuits. "Currently there are more than 40 journalists in prison, and hundreds of others are facing lawsuits with potential imprisonment if convicted," Dunja Mijatovic, the OSCE's media freedom representative, said in a letter to Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu. Though recognising the "threat posed by terrorism to national security and the need to fight it", Mijatovic stressed "the right of the public to know of matters of public importance".

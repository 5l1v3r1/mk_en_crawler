TIRANA, Albania -- The government has decided to pay 417m euros in compensation to victims of the communist regime, according to an announcement Sunday (December 2nd). President Bamir Topi decreed the law on compensating victims of political persecution Friday. The payouts will start in 2008 and will continue for eight years. In next year's budget, the government has allocated approximately 8.25m euros for the cause. The families of the estimated 2,000 people killed under communist rule will receive compensation, as will the more than 15,000 Albanians imprisoned during Enver Hoxha's regime.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian Democratic Union on Sunday (17 October) nominated Deputy Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor, 51, as its candidate for president. The far-right Croatian Bloc announced Saturday that it has chosen Ivic Pasalic, a close associate of the late Franjo Tudjman. Miroslav "Ciro" Blazevic, who led Croatia's soccer team to third place in the 1998 World Cup, will run as an independent. Incumbent Stipe Mesic has not yet announced his intentions, but observers believe he will seek one more term. The election is scheduled for 21 December.

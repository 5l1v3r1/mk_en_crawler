SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A no-confidence motion against the Bulgarian cabinet failed Wednesday (19 April), following a lengthy parliamentary debate the day before. Only 61 MPs voted for the cabinet to be dismissed, while 166 provided their support and 1 MP abstained. The motion came from the right-wing opposition bloc, which accused the cabinet of failing to prevent or respond to recent flooding, and claimed that corruption and embezzlement had marred funding flood recovery projects. The ruling coalition has denied the accusations. (bTV, BNR, BTA - 18/04/06)

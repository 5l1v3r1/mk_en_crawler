TIRANA, Albania -- Two minor rightist parties -- the New Democratic Party (NDP) and the Christian Democratic Party (CDP) -- announced on Wednesday (31 August) their decision to form a joint caucus in the new parliament. The joint group will have a total of 8 deputies -- six from the NDP and two from the CDP -- and will be led by the NDP's Nard Ndoka. Both formations are allies of the major Democratic Party, which won the July parliamentary elections, and will be part of the future DP-led coalition government. (Albanian News - 01/09/05)

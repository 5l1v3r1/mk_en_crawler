ANKARA, Turkey -- World Bank country director for Turkey Andrew Vorkink said on Sunday (13 November) that Turkey's economic development has entered a new era. Commenting on the latest European Commission (EC) progress report, Vorkink said the country has not only moved to another level in government policy, but also to another level economically, one that resulted in the EC declaring Turkey -- for the first time-- as a "functioning market economy". That, he said, should result in a surge in foreign investment. (Turkish Daily News - 14/11/05)

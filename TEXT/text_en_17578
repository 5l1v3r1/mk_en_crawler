SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina -- EUFOR Commander Rear Admiral Hans-Jochen Witthauer and BiH Minister of Traffic and Communications Bozo Ljubic are in Paris on Friday (April 20th) to seal a protocol that would hand over the command of BiH air space to local authorities for the first time in 12 years. Taking control over airspace is further proof that BiH has made significant progress since Dayton, Witthauer said. BiH would take over control of its middle sky (3,000-8,000m) but due to a lack of proper equipment, would continue to pay Serbia to help control its upper sky (over 8,000m). 
In other news, the BiH Security Ministry announced on Thursday that all people who were stripped of their BiH citizenship under a government decision announced last week must leave the country immediately or face deportation. The government revoked the citizenship of more than 300 people, most of whom were Mujahideen soldiers granted citizenship under questionable circumstances during the 1992-1995 conflict.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Malaysia is the latest country to recognise Kosovo's independence. Foreign Minister Rais Yatim said on Friday (October 31st) that diplomatic relations with the young country will be established "at the right time". Serbia reacted on Saturday by giving Malaysia's ambassador to Belgrade 48 hours to leave. 
In other news, Japan and the UN decided on Friday to donate $3.05m to improve living conditions of minority groups and support the peaceful and sustainable development of Kosovo. The aid will finance projects aimed at promoting ethnic reconciliation and helping residents become independent through initiatives such as job training and subsidies to establish small enterprises.

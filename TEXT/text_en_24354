SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EU foreign ministers are likely to approve Austrian diplomat Valentin Inzko's nomination as new high representative and EU special representative to BiH at their meeting in Brussels next week, local newspapers reported on Monday (March 9th). Afterwards, the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) will confirm the appointment at its March 25th session, the press said. The nomination also requires the support of the non-EU PIC members -- Russia, the United States and Turkey. Inzko has just completed consultations in Washington and will hold similar talks in Moscow. Officials want to move quickly, as reforms have completely stalled since incumbent High Representative Miroslav Lajcak announced his resignation in early February. 
Croatian Democratic Union leader Dragan Covic said on Monday that leaders of the three largest parties will not meet again regarding EU-related and constitutional reforms before that PIC session. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 09/03/09)

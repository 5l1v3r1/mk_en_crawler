TIRANA, Albania -- A 45-year-old woman died on Tuesday (January 6th) in Polican, Albania, following a blast inside an ammunition-dismantling depot, prompting Defence Minister Gazmend Oketa to call on Wednesday for stricter safeguards. The dismantling centre is preparing to start a long process to reduce the large amount of old ammunition still present in Albania. In mid-March, a huge explosion at a depot in Gerdec, 20km north of Tirana, killed 25 people and destroyed more than 300 homes and businesses in the area.

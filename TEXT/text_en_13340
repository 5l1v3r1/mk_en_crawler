NEW YORK, United States -- Croatian Foreign Affairs and EU Integration Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic delivered a lecture Thursday (22 September) on Zagreb's foreign policy at Columbia University in New York. She stressed that Croatia has made real progress in its preparations for membership in NATO and the EU, and has managed to establish a functioning democracy and a market economy. She asserted her government is working hard to implement its action plan to locate fugitive retired General Ante Gotovina and thus remove the last obstacle to opening membership talks with the EU. As for the border dispute with Slovenia, she noted Croatia prefers it to be referred to an international arbitration court, but for the time being Slovenia opposes this solution. (Index - 23/09/05)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The leader of the main opposition Social Democratic Party, Ivica Racan, suggested on Saturday (17 December) that early parliamentary elections could take place in 2006, a year earlier than scheduled. Speaking at a news conference, Racan said that while the start of EU accession talks is a true success, the ruling HDZ is failing to ensure the country's economic and democratic development.

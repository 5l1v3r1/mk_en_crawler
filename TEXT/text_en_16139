ATHENS, Greece -- Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku was in Athens on Wednesday (November 15th) to press for independence from Serbia. "Kosovo will become democratic, functional and multiethnic as well as a stabilising factor in the region," he told Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis."These are enough and important reasons to welcome Kosovo in the world community of nations." Good neighbourly relations with EU member Greece are of the highest importance for Kosovo, he added.
For her part, Bakoyannis said her country would support "a solution that is acceptable for both parties and that is in favour of everybody".
Meanwhile, UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari addressed the Permanent Council of the OSCE in Vienna on Wednesday, explaining his decision to postpone presenting his blueprint for Kosovo's future until after Serbia's legislative elections in January. He next travelled to Italy to meet with officals there. (Tanjug, ANA-MPA, Beta, Fonet - 15/11/06)

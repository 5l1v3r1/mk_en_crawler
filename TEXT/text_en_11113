NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The UN will start reducing its peacekeeping force in Cyprus this week, according to UN spokesman Brian Kelly. After Greek Cypriots rejected a UN reunification plan for the island last April, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said the force would be downsized by about a third, from the current 1,230 to 900 by the end of January. The remaining troops will retain their original mandate of maintaining order and preventing the renewal of interethnic fighting.
On Saturday (29 January), Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was in Davos where he reiterated that a withdrawal of Turkish troops from the northern part of the island is not under consideration for the time being. (TurkishPress.com - 29/01/05; NTV - 28/01/05; AFP - 27/01/05)

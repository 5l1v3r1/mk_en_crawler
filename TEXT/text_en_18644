SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia's largest opposition party, the Social Democratic Alliance for Macedonia (SDSM), threatened to leave parliament on Monday (February 12th), unless the ruling majority withdraws a motion that would impose time limits on deputies' discussions. The party says the idea is intended to silence the opposition. Two weeks ago, the main ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic Union for Integration, withdrew its representatives from parliament and has threatened to suspend participation in all state institutions.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Foreign Minister Adrian Cioroianu says Bucharest wants to serve as a bridge between Belgrade, the EU and NATO. He told AFP on Tuesday (February 26th) that as a member of both the EU and NATO, Romania can "deliver Serbia's messages to international organisations and to EU member states. At the same time, we can present to the Serbian side the concerns and expectations of our Euro-Atlantic partners". Romania -- along with Spain, Slovakia and Cyprus -- has refused to recognise Kosovo's independence.
Also Tuesday, the Romanian Senate adopted a motion demanding measures to boost living standards. The motion, tabled by the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD), says the government should curb natural gas prices and protect low income sections of the population.

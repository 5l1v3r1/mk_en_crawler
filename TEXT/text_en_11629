BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn vowed on Tuesday (19 July) that the EU would extend assistance to Bulgaria and Romania, which have been battered by torrential rains and devastating floods this month. Rehn says the EU is prepared to grant at least 20m euros to Romania for rebuilding of the crisis areas, but mentioned no specific figure for Bulgaria.

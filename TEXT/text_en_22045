SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The air carrier Macedonian Air Transport (MAT) has been banned from flying charters to the popular Greek tourist destination of Corfu this summer. MAT received a letter Wednesday (April 16th) from the Greek Transport Ministry, informing it that the company will not be allowed to fly to the island between June and August under its current name. MAT says this is the first open ban by Greece on flights from Macedonia, which MAT describes as a violation of international law. It appears to be the latest round in the long-standing name dispute between the two countries.
In other news Wednesday, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Macedonia will be admitted to NATO as soon as it resolves that dispute. Rice reiterated calls to overcome differences between the two sides. The dispute sank Macedonia's membership bid at the Alliance's recent summit in Bucharest. UN envoy Matthew Nimetz returns to Skopje on Thursday to assess the situation before heading to Athens on Friday. (Vecer - 17/04/08; Tanjug, A1, Makfax, Naftemporiki - 16/04/08)

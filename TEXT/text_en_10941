BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Talks on key police reform in BiH will continue in mid-August and will be held at institutional level, it was announced Friday (29 July), after a meeting that High Representative Paddy Ashdown, BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic and representatives of the BiH, Republika Srpska (RS) and Federation of BiH governments held the previous night. Ashdown and Terzic called for Thursday's meeting in Banja Luka to hammer out the next steps in the stalled police restructuring process. The RS cabinet issued a statement Friday saying participants decided that negotiations would include BiH institutions only. International officials will attend the next meetings if technical assistance is needed. Terzic said that if necessary, talks would be held daily until all aspects of police reform is achieved. The reform is crucial to starting Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with the EU this autumn. (Dnevni avaz - 30/07/05; Fena, RTRS, PBS BiH - 29/07/05)

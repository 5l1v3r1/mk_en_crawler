TIRANA, Albania -- Local elections fell short of international standards, observers from the OSCE and the Council of Europe said in a joint statement issued on Monday (February 19th). In particular, they cited problems with the voter lists that disenfranchised many on Sunday. The observers also complained that the vote was held in an atmosphere of tension and distrust between the main political players. The vote was "a missed opportunity" to show Albania is capable of holding free and fair elections, OSCE mission head Jorgen Grunnet said at a press conference in Tirana.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha had praised the election shortly before the release of the observers' report, describing it as the "best ever held in post-communist Albania". (Albanian News - 20/02/07; AFP, AP, OSCE website, CoE website, RFE - 19/02/07)

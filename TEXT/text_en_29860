PODGORICA, Montenegro -- A judge in Podgorica on Saturday (December 25th) remanded Budva Mayor Rajko Kuljaca, Deputy Mayor Dragan Marovic and eight other municipal officials to 30 days in custody. They are suspected of abuse of office, stemming from illegal construction on the Zavala peninsula. Prosecutors say the suspects have siphoned off more than 11m euros. Dragan Marovic is the brother of Deputy Prime Minister Svetozar Marovic, who resigned on December 21st, along with Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic. All of those detained deny the allegations.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Presidential elections will be held on December 27th, the cabinet decided during its session Friday (October 30th). If a run-off is required, it will be held on January 10th. The decision sets potential candidates in motion, beginning 12 days allotted them to collect signatures from their backers. Authorities then have two days to verify those signatures before formal campaigning begins. Incumbent President Stipe Mesic is wrapping up his second term and cannot seek re-election.

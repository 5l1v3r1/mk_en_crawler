BUCHAREST, Romania -- The objective of adopting the single European currency in 2015 must be maintained, President Traian Basescu said in a TV interview Wednesday (April 27th). He added the target could be achieved by maintaining the pace of reform implementation. The cabinet will consider the issue Friday.
Basescu also insisted on the importance of reforming state-controlled companies, in line with the new precautionary agreement with the IMF. He also emphasised that the 2011 deadline for Schengen area admission remains in effect and blamed the delay on Bulgaria. (Ziare, Ziarul Financiar, Cotidianul, Romania Libera - 28/04/11)

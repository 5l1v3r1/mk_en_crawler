BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European foreign ministers on Monday (April 27th) officially discussed for the first time the border conflict between Croatia and Slovenia, which has resulted in a stalling of Zagreb's accession talks since December. EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn presented his latest proposal on resolving the conflict and said he expects member states to back it. He calls for the establishment of a five-member arbitrage panel to decide the issue. The foreign ministers did not offer a final response following the discussions because of opposition from Slovenia. Other EU members are pressuring Slovenia to offer a more constructive approach that would enable the resumption of negotiations with Croatia.

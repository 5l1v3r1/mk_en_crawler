PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Special envoy Miroslav Lajcak presented the EU's proposal for the Montenegrin independence referendum Wednesday (15 February). It reportedly stipulates a 55 per cent threshold for a "yes" vote on independence to succeed. According to media reports, it also recommends that the poll present only one question, which would ask whether the voter favours an independent and internationally recognised Montenegro. The EU is proposing to hold the poll on 14 May, to coincide with local elections in the republic. The ruling coalition wants the referendum held in early April and has called for a lower, 41 per cent margin of support by eligible voters. Separately, Montenegro agreed on Wednesday that the OSCE would monitor the referendum. (Politika - 16/02/06; Mina, Tanjug, Beta - 15/02/06)

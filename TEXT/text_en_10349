THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Judges at the UN war crimes tribunal decided Friday (22 October) to adjourn the trial of Slobodan Milosevic for another two weeks. The proceedings, which started in February 2002, are set to resume on 9 November. The judges made the ruling at the request of the defendant's court-appointed lawyers, who were unable to persuade witnesses to testify during that period. (AFP - 22/10/04)

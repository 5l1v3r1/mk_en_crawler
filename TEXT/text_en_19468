SOFIA, Bulgaria -- As expected, the cabinet won a vote of no confidence on Friday (February 22nd). In all, 149 parliamentary members supported the government, while 86 voted against it, with no abstentions. Opposition and independent MPs cited rampant corruption and organised crime as reasons for the no confidence vote, the fourth since April 2006. (BTA, BNR, Darik - 22/02/08)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Bosnian Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj said on Saturday (July 10th) that Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) will delay its EU membership application until it receives more positive signals from Brussels. Speaking on the sidelines of the Croatia Summit, he told Reuters that EU membership remains BiH's strategic goal, but noted that "the European Commission is very reluctant to accept the application ... as long as the OHR [Office of the High Representative] is present." Alkalaj added that the general elections in October amount to another delaying factor. (Reuters, RTRS, Srna - 10/07/10)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic confirmed on Friday (May 11th) that he has nominated Vojislav Kostunica, the leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), for a second term as prime minister. The nomination came after Tadic's Democratic Party (DS), the DSS-New Serbia coalition and G17 Plus struck a last-minute deal to form a democratic coalition cabinet. Tadic also said he expected the legislature to vote on the new government by Monday, the legal deadline. 
The EU leadership and the United States have welcomed the agreement among the democratic bloc parties. Both voiced hope that the future Serbian cabinet would resume key reforms leading toward the relaunch of Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with the EU. 
Meanwhile, a special session of the Serbian Parliament got under way in Belgrade Sunday (May 13th), focusing on the democratic bloc's demand for dismissal of Tomislav Nikolic as parliamentary speaker. The DS has proposed Oliver Dulic for the post. (Beta, B92 - 12/05/07; Tanjug, RTS - 11/05/07)

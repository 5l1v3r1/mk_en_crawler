SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament is expected to adopt by the end of this week the new law on files from the Communist era-State Security's archive, according to media reports Tuesday (December 5th). Late last month, the legislature passed the draft in the second reading, but a few issues must be ironed out before the third, final reading. On Monday, Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev consulted for hours with the heads of the national security services and the chairpersons of the caucuses of partners within the ruling coalition.

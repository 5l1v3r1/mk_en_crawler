ANKARA, Turkey -- Main highways were blocked on Sunday (February 17th), as well as airports and docks, due to a snow storm that began on Saturday. In some parts of the country, temperatures fell to 20 degrees Celsius below zero. The main highway connecting Istanbul and Edirne was closed, as was the road between Ankara and the town of Konya. Thousands of towns and villages are cut off from the rest of the country due to the snow. 
Greece was also hit by heavy snow and wind-whipped drifts, blocking roads and keeping ships in port. In Athens, which rarely sees snow, the airport closed, as did schools. (DPA, AFP, Anadolu news agency, Sky, ANA-MPA, ERT, Nafthemporiki, News In, Antena - 17/02/08)

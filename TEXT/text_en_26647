PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu on Monday (November 9th) urged Kosovo Serbs to participate in the November 15th municipal elections. Following a meeting of the Consultative Council for Communities, Sejdiu said "It is in their interest to participate."
Local media reported on Tuesday that a group of 100 intellectuals from Serbia is encouraging Kosovo Serbs to participate in the vote. "Only through active participation in Kosovo's political life, the Serb community could efficiently solve its crucial everyday problems -- status and property rights, and economic, social (educational and health care) and other issues," said a statement from the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia.

TIMISOARA, Romania -- The first unit of 10 Romanian troops specialising in nuclear, chemical and biological decontamination left the western district of Timisoara on Friday (4 April) to join the US-led campaign against Iraq. The mission will reportedly operate only in Kuwait and would not participate in combat. In all, Romania is expected to contribute 55 decontamination specialists to the effort and will provide local military bases for use by coalition flights and personnel. (Rompres - 04/04/03)

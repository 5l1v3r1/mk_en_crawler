General questions 

1.  What is the current situation with regard to right of establishment and cross-border supplies of services in your country for EU credit institutions? Which conditions apply? Are there specific conditions regarding the opening of branches by foreign banks? Regarding the establishment of a foreign subsidiary? 
European Union credit institutions can establish banks and subsidiaries in the Republic of Macedonia. According to Article 4, paragraph 6 of the Banking Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 63/00, 103/00, 37/02, 51/03, 85/03), subsidiaries are legal persons registered in the Republic of Macedonia (commercial presence) in which other persons or groups work together and have: a) 50% or over of the voting shares; and, b) common interest as defined in Article 2, paragraph 7.  Cross-border (direct) service provision is not allowed. With the accession of the Republic of Macedonia to the European Union, the credit institutions of the European Union member states will be allowed to provide cross-border services.  Foreign bank service provision through branches is not allowed for the time being. According to the Banking Law (Article 2, paragraph 19), a branch is an organisational unit, legally dependent on the bank which directly performs financial or part of financial activities. In line with the obligations assumed for the accession of the Republic of Macedonia in the World Trade Organisation, provision of services through foreign bank branches will be allowed on 1 January 2008 the latest. By then, the legislation regarding European Union and third country credit institution branches will have been transposed.  As regards the establishment of a foreign bank subsidiary, there are no restrictions related to their right to establishment and provision of services. Foreign bank subsidiaries are established under the same conditions and in the same procedure that apply to banks founded by domestic legal and natural persons. (Article 6, paragraphs 8 and 19, part 1 of the Banking Law, Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 63/00,103/00, 37/02, 51/03). In addition to documents from Article 15 (for more details see 03_II_A_8), foreign bank subsidiaries in process of establishing have to submit: 1) evidence that the foreign bank establishing the subsidiary is authorised to collect deposits and other funds in its country of origin; 2) agreement by the supervising bodies in the country of origin to establish a subsidiary; and 3) evidence that the foreign bank supervision performs adequate supervision on consolidation basis (Article 19, paragraph 2 of the Banking Law).  
2. Are foreign credit institutions, once authorised, treated in every respect as a national undertaking? 
Following the receipt of the license to operate in the Republic of Macedonia, the banks established by foreign legal and natural persons and foreign credit institution subsidiaries receive the status of domestic entities and are treated same as domestic banks. 
3. What is the number of banks and other credit institutions operating in your country (if possible, by type of credit institution – banks, savings banks, mortgage credit institutions, etc.)? Please provide the following information: a)      Total number; b)      Domestic; c)      Non-domestic Community, of which: i)          subsidiaries and ii)         branches. d)      Non-domestic non-Community, of which: i)          subsidiaries and ii)         branches.

(3) Under “banks established by foreign legal and natural persons other than EU”, are included banks that are established by foreign legal and natural persons from countries other then EU, that are not registered banks. The data for 2002 and 2003 do not include data on the assets of one bank which was placed under temporary management in January 2003, with a bankruptcy procedure opened against it in March 2004. The movement of total assets of the banking system in the Republic of Macedonia from 1999 to 30 June 2004 was primarily determined by the deposit base fluctuation and bank assets changes as a result of the establishment of two new banks, the conversion of one savings house into a bank and the final capitalisation of several existing banks, whose controlling share packages were bought out by foreign strategic investors.  The outstanding assets increase of the banking system in 2001 is mainly a result of the increased citizens’ deposits at the end of 2001, i.e. prior to conversion to euro. In this period, the total citizens’ bank deposits increased by over 33 billion MKD, out of which 29 billion MKD or approximately 88% were citizens’ bank deposits.  In 2002 there was a certain fall of the total assets in the banking system which was mostly determined by the deposit base movement. Namely, during this year, the total deposits fell by approximately 12 billion MKD, which is generally in line with the deposit base movement tendency in the banking system. However, in spite of the decrease of the deposit base, the banks in the Republic of Macedonia managed to retain over 70% of the foreign currency deposits of the population collected in the period prior to the euro conversion.  The assets increase in the banking system during 2003 and the first six months of 2004 is mostly related to the changes in the bank deposit activities, i.e. the rising total deposits. The rise of the total assets during this period amounts to 18 billion MKD, or 19.3% as compared to the situation at the end of 2002.  5.

The branch of a foreign bank had to have a status of a legal person and had to fulfill the capital requirements like all other commercial banks established under this law in Republic of Macedonia.

The data for 2002 and 2003 do not include data on the assets of one bank which was placed under temporary management in January 2003, with a bankruptcy procedure opened against it in March 2004. In the period between 1999 until 30 June 2004, the banks’ deposit base had a tendency of continuous rise, except for 2002, i.e. following the large inflow of citizens’ deposits into the bank system at the end of 2001, prior to the euro conversion.  At the end of 2001, the total deposits were by 33 billion MKD higher compared to the end of 2000, or there was an increase of nearly 50%. As already stated above, the rise in 2001 was due to the euro conversion, and primarily of the citizens’ deposit increase.  The main determinant of foreign currency movement during 2002 was the citizen’s deposits. Namely, during 2002 there was a net deposit withdrawal of about 12 billion MKD (90%), which is mostly due to the foreign currency deposit withdrawal. Nonetheless, although the previously stated deposit amount was withdrawn from the banking system, it may be concluded that nearly 70% of the deposit inflow prior to the euro conversion remained in the banks. The deposit withdrawal did not cause problems in the banks. This was a signal for a gradual and safe restoration of the citizens’ confidence in the banks.  During 2003 and the first six months of 2004, the banking system in the Republic of Macedonia experienced a continuous increase of the deposit base. Thus, on 30 June 2004 the total deposits increased by 18 billion MKD or nearly 31% compared to 2002. Out of the total amount of new deposits, about 10 billion, or 55% are citizens’ deposits.  Despite the continuous increase of the deposit base, there was still a significant disturbance of its maturity structure. Out of the total bank deposits, as high as 94% have the maturity period shorter than one year, i.e. the maturity structure is still unfavourable to provide for a more serious credit expansion of the banks’ portfolios.  6.

The data for 2002 and 2003 do not include data on one bank which was put in January 2003 under temporary management, with the bankruptcy procedure opened against it in March 2004.  Having in mind that, based on all three criteria, the concentration of the largest five banks in the banking system is higher than 70%, while concentration exceeds 84% in the case of the largest 10 banks in the analysed period, it is obvious that the banking system of the Republic of Macedonia is highly concentrated.  The share of domestic banks in the bank concentration has a tendency of continuous decrease in the analysed period. This tendency is due to the fact that several banks included in the group of the largest 5, and the largest 10 banks, were bought out by foreign strategic investors, mainly from EU member states or EU latest acceded member states during the analysed period. The same reasons are behind the increase of the EU banks’ share in the bank system concentration in the Republic of Macedonia under all criteria from 0% in 1999 for, to 39%, and 44%, on 30 June 2004, for the largest 5 and 10 banks, respectively.  The foreign banks’ share from countries other than EU during the analysed period is insignificant. There was a slight increase in 2001, 2002 and 2003 which was a result of the acquisition of one bank by a foreign strategic investor from Slovenia. This bank was included in the largest 5, i.e. the largest 10, on 30 June 2004, yet, since Slovenia acceded to the EU in the most recent extension, it is presented as a foreign bank other than from the European Union. Thus, other than EU foreign bank share in the largest 5, i.e. largest 10, on 30 June 2004 comes down to 0% by all criteria. 




7. Importance of the public sector in the banking industry: a)      Number of banks owned by public institutions and the amount of their assets and deposits; b)      Timetable, objectives and scope of the envisaged privatisation; c)      Do public banks benefit from special treatment? Do banks directed by public or political party officials benefit from special treatment and how? Do public utilities/companies keep their accounts with commercial banks? d)      Is there some policy to recapitalise them? e)      Indicate the percentage of bank capital held by public entities on a bank by bank basis. 
a)  In the Republic of Macedonia, there is only one bank, the Macedonian Bank for Development Support (MBDS), which is under state control (the term ‘bank under state control refers to one bank in which the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, directly or indirectly, through another legal person under Government control, owns over 51% of the total number of voting shares). MBDP was established with a standalone law - Law on Establishing the Macedonian Bank for Development Promotion, Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 24/98 and 6/00) to support the development and promote further the Macedonian economy through:   investing in small and medium size enterprises;  supporting exports;   managing foreign loans and donations. MBDS was established as a joint stock company (Article 1 of the Law on Establishing the Macedonian Bank for Development Promotion (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia 24/98 and 6/00)) and operates according to the Banking Law provisions, except for some specific elements which are individually regulated in the provisions of this particular law (Article 3 of the Law on Establishing the Macedonian Bank for Development Promotion (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia 24/98 and 6/00)). MBDS is not authorised to collect deposits (Article 8 of the Law on Establishing the Macedonian Bank for Development Promotion (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia 24/98 and 6/00)  and cannot approve loans and issue guarantees to the state, public enterprises and institutions funded by the budget of the Republic of Macedonia. Its activities cannot be directed to crediting the establishment or development of small and medium size enterprises, export funding, issuing guarantees for loans approved for identified inflow from export, neither on insurance and re-insurance of export against commercial and non-commercial risks (Article 6 of the Law).   Under the law, the state dividend share in MBDS operations is transferred to the Bank’s reserves (Article 13, paragraph 3 of the Law). Shareholders of MBDS Besides the Government, the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of Macedonia, as well as other domestic and foreign legal persons, can also be founding partners of this Bank (Article 4, paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the Law). The Government share in the initial capital of this bank cannot be lower than 51%. The total participation in the initial capital by foreign legal persons cannot be higher than 30%. For the time being, the only shareholder of this Bank is the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. MBDS AssetsThe total assets on 30 June 2004 are 1.817.466.000 MKD. 
b)  Privatisation Time Table and Objectives From a historical viewpoint, majority owners of the banks in the Republic of Macedonia were the socially owned enterprises. With the privatisation of socially owned enterprises, there was a process of bank privatisation, so today all banks, except for the Macedonian Bank for Development Support, are in private ownership (see Table in the answer of this question under e). The only state owned bank today is the Macedonian Bank for Development Support which was established in 1998 under a specially enacted piece of legislation – the Law on Establishing the Macedonian Bank for Development Promotion. In light of the specific type and objectives behind the establishment of this Bank (more details on this in the answer under a) of this question), the Government does not plan its privatisation, i.e. does not plan to reduce the state holding in MBDS below 51%.  
c)  The only state bank does not enjoy special treatment in any respect Public enterprises hold their accounts with commercial banks, though not with MBDS due to the fact that it is not allowed to receive deposits and provide payment services for clients (Article 8). 
d) There is no definite plan on the MBDS recapitalisation. If fit and proper investors are interested in investing in MBDS, the Government is ready to implement the possibility granted by the Law on Establishing the Macedonian Bank for Development Promotion, which provides 49% of the MBDS assets to be owned by domestic and foreign legal and natural persons (Article 4). This can be done through a new share issue, i.e. by increasing the equity, rather by selling part of the state owned stake (share holding). 
e) The public sector share in the banks’ capital in the Republic of Macedonia for individual banks is presented in the Table below.

Prokredit Bank JSC Skopje 0,00% 20. MBPR 100,00% 21. Invest Banka JSC Skopje 0,19% The public sector share in the banks’ capital is due to the share of the unprivatised state enterprises and the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund. The public sector share in the banks’ capital in the Republic of Macedonia is rapidly decreasing with the finalisation of the privatisation process and the fast pace of sale of shares of the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund.  Legal framework - Conditions of admission 

8. What are the essential requirements for the authorisation to take up the business of credit institutions (legal form, level of own funds, number and conditions concerning the persons who direct the business, others?) 
The establishment and operations of banks in the Republic of Macedonia is regulated with the Banking Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 63/00, 103/00, 37/02, 51/03, and 85/03) and the Law on Micro-Financing Banks (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 61/02). Generally, for banks established under the Law on Micro-Financing Banks, the provisions of the Banking Law as defined in Article 4 of the Banking Law, and Article 5 of the Law on Micro-Financing Banks, also apply.  The provisions in the Law on Micro-Financing Banks referring to the establishment of this type of banks (Articles 4, 5, 6 and 7) were in force for two years after the entry into force of the Law, i.e. two years after 26 July 2002, which means that they do not apply any longer and, new banks cannot be established under this law any longer. Other provisions remain in force and the established micro-financing banks continue to operate in accordance with these provisions, as well as with the provisions of the Banking Law. During the period of effectiveness of the provisions pertaining to establishment, only one micro-financing bank was established in the Republic of Macedonia – Procredit Bank, with IMI, EBRD, KfW and IFC as shareholders. Procredit Bank filed an application with the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia for its conversion into a bank established in line with the Banking Law and it is soon expected that the National Bank will approve the conversion. This practically means that there will be no banks established and operating under the Law on Micro-Financing Banks, and the law will cease to be in force. In the Republic of Macedonia, for the time being, savings houses are also in operation. They were established under the Law on Banks and Savings Houses (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 31/93, 78/93, 17/96, 37/98 and 25/00) which was abrogated in 2000 with the adoption of the Banking Law, with exception of Chapter II "Savings Houses", which is still in force. The application refers only to the operation, and not to the establishment, so, as the Banking Law was adopted, approvals for establishing new savings houses have not been issued. It is planned that the status, requirements and operations of the savings houses are regulated until the end of 2005 in accordance with the Banking Law.  The market share of savings banks is marginal. Total deposits by natural persons stand at about 1% of the total deposits in credit institutions.  Legal Form The banks in the Republic of Macedonia are established as joint stock companies (Article 3, paragraph 1 of the Banking Law). The savings banks are established as joint stock companies or limited liability companies.  Initial Capital Minimum capital requirement for establishment of a bank is 3.5 million EUR in denar counter-value (Article 8, paragraph 1 of the Banking Law). As already stated in the answer in Chapter 11, part I, A, question No.2, this amount will be increased to 5 million EUR by the end of this year (for more details see 11_I_A_2). Capital of 9 million EUR (eligible own funds) is required in order to perform activities explained in Article 46 of the Banking Law. More details regarding activities that can be performed by banks based on the amount of capital are given in the answer in Chapter 03_II_A_12.  To establish a micro-financing bank the required capital was 4 million EUR (Article 5, paragraph 1 of the Law on Micro-Financing Banks). As stated above, this provision does not apply any longer. Bank Founders and Shareholders  As provided in Article 7 paragraph 1 and Article 15 paragraph 1, point 14 of the Banking Law, it is prohibited for bank founders and shareholders to be individuals who are subject to bankruptcy proceedings, individuals who are subject to an injunction to perform activities in their profession, activity or duty and individuals sentenced to prison: a)  in the period from the date of sentence enforcement until the date the sentence has been served and 5 years after the sentence has been served, in cases when the individuals were sentenced with a final court decision  with imprisonment up to 3 years, and b)  in the period from the date of sentence enforcement until the sentence has been served, and 10 years after the sentence has been served, in cases when the individuals were sentenced with a final court decision  with imprisonment over 3 years. Also, prior to issuing the establishment and operations license to the bank, or permission to change the bank’s structure, the National Bank governor assesses the qualifications, experience and integrity of shareholders (Article 15 paragraph 8 of the Banking Law). The evaluation is based on the documentation provided in Article 15 paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 and Article 11 paragraph 5 of the Banking Law which must be filed with the National Bank. If the National Bank assesses that the bank’s shareholders do not meet the requirements for a healthy and prudent bank management, it will reject the application for issuance of establishment and operations license, i.e. reject the application for changing the shareholding structure of the bank (Article 11 paragraph 7 of the Banking Law). Documentation required for incorporation of a bank In order to establish a bank, it is necessary to submit the following documentation and information provided in Article 15 paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Banking Law to the National Bank: 1.  Draft establishment act; 2.  Draft operating plan; 3.  Proposed name of the bank; 4.  Amount of capital and a statement that the funds will be deposited; 5.  Source of capital; 6.  Certificate from a relevant institution for regular payment of public taxes; 7.  Information on the founders’ identity and the number of shares of each founder; 8.  Documented evidence on the appropriate status of the founders regarding the bank’s stability; 9.  Evidence on the financial position of the founders; 10. Information on the identity, educational background and experience of the managing board members, including professional history in the last 5 years; 11. Organisational structure of the bank; 12. Financial activities to be performed by the bank; 13. Financial reporting projection for the next 3 years; 14.

9. What are the provisions concerning prudential ratios: a)      solvency ratio; b)      liquidity ratio. Indicate the average level of these ratios for the industry. 
a) The solvency ratio in the Republic of Macedonia is defined as capital adequacy ratio. This indicator measures the solvency position of the banks through incorporating credit and foreign currency risks to which the banks are exposed in their work. The capital adequacy ratio is a ratio between the guarantee capital and the risk weighted assets, defined in line with the Basel Committee recommendations on capital adequacy, i.e. the 1988 Basel Capital Accord.  The banks in the Republic of Macedonia are obliged to maintain the capital adequacy rate at a minimum level of 8%. The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia may prescribe a capital adequacy rate higher than 8%, at most 16%.  The guaranty capital includes the basic capital and the additional capital, in line with the Basel Capital Accord. The risk weighted assets are a sum of the weighted book values of assets on the balance sheet (with risk weightings of 0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) and credit equivalent to the book value of off-balance sheet by their risk degree (with credit conversion factors of 0%, 50% and 100%). The credit equivalents of the specific off-balance sheet positions, such as financial derivatives, are calculated as a product of the book value of these balances and the relevant conversion factor determined by the maturity of the contract type.  The capital adequacy ratio and the calculation procedure are regulated in Article 30 of the Banking Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 63/00, 37/02, 51/03, and 85/03), the Decision on the Methodologies of Determining Banks’ Guarantee Capital (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 77/00), and the Decision on the Methodology of Determining Risk Weighted Assets of Banks (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 50/01). In order to ensure adequate level of capital for covering the exchange rate risk, the calculation of the capital adequacy indicator takes into account also the aggregate open foreign exchange position, calculated in accordance with the Decision on Determining and Calculating the Open Foreign Exchange Positions of the Banks (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 103/01 – consolidated text). The capital adequacy indicator is calculated as a ratio between the bank’s guarantee capital and the sum of the risk weighted assets and the aggregate open foreign currency position. The following Table shows the movement of the bank capital adequacy level in the period from 1999 to 26 June 2004.  CAPITAL ADEQUACY RATIO OF THE BANKING SYSTEM IN THE REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA  Year Capital adequacy in % 1999 28,67 2000 36,73 2001 34,26 2002 28,12 2003 25,83 30.06.2004 25,70 Source NBRM 
The high level of bank capital adequacy ratio in the Republic of Macedonia is due to the high share of cash deposited in the domestic and foreign banks and the government securities in total banking assets, which, in line with the risk weighted assets regulation, carry a risk weighting of 0% i.e. 20% respectively. In addition, the high capital adequacy rate is due to the high share of own funds in the total financial potential of the banks, which was at the level of about 20% from 1999 until 30 June 2004.  The relatively high and stable capital adequacy ratio is an indicator of a stable solvency of the banks, i.e. it is an indicator of the relatively high level of the banks’ ability to absorb a certain level of loss, before reaching the insolvency zone. However, the high capital adequacy indicator is also a sign of the relatively low efficiency of the banks in performing their financial intermediation.  The capital adequacy rate has a stable and continuous downward trend, which is a result of the continuous process of lending banks’ activities in the analysed period. Activities on full harmonisation of the regulations on capital adequacy to the requirements of the 1996 Basel Capital Accord amendments with regard to the incorporation of the market risk and the new Basel Capital Accord (Basel II) are in process. 
b)  The prudential liquidity ratio limits are in the process of being defined. At the moment the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia is able to monitor the residual contractual and expected maturity structure of the banks’ assets and liabilities by individual balance sheet positions, based on the Decision on the Methodology for Determining, Evaluating and Managing Banks’ Liquidity Risks adopted at the end of 2003 (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 84/03). The prudent risk management limits will be calculated based on the collected data analysis and they will be incorporated in the legal framework.  In addition, a supervision circular was adopted in 2004 that defines more precisely the basis for the systems and procedures on banks’ liquidity risk management, and in particular:   The liquidity risk management policy (definition of the optimal asset and liability structure, basic liquidity indicators, the role of the management bodies in the domain of liquidity risk management etc.);   The adequate information system which will enable timely and continuous monitoring and control of liquidity risks;    Identification and monitoring of the funding concentration, particularly from the aspect of deposit base stability;    Testing of liquidity in order to determine the influence of various conditions (stress scenarios) on the liquidity position of the banks, as well as on the ability of the banks to comply with the established limits; and   Management of the liquidity risk on a consolidated basis. 
10. Is there a deposit guarantee scheme? Describe the main elements of it. 
There is a deposit insurance scheme. The scheme was established by the Law on Deposits Insurance Fund (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 63/00, 29/02, 43/02, 49/03 and 66/03) and is based on the principles of Directive 94/19/EC. The essential elements of the Fund are;   The Fund was established by the Republic of Macedonia.   The Fund is managed by a Managing Board (composed of 5 members nominated by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, out of which three upon recommendation of the Minister of Finance, one by the governor of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia and one by the director of the Banking and Insurance Association) and a director. (Article 11, Paragraph 12 point 10)   The Fund resources come from the initial capital deposited by the Republic of Macedonia, the insurance premiums deposited by the banks and savings houses – members of the Fund, which at annual level cannot be higher than 0.7% of the total personal deposits in each bank or savings house (Article 7 paragraph 1), single payment premiums deposited by banks and savings houses as membership fee amounting to 1% of the initial capital of the bank or savings house, as well as income from Fund placements.    The funds can be used solely for payment of deposit insurance to natural persons and the Fund’s operating costs (Article 6, paragraph 3)   In cases of lack of funds for deposit insurance payment, the Fund secures the funds from additional inflows from the banks and savings houses (the amount, in this case, is limited to the triple amount of a monthly premium), by borrowing in the country and abroad, or by borrowing from the budget (Article 8).   The Fund can place the funds into short-term securities of the Republic of Macedonia and the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, in debt securities issued by foreign countries, central banks and public international financial institutions to the amount of the insured deposits in foreign currency, as well an in futures, options and term agreements with deposit institutions, to the maximum of 2% of the Fund sources. For placement safety, foreign institutions where the Fund sources are placed must be rated by at least two internationally certified agencies in one of the two highest categories (Article 6).   Fund membership is obligatory for all institutions (banks and savings houses) which collect deposits from natural persons  (Article 4 paragraph 1)   Fund membership terminates when the governor of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia cancels the bank incorporation and operating license or cancels the part of the license related to deposit collection from natural persons (Article 4 paragraphs 2 and 3).   The subjects of insurance are the denar and foreign currency deposits made by natural persons to the maximum of 20.000 EUR in a single bank or savings house, and 100% of the deposit is paid to a maximum of 10.000 EUR with 90% of the deposit between 10.000 and 20.000 EUR (Article 9 paragraph 2). The natural person deposits are considered insured if they have been deposited in the bank or savings house before the date of termination of the establishment and operations license.    The insurance does not apply to natural person deposits with favourable interest rates, different from those announced by the bank or savings house, the deposits of natural persons who own over 5% of the voting shares or are bank or savings house managing body members,  deposits of  the next of kin of owners of over 5% of voting shares and members of the managing bodies, and deposits related to transactions in which money laundering has been performed, in cases when the offender has been sentenced and the  punishment is enforced (Article 10 paragraph 1).    The payment from the Fund sources is effected within three months from the final decision of the governor of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia on the termination of the establishment and operations license of the bank or savings house (Article 9 paragraph 1) 
11. Is there a regulation preventing the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering? Describe the main elements of it (see also Chapter 4 – free movement of capital).

The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, in the course of the year 2005, will draft a regulation that will refer to bank accounting and financial reporting of banks to the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia.  This regulation will be harmonised with the rules of International Financial Reporting Standards.  14.  Is there a specific regulation concerning the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of banks? Explain the main rules applying to the format of the balance sheet and to the publication of the annual accounts. 
The banks’ annual financial statements are submitted and published in accordance with the provisions in Article 476-480 of the Company Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 28/04), the Rulebook on Balance Schemes Format and Contents for Banks, Savings Houses and other financial organisations (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 27/99), the International Accounting Standards adopted in the Republic of Macedonia and published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 40/97 and 73/99. The banks’ financial statement consolidation and publishing is regulated in Articles 504-506 of the Company Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 28/04), the Decision for Consolidated Bank Supervision (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 84/03) and the International Accounting Standards adopted in the Republic of Macedonia and published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 40/97 and 73/99. The balance sheets prescribed by the Rulebook on Balance Schemes Format and Contents for Banks, Savings Houses and other financial organisations (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 27/99) are almost completely harmonised with Articles 4 and 27 of the EU Directive of 8 December 1986 (86/635/EEC). This Rulebook does not prescribe that the banks’ financial statements need to be accompanied by notes on financial statements, which is determined as a requirement in Article 40 of the EU Directive of 8 December 1986 (86/635/EEC). There are also certain differences in the rules for presenting assets pledged as collateral, as well as some differences in the rules on evaluating financial instruments compared to the ones prescribed by the Directive (86/635/EEC).  A task force has been established with the objective to evaluate, i.e. prepare comparative analysis of the harmonisation of the legal accounting framework in the Republic of Macedonia with the EU Directive of 8 December 1986 (86/635/EEC) and the International Financial Reporting Standards. In addition, a new chart of accounts for the banks is now being designed which will enable the implementation of the requirements for measuring, evaluation and presentation of financial instruments determined by international accounting standards.  The annual accounts, along with the legally binding Annual Report on the work of the company in the previous business year, are prepared and submitted to the Central Register for Annual Accounts in the Republic of Macedonia and to the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Macedonia – the Public Revenue Office, not later than 28 February for the previous year.  The accounting and auditing of the banks is particularly regulated in Articles 69-76 of the Banking Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 63/ 00, 103/00, 37/02, 51/03, and 85/03). The banks’ financial reports and books are subject to a mandatory audit conducted by audit companies. The audit company prepares an audit report in line with the Law on Auditing (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 65/97, 27/00, 31/01, and 61/02). The audit company files its audit report with the National bank of the Republic of Macedonia, the bank’s managing body and the Ministry of Finance.  In cases when the auditor determines that the bank is not able to meet its obligations or that the bank worked in contradiction to the legislation in force, the auditor is obliged to inform the Minister of Finance and the governor of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia immediately. The banks are obliged to publish an extract from the audited financial statements containing the opinion of the certified auditor in at least one of the daily newspapers within 15 days of the approval of the audit by the Bank Shareholders’ Assembly.  15.  Is there a regulation concerning the capital adequacy relating to risks other than credit risks? 
In addition to the credit risk, while assessing the capital adequacy, the banks exposure to the exchange rate risk through adding the bank’s aggregate open currency position to the risk weighted balance and risk weighted off-balance sheet assets, is included. The aggregate open currency position is determined on the basis of the Decision on Determining and Assessing the Banks’ Open Currency Positions (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 103/01- consolidated text). The open aggregate currency position is a balance of foreign currency assets and liabilities position and the denar balance of currency clauses, calculated individually for each foreign currency which appears in the bank’s balance sheet.  The open aggregate currency position referring to the above Decision may be an aggregate balance of currency assets position and aggregate balance of currency liabilities position The aggregate balance of currency assets position is a sum of the positive amounts of the balances between the balance of foreign currency assets and liabilities positions expressed in denar counter-value on the day of notification.  The aggregate foreign currency liabilities position is a sum of negative amounts of the balances between foreign currency assets and liabilities positions expressed in denar counter-value on the day of notification.  The calculation of capital adequacy of the banks in the Republic of Macedonia is regulated by Article 30 of the Banking Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 63/00, 37/02, 51/03, and 5/03) and the Decision on the Methodology for Determining the Risk weighted Banks’ Assets (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 50/01). As stated in the answer to the question in Chapter 11_I_A_2 the Capital Adequacy Directive (Directive 93/6/C) will be implemented by the end of 2005 in the part of market risk.  
16.  Is there a regulation concerning the large exposures? Describe the main elements of it. 
A large credit exposure towards single subjects is the credit exposure either equal or higher than 10% of the bank’s guarantee capital. The total amount of large credit exposures must not exceed the amount eight times higher than the bank’s guarantee capital (800% of the credit capital). The term 'single subject' refers to all legal and natural persons which, in line with the Banking Law, are considered to be related.  The credit exposure of one bank to a single subject includes the total debt on- and off-balance sheet, i.e. the credit exposure reflects the highest possible loss which may occur in cases the client fails to meet in full the obligations towards the bank.  In Chapter III, Supervision Standards in the Banking Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 63/00, 37/02, 51/03, and 85/03), provisions are stipulated which regulate the banks’ exposure, as follows:    credit exposure towards a single subject;   credit exposure towards a single shareholder whose shares are over 5% of the total number of voting shares ;   credit exposure towards the bank’s management body, members of the Managing Board and other bodies of the bank and individuals with special rights and obligations; and   total large credit exposures towards single subjects  The Decision on Credit Exposure Limits (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 01/04), regulates the conditions for implementing the provisions of the Banking Law related to credit exposure in more detail.  
17.  Is there a regulation concerning the supervision on a consolidated basis? Describe the main elements of it. 
The legal requirement for the performance of consolidated supervision of the banks by the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia is included in Article 69, paragraph 4 and Article 77 of the Banking Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 63/00, 37/02, 51/03, and 85/03).  The elements of the regulation on banks’ supervision on consolidation basis (provided in the Decision on Banks’ Consolidated Supervision (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 84/03) whose practical implementation starts from 31 December 2004, identify the following elements:  1. The scope of consolidated supervision, i.e. the subjects which compose the banking group. The banking group refers to a parent entity (bank or financial holding company) seated in the Republic of Macedonia which controls one or more banks, other financial institutions or companies for bank assistance services which are regarded as subsidiaries to the bank or financial holding company. A bank or a financial holding company is subject to supervision in cases when;    directly or indirectly possess the majority shares or majority voting shares in the subsidiary;   it is entitled to directly or indirectly nominate and dismiss the majority members in the managing bodies of the subsidiary, including a signed agreement with one or more shareholders in the subsidiary for transferring their voting right or achieving dominant influence on the operations of the subsidiary; or   in any other case when the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia has determined that the parent company has a dominant influence over the subsidiaries  A bank, or a financial holding company, has a share in other subsidiaries when it has direct or indirect ownership of a minimum of 20% of the equity and voting rights of these subsidiaries.  The bank seated in the Republic of Macedonia under control of the financial holding company in the Republic of Macedonia is subject to consolidated supervision based on the financial statements of the financial holding company. In cases when the financial holding company seated in the Republic of Macedonia has control over two or more banks seated in the Republic of Macedonia, which are not mutually related in the aspect of control or share, the bank subject to supervision is considered to be the one with largest equity, and in cases when the equity is the same, the bank which is subject to consolidated supervision is considered the one which first received license from the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia. Exceptions to consolidated supervision of subordinated subjects are in the following cases:   If the subordinated subject has a seat outside of the territory of the Republic of Macedonia, in a country in which there are legal restrictions to transfer required information;   If the inclusion of the subordinated subject does not significantly affect the determination of the banking group’s financial position; and    If the inclusion of the subordinated subject in consolidated supervision may cause incorrect or inadequate conclusions regarding the objectives of the consolidated supervision.  The bank subject to consolidated supervision is obliged to notify the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia on the subjects of the bank group that it intends to exclude from consolidation and on the reasons for their exclusion. The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia assesses whether the proposed consolidation scope provides a complete and true presentation of the financial state of the bank group; 2. Methods of consolidation of a bank group financial statements Consolidated financial statements are made in line with the applicable accounting standards. The selection of the consolidation method depends on the equity share of the parent company or the voting rights in the other subjects of the group.  Consolidated financial statements are made by the method of complete consolidation of the financial statements of the parent bank, the financial holding company or their subsidiaries.  In cases when the parent company has a stake, the consolidated financial statements are made by the equity method.  In cases of joint control, when the parent company’s obligations are clearly defined and restricted to the level of its equity share, while making the consolidated financial statements of the bank group the proportional consolidation method is used.  3. Rights to risks management at bank group level The bank subject to consolidated supervision is responsible for monitoring the risks to which the banking group is exposed and the adjustment with the limits determined in the Banking Law and other regulations. This means establishing an adequate risk management system at the group level, when each subject in the group needs to have adequate systems for generating data and information required for risk management on consolidation grounds. The banking group needs to be organised in such a way that will enable the bank, subject to consolidated supervision, to monitor the risks to which the group is exposed and undertake measures for reducing the risks. The prudent limits determined in the Banking Law which apply to single banks also refer to the banking group. 4. The format and content of the statements and other information required for consolidated supervision and deadlines for their submission to the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia. The bank subject to consolidated supervision is responsible to submit the statements and information on the composition of the banking group, including data for individual group subjects, consolidated financial statements (balance sheet and balance of success), as well as consolidated statements on risk management in the banking group, which are filed with the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia on semi-annual basis.

21.  Can the supervisory authority ensure that managers and directors act in a fit and proper way? Intervene if they do not? 
The bank management body includes a minimum of two members, who are equally responsible for the bank’s operations and obligations undertaken by the bank according to Article 62 of the Banking Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 63/00, 37/02, 51/03, and 85/03).

These changes will strengthen the role of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia in finding solution strategies for the banks with temporary management and implementation of these procedures in order to increase efficiency. The Ministry of Finance is planning the implementation of amendments and annexes to the Banking Law by the end of 2005. According to Article 22 of the Banking Law, the National Bank governor can reach a decision to cancel the license for establishing and operations of the bank if he/she determines that: 1.  The license was given on the basis of false evidence; 2.  The bank has failed to reach a decision for establishment within 30 days of receiving the license for establishment and operation, i.e. a decision on status changes, within 30 days from receiving the license for executing status changes; 3.  The bank has failed to file an application to be registered in the Trade Register within the set deadline; 4.

23.  Are the institutions issuing electronic money regulated? If so, in which way? 
Issuance of electronic money is not regulated separately. The Banking Law allows banks which have operating licenses issued by the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia to issue electronic money (Article 45 item 6 of the Banking Law, Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 63/00, 103/00, 37/02, and 51/03). Currently none of the banks in the Republic of Macedonia is performing this activity.  By the end of 2007 at the latest, a regulation will be adopted in line with Directive 2000/46/EC, i.e. in addition to the banks, the service of issuing electronic money will be permitted to specially regulated credit institutions – electronic money institutions. The criteria to be complied with for performing such activities will also be defined. It is estimated the transposition to be justified after, in line with Article 11 of the Directive, a report by the Commission for Implementing Directive 2000/46 has been submitted by the end of April 2005, proposing changes, particularly on the part of protection of the bearers of electronic money. By then, the capacity of the Bank Supervision Department will strengthen regarding the implementation of the increased number of activities (licensing and supervision of electronic money institutions.)  
24.  Do you apply any special measure for the supervision of financial conglomerates, as defined in Directive 2002/87/EC? If so, please describe them. 
There are currently no financial conglomerates on the market in the Republic of Macedonia. This is the reason why there is no regulation and special measures of supervision as defined in Directive 2002/87/EC. As the financial markets and institutions develop, there will be a gradual process of incorporating this in the legislation and practices, with particular reference to the relevant Directive.  
25.  How is the operational independence of the supervisory authority ensured, in line with international standards (Basel Committee, IOSCO and IAIS core principles)? 
Under the Law on the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia and the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia is an institution independent in the performance of its activities, and these include also the function of bank supervision.  Under Article 4 of the Law on the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 3/02, 51/03, 85/03, and 40/04), the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia and the members of the bodies authorised for adopting decisions, when performing their functions, do not require and do not receive instructions from the state bodies and the state government. Under Article 55 of the Law on the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia is obliged to inform the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia on a semi-annual and annual basis on the supervision and the measures undertaken in respect of banks and savings houses. The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia is not obliged to request any prior consent from a state body for reaching decisions on undertaking corrective measures and performing supervisory activities.  There is a particular Bank Supervision Department within the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia which performs supervision of banks and savings houses. In line with the National Bank organisation, the Bank Supervision Department reports and is directly responsible to the National Bank Governor.  The World Bank and IMF FSAP mission found that the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia is in full compliance with the Basel Principle 1 (2) which refers to the operational independence of the regulatory body.  
26.  Are professionals employed by the supervisory authority subject to limitations (time or other) regarding the possibility to be employed as senior staff in commercial banks? 
In accordance with Article 133-b of the Collective Agreement of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, in cases where employment terminates through employee resignation, the worker does not have the right to be employed in a commercial bank, savings house or auditing house for a period of two years from the date on which employment was terminated. In all other cases the personnel of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia are not subject to restrictions regarding the possibility to get employment at higher positions in commercial banks.

The powers of the Ministry of Finance regarding supervision of the insurance company operations are regulated with the Law on Supervision of Insurance (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 27/02, 84/02, 98/02 and 33/04). Currently, the Ministry of Finance is working on drafting the secondary legislation which will regulate certain issues related to the insurance company obligations to submit reports and information on their work in more details. a)  Under the Law on Supervision of Insurance, the Ministry of Finance is authorised to request any evidence and information necessary to conduct the supervision. Insurance companies are obliged to submit the evidence and information within the deadline determined by the Ministry of Finance. b)  In conducting the supervision, the Ministry of Finance may require that the insurance company: provides reports and information on the company’s operations; submits an audit report and additional information which are produced by it; submit statistical and other data by groups and classes of insurance and re-insurance, as well as extraordinary audit of the insurance company’s operations. In the process of supervision, the insurance company is obliged to present to the authorised representatives of the Ministry of Finance the complete documentation on the company’s operations. c)  Under Article 24 of the Law on Supervision of Insurance, the Ministry of Finance issues consent for the performance of the function of a member of the management body of the insurance company. The member of the insurance company’s Management Body can be an elected person who meets certain legal conditions, such as appropriate educational background and experience in insurance management (Article 23). The Ministry of Finance can also withdraw the consent in cases where the person works in contradiction to the regulations for risk management, the other provisions in the Law on Supervision of Insurance, as well as other laws regulating the operations of the insurance company.

8. How many actuaries are employed by the supervisory authority? 
Currently, the Insurance Supervision Department at the Ministry of Finance has a staff of one holding the position of an actuary. This is due to the lack of a Training and Upgrading Program for Actuaries in the state prior to 2002, when for the first time the Ministry of Finance, by means of technical assistance, organised an advanced actuary course lasting two years. In June 2004, with the end of the two-year training, a staff of nine was trained and certified after passing the actuarial exam. In line with the strategic plan of the Ministry of Finance, the supervision function is planned to strengthen in the following period, among other things, by taking on an additional number of actuaries. In compliance with the Law on Supervision of Insurance  (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 27/02, 98/02), the Ministry of Finance, being the body in charge of supervising the work of insurance companies, controls whether the insurance companies, along with the annual balance sheet submitted to the Ministry of Finance, also submit an authorised actuary’s certificate. The authorised actuary issues a certificate after the audit of compliance of data in the annual accounts with the insurance accounting standards and the accuracy of the annual accounts regarding the establishment of technical and other reserves of the insurance company. The authorised actuary is obliged to verify whether the premiums and technical reserves have been calculated in compliance with the provisions in the Law on Supervision of Insurance, and whether they have been calculated and allocated in a way that will ensure long-term meeting of obligations which derive from the insurance contracts by the insurance company (Article 116).

The Ministry of Finance may distribute these data to relevant supervisory bodies of member states, where performance of supervision of the insurance companies so requires, and where these bodies are legally obliged to keep the evidence confidential, as well as to relevant supervision bodies in foreign countries, where performance of supervision of insurance companies so requires, and where these bodies are legally obliged to keep these data confidential (Article 233 paragraph 3). Notwithstanding the above, the Ministry of Finance may submit data obtained from relevant supervisory bodies in the member states, only upon consent given by the body that submitted the data. (Article 233 paragraph 4) 
11.  Does the supervisory authority publish an annual report? Could it provide the Commission with a copy or a summary of the report in one of the EU languages? What are the powers of intervention in case of insolvency, abuses of authorisation? 
The Law on Supervision of Insurance (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 27/02, 98/02) does not impose an obligation on the Supervisory Body to prepare annual reports.  Nevertheless, the Insurance Supervision Department within the Ministry of Finance prepares, for internal purposes, internal and unofficial annual reports on the insurance market and insurance supervision, on the basis of data contained in annual reports of insurance companies.

(for more details see 03_II_B_2_7
12.  How is the operational independence of the supervisory authority ensured, in line with international standards (Basel Committee, IOSCO and IAIS core principles)? 
The Insurance Supervision Department is an organisational unit within the Sector of Affairs Immediately Related to the Minister at the Ministry of Finance.

Nevertheless, regarding the essential criteria of this principle, the following must be mentioned: The management structure of the Insurance Supervision Department is defined in the Rulebook on Systematisation of Job Positions in the Ministry of Finance, adopted in April 2004. Namely, according to the Rulebook, the Insurance Supervision Department is an organisational unit within the Sector of Affairs Immediately Related to the Minister at the Ministry of Finance and consists of three employees.

In relation to appointment and removal of the Head of the Department and its employees, the procedure described in the Law on Civil Servants (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 59/00, 112/00, 34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04 and 69/04) shall apply.  Institutional relations among the Insurance Supervision Department, the enforcement and court authorities are not closely defined.   The Insurance Supervision Department is an organisational unit within the Sector of Affairs Immediately Related to the Minister at the Ministry of Finance. It is financed from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia. The Insurance Supervision Department is transparent regarding the procedures for adoption of supervision decisions.

While assessing the company’s capital, the additional capital will be taken into account in amounts not exceeding 50% of the basic capital (Article 70). While assessing the company’s capital, the amount of the basic and additional capital is also reduced by the investment of the company in shares or subordinated debt instruments issued by another insurance company or financial institution in which the insurance company holds a stake of a minimum of 10%, as well as other investments in these entities which are included in the capital assessment of these entities, as well as investments of the company in shares or subordinated debt instruments issued by the insurance company or financial institution, with the exception of those listed above, which amount to over 10% of the insurance company’s capital calculated prior to the setoff of the previously listed investments (Article 70).

Legal framework - Investment firms 

3. Please outline the legal framework adopted for the operation of investment companies, mutual funds, pension funds. 
There is no definition of investment companies in the current legislation of the Republic of Macedonia. The Law on Investment Funds ("Official Gazette of Republic of Macedonia No. 09/00) does not refer to investment companies.  The term mutual funds means open-end investment funds regulated by the Law on Investment Funds (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 09/00). This Law regulates the terms for establishment of investment funds and fund management companies and the manner of their operation, selection of deposit banks and supervision of their work.  The Law on Investment Funds applies to any natural and legal person that acquires monetary assets by way of a public call for their collective investment in securities, i.e. shares, bonds, treasury bills, commercial papers, state treasury bills, deposit certificates and documents for investment in joint undertakings, the purpose of which is acquisition of profit on the basis of entrepreneurial efforts of other parties.  Pursuant to this Law, an investment fund is established for pooling monetary assets intended for investments, collected from investors by way of a public call, which are managed by the fund management company on behalf of the investors. Investment funds may be established as  open-end or closed-end funds.  Open-end fund is a separate entity, having no status of a legal entity, of which owners of share certificates have the right to a proportional part of the profit of the fund and right to request buying-up of share certificates. The open-end fund is established by raising monetary assets by way of public call for the sale of share certificates.  The open-end fund is registered in the registry of the  Securities and Exchange Commission and acquires the property  of a going concern as of the date of its entry in the registry of the Commission.  For the purposes of establishing an open-end fund, the fund management company adopts a statute, prepares the public call and the prospects of the fund, and concludes a contract with a deposit bank in accordance with the provisions of the Law on Investment Funds.  The Securities and Exchange Commission issues an approval to the fund management company for establishing an open-end fund.  The fund management company may start raising the monetary assets through public sale of share certificates after receiving the approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission for establishment of the fund.  The Securities and Exchange Commission  supervises the operation of investment funds, fund management companies and deposit banks in the field of operation with investment funds.  Regarding the pension funds, a thorough reform of Macedonian pension system has been implemented since 1999, for the purpose of ensuring its long term solvency.  The new pensions system consists of three pillars:  first mandatory pillar – based on inter-generation solidarity, second mandatory pillar - based on fully funded pension insurance and third voluntary pillar – based on fully funded pension insurance.  The persons employed as of 1 January 2003 shall be obligatorily included in the new system, while the remaining beneficiaries shall have the right to make a voluntary choice for inclusion in the new system.  The contributions for pension beneficiaries who will be included in the new system will be shared between the two pillars in the following manner:  65% in the first pillar and 35% in the second pillar.   Pension beneficiaries who will remain in a system with only one pillar will receive full age-based pension, disability or family pension from the first pillar.  Pension beneficiaries, who will be included in the system of two pillars, will receive pension from the first pillar and part of the pension from the second pillar in case of age-based retirement.  In case of retirement based on disability or family pension, the beneficiaries will receive the full pension from the first pillar, where the assets accumulated on their individual account will be transferred in the first pillar.  The minimum guaranteed pension shall also be provided from the first pillar.  Pension from the second pillar, with the right to a personal choice of the member shall be paid by way of purchasing pension annuity, which is paid for the rest of the life from a special institution authorised for such activities or through programmed withdrawals provided by the company managing the pension fund, where he/she was a member as of the date of his/her retirement, which will be regulated with a separate law.  The voluntary pension insurance (third pillar), as part of the multi-level pension system in the Republic of Macedonia shall be regulated in more details with a separate law.  The legal framework of the mandatory fully funded pension insurance consists of the following:    Law on Amending and Appending the Law on Pension and Disability Insurance (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 24/00).   Law on Mandatory Fully Funded Pension Insurance (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 29/02, 85/03 and 40/04). A State Fund for Pension and Disability Insurance of the Republic of Macedonia has been established according to the Law on Pension and Disability Insurance. The Fund has the capacity of a legal entity and its activity is of public interest. An Agency for Supervision of Fully Funded Pension Insurance has been established on the basis of the Law on Mandatory Fully Funded Pension Insurance (“Official Gazette of Republic of Macedonia” Nos. 29/02, 85/03 and 40/04). The purpose of establishing the Agency is protection of interests of the members of the pension funds and stimulation of the development of the fully funded pension insurance.  In performing its duties, the Agency conducts activities such as: organising tenders, issuing, revoking and terminating licenses for establishment of pension fund management companies and approvals for managing pension funds.  4.

Are there rules governing the investment policy of a collective investment undertaking (eligible assets, investment limits)? Are there risk-management processes employed to monitor and measure the overall risk of a collective portfolio? 
Are collective investment undertakings subject to authorisation requirements in your country?

Collective investment undertakings in securities are defined in the Law on Investment Funds ("Official Gazette of Republic of Macedonia No. 09/00) as open funds.  Open fund is a separate property, having no status of a legal entity, the owners of which possessing share documents have the right to a proportional part of the profit of the fund and a right to request repurchase of the share certificates. For the purposes of establishing an open fund, the fund management company adopts a statute, prepares public call and prospects of the fund, and concludes a contract with a deposit bank in accordance with the provisions of this Law. A fund management company files an application for obtaining an approval for establishment of an open fund to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The application contains the following:  1.  Business name and registered office of the fund management company, 2.  Name of the open fund and  3.

Which legal forms and structures of collective investment undertakings are provided? 
The Law on Investment Funds recognises the open and closed funds as legal forms and structures for joint investments.  - Open fund is a separate property, having no status of a legal entity, the owners of which possessing share cerificates have the right to a proportional part of the profit of the fund and right to request buying-up of the share documents. The open fund is established by collecting monetary assets by way of public call for selling share documents (Article 18 of the Law on Investment Funds "Official Gazette of Republic of Macedonia” No. 09/00). The open fund is registered in the registry of the Securities and Exchange Commission and acquires the capacity for running business as of the date of its entry in the registry of the Commission. - Closed fund is a joint stock company established for the purposes of collecting monetary assets by way of public call for selling own shares and investing such assets in securities (Article 30 of the Law on Investment Funds).  The closed fund is established by collecting monetary assets by way of public call for selling shares.  The closed fund is established and managed by a fund management company.  A fund management company files an application for obtaining an approval for establishment of a closed fund to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The approval for establishing a closed fund is published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia by the Securities and Exchange Commission (Article 31 of the Law on Investment Funds). 
A pension fund management company can be established and can operate only in a form of a joint stock company, where the initial capital of the company amounts to at least 1.500.000 EURO.  Shares of the company are common personal shares and the company may not issue priority shares. Shareholders of the company, according to their participation in the equity of the company, have equal status in the company.  The single activity of the company is managing pension funds, representing them before third parties and other activities relating to pension funds management.  For a period of ten years as of the date when the payment of contribution in the mandatory fully funded pension insurance has commenced, the company can establish and manage only one pension fund.  The pension fund is defined in the Law on Mandatory Fully Funded Pension Insurance (“Official Gazette of Republic of Macedonia” Nos. 29/02, 85/03 and 40/04), and its legal form derives from an open investment fund that is a private property and has no capacity of legal entity. The pension fund consists of assets from contributions of fund members and inflows from invested contributions.   Owners of the pension fund are its members and their individual ownership rights are determined from the amount of assets on their accounts.  Assets of the pension fund are completely separated from the assets of the company that manages that fund and they are kept under custody. 
Are there rules governing the investment policy of a collective investment undertaking (eligible assets, investment limits)? 
Securities, which the fund invests in, consist of the following:  securities, monetary deposits and other assets. Investment funds can invest assets in the following types of securities:   securities listed and traded on the stock exchange market or sold on the money market or other regulated market, and     securities from new issues, if the conditions for their issuance contain an obligation for filing a request for inclusion of the securities in a stock-exchange market, money market or some other regulated market.  (Article 13 of the Law on Investment Funds "Official Gazette of Republic of Macedonia” No. 09/00).

19.  What are the powers of intervention of the supervisory authority in cases of investment firms in difficulties? 
According to the Securities Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 63/00, 103/00, 34/01, 04/02, 37/02, 31/03, 85/03, and 96/04), the Securities  and Exchange Commission (hereinafter ‘Commission’) is responsible for brokers, brokerage houses, banks and participants in the stock market, trading and investment advisors. It is authorised to undertake measures and activities of supervision and sanctioning the operations of aforementioned subjects. The Securities Law and the Law on Investment Funds (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 09/00) do not provide authorisation for the Commission to intervene in cases when investment companies face difficulties in their work. When the Commission’s supervision of the authorised participants in the stock market identifies irregularities and illegal securities operations or irregularities in book-keeping, the Commission reaches a decision for eliminating the identified irregularities within a certain period. The authorised participants on the stock market are obliged to eliminate the identified irregularities and submit a report to the Commission, which will describe the measures undertaken to eliminate irregularities. The report is accompanied by documents and other evidence which will substantiate that the identified irregularities have been eliminated.

20.  Is there a right of appeal to the Courts against any decisions taken by the supervisory authority? 
Under the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, the right to appeal in the public administration and before judicial bodies is guaranteed.  In addition to the laws referring to its responsibility, the Securities and Exchange Commission also applies the Law on General Administrative Procedure (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 47/86-consolidated text and 44/02), which is applicable to all public administration bodies and institutions in the Republic of Macedonia. Under the Securities Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 63/00, 103/00, 34/01, 04/02, 37/02, 31/03, 85/03, and 96/04), clients are entitled to file an appeal against the decisions brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as the supervisory body for the capital market.  An especially established Committee at the Government of the Republic of Macedonia decides in a second instance procedure.  In cases when clients are dissatisfied with the second instance decision reached by the Committee established by the Government, they can invoke their right and within certain deadlines start a pubic administration procedure at the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia. In all other cases, clients have the right to bring a legal action to the Court based on grounded evidence, for determining the responsibility of the body or individuals who were involved in reaching the decision. A public administration dispute or another procedure filed to the competent court may be initiated against the acts of the Agency for Supervising Mandatory Fully Funded Pension Insurance, depending on the contents of the subject.  

21.  How is the supervisory authority’s operational independence ensured? 
The Securities Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 63/00, 103/00, 34/01, 04/02, 37/02, 31/03, 85/03, and 96/04) defines the Securities and Exchange Commission as an independent organisation with the status of a legal entity responsible to implement laws and by-laws related to this field. A person who meets the following conditions can be nominated for a president or a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission: the person must be a citizen of the Republic of Macedonia, hold at least a university degree, be an outstanding expert in the field of finance and corporate law, must not be member of any bodies and political parties, must not be a management person or Management Board member of a company over which the Securities and Exchange Commission or the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia performs supervision, must not be a shareholder with over 25% stake in a joint stock company which issues securities and must not be an official who manages a state body.  In addition, the president or members of the Securities and Exchange Commission cannot make decisions on legal entities they are in contract relations with; nor be shareholders in companies which are subject to control and approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission; and must treat the information they have received during the work at the Securities and Exchange Commission as confidential. The term of office of the president and the members of the Securities and Exchange Commission can terminate in cases of unjustified absence from work at the Securities and Exchange Commission  over a period of six months or more; submission of their resignation in writing; a loss of working ability for performing regular activities; revelation of a business secret while performing work for the Securities and Exchange Commission; execution of duties  in a dishonest and irresponsible manner; becoming members of  state bodies or political parties, managers or members of a company’s Management Board which is subject to supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission; acquisition of over 25% shares of the total number of shares in a company which issues securities, or becoming an official of a public administration body.  In order to ensure higher independence of the Securities and Exchange Commission, its Statute is confirmed by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and its annual accounts are audited and evaluated by an auditing company in line with the international audit standards and an audit report is prepared in line with the audit regulations. To ensure its independence, the Securities and Exchange Commission provides resources for its operations from its own funds, i.e. does not use budgetary funds. In cases of shortage of funds, in line with the Securities Law, funds are provided from the budget of the Republic of Macedonia. The new Securities Law will allow for a greater independence of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the funds of its operations. The funds will be provided via fees that the Securities and Exchange Commission will be charging based on a price list for services. This means that, with the new Securities Law, the funds for the operations of the Securities and Exchange Commission will not be provided from the budget of the Republic of Macedonia. The Agency for Supervision of a Mandatory Fully Funded Pension Insurance is an independent legal entity, and not a body within a certain institution. It is responsible for its work to the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. The work of the Agency is funded by fees which it charges to companies for pension fund management, and the fees are determined by the Agency upon approval from the Government of the Republic of Macedonia.

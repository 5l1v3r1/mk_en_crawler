ATHENS, Greece -- Authorities said Monday (27 October) that wildfires were raging out of control on the island of Crete. An estimated 550 hectares of olive groves and pastures have been destroyed since the fires began at the weekend. At least six homes have been damaged. Unusually high temperatures and strong winds have hampered fire-fighting efforts. (AFP - 27/10/03)

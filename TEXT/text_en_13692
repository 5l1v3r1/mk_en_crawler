ZAGREB, Croatia -- Italy has again expressed dissatisfaction with Croatia's approach towards Italians trying to buy real estate, according to Tuesday's (20 December) edition of Vecernji list. The newspaper quoted Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman Pasquale Terracciano, who said Rome views Zagreb's approach to Italian buyers as unacceptable and "discriminatory" in comparison to attitudes towards buyers from other EU member states. He also suggested this may prompt Italy to reconsider its support for Zagreb's EU accession bid. (Vecernji list - 20/12/05)

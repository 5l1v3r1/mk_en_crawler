ZAGREB, Croatia -- The international community's High Representative in BiH, Paddy Ashdown, visited Zagreb on Tuesday (22 April) and said that Croatia's approach towards EU accession is a model for other countries in the region. During his visit, Ashdown met with President Stipe Mesic, Deputy Prime Minister Goran Granic and Foreign Minister Tonino Picula to discuss issues related to regional co-operation. The talks focused particularly on the need for joint efforts in fighting organised crime, as well as the possibility of Croatia assuming an advisory role for other states in the region seeking EU accession.

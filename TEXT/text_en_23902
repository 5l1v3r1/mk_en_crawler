PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Preparations for discussions between EULEX and Belgrade are under way, as part of technical arrangements on issues of joint interest, local media reported on Tuesday (July 21st). Implementation of these agreements is one of the conditions required of Serbia as a country included in the visa liberalisation process. The Kosovo government has been informed of these discussions, but has made no comment for now.
In other news, two Albanian and two Serb members of the administrative staff returned to their jobs Monday at the Mitrovica district court in the north, local media reported. A EULEX-mediated agreement between Pristina and Belgrade made the return possible. Initially, eight staff members were to return, but the number was reduced for security reasons. The municipal and district court in northern Mitrovica resumed operations in October 2008, after closing down when Kosovo declared independence. Since its reopening, only EULEX judges and prosecutors had been working there. (Zeri, Koha Ditore - 21/07/09; Klan Kosova, Kohavision - 20/07/09)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish and US officials agreed Friday (12 September) on what they described as a "joint plan" regarding Kurdish rebels who maintain bases in northern Iraq. A US team headed by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State B. Lynn Pascoe was in Ankara for meetings with senior Turkish officials. A technical meeting will be held this week in Ankara to discuss implementation of the action plan. An estimated 5,000 Kurdish fighters belonging to the former Kurdistan Worker's Party, now known as KADEK, are thought to be based in northern Iraq.
In other developments, Iraq's Governing Council said Friday that it approves of the potential presence of Turkish peacekeeping forces in Iraq. Following a visit to Ankara, Governing Council Chairman Ahmad Chalabi said he understood Turkey's intentions are to enter Iraq not as an occupying force but to provide assistance.

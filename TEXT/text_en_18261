BUCHAREST, Romania -- At a joint session Tuesday (December 12th), parliament approved the nomination of National Liberal Party Senator Varujan Vosganian as new minister of trade and economy. He replaces Codrut Seres, who resigned earlier this month after his Conservative Party left the ruling coalition. Vosganian made headlines weeks ago when he was tapped as the Romanian nominee for EU commissioner, then was forced to withdraw his name amid apparent disapproval by Brussels. 
In other news, Romanian Administration and Interior Minister Vasile Blaga said on Tuesday that the country needs five years to become a Schengen state. The Schengen Agreement among 26 European states outlines a common policy on temporary entry and harmonises external border controls. (Rompres, Mediafax, Romanian Government website - 12/12/06)

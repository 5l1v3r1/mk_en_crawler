PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbs in Kosovo marked the sixth anniversary of riots that left dozens dead and thousands expelled from their homes on Wednesday (March 17th). In Fushe Kosova/Kosovo Polje, Bishop Atanasije called on Orthodox believers to fight for Kosovo with dignity. Serbs in northern Mitrovica also commemorated the event. There were services in churches across Serbia as well. In Belgrade, Serbian Patriarch Irinej reiterated that Serbia will never give up Kosovo. In March 2004, simmering tensions between ethnic Albanians and Serbs boiled over after a Serb teenager was wounded in a drive-by shooting in the village of Caglavica, near Pristina. Fighting then broke out in Mitrovica amid news that three Albanian children had drowned after allegedly being forced by Serbs to jump into the Ibar River. (Klan Kosova, TV 21, RTK, B92 - 17/03/10)

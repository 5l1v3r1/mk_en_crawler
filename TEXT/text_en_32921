SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament on Wednesday (28 May) gave final approval to the law on collection of illegal weapons. The collection campaign, expected to begin late next month, will continue for 45 days. The weapons will then be destroyed within a three-month period. Those who fail to turn in illegal weapons by then will face criminal charges.

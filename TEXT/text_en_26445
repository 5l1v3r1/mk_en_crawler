PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Opposition and ruling parties alike expressed disappointment Tuesday (August 11th) with the Central Election Commission's (CEC) decision not to allow camera surveillance during the November 15th local elections. The CEC says installing cameras at 3,000 polling stations could threaten voters' privacy. But representatives of the Kosovo Democratic Institute, who will observe the elections, along with a group of NGOs, disagree, saying the CEC's decision will damage the vote's credibility. Opposition parties and President Fatmir Sejdiu's Democratic League of Kosovo agree, while its coalition partner, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo, opposes camera surveillance.

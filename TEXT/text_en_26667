PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The head of the International Civilian Office, Pieter Feith, voiced support Tuesday (October 6th) for establishing a Serbian-language TV station in Kosovo, as envisioned in former UN envoy Martti Athisaari's plan. Speaking to Kosovo-based Serb-language Radio KiM, Feith said that Kosovo Serbs get their information through public broadcaster RTK on a limited schedule, and through local media outlets operating mainly from Serb enclaves.

NEW YORK, United States -- In a speech Wednesday (3 March) to the UN Security Council, High Representative Paddy Ashdown warned of risks in realising reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and called for efforts to meet these challenges. The top international envoy in BiH said the slow pace of reforms might result in a return of nationalism during local elections this fall. He added that while the country achieved real progress in defence, intelligence, customs and tax reform, the UN-led police certification process still requires attention. BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic also spoke before the Security Council.
In other news Wednesday, SFOR announced the discovery of two large caches of weapons in Republika Srpska, as part of an ongoing effort to collect weapons left from the 1992-1995 conflict. (OHR Sources - 04/03/04; UN Web site, PBS BiH, RTRS, AFP - 03/03/04)

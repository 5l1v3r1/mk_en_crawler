BERLIN, Germany -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Wednesday (27 November) that he will back Turkey's bid to start negotiations with the EU, but stopped short of insisting that the EU provide Turkey with an accession roadmap at its summit in Copenhagen next month. Turkish President Ahmed Necdet Sezer, on his first official visit to Germany, made it clear he wants just that. Schroeder's stance will face opposition in the Bundestag.
Meanwhile, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, leader of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party, went to Paris on Wednesday, trying to drum up support for EU accession. He met with President Jacques Chirac, who like Schroeder voices personal support for Turkey's bid, but faces popular opposition.

BRCKO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The UN war crimes tribunal will focus on processing of the main war crimes and genocide cases, so all related procedures are completed by 2010, said the tribunal's deputy secretary David Tolbert, during a weekend visit to Brcko. He explained that as The Hague tribunal would be unable to process all cases, it would concentrate on the major ones involving Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Ante Gotovina. Local courts authorised by the UN tribunal would likely handle the rest.
In other news, US Ambassador to BiH Clifford Bond expressed dissatisfaction Friday (7 May) with Republika Srpska's (RS) co-operation with The Hague tribunal during an interview with RS's public TV station RTV.
Meanwhile, another mass grave has been discovered in BiH. Officials say the site is thought to contain the bodies of 72 people, including 16 children. The victims, presumably executed by Serbs in May 1992, were from the village of Zaklopca. (OHR Sources, Oslobodjenje - 10/05/04; NTV Hayat, Reuters, AFP - 08/05/04)

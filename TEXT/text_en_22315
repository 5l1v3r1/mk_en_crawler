ANKARA Turkey -- Constitutional Court rapporteur Osman Can said in a report that the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) should not be banned, Turkish media reported on Wednesday (July 16th). Constitutional Court chairman Hasim Kilic announced on Wednesday court members have received the non-binding document. The rapporteur asserts that banning the AKP would be disproportionate to its actions since it does not pose a real threat to the state's secular character, CNN Turk reported. The court has not followed the rapporteur's recommendation in key recent rulings. (Sabah, Radikal, Zaman - 17/07/08, Hurryiet, CNN Turk, ANA-MPA, Kathimerini - 16/07/08)

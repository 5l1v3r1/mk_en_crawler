BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic vowed on Sunday (15 January) to strengthen the fight against corruption, saying the government is determined to combat it at all levels. According to Stojkovic, the adoption of a national strategy against corruption, action plans and a number of related laws have created a sufficient legislative basis in this field. At the same time, however, he criticised the work of the judiciary, implying it is unsatisfactory. He also said any judge or prosecutor proven to have taken a bribe or abused office would be held accountable, just like any ordinary citizen. (RTS - 16/01/06)

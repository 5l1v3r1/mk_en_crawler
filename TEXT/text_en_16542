BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu urged President Traian Basescu on Monday (October 9th) to annul his decree suspending Defence Minister Teodor Atanasiu last month. Prosecutors investigating whether Atanasiu revealed classified information about the location of Romanian troops abroad officially announced last week that there were no grounds for a criminal proceeding. Given that fact, Atanasiu should return to his job, the prime minister said. (Ziua - 10/10/06; Mediafax - 09/10/06)

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski met with Hague tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte on Thursday (14 September) and vowed his country will provide full co-operation in this area. Though the meeting was cordial, del Ponte rejected Gruevski's request for the provisional release of former Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski and security official Johan Tarculovski, both of whom face war crimes charges stemming from the 2001 interethnic conflict in Macedonia. Del Ponte also rejected a request that four specific cases be turned over to Macedonia, saying the domestic courts are not yet prepared to handle them. (Makfax, MIA, A1 TV - 14/09/06)

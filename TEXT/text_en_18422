BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic, leader of the Democratic Party, rejected on Monday (March 12th) the need for debate over whether one party could hold the posts of both president and prime minister, during negotiations on forming a new government. Tadic said that such discussions were pointless, as the president is elected by the public, not by parties. He acknowledged that the ongoing coalition talks have not been easy, but said he remains optimistic about the chances of forming a new cabinet by the end of the month.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Former President Tassos Papadopoulos died of lung cancer Friday (December 12th). He was 74. A veteran of Greek Cypriot politics, he became president in 2003 but lost a bid for a second term earlier this year to Demetris Christofias. Under his leadership, the country joined the EU in 2004, though without an agreement to end the decades-old division of Cyprus. A reunification proposal by then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan was rejected by Greek Cypriots in a referendum, with Papadopoulos rallying opposition to the plan in an emotional televised address ahead of the vote.

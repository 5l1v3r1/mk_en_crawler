NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The government has submitted to the EU Presidency a draft set of measures to provide economic support to Turkish Cypriots and deepen the level of co-operation between the two communities on the divided island. Cabinet spokesman Christodoulos Pashiardis said on Monday (April 2nd) that the proposal was submitted at the weekend but its contents would remain confidential for the time being. Pashiardis stressed that the package was unrelated to Turkish demands to lift the embargo on direct trade with the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. (CNA, ANA-MPA, Focus - 02/04/07)

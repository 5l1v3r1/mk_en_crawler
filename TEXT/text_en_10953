TIRANA, Albania -- Pollsters plan to conduct surveys for the first time, ahead of this summer's parliamentary elections. Gallup and the Mjaft (Enough!) organisation jointly plan to release surveys of 1,400 respondents in May and June. The move is both expected to help parties better gauge their levels of support and to curb accusations of voter fraud by those who lose the elections.

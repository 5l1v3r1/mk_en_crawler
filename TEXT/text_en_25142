TIRANA, Albania -- The Constitutional Court suspended ratification procedures in parliament on Thursday (November 26th) on a territorial agreement between Albania and Greece that delineates the continental shelf between the two countries in the Ionian Sea. The court took on the issue last month, when opposition parties filed a claim arguing that the agreement harms Albania's interests. The next hearings are scheduled for December 8th, when the court will decide whether the agreement is constitutional. Various associations and military experts have denounced the deal, saying Albania would lose about 225sq km of territorial waters if parliament ratifies the measure. The government insists the agreement, signed in April, is in the interest of both countries. (BBC, Shekulli, VoA, Ora News, Top Channel - 26/11/09)

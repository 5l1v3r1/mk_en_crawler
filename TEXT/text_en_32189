BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- The televised debate between Serbian presidential candidates Vojislav Kostunica and Miroljub Labus on Wednesday (9 October) failed to ignite any sparks. Though they discussed a variety of issues, neither candidate made any controversial remarks that analysts say might have attracted additional votes in Sunday's run-off. Labus stressed that his economic expertise would open doors at international financial institutions while Kostunica called the Serbian presidency a post of national unity.
In other news, Serbia opened a trial Wednesday against two police officers charged with the March 1999 murders of at least seven ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Sasa Cvjetan and Dejan Demirovic are accused of alleged involvement in an incident in which 19 civilians were executed after they were told to leave their homes to allow Yugoslav troops to move in. Only Cvjetan appeared before the court; police have been unable to find Demirovic. This is the third such trial involving members of Serbia's police and special units.

TIRANA, Albania -- Some 1,800 policemen will lose their jobs by year's end in a bid to restructure the various police forces. Deputy Interior Minister Gjergj Lezhja announced the move Thursday (November 23rd), saying the work of each policeman would be evaluated before any layoff decisions are made. But the opposition criticised the move, describing it as a political purge by the ruling party. (Albanian News - 24/11/06)

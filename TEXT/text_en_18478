CLUJ NAPOCA, Romania -- Suspended President Traian Basescu cited a list of "oligarchs" whom he says rule the country according to their own interests, rather than the public's, during a rally in the central city of Cluj Napoca on Wednesday (May 9th). According to media reports, Basescu cited Rompetrol Group's CEO Dinu Patriciu, media magnate and Conservative Party leader Dan Voiculescu, former Romanian President Ion Iliescu, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, Social Democratic Party deputy Viorel Hrebenciuc, and former Economy Minister Dan Ioan Popescu. Basescu has been appearing at rallies ahead of the May 19th referendum on whether to impeach him for alleged constitutional violations.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Though voting is more than four months away, President Boris Tadic said on Wednesday (July 1st) no protections are in place for the Serb minority to participate in Kosovo's November local elections. Nor, he said, would there be any guarantee that Serbs would have any legitimacy in Kosovo institutions. Therefore, he said, Belgrade could not lend the election any support.
Kosovo counterpart Fatmir Sejdiu responded, saying Tadic's statement is "proof of an irrational and unjust approach to Kosovo Serbs, because Tadic is attempting to prevent them from accepting the reality in Kosovo". Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci reminded the Serb community that by participating in the elections, they would assume more responsibility.

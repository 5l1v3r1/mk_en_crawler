BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Prime Minister Yves Leterme said on Thursday (July 15th) that the EU will carefully monitor Serbia's reaction to the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) opinion on the legality of Kosovo's independence, which is expected on July 22nd. "The reaction of authorities in Serbia will be much more important than the opinion itself," Leterme, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency, told journalists in Brussels after meeting with Serbian President Boris Tadic. In response, Tadic reiterated that Serbia will never recognise Kosovo's independence. "Serbia is in favour of a sustainable solution, which cannot be one where one side gains everything, and the other loses," he said. (Beta, Tanjug, B92, Radio Free Europe - 15/07/10)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski again invited the Party of Democratic Prosperity (PDP) to join the ruling coalition, during a recent meeting with PDP leader Abdulmenaf Bexheti. On Monday (29 September), Bexheti said PDP is discussing the proposal, but only in general terms. He added that he remains sceptical about joining the cabinet, since the junior partner in the coalition, the Democratic Union for Integration, blocked PDP's participation when the government was first formed a year ago. Bexheti says it is still unclear whether DUI has changed its position. (Utrinski Vesnik - 30/09/03; A1 TV - 29/09/03)

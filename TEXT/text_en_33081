BRUSSELS, Belgium -- In a speech Tuesday (20 May) to the European Centre on Politics, Macedonian Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva said her country would probably be able to submit its application for EU membership by year's end. Mitreva noted that five EU members -- Italy, Luxembourg, Finland, Belgium and Greece -- have yet to ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Macedonia and the EU.
In other news Tuesday, Macedonian Local Self-Government Minister Aleksandar Gestakovski said the legal framework on power decentralisation should be adopted by the end of November. The entire decentralisation process would be completed by the beginning of 2005, in time for new mayoral and municipality council elections. (MIA, A1 TV - 20/05/03)

ANKARA, Turkey -- A new poll suggests the public is divided over the proposed ban of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). A slight majority -- 53.3% -- oppose the measure, according to the survey by A&G Research, published on Monday (June 30th). In all, 34% support the ban, while 38% said they fear economic and political chaos if the AKP is closed for allegedly undermining the secular character of the state. The prosecutor in the case, Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya, addresses the Constitutional Court on Tuesday. The defence responds on Thursday. (Hurryet, Zaman - 30/06/08)

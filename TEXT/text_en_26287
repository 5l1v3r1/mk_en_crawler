ANKARA, Turkey -- Israel's Air Force announced on Sunday (October 11th) that a joint military exercise with several NATO members has been postponed after Ankara's withdrawal from it over Tel Aviv's participation. The drills, dubbed Anatolian Eagle, were supposed to take place on Turkish territory starting Monday. They are held every few years, and are aimed at boosting international co-operation. "The exercise was postponed due to a Turkish decision to change the composition of the participants and not allow the Israeli Air Force to participate, a decision we were informed of only several days ago," read a statement from Israel. US Ambassador to Ankara Deborah Guido confirmed the information. "We look at this as a postponement, not a cancellation," she said. According to media reports, Ankara's decision was prompted by Israel's intention to send aircraft that may have been used in operations against Gaza last December.

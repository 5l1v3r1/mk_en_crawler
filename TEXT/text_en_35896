ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Simitis and Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos reiterated Monday (19 January) their countries' readiness to resume talks on the Cyprus issue, based on UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's plan. Papadopoulos said that in order to hold a referendum on the fate of the divided island, the two sides need to first reach an agreement; otherwise the results of the referendum would not be acceptable to the Greek side. Both Simitis and Papadopoulos stressed that Turkey must clarify its position for negotiations to resume. (CAN, MPA - 19/01/04)

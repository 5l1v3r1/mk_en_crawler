BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica warned the EU on Tuesday (December 11th) that it would violate international law if it establishes a mission in Pristina to assume UNMIK's supervisory functions without a new UN Security Council resolution. Kostunica was responding to the EU foreign ministers' approval on Monday of the deployment of a mission of 1,600 police and judicial officials to replace UNMIK. He added that if the EU proceeds with these plans, Belgrade would sever relations with Brussels. 
Also on Tuesday, Russia's representative in the international mediating troika, Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko, warned that should Pristina unilaterally proclaim Kosovo's independence, Russia would demand the Security Council and the head of UNMIK annul the decision. Meanwhile, Romanian Defence Minister Teodor Melescanu visited Belgrade on Tuesday and said that the Romanian parliament would not recognise an independent Kosovo. He added Romania believes the issue should be resolved through negotiations, and only with the Security Council approval.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Outgoing US Secretary of State Colin Powell said Tuesday (7 December) that his country would continue working to resolve the case of the five Bulgarian nurses sentenced to death in Libya on allegations that they infected children with HIV. Following talks in Sofia with Bulgarian counterpart Solomon Passy, Powell pledged that Washington would continue to press Tripoli on the matter. Later in the day, Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov rejected the notion of negotiating compensation for the children's families, as proposed by Libya last week. Parvanov said compensation amounts to an acknowledgement of guilt. Bulgaria has rejected the charges against the nurses. (bTV, Mediapool, BNT - 07/12/04)

ATHENS, Greece -- Representatives of the ruling New Democracy party and the opposition PASOK separately submitted requests Monday (4 October) for the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate questionable weapons contracts. The New Democracy is insisting on a probe into two agreements signed by the previous PASOK administration, related to the procurement of anti-aircraft systems and anti-artillery radar. Though PASOK denies any wrongdoing, it favours an investigation into all weapons contracts signed by the previous and current governments. 
Also Monday, an Olympic Airlines flight was forced to divert amid claims of a bomb on board. It was the third such incident involving the airline within the last month. The London-bound plane landed in Corfu and was searched before being cleared for take-off. (ANA, AFP - 05/10/04; MPA, ABC - 04/10/04)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Diplomatic sources say Ankara will return its ambassador to Washington next week, ahead of a US visit by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on April 12th, to attend a summit. Ambassador Namik Tan was recalled for consultations after the US House Foreign Affairs Committee approved a controversial resolution on March 4th, branding the 1915 killing of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire as genocide. The agreement to return Tan to Washington followed negotiations between Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

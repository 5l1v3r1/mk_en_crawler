SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The trial against four Bosnian Serb officials accused of organised crime -- Mirko Sarovic, Momcilo Mandic, Milorad Govedarica and Milovan "Cicko" Bjelica -- opened at the BiH Court on Tuesday (18 April). Former BiH presidency Serb member Sarovic and the three others are accused in relation to a fraud scheme at Privredna Banka Srpsko Sarajevo in 1998, in which the bank provided non-guaranteed loans to phantom companies established by the defendants, who then never repaid the loans. A total of 22 witnesses are expected to testify during the course of the trial.

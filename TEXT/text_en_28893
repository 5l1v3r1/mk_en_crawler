BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government is drafting a new set of measures that will allow Serbia to act quickly to prevent risks arising from Greece's debt woes, Finance Minister Diana Dragutinovic said on Friday (May 7th). The legislation will be forwarded to parliament before July. At the same time, Dragutinovic said Serbia's banking sector is stable and well-capitalised, and there should be no concerns that the Greek crisis will affect Serbia, especially now that Athens is receiving international assistance. The finance minister also said the government is ready with draft laws on pension reform, pension indexations and fiscal responsibility, and will present these to the IMF next week.

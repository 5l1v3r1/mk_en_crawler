PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- A report by the OSCE and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees released Monday (10 March) noted progress in guaranteeing minority rights but concluded that more needs to be done before larger numbers of refugees can return to Kosovo. The report said that "minority communities continue to face varying degrees of harassment, intimidation and provocation as well as limited freedom of movement." (AP, AFP - 10/03/03)

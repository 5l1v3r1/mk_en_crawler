PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Low turnout was reported in Mitrovica on Sunday (January 23rd), where a re-vote of the December 12th snap elections was held. The Central Election Commission says just 26% of voters cast ballots. Major irregularities were reported last time; this time however, the NGO Democracy in Action (DIA) reported lesser issues, such as assistance during voting, double voting, the presence of unauthorised persons in polling stations and family voting. DIA has issued preliminary results of the general elections, confirming the Democratic Party of Kosovo won with 30.8%, followed by the Democratic League of Kosovo with 26.4%, newcomer Vetevendosje with 13.3%, the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo with 10.5%, and the New Kosovo Alliance with 8%.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic said on Monday (12 December) that top war crimes fugitives Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic are on Serbia-Montenegro territory, citing information from BiH intelligence sources. He added that to boost war crimes co-operation, the cabinet would be discussing a draft law on confiscating the assets of fugitives. High Representative Paddy Ashdown has warned that Belgrade and Banja Luka might face sanctions if they fail to ensure concrete progress in war crimes co-operation. 
In Paris meanwhile, French President Jacques Chirac has called on BiH to capture Karadzic and Mladic. During a meeting with members of the tripartite BiH presidency on Monday, Chirac also called for the strengthening of democratic institutions in BiH.

ATHENS, Greece -- Abductors kidnapped shipping magnate Pericles Panagopoulos at gunpoint near his home on the outskirts of Athens on Monday (January 12th). Police say the perpetrators abducted him and his driver after deliberately blocking their car in the seaside suburb of Kavouri. A witness saw them being bundled into another vehicle, though the kidnappers later released the driver. Panagopoulos, 70, is said to be in poor health. He founded Greece's largest ferry company, Attica. (BBC -- 12/01/09)

WASHINGTON, United States -- The Pentagon will spend over $100m to build two new military bases in Bulgaria and Romania, after the government of President Barack Obama recently scrapped plans to build a missile-defence shield in Eastern Europe, online newspaper Stars and Stripes reported on Friday (October 16th). Colonel Garry Russ, commander of Joint Task Force-East, was quoted as saying that the bases in Romania and Bulgaria are evidence of the strong US commitment in Eastern Europe. Construction of the base in Romania will be completed within the next couple of months, while the base in Bulgaria will become operational in 2011 or 2012, according to Stars and Stripes.

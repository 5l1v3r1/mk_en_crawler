BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prosecutors and defence lawyers delivered closing arguments Monday (April 23rd) in the trial of those charged with murdering Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. He was gunned down by a sniper in Belgrade in March 2003. Investigators say an underworld gang, which included members of a former interior ministry special operations unit, plotted and carried out the murder. More than 150 witnesses testified during the three-year trial. Prosecutors reportedly are seeking maximum sentences. (Politika, Danas - 24/04/07; RTRS, B92, Tanjug - 23/04/07)

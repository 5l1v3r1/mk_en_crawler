BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party (DS) ruled out forming a coalition with the Serb Progressive Party (SNS), an offshoot of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) formed by former SRS deputy leader Tomislav Nikolic, media reported on Thursday (October 9th). DS Deputy Chairman Dragan Sutanovac said any coalition with the SNS would be politically "absolutely unnatural". Nikolic founded the SNS after splitting with the SRS because of a disagreement with jailed party leader Vojislav Seselj over the party's position on ratifying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A month ahead of Bulgaria's report on its EU progress in the field of justice and interior affairs, former European Parliament Rapporteur for Bulgaria Geoffrey van Orden said on Saturday (September 15th) he was dissatisfied by what he sees. "I am disappointed that more progress has not been achieved in the fights against organised crime and corruption. These are the most serious weaknesses and they heavily affect many spheres of life in Bulgaria," van Orden said. By contrast, European Commission Vice President Franco Frattini reiterated that Bulgaria is not a disappointment to the EU and has stepped up efforts to fulfil all commitments related to its EU accession. He added, however, that protracted legal proceedings remain an issue. (BNR, BGNES, Netinfo - 15/09/07)

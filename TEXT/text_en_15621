SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Fadil Sulejmani, a member of parliament affiliated with the main ethnic Albanian opposition Democratic Union of Integration (DUI), announced on Wednesday (October 25th) that he is leaving the party, to serve instead as an independent. He blamed DUI's policy of boycotting parliament's work, as well as constant quarrels with other ethnic Albanian formations. Without him, DUI has 13 deputies in the 120-member legislature.

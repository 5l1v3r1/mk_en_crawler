ZAGREB, Croatia -- The main opposition party, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), announced Monday (10 November) that it has expelled its most outspoken nationalist, retired General Ljubo Cesic Rojs. The party issued a statement saying it was distancing itself from his inflammatory statements, in which he has attacked other ethnic groups, particularly Serbs. The move by the HDZ was seen as an attempt to improve its image ahead of the 23 November parliamentary elections.
In other news, a new poll suggests the public would prefer to see a coalition of several parties instead of a single party in power. The government commissioned the survey by the Puls agency. (MediaScan - 11/11/03; AFP, HINA - 10/11/03)

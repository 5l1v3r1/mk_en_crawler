BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) decided on Wednesday (December 20th) to open talks with Croatia on three more chapters of the acquis: enterprise and industry policy, economic and monetary policy, and customs union. Croatia has opened and provisionally closed two chapters with the EU -- education and culture, and science and research.
Separately Wednesday, COREPER decided to begin talks with Turkey on one new chapter of the acquis -- enterprise and industrial policy. COREPER sent a letter to Ankara, asking Turkish authorities to submit their position. Actual talks are to open in January at the earliest. (HRT, Aksam, Milliyet - 21/12/06; Zaman, Anka - 20/12/06)

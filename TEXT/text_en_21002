PODGORICA, Montenegro -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn firmly rejected the idea that Kosovo's likely independence will lead to the so-called "syndrome of little countries in the Balkans" with more areas from the region following suit and demanding independence. "Europe's activities are such that there is no room for that sort of process," Rehn is quoted as saying in Monday's (February 4th) edition of the Podgorica magazine CG Ekonomist. Rehn added that the solution to the Kosovo status process will be the result of a co-ordinated effort led by the EU. He reiterated that the EU is ready to send a mission to Kosovo and take full responsibility for the situation there. He said that the future of Kosovo and the western Balkans is in the EU.

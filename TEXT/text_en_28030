BELGRADE, Serbia -- The trial of 15 soccer fans charged with the murder of a French citizen began on Wednesday (April 21st) in Belgrade. Two of the defendants are being prosecuted in absentia. Brice Taton, a fan of the French football club Toulouse, died in hospital last September after he was attacked by fans of rival team Partizan Belgrade, ahead of a match between the two squads. Prosecutors plan to seek the maximum sentence for each defendant, 40 years in prison. 
In other news Wednesday, the Avala TV tower -- a symbol of the city of Belgrade -- re-opened on Wednesday, more than a decade after it was demolished during the 1999 NATO air campaign. Mayor Dragan Djilas told those attending the ceremony -- including several dignitaries -- that the tower should be a symbol of the future. (Tanjug, Politika, Beta, B92, RTS, AP - 21/04/10)

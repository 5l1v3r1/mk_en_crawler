BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic will not attend next month's inauguration ceremony of Croatian President-elect Ivo Josipovic, his cabinet said on Wednesday (January 20th). The announcement comes after Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu said he will be there. 
Tadic said Wednesday that a statement by outgoing Croatian President Stipe Mesic -- who threatened military intervention if Republika Srpska tried to secede from Bosnia and Herzegovina --.was a threat against regional security. Tadic added that he will mention the threat Friday when addressing the UN Security Council in New York. The Council plans to discuss the Kosovo situation. (Beta, B92, RTS, Tanjug, DPA - 20/01/10)

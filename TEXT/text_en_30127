TIRANA, Albania -- Miroslav Lajcak, the EU mediator in efforts to resolve Albania's political stalemate, reiterated on Tuesday (March 22nd) Brussels' expectations for the country to move forward. The upcoming May 8th local elections are key and it is up to the government and state institutions to guarantee that they are free, Lajcak said after a series of meetings in Tirana. He also commented on the violent events in January, when four protestors died in clashes that erupted during an anti-government protest. He urged prosecutors to conduct an independent investigation.

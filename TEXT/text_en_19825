ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader struck an agreement Wednesday (September 19th) with the leaders of political parties in parliament to establish two commissions that would work to resolve the country's border disputes with Slovenia. The first panel would pinpoint the specific disputed locations, while the other would be responsible for the legal framework involved in presenting the case to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Croatia and Slovenia plan to establish joint commissions as well. (Vjesnik, Poslovni Dnevnik - 20/09/07; Vecernji list - 19/09/07)

NEW YORK, United States -- Turkey's government will ask parliament to authorise the deployment of peacekeepers to Iraq only if it expects to be able to get an authorising motion, said Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, who is currently in New York. When pressed by a reporter Wednesday (24 September), he added that if the government sensed approval is unlikely, no request would be submitted. In Ankara, meanwhile, the media quoted Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan as saying that the cabinet would try to resolve the issue and obtain an authorisation motion in October.

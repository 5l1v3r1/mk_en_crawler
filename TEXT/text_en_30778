SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH is facing its worst crisis since the end of the 1991-95 war, the International Crisis Group (ICG) said in a report published on its web site on Friday (May 6th). "Seven months after elections, there is no state government and little prospect for one soon," the group said, warning that "violence is probably not imminent but is a near prospect if this continues." The ICG urged the international community to "to launch a strategic rethink of international policy", which should "culminate before the planned mid-June Republika Srpska (RS) referendum". 
Meanwhile, Belgrade-based news agency Tanjug reported on Saturday that RS President Milorad Dodik has sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reassuring him that the planned referendum in the entity is not about secession. "The referendum is in full accordance with the law and represents a legitimate way to determine the will of the people," Dodik said. (B92, Tanjug - 07/05/11; ICG website - 06/05/11)

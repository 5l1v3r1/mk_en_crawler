ENVIRONMENT 

1. Please provide information on current and planned measures promoting energy efficiency and new and renewable energies (nature of measures; budget available, etc.). 
Direct and indirect provisions on energy efficiency are incorporated in the Energy Law, the National Strategy on Economic Development and other related laws and regulations. The Energy Law (“Official Gazette of RM“ No 47/97, 40/99, 98/00, 94/02 and 38/03), see 14_Annex_01, is a principal legal framework for this sector. This Law determines the national policy on energy which, among other things, emphasizes the importance of: increased use of natural gas as a high priority environmentally friendly fuel; incorporating energy efficiency into the construction standards; separating the funds necessary for realization of energy efficiency projects; identifying the possibilities for efficient energy consumption; adopting measures and activities for realization of the aforementioned activities. In 1999 the Government of the Republic of Macedonia adopted a Programme on efficient energy use in the Republic of Macedonia until 2020, see 14_Annex_10. The preparation of this programme is also a legal obligation stemming from the Energy Law. This Programme determines many measures on increasing the energy efficiency, among which: preparation of a Strategy on energy efficiency in the Republic of Macedonia until 2020; legal and other incentive measures; establishment of a fund for financial support; preparation of investment and technical documentation for realization of concrete projects; realization of concrete projects; preparation of regulations, standards and other acts; informational and educational activities; publications and brochures; international activities. The initial activity in the Programme is preparation of the Strategy on energy efficiency in the Republic of Macedonia until 2020, see 14_Annex_09. The Strategy was prepared in the beginning of 2004, upon an initiative of the Ministry of Economy. It was prepared by the American company Nexant. Inc., in cooperation with national experts, and was adopted by the Government in October 2004. The strategy includes a number of initiatives, including capacity building, as well as technical activities. Institutional building and capacity building include the following activities: founding of Energy Efficiency Agency; receiving a certificate from energy auditor; energy codes for facilities; equipment standards; founding an Energy Efficiency Fund. A number of technical programmes which were identified and analysed were included into the implementation plan. Some of the more important initiatives described in the Strategy are: A Programme on housing facilities; a Programme on commercial facilities; a Programme on buildings of public institutions; a Programme on industrial facilities; a Programme on street lighting. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in 1994 provided credit in amount of 4.500.000 EUR for realization of projects for rational energy use, under the following conditions: 10 years of down payment, which includes 2 years of grace period and LIBOR+1 interest rate. The Ministry of Economy, on an open competition, allocated these funds as a loan to 27 economic operators in the country for co-financing of energy efficiency projects, 15 of which for adaptation of energy machines in industrial facilities for natural gas usage. In the period between 1998 and 2003, through the PSO Programme of the Government of the Netherlands, with a total amount of 3.500.000 EUR, five projects on energy efficiency and exploitation of renewable energy sources were implemented. Grant funds for preparing a Programme on small hydro plants were provided through the World Bank, in 1998. The programme considers 70 small hydro plants with total installed capacity of 183 MW and annual production of electricity of 700 GWh. Within the bilateral cooperation of the Republic of Macedonia with the Republic of Austria, the Austrian Government provided grant funds in amount of 400.000 EUR in 1998 for implementation of the project „Geothermal system - Koani”. This was a successful project and the effects from the operation of this system are visible today. In 1999 the Austrian Government also provided grant funds of 420.000 EUR for realization of the project „Geothermal system - Vinica”. Renewable sources of energy are subject of many foreign and domestic studies which treat the energy efficiency, too. Three particularly useful studies, developed with foreign financial support, are:    “Potential of renewable energy sources in the Republic of Macedonia”, Electrotek Concepts and Macedonian Academy of Science and Art, funded by USAID, 1999;   The report prepared through funding of EU SYNERGY Programme in March 2001: “Energy-related policies in the EU member-states regarding protection of the environment and energy efficiency: Possibilities of their implementation in Macedonia”; and   EU PHARE programme “Investment options in the energy sector”, prepared by Exergia S.A.  In these studies, among other things, the potentials of renewable sources in the Republic of Macedonia and the energy efficiency potentials are estimated.  In October 2004 the Government of the Republic of Macedonia allocated approximatly 65.000 EUR from Swiss Counterpart fund for preparation of a Study on utilizing renewable energy sources in the Republic of Macedonia. This Study shall include analysis of the necessary expenses and the benefits of using the renewable energy sources. In addition, within this Study, an impact assessment of the European legislation in the area of renewable energy will be prepared. In the period from July 2004 to July 2005, the Project for Preparation of a Programme on renewable energy will be carried out, which shall enable provision of a grant of 5.000.000 USD from the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) through the World Bank as an implementation agency. The basic objective of this Programme is stimulation of investments in energy efficiency and use of renewable energies by removal of institutional and financial barriers. With realization of this programme, a Fund for Sustainable Energy for support of projects on energy efficiency and renewable energy sources will be founded. Within the cooperation with the Republic of Austria, a decision on grant assistance of about 300.000 EUR for realization of a programme on solar water heaters is expected in the beginning of 2005. The programme envisages a training of professionals on solar energy and a realization of a programme on improvement of technology and production of thermal solar energy equipment and systems, in the period between 2005 and 2007.  
Other related laws and regulations 
The Law on Local Self-Government (“Official Gazette of RM” No 05/02) transfers the authority to the local government. This Law determines that, among other obligations, the municipalities are authorized for supply of natural gas and thermal energy, protection of the environment and the nature. The existing law and laws on amending the Law on Construction Activities (“Official Gazette of RM” No 15/90, 11/91, 11/94 and 18/99), do not include specific provisions that require investors or contractors to design and build new buildings in the most energy efficient way. However, in the sections dedicated to the technical documentation needed for construction of a new building, this Law requires the documentation of the project to be prepared according to the standards and norms on construction design brought by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The Law on Prescribing Technical Requirements for Products and Conformity Assessment (“Official Gazette of RM” No 55/02) defines the regulations which impose technical requirements onto the “products”. These technical requests are regulated in a legal form for the purpose of protection and promotion of the environment, as well as protection of consumers and other users of products. In accordance to the Article 4, Paragraph 2 of this Law, the technical requirements may be adopted and implemented by the Ministry competent for production, trade and usage of appropriate products (including construction of buildings). Therefore, there are no legal obstacles for implementation of provisions on mandatory application of norms and standards which would stimulate efficient energy use in buildings (and other consumers of energy). It is worth mentioning that there are standards on thermal insulation of the buildings, dating from before the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia. However, the implementation of this Rulebook is limited. The current version of this Rulebook on standards regarding techniques of heating and issues related to thermal insulation was published in the Official Gazette No. 32/1999. This Rulebook adopts the appropriate ISO standards and standards from the En-Charter as national standards (ISO 6946, 7345, 9251, 9346, 9229, 1011-1). These standards, however, are mostly related to the method of calculation, and not to the minimal criteria for insulation and in many cases, according to the law, their application is not compulsory. 
2. The European Union has adopted legislation with a view to improving energy efficiency, the environment and to promote renewable energy. (E.g.: Directive 93/75/EC to limit carbon dioxyde emissions by improving energy efficiency; Directive 96/57/EC on energy labelling of household electric refrigerators, freezers and combinations; Directive 2000/55/EC on energy efficiency requirements for ballasts for fluorescent lighting; Directive 2001/77/EC on the promotion of Renewable Energy Sources in the consumption of electricity; Directive 2002/91/EC on the energy performance of buildings; Directive 2003/30/EC on the promotion of biofuels; Directive 2004/8/EC on the promotion of cogeneration; Directive 2003/96/EC for the taxation of energy products and electricity.)  a) Is there framework legislation in place (an Energy Law)? Does secondary legislation already exist? Which piece of legislation corresponds with which acquis and what is the state of compatibility? Is your country already labelling appliances according to EU acquis? Is the institutional framework in place and operational (National Agency, etc.)? What is its staffing and budget? b) Has a governmental National Plan or Strategy been adopted to promote renewable energy sources and rational use of energy?  c) Have studies to assess the impact of the European acquis in the field of renewable energy been undertaken? d) What difficulties do you foresee in the gradual adoption of these EU rules? What timetables for application are there foreseen? e) In relation to Directive 2001/77/EC and Directive 2003/30/EC on the promotion of Renewable Energy Sources, what is the current situation and what are your ambitions for the contribution of renewable energy sources in electricity production by the years 2010, 2015 and 2020? (Please use the methodology of the annex of the Directive.) 
a)    The existing Energy Law (“Official Gazette of RM“ No 47/97, 40/99, 98/00, 94/02 and 38/03), see 14_Annex_01, contains provisions on energy efficiency. Pursuant to these provisions, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia adopts a long-term programme on efficient energy use. For realization of this programme, the Government establishes an Energy Efficiency Fund, which shall be financed by banks and other financial institutions, foreign loans, donations and sponsorships from domestic and foreign legal entities and natural persons. According to the Programme for Approximation of the National Legislation to the Legislation of the European Union, a new Energy Law is being prepared. The Law shall contain a separate section on the provisions for energy efficiency and exploitation of renewable energy sources, shall be adopted in 2005 and shall be in conformity with the EU Acquis in the area of energy efficiency.  After the adoption of the new Energy Law, secondary legislation is going to be adopted. The secondary legislation will be approximated with the directives from the EU acquis, concerning the area of rational energy use and energy savings. For the time being, only a Draft-Licence on production of electricity from renewable energy sources, which according to the Energy Law is responsibility of the Energy Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Macedonia, has been prepared. The new Law on Construction, which is in adoption phase, contains provisions which would impose an obligation to the investor to comply with energy efficiency standards. This draft Law contains provisions according to which the technical documentation needs to define the concept and technical specifications of the construction project, as well as plans for its construction. The new Draft Law on Construction requires compulsory estimation on energy consumption, as one of the criteria contained in the technical documentation. The Republic of Macedonia still has not introduced labelling of appliances, which shall be introduced with the new Energy Law.  In the Republic of Macedonia there is no related institutional framework in place. An Energy Agency shall be established by separate law, planned for adoption in 2006.  Competences regarding rational use of energy and exploitation of renewable energy sources are responsibilities of the Sector for Energy and Raw Materials within the Ministry of Economy.  
b)  
In 1999 the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, upon a proposal from the Ministry of Economy, adopted a Programme on efficient energy use in the Republic of Macedonia until 2020, see 14_Annex_10. The initial activity of the Programme concerns the preparation of a Strategy on Energy Efficiency of the Republic of Macedonia until 2020, see 14_Annex_09, and establishment of a fund for financial support of energy efficiency, which shall enable realization of concrete projects, preparation of investment and technical documentation, publication of brochures and publications etc. Establishment of this fund is also a legal obligation stemming from the Energy Law. The Strategy on Energy Efficiency in the Republic of Macedonia until 2020 was adopted by the Government. A Sustainable Energy Fund is expected to be established, upon receiving of a grant financial support provided by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF).  National Strategy on Economic Development of the Republic of Macedonia, which was initiated by the Government, financed by UNDP and the Government of Austria, and published in December 1997, emphasizes the need for energy efficiency as a key factor for accomplishing the national development objectives. In general terms, this document suggests the necessity of striving towards economic development with minimal consumption of energy, and at the same time the document identifies the positive consequences on the environment resulting from more efficient energy use. 
c)  
In October 2004 the Government of the Republic of Macedonia allocated approx. 65.000 EUR from Swiss Counterpart fund for preparation of a Study on utilizing renewable energy sources in the Republic of Macedonia. This Study shall include analysis of the costs and benefits from use of renewable energy sources. In addition, within this Study, an impact assessment of the European legislation in the area of renewable energy will be prepared. 
d)  
Possible difficulties in adoption of the EU rules on energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy sources could be:   Amendments to several laws and secondary legislation of the Republic of Macedonia, as well as adoption of new regulations;   Organizational activities in civil administration and other institutions;   Financial support for implementation;   Low prices of energy sources;   Appropriate education of professionals in various sectors.  It is estimated that overcoming the identified barriers and adoption of EU rules in this area shall take place in the following 10 years. 
e)  
The Republic of Macedonia has a long-term tradition in exploitation of the hydro potential. Currently, that enables 19% of electricity production to originate from renewable energy sources. The current production of electricity from renewable energy sources is above the national indicated targets of the Directive.  For 2003, production of electricity from renewable energy sources,–or specificly from the hydro potential of the Republic of Macedonia, was 4,9 x 10 TJ, or 21,6%, and for 2004 it was 4,2 ·10 TJ, or 19%.  It is realistic to expect that the national indicated target of 22% will be accomplished by 2010, then, 25% by 2015, and 27% by 2020. These national indicated targets are justified by the estimates of maximum exploitation of the hydro potential of the country, introducing technologies for exploitation of bio-mass energy as well as bio-gas from water treatment stations.  The Republic of Macedonia so far has kept the pace with the EU requirements regarding the quality requirements of the fuels intended for transport. The Republic of Macedonia currently does not have own production or technology available for biofuels or other renewable fuels which could substitute conventional fuels for transport. Studies on feasibility of such a production and use have not been made. Of course, in accordance with the general efforts for improved environment, there is a high interest for application of biofuels. 
3. What is the current status of your country in standardisation bodies active in the energy sector, such as CEN/CENELEC? 
The National Technical Committee “Oil and Lubricants” within its scope of activities covers the area of appropriate CEN committees. This Committee follows the work of CEN committees in the respective area. Activities related to joining CEN/CENELEC are ongoing. 4. Concerning the oil sector, do standard forms such as EN-288 (unleaded petrol-automotive fuel), EN-589 (LPG automotive fuel), EN-590 (diesel automotive fuel) exist? 
The existing Macedonian standards on quality of liquid fuels (automotive petrol, unleaded automotive petrol, diesel fuel, jet fuel and heating oils) were prepared in 1999 using as a basis existing European standards. Enforcement and application of these standards is regulated by the Rulebook on Quality of Liquid Fuels (“Official Gazette of RM” No 72/03, 85/03 and 23/04), where: - Content of lead in automotive petrol is:   For leaded petrol, 0,15 g.Pb/l (previously 0,6 g.Pb/l)   For unleaded petrol, 0,013 g.Pb/l (previously 0,02 g.Pb/l) - Content of sulphur in diesel fuels is:    0,26% g.Pb/l (previously 0,6 g.Pb/l) The National Technical Committee on Oil and Lubricants is currently working on translation of texts of the standards: EN-228 2004 and EN-590 2004. Adoption of these standards, as well as the standard EN-589 2004 on automotive fuels is planned for 2005. 
INITIATIVE FOR ADOPTING THE NEW EUROPEAN STANDARDS EN-228 AND EN-590 . 
The Technical Committee on producing draft standards “Oil products and lubricants” received an initiative by JSC Makpetrol Skopje for amendments to Macedonian standards: MKS B.H2.210: 1999 on unleaded petrol; and MKS B.H2.410: 1999 on diesel fuel; Or creating and adopting Macedonian standards on Unleaded Automotive Petrol Super 98+ and  diesel. At the same time, the group of motor vehicles and spare parts vendors within the Macedonian Economic Chamber submitted an initiative on adopting the European standards of unleaded and diesel fuels, harmonized with EN and ISO standards.  Based on the above mentioned, the Technical Committee on producing draft standards “Oil products and lubricants” on its session on 28.09.2004 accepted the proposal on adoption of an Annex to the National standard on unleaded petrol super 98. After eventual positive response from competent institutions, a procedure on adoption of this standard is expected to begin. By adopting the Rulebook on Quality of Liquid Fuels (“Official Gazette of RM” No 72/03, 85/03 and 23/04) the first phase of the strategic recommendations was realized and completed. Currently, there is ongoing implementation of the second phase of the strategic recommendations, which includes:    Establishing an independent laboratory for fuel quality testing;    Appointing a competent institution on monitoring the quality of fuels and preparing a national system on systematic supervision on the fuel data;   Adopting legal acts (secondary legislation) on the Law on accreditation of laboratories for fuel quality control;   Specifying a specific deadline for elimination of leaded petrol;   Technical Committee on Standardization should prepare new Macedonian standards which shall apply only to unleaded petrol, and shall include all new requirements from EU Directives;   Preparation of Rulebook which shall enforce the new Macedonian standards on petrol, and shall apply only to unleaded petrol; and   Preparation of a strategy on communication and a campaign for raising the public awareness, for the purpose of informing all relevant organizations about the prohibition date of leaded petrol, which will satisfy the requirements of the Directive 98/70/C on quality of automotive fuel and diesel fuels. This phase will be completed before 01.01.2006 in accordance with the Basic plan on elimination of lead from the petrol, adopted in 2003 as a result of the project “Strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning“, PHARE programme SOP 99.  For the time being, sampling for examination of the quality of liquid fuels and methods for determining limit values by a Rulebook are performed according to Macedonian standards on liquid fuels, as follows:

5. Do any regulations on emissions from route and non-route vehicles exist? 
In the Republic of Macedonia since 02.11.2000, when the Order on mandatory testing (homologation) of wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts for motor vehicles (“Official Gazette of RM”    The period between December 1 and February 28(29) is considered as winter period, between April 16 and  September 30 as summer period. Periods between October 1 and November 30 and between March 1 and April  are fall periods. No 84/01, 21/02, 31/02, 52/02, 26/04 and 35/04) was adopted, the issue related to emissions from route vehicles is completely regulated. In the following table (which is contained in the Order), rulebooks are related to emission of gases from route vehicles. ECE rulebooks, which are harmonized with appropriate EEC directives of EU, are indicated.

6. Could information be given on compliance with EU standards in other energy sub-sectors? 
Currently, valid Macedonian standards from the other energy sub-sectors are still not harmonised with the European norms from the corresponding area. A preliminary assessment of the correspondence of the standards which are valid in the Republic of Macedonia (MKS) and the equivalent CEN / CENELEC standards is in progress. Comparative tables on the numbers of corresponding standards in individual energy sub-sectors are given below.

451 * Standards from the corresponding Technical Committee (TC) of CENELEC include more than one group of MKS standards Considering that the MKS classification of standards is not identical to the EN classification, one MKS standard may be equivalent to more than one EN standard. The process of harmonisation of the legislation in this area in the Republic of Macedonia, as well as the needs of industry and consumers will determine the schedule of adoption of the European Standards. Having this in mind, the Standardisation Institute of the Republic of Macedonia commenced activities for preparation of bases for planned adoption of the European standards as Macedonian. 7. Please provide information on energy technology and other programmes aiming at promoting energy efficiency and renewables. Could details of these programmes be provided, including the level of public subsidies? 
The Strategy on energy efficiency, among other things, incorporates determination for realization of projects with new technological solutions on energy efficiency. Project for Preparation of a Programme on renewable energy (2004-2005) financed by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), through the World Bank as an implementation agency, (350.000 USD), for establishing a Fund for Sustainable Energy and Body for Project Development Assistance. The basic aim of this project is promotion of energy efficiency and use of renewable energy resources through financial support of new technologies and economically justified projects from this area.  Project “Solar Water Heaters” (2005-2007), which is expected to be approved for financing by the Austrian Government in the beginning of 2005, (about 300.000 EUR) for training of professionals in solar energy and improvement of the technology of production, evaluation of the available technology and energy characteristics of the existing solar cells and their production, as well as development of knowledge and technology of the production of solar cells and tanks. A Programme on Efficient Distribution of Energy (2004-2005) financed by the Swiss Government, (12.100.000 CHF), divided into four components, the third being a promotion of energy efficiency, (250.000 CHF). This component provides for preparation and conducting of a survey, processing and analyzing of data, providing recommendations for realization of concrete projects for increasing energy efficiency, and project implementation. Feasibility study on construction of a cogeneration gas plant 184-237 MWe + 134-177 MWth (2004), financed by a Japanese grant through the World Bank. The aim of the study is evaluation of economical feasibility of constructing cogeneration gas plant in Skopje, and helping to find a strategic investor; selection of a consultant for preparation of tender documentation for realization of the cogeneration plant. With this cogeneration plant, a new technological process of production of electricity and thermal energy will be introduced. Funds of 750.000 USD are provided from the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) through the World Bank, for co-financing of five small hydro power plants with total installed capacity of 1,37 MW and annual electricity production of 11 GWh.   With the realization of the project “Geothermal system - Koani“, a new geothermal well for exploitation of low-temperature geothermal water for heating of greenhouses, public and business premises was built. For the purpose of rational exploitation of the spring, a modern electronic monitoring system for regulation and a system for waste water re-injection were built. For the purpose of greater exploitation of the geothermal water for heating, a connection of households to the distribution hot water network in the city of Koani is planned for the near future. Within the framework of the project “Geothermal system – Vinica“ the following primary goals were achieved: sustainability of the geothermal water production, optimization of the transmission and distribution system, and adaptation of greenhouses to new achievements in heating technology. Within the PSO Programme of the Dutch Government in the period between 1998 and 2003 the following five projects on energy efficiency and exploitation of the renewable energy sources were implemented:  Energy savings in the factory Evropa AD-Skopje, by converting the heating system from hot-water to steam, optimizing the steam system and introducing a new production line (of caramels) with greater energy efficiency. By completing the whole project, savings of energy consumption in the production process of the company were achieved; 
 Exploitation of biomass for energy purposes in the factory Lozar AD-Veles, which accomplished the primary aim for heating the company's greenhouses by exploitation of waste vine branches as a renewable energy resource. The realization of the project enabled the greenhouse boiler room in the company Lozar AD- Veles to be equipped with a new system for incineration of vine branches, which replaced the old system which used heavy oil as a fuel. This project enabled replacement of the fossil fuels with another energy source - biomass (vine branches), which contributes to increased energy efficiency and decreased pollution of the air, and in the future much larger positive energy and environmental effects may be expected;  Alternative energy source for Teteks AD-Tetovo, which contributes to reduction of environmental pollution, enabling the company “Teteks“ AD Tetovo to replace the old coal boilers with new, which use heavy oil for a fuel, with a final purpose of their adaptation to natural gas when it will be available, which shall contribute to decreased pollution of the air and soil, and in future much larger positive energy and environmental effects will be achieved,  Upgrade of the process of powder enamelling in boiler production (for sanitary hot water) in the company Leov Company-Veles, by setting up a complete section for powder enamelling of boilers which satisfies the environmental regulations for enamelling. The environmentally clean technology itself enables energy savings in the production process as well as increased energy efficiency of the final product; and  Market-oriented upgrade of the valves and fittings production programme in MZT, Macedonia, which achieved the primary objective for energy efficient and environmentally friendly production of castings (valves and fittings) in MZT - Skopje. This project enabled painting of the castings in MZT with epoxy pitch instead of bitumen, which achieved positive environmental effects in the production process. The final product has a high-grade insulation and corrosion protection, which makes it an ecology product by itself.

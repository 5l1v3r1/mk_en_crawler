ATHENS, Greece -- The government won a confidence vote on Monday (22 March) in the country's newly elected parliament. All 165 deputies of the conservative New Democracy Party backed the cabinet of Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis. The 135 opposition lawmakers voted against the government.
Also Monday, Economy and Finance Minister Yiorgos Alogoskoufis accused the previous Socialist government of manipulating statistics before the 7 March elections. He warned that the budget deficit would be around 2.7 per cent of GDP in 2004, rather than the projected 1.7 per cent. He also said economic growth in 2003 was 4.2 per cent rather than the previous cabinet's estimate of 5 per cent. (ANA, MPA - 23/03/04; AFP - 22/03/04)

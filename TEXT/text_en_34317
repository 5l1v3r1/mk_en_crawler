PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Montenegrin State Prosecutor Vesna Medenica asked the government to sack deputy prosecutor Zoran Piperovic and one other judicial official in connection with a sex trade scandal. Last year, a Moldovan woman accused Piperovic and other officials of abusing her while she was held against her will in a Montenegrin brothel. Piperovic was detained briefly and then released for lack of evidence. (AFP - 28/10/03)

ANKARA, Turkey -- The Constitutional Court will begin debating the closure case against the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) Monday (July 28th), the deputy chairman of the court, Osman Paksut, said on Tuesday. The court will try to make its ruling "as soon as possible", he added. Court members have examined the report on the AKP case submitted by rapporteur Osman Can, who advised against banning the party. It stands accused of undermining the secular character of the state.
In other news, Turkish police on Wednesday arrested 26 people with suspected links to the shadowy secularist group Ergenekon, which is accused of plotting a coup against the pro-Islamic government. A large-scale police operation in the provinces of Konya, Kocaeli, Elazig, Mersin and in Istanbul detained the suspects.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic on Wednesday (August 18th) asked EULEX to react after Pristina authorities banned his scheduled visit to Kosovo. Bogdanovic was supposed to visit on Thursday. He described the cancellation as a political provocation and urged the EU Rule of Law Mission to make it clear to Pristina that such actions cause tension. Kosovo's government decided to ban Serbian authorities from making official visits in order to prevent provocative political statements that have occurred during previous visits.

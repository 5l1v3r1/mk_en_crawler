BUCHAREST, Romania -- The main opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) will hold an extraordinary congress on December 10th to vote on leaders and policy changes. PSD president Mircea Geoana told reporters on Friday (November 3rd) that the December convention would be aimed at streamlining PSD's organisational structure. 
In other news, some 500 people gathered in Iasi on Saturday to support a new political project, the Liberal Platform, launched by Theodor Stolojan, former leader of the National Liberal Party (PNL). He was forced out weeks ago due to arguments with current party leaders. Addressing supporters, Stolojan again criticised the politics of PNL and Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, and called for early elections. (Ziua - 06/11/06; Mediafax - 04/11/06)

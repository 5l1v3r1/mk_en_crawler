ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish Chief of General Staff General Ilker Basbug on Friday (June 26th) firmly rejected allegations that the army has prepared a plot to destabilise the Justice and Development Party's (AKP) government, media reported. "We will not permit anyone in our ranks to get involved in unlawful activities," he stressed. Earlier in June, the liberal daily Taraf claimed military circles had prepared a plan "to break popular support" for the AKP and one of its influential supporters, Muslim preacher Fethullah Gulen.

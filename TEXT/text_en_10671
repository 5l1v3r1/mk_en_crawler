TIRANA, Albania -- Residents of the capital continued protests Friday (8 October) against the demolition of buildings the government says were illegally constructed. The buildings in question are located along the so-called New Ring, a road that encircles Tirana. The protesters set several tyres on fire and staged a sit-in, blocking access to the main road. After hours of negotiation, the road reopened. The protesters -- some of whom say they have lived in the buildings since 1992 -- want to know why the state took so long to act.

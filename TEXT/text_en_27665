ATHENS, Greece -- Rating agency Standard & Poors on Tuesday (April 27th) drastically cut Greece's credit rating by three levels from BBB+ to junk status, following a new assessment of the political, economic and budget challenges confronting the government in its efforts to overcome its debt crisis. The downgrade sent world financial markets plunging Tuesday and Wednesday. Late last week, Athens requested activation of a 45 billion euro aid mechanism from the EU and the IMF. The Financial Times is reporting that the IMF is now considering whether to boost the aid package by 10 billion euros. (FT, Reuters, Bloomberg, AP - 27/04/10)

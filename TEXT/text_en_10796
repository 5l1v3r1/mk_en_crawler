TIRANA, Albania -- The new head of the OSCE mission in Albania, Ambassador Pavel Vacek, urged the acceleration of electoral reforms in the country, during his first official press conference in Tirana on Friday (5 November). The Czech diplomat stressed that unless the Albanian political players work to step up the pace of electoral reform ahead of next year's parliamentary elections, a serious setback would occur. 
In other news, Albania and Turkey have sealed a new military co-operation agreement for 2005. According to an announcement Friday, Ankara will continue to provide assistance in reforming the defence sector, to bolster Tirana's bid for NATO entry.

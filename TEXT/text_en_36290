BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Clifford Bond said in an interview published Saturday (29 May) that leaders of Republika Srpska "will have to suffer the consequences" if the country is not accepted in NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme because of their failure to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal. RS has just appointed lawyer Zivorad Mijatovic to head the office for co-operation with The Hague tribunal. The previous administrator, Dejan Miletic, was dismissed for failing to co-operate with the Srebrenica Commission.
On Friday, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer told the members of BiH's tripartite presidency that the chances of being invited to join the PfP during NATO's summit next month would be "close to zero" if something fundamental is not done about capturing major war crimes suspects.

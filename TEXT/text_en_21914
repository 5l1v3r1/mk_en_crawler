ATHENS, Greece -- Traffic in central Athens remained block for over two hours Friday (September 19th) after about 300 employees of the national air carrier Olympic Airlines clashed with the police over plans to privatise the airline. No injuries or arrests were reported. Local opposition and trade unions have vowed to continue protests against the privatisation of the embattled air carrier, which was approved by the European Commission on Wednesday. They are afraid the transfer of the company to private hands will result in massive job cuts. (AP, Sky - 19/09/08)

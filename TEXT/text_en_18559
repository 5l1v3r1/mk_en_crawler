ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul called for changes Monday (February12th) to a controversial legal provision that makes it a crime to "insult Turkishness". Article 301 of the Criminal Code must be changed, he said, because it damages the country's reputation. "People outside Turkey think you can be thrown into jail for opening your mouths. They think there are hundreds of journalists and intellectuals in jail ... This is all false," Gul said. A number of Turkish writers and intellectuals have been tried under this article for statements regarding the so-called World War I era Armenian genocide, but most have been acquitted. Gul also clarified that Article 301 would be amended, not scrapped. 
Separately Monday, Gul met with visiting Australian counterpart Alexander Downer. They sealed a bilateral agreement on combating international terrorism. Ankara is hosting a two-day conference on counterterrorism and non-proliferation activities. (Sabah, Zaman - 13/02/07; Reuters - 12/02/07)

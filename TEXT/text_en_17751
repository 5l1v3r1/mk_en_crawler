ANKARA, Turkey -- The country's chief prosecutor criticised the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan for its plans to amend the constitution regarding the election and powers of the president. "Trying to overcome every political and administrative problem by changing the constitution ... leads to tensions in politics and society," Nuri Ok said. The ruling Justice and Development Party began trying to pass amendments to let the people directly elect the head of state after the party fell a few votes short in Parliament to elect Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul as president. 
On Sunday, meanwhile, thousands turned out for the latest in a series of rallies in support of secularism. This one was held in Black Sea port city of Samsun. (CNN - 20/05/07; Reuters - 18/05/07)

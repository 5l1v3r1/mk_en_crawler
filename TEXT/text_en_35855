ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Sunday (25 January) that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas had agreed to revive UN-backed talks on the reunification of Cyprus. The two men met a day after Erdogan called on UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to send a mediator to the island. Denktas had previously opposed the plan, calling it "a plot" against Turkish Cypriots. Erdogan also met on Sunday with Turkish Cypriot Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat and his deputy Serdar Denktas, both of whom support efforts to reunify Cyprus. Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Panos Beglitis told a local radio station Sunday that his country and Cyprus are prepared to resume negotiations on the UN plan.

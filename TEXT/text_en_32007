PODGORICA, Montenegro, Yugoslavia -- Serbia and Montenegro are going to draft a new constitution by the end of November, says Miodrag Vukovic, a member of the joint constitutional commission and an official with the ruling Party of Democratic Socialists in Montenegro. He predicts the final agreement may be signed as early as Friday (29 November) at the commission's next session in Podgorica, now that the last thorny issues, involving the election of deputies to the new common parliament, have been resolved. Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic seemed less confident, but predicted Saturday that the new constitution would be adopted by year's end.
In other news, the Socialist Party of Serbia urged its supporters Saturday to vote for extreme nationalist Vojislav Seselj in Serbia's 8 December presidential election. The Socialists say the decision follows consultations with party chairman Slobodan Milosevic. (Pobjeda, Politika - 24/11/02; Tanjug, B92, AP - 23/11/02)

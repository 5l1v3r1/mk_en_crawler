SKOPJE, Macedonia -- US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Marc Grossman said Macedonia should actively support efforts by the international community to stabilise Kosovo and resolve the issue of status. Grossman met on Thursday (6 November) with President Boris Trajkovski and Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski, as well as with Ali Ahmeti, leader of DUI, the largest ethnic Albanian party in the country. Grossman called for the speedier integration of Southeast European countries in the EU and NATO, and urged Macedonia to complete implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement. Crvenkovski and other officials will visit Washington later this month at the invitation of Vice President Dick Cheney. (Utrinski Vesnik - 07/11/03; MIA, Makfax - 06/11/03)

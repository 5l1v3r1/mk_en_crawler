BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica resigned on Saturday (March 8th) and called for early elections, citing deep differences within the tenuous ruling coalition over Kosovo. The governing parties have been split over a resolution saying that Serbia would join the EU only if Kosovo is part of its territory. Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) backs the resolution, but it is opposed by the Democratic Party (DP) and G17 Plus. "The Serbian government no longer has a united policy on an important issue related to the country's future. Such a government cannot function. This is the end of the government," Kostunica told a press conference Saturday in Belgrade. 
President Boris Tadic, who heads the DP, said he respects Kostunica's decision and will convene early elections. (Tanjug, AFP, Reuters, RIA Novosti, BBC, RTS, Beta - 08/03/08)

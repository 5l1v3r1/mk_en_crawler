BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic, who also chairs the national council for co-operation with The Hague tribunal, says six or seven war crimes indictees probably remain in the federal union, while two or three others are likely in Russia. Information to that effect came from The Hague tribunal, he says. In a statement picked up by media in Belgrade and Sarajevo, Ljajic said that Dragan Zelenovic and Vlastimir Djordjevic -- wanted for war crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, respectively -- are probably in Russia. He did not name the third indictee. Asked whether it might be Ratko Mladic, Ljajic said it appears Mladic had once been in Russia, protected by the Russian mafia, but had departed, "fearing that the mafia would sell him for $5m".

LONDON, United Kingdom -- Efforts to improve ties between Turkey and Armenia and to open their common border might fail, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said after meeting with Armenian counterpart Edward Nalbandian on Friday (January 29th). Speaking to journalists in London on the sidelines of an international conference on Afghanistan, Davutoglu said that Ankara "respects every country's way of functioning", but is concerned about a recent ruling by the Armenian Constitutional Court regarding protocols to establish and develop formal diplomatic relations. Ankara has criticised the ruling, arguing it contains "preconditions and restrictive provisions". (Reuters, Hurriyet - 29/01/10)

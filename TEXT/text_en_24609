ANKARA, Turkey -- The terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) declared a nine-day unilateral cease-fire Sunday (December 7th) to honour the Muslim religious holiday Eid al-Adha, which starts Monday. The cease-fire is a gesture of goodwill and the "first step towards peace", said PKK spokesman Ahmed Deniz, who added the group's military and political leaders want to resolve its conflict with Turkey peacefully. Turkey has previously rejected several cease-fire declarations by the PKK.
Meanwhile, Turkish warplanes continued air strikes against PKK targets in northern Iraq, media reported on Monday, citing defence sources. The latest in a series of raids occurred on Sunday evening. No civilians suffered injuries, Turkish TV channels reported. Also Sunday, the Turkish General Staff said security forces killed two PKK militants in clashes Saturday in the southeastern province of Sirnak.

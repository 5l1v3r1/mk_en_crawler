THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal announced on Friday (April 16th) it has decided to relieve the court appointed-lawyer of former Bosnian Serb wartime commander Radovan Karadzic of his duties, suggesting the defendant no longer needs his services. The court says Karadzic, who is conducting his own defence, is actively participating in the proceedings against him and is no longer obstructing the trial, making the services of attorney Richard Harvey unnecessary. Harvey could be recalled however, if the trial chamber decides his services are needed at some point. (RTRS - 17/04/10; FoNet, B92 - 16/04/10)

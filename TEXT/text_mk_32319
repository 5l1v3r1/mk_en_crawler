SPLIT, Croatia -- A joint Croatian-US military exercise began along the central Dalmatian coast Tuesday (1 October). The drill will continue for four days and involve a large amount of equipment, with an eye to improving the security of maritime communications, preventing deliberate communication interceptions and simulating anti- smuggling activities on the central Dalmatian islands.
Also Tuesday, Bulgaria and Romania officially launched a joint military exercise dubbed Blue Danube. The annual manoeuvre aims to integrate the armies of Bulgaria and Romania, in line with their participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace programme. (Trud - 02/10/02; HINA, BTA - 01/10/02)

COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Prosecutors on Tuesday (August 31st) pressed charges against the Kurdish-language station Roj-TV, which holds a Danish broadcasting license, for promoting the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Turkey has also accused the channel of being a mouthpiece for the PKK. Top Danish prosecutor Joergen Steen Soerensen said the programmes run by Roj-TV "must be regarded as having the characteristics of propaganda in support of the PKK". The conclusion was made after "extremely comprehensive investigations" of links between the TV station and the group. Turkey welcomed the decision, expressing hope that "media organisations that support terrorism and encourage the use of violence will get the punishment they deserve".

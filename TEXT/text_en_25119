SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Ivan Iskrov was officially appointed on Wednesday (August 26th) to a second term as governor of the central bank, after parliament overwhelmingly backed his nomination. A total of 195 lawmakers voted for him, one opposed, and 14 abstained. An earlier effort to offer him a second term ended up violating procedures, prompting this vote.

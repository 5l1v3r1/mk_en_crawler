ANKARA, Turkey -- On Sunday (15 December), Mehmet Agar was elected the new leader of the True Path Party (DYP), by an overwhelming majority. The result came after former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller announced she would not seek re-election. DYP was the major opposition party in the previous parliament, but failed - by a fraction of votes - to pass the 10 per cent election threshold needed for parliament. Agar was elected as an independent candidate and will represent the party in parliament. He served as justice and interior minister in DYP governments during the mid-1990s.

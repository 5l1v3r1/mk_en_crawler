PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Police arrested six Pristina municipality officials on Tuesday (May 3rd) for suspected abuse of office. The procurement and infrastructure officials are believed to have paid about 800,000 euros to a company before signing a contract for an infrastructure project. The police unit for economic crimes and corruption questioned the suspects for six hours and later detained them for 48 hours. Just last week, Pristina Mayor Isa Mustafa accused members of the police of pressuring municipal workers and applying methods used by former Yugoslav secret service.

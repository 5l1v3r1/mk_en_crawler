BELGRADE, Serbia -- Chief prosecutor of the UN war crimes tribunal Serge Brammertz says he has no reason to believe that fugitive indictee Ratko Mladic is not in Serbia. In an interview in the Vecernje Novosti newspaper Sunday (May 4th), Brammertz said Hague prosecutors are in regular contact with the relevant authorities in Serbia and exchange information about Mladic. He added that he believes Serbian authorities can also find fugitives Radovan Karadzic, Stojan Zupljanin and Goran Hadzic. "During our meetings in Belgrade, we received detailed information about a recent operation, which confirmed that Zupljanin was in Serbia. We have no grounds to believe that the other fugitives are far, considering that this is where their families and network of supporters are," Brammertz said. (Vecernje Novosti - 04/05/08)

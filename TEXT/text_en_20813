ATHENS, Greece -- An earthquake measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale shook most of Greece early Sunday (January 6th). The epicentre was about 60km southeast of Kalamata, in the southern Peloponnese peninsula. Two hours after the quake, two smaller aftershocks measured 3.4 and 3.9 on the Richter scale. Seismologists said the deep epicentre of the first quake prevented major damage or injuries.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal sentenced Bosnian Serb Milan Lukic to life in prison on Monday (July 20th), for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed against Bosnian Muslim civilians in the town of Visegrad from 1992 to 1994. The judges concluded that Lukic played a lead role in killing at least 119 civilians, herding them into two houses that were set ablaze. He was also found guilty of murdering 12 Muslim civilian men, and beating Muslims at a detention camp. His cousin, Sredoje Lukic, was given a 30-year sentence. The tribunal ruled he did not participate in these crimes, but failed to prevent them. Milan and Sredoje Lukic were a leader and member, respectively, of a Bosnian Serb paramilitary group called White Eagles or Avengers.
In other news, the remains of 44 Bosnian Muslims and Croats killed during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict were buried Monday near the town of Prijedor. Several hundred people attended the ceremony, led by the head of the Islamic community in BiH, Grand Mufti Mustafa Ceric.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The European Commission (EC) warned on Monday that the introduction of ZERP, Croatia's protected environmental fishing zone, could have consequences in the country's EU accession negotiations. Jan Truszczynski, deputy director general at the EC's Enlargement Directorate, said restricting the fishing rights of EU members is unacceptable in a country poised to join the Union. He warned that the EC might delay negotiations on the fisheries chapter of the acquis if the situation is not resolved. 
The introduction of ZERP has been triggered by a dispute with Slovenia, and to some extent Italy, over fishing rights in the Adriatic. (Vecernji List, Makfax - 02/10/07; HINA, HRT -01/10/07)

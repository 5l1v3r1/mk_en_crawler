ANKARA, Turkey -- Police announced on Sunday (March 9th) that they prevented a series of terrorist attacks against the offices of US companies in Turkey. During a raid in Istanbul, three alleged members of the leftist Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front (DHKP/C) were arrested. Police confiscated a remote-controlled toy car that is believed to have been ready for use as an explosive device. The suspects purportedly had a list of US companies operating in Turkey that they planned to target, including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Citibank. The DHKP-C group has been active since the mid-1970s and is recognised as a terrorist organisation by the United States and the EU.

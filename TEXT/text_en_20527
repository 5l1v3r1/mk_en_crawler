MUNICH, Germany -- Serbian President Boris Tadic made a last ditch call on Friday (February 8th) to resume talks on the Kosovo status issue, warning that everyone will have to pay a very high price if the province declares independence unilaterally. Serious talks on Kosovo are necessary now to protect the Serbs in the province, Tadic said in a speech at the opening of an international security conference in Munich. He warned that a possible unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo may threaten security in Europe. He reiterated that Kosovo's independence will never be recognised by Serbia and that the deployment of the planned EU mission in Kosovo must have the necessary legal basis, namely UN Security Council approval. 
Meanwhile, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica told Tanjug on Saturday that Serbia will never accept possible independence of the province in exchange for any written agreement with the EU. "Kosovo is not for sale," Kostunica said. (Vecernje Novosti - 10/02/08; Danas, Vjesti, Tanjug - 09/02/08; AFP, Makfax, Beta, Tanjug, RIA Novosti - 08/02/08)

TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on Sunday (January 20th) that his government is on the right path at the right pace and therefore requires no reorganization. During a press conference in Korca to mark the start of important roadwork, Berisha said it is time for investments, not changes in the government. Two ruling coalition allies, the Republican Party and the Human Rights Union Party, have been calling for urgent changes to Berisha's cabinet. 
In other news, a second contingent of Albanian troops within the International Security Assistance Force left for Afghanistan on Friday. The 112 officers and soldiers will serve a six-month mission in Herat, under Italian command.

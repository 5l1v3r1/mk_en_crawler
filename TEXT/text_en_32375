SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Some 336 Albanians will be trained to join the army by 2007 and will comprise 20 per cent of the officers' staff, Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski said Thursday (27 March). Lawmakers from the Democratic Party of Albanians had asked about progress in implementing the action plan for equal representation of all ethnic communities in the army.
In other news Thursday, the European Agency for Reconstruction launched five projects aimed at supporting the process of ethnic reconciliation in Macedonia. The projects aim to build trust among ordinary citizens, rather than among parties or politicians. (Dnevnik - 28/03/03; MIA - 27/03/03)

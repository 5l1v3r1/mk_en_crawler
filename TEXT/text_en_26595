PRISTINA, Kosovo -- NATO's new Secretary-General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, will visit Kosovo on Thursday (August 13th), the Pristina-based daily Express reported on Sunday, citing sources within the Alliance. Rasmussen will hold talks with President Fatmir Sejdiu, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and Defence Minister Fehmi Mujota. This will be Rasmussen's first visit to Kosovo since taking office two weeks ago. Last week, he predicted that KFOR could be reduced to a small reaction force or even completely withdrawn by the time his four-year term ends. (Makfax, A1, MRT - 09/08/09)

ATHENS, Greece -- Government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos resigned on Thursday (October 23rd) amid accusations he was involved in an improper real-estate deal between the state and the Vatopedi Monastery. Roussopoulos, one of Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis's closest aides, said he was quitting to defend himself against a "malicious and totally groundless attack". He announced his resignation shortly after parliament adopted a proposal establishing a panel to investigate the deal. George Papandreou, leader of the main opposition party PASOK, says Roussopoulos is a prime suspect. A preliminary investigation found the deal resulted in at least 100m euros in losses to the state.

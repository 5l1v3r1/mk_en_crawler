ANKARA, Turkey -- The Economic Co-operation Organisation Trade Agreement (ECOTA) will go into force from 2009, Turkish State Minister Kursad Tuzmen said on Sunday (May 25th). The ECOTA will gradually cut the 80% customs duties for products traded among Turkey, Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and Tajikistan. The first tranche of reductions will be a minimum 10% for nearly 500 products. The ECOTA would be the second preferential trade agreement, after the customs union between Turkey and the EU that came into force in December 1995.
Initially, all ten members of the Economic Co-operation Organisation -- Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan -- agreed to participate in the ECOTA. But in the end, only five parliaments ratified it. (Hurriyet - 26/05/08; Anadolu Agency - 25/05/08)

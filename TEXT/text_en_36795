ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish Justice Minister Cemil Cicek said Friday (16 July) that the government will file a request for the extradition of convicted organised crime kingpin Allattin Cakici, who was arrested earlier this week in Graz, Austria. The minister said that Turkey's abolition of capital punishment should pave the way for the extradition. Cakici was captured in France in 1998 and transferred to Turkey, but managed to escape two years ago after serving part of his jail sentence. (NTV, Anadolu Agency - 16/07/04)

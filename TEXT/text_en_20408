ANKARA, Turkey -- The country's top general warned on Sunday (October 14th) that relations with the United States could suffer irreparable damage if the US House of Representatives adopts a resolution recognising the killings of Armenians during World War I as an act of genocide. "Military ties with the US will never be the same again" if the resolution passes, General Yasar Buyukanit said in an interview for a local newspaper. House Democrats are determined to put the measure to a vote, despite strong opposition by the White House. "If we forget what has happened ... then we are at risk of letting it happen again", House Democratic leader Steny Hoyer said. 
Republican leaders in Congress say it is irresponsible to raise the issue now and endanger relations with an important ally. "What happened 90 years ago ought to be a subject for historians to sort out, not politicians here in Washington," said House Republican leader John Boehner.

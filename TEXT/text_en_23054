ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said on Wednesday (July 3rd) he believes that French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who said there will be no further EU enlargement without Lisbon Treaty ratification, sought to accelerate the ratification process by making such a statement. France assumed the rotating EU presidency earlier this week. In an interview for a local TV station, Sanader said he thinks that mentioning Croatia in this context is a method of warning the nations that support Croatia's accession to speed up Lisbon Treaty ratification. Sanader added he remains certain of the final outcome: EU membership for Croatia. (Vjesnik - 03/07/08; HINA - 02/07/08)

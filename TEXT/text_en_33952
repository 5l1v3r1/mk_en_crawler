ATHENS, Greece -- Defence Minister Yiannos Papantoniou told reporters Thursday (6 November) that plans have been made to move the bulk of the country's armed forces away from the northern borders. The move signals improved relations with Bulgaria, Albania and Macedonia. It is also part of a cabinet plan to overhaul the military. "We are creating flexible, mobile and more powerful units and adjusting the personnel numbers to realistic levels," Papantoniou said. (AFP - 06/11/03)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A court on Monday (October 20th) launched a trial of nine people accused of embezzling EU aid funds. The defendants allegedly stole around 7.2m euros from funds allocated to Bulgaria under the SAPARD agriculture and rural development programme. Prosecutors say they imported used machinery for processing meat and forged documents so they could register the machines as new. The EU reimbursed the cost of new equipment, with the defendants allegedly pocketing the difference. (DW, BNR, Darik, novinite.com, Mediapool - 20/10/08)

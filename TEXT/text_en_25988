PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Central Election Commission (CEC) has decided to review its decision barring camera surveillance in the November local elections, media reported on Wednesday (August 19th). A proposal to review the decision was submitted by the opposition Kosovo New Alliance, in an effort to boost transparency. Two other opposition parties have asked for surveillance as well, in light of serious irregularities that marred the November 2007 general elections. (Zeri, Express, Koha Ditore, Lajm - 19/08/09)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament voted on Wednesday (22 February) to send a new military unit to Iraq. Some 120 troops and about 30 support staff will be dispatched in a non-combatant role -- guard duties at the Al-Ashraf refugee camp. The decision marks Bulgaria's return to the international coalition in Iraq, following a December troop withdrawal. 
Parliament also decided on Wednesday to lift immunity for former Sofia Mayor Stefan Sofianski, who is now an opposition deputy. He faces corruption and misappropriation charges stemming from his years as mayor. 
In other news, a reputed top-level gangster was gunned down in Sofia on Wednesday. Ivan "the Doctor" Todorov was a multimillionaire who purportedly made his fortune smuggling cigarettes into Balkan countries. He survived a car bombing in 2003 that killed his driver and was standing trial for money laundering of some 50m euros. 
Also Wednesday, the head of the Bulgarian Service for the Fight against Organised Crime, Vanyo Tanov, announced that an investigation suggests that the chairman of the Bulgarian Red Cross, Hristo Grigorov, was responsible for significant misappropriations of medicine donated for oncology patients. Grigorov was arrested in early February but released on bail. (Dnevnik - 23/02/06; AP, BNT, BNR, bTV, Nova TV, Mediapool - 22/02/06)

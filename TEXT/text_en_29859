BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia is asking The Hague war crimes tribunal to launch an investigation against a former UNMIK chief, Soren Jessen-Petersen, for possibly covering up evidence in an organ trafficking affair. The head of the national council for co-operation with the UN tribunal, Rasim Ljajic told the Belgrade-based daily Blic on Sunday (December 26th) that he has sent a letter to tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz. In it, he insisted on a contempt of court probe against Jessen-Petersen, who headed UNMIK from 2004 to 2006. 
Earlier this month, Council of Europe Rapporteur Dick Marty presented a report saying that members of the Kosovo Liberation Army Kosovo were involved in organ trafficking in the end of the 1990s. Ljajic says that in 2004, UNMIK investigated the allegations. "At the time, UNMIK said it did not have a report on organ trafficking and had no proofâ¦But in 2008 our war crimes prosecutor obtained 16 pages of this report," Ljajic said on Sunday.

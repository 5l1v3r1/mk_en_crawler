SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic predicted on Tuesday (12 April) that the country would obtain a positive Feasibility Study for starting negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU by the end of May. His comment came during a speech to the BiH Parliament about progress made in meeting the 16 EU requirements set under the Feasibility Study. According to Terzic, SAA talks could begin in late autumn if the country enhances co-operation with The Hague tribunal and forms a state-level police structure. (RTRS, NTV Hayat - 12/04/05)

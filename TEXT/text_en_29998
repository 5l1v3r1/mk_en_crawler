WASHINGTON, United States -- The Serbian government has reached an agreement on an $800m four-year loan with the World Bank, Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic said on Sunday (April 17th) after meeting with Bank Managing Director Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala in Washington. Half of the loan will finance the fiscal gap, while the other will be directed to specific projects. Serbia will be able to withdraw a maximum of $200m each year. Cvetkovic also confirmed that the government will seek a precautionary agreement with the IMF, aimed in part at supporting investor confidence. (B92, Tanjug - 17/04/11)

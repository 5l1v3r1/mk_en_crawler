TIRANA, Albania â Prime Minister Sali Berisha said Wednesday (January 26th) that his country is ready to investigate "every inch" of its territory, as requested in CoE rapporteur Dick Marty's report on organ trafficking allegations. However, he denied that the accusations were true and said Marty must come forward with evidence, as promised.
"Dick Marty has made an important statement that he will provide witnesses. And I guarantee the international community that we will provide full protection of witnesses," Berisha said during a government meeting. He described the claims that KLA militia leaders â including current Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci â were involved in illegal harvesting and trafficking of human organs as "fabricated by the Milosevic propaganda machinery immediately after the NATO bombing".
"The accusations have been investigated and they are not true," Berisha said. (Top News, Alsat, Klan, Vizion +, Balkan Web - 26/01/11)

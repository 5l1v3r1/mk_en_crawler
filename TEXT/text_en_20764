PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The chief of the US mission in Kosovo, Tina Kaidanow, rejected on Tuesday (November 6th) Serbia's latest proposal to resolve the province's final status according to the so-called Hong Kong model. She insists Kosovo is not analogous to anywhere else. Kaidanow also said she doesn't expect status negotiations to continue after December 10th, the date the US-EU-Russia mediating troika will report to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
Kosovo's negotiating team reiterated on Tuesday that a compromise between Belgrade and Pristina is impossible. "We can talk for 100 years with the Serbs and still not reach an agreement. Our stance has not changed. It is our right to gain independence," said Hashim Thaci, a member of the team. (Telegrafi, RTK, Kosovapress, Balkanweb - 06/11/07)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- During his first official visit to Bulgaria Friday (18 March), EU Enlargement Commissioner Ollie Rehn urged local authorities to speed up crucial judicial reforms, a priority condition for the country's expected entry into the Union in 2007. Rehn emphasised that the EU expects Bulgaria to establish a new penalty procedure code and carry out structural changes to the judicial sector. He warned that Brussels would not hesitate to activate a safeguard clause allowing Bulgarian and Romanian membership to be delayed for one year if they fail to fulfil their accession commitments. At the same time, Rehn emphasised that the EU attaches great importance to Bulgaria's and Romania's accession, which he described as a positive example for the region.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic says there was no state involvement in the ethnic incidents in Vojvodina. In a letter to the Dutch presidency of the EU on Monday (13 September), Draskovic insisted that the acts of violence, verbal abuse and graffiti against ethnic Hungarians in Vojvodina were isolated, and that the state union's government supports respect for minority rights. Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Laszlo Kovacs met with counterparts from EU member countries. He said afterwards that resolving the ethnic issues in Vojvodina is both a question of law and order for Serbia-Montenegro and an essential pre-condition for EU integration. 
In other news, Serbian President Boris Tadic has been hospitalised for over a week now, battling a recurring fever and an acute respiratory tract infection. Aides say he will continue his presidential duties from the hospital, where he may remain for several more days. (Danas - 14/09/04; Beta, B92, Tanjug - 13/09/04)

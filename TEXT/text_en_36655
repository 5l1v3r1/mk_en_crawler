PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UN police have arrested two former KLA fighters for allegedly fomenting the unrest in Kosovo in March, a UN spokesman said Sunday (2 May). Local media identified the suspects as Nexhmi Lajci and Naser Shatri, both members of the ethnic Albanian War Veterans Association. According to police, they played an active role in demonstrations that resulted in violence against Serbs and the destruction of property. The head of the association was arrested last month on similar charges. (AFP - 02/05/04)

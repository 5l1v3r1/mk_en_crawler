NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The ambassadors of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council vowed on Tuesday (March 18th) to support the July 2006 agreement on Cyprus' unification. At a meeting with Cypriot President Demetris Christofias, diplomats from the US, UK, Russia, China and France were briefed about the meeting later this week between the Greek Cypriot leader and the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community, Mehmet Ali Talat. The July 8th agreement was signed by Talat and former Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos. It envisions the island becoming a dual-zone bi-communal federation.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu nominated Mihai Razvan Ungureanu to head the country's foreign intelligence service (SIE) on Monday (November 26th). Ungureanu, 39, is currently Romania's representative to the Southeast European Co-operative Initiative. He served as foreign minister from December 2004 to March 2007, but was forced to resign after Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu accused him of failing to inform the government that two Romanians had been detained by US forces in Iraq. Ungureanu, a Basescu ally, must be approved by at least half the members of parliament to take the SIE post, vacated in March by Claudiu Saftoiu, amid evidence of illegal wiretaps.

TIRANA, Albania -- Police in Vlora faced physical resistance Thursday (November 11th) from village residents protesting property issues. Residents of Dukat and Orikum blocked the national road for five hours, insisting that authorities return properties owned by their predecessors. After threatening and confronting police, three villagers were injured and 14 were arrested, including one man allegedly carrying Molotov bombs in his truck. Interior Minister Lulzim Basha said there is no tolerance for those who attack institutions and block national roads. At a parliamentary session, he accused the opposition of encouraging such protests. Property has been one of the most disputed issues in Albania since 1991.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- An IMF delegation visiting Serbia backs the government's efforts at pension reform, Deputy Prime Minister Jovan Krkobabic's office said in a statement Thursday (February 11th). The cabinet plans to consolidate four existing state pension funds under one heading. This streamlining would be a first step toward reducing expenses and boosting long-term sustainability. The government is expected to proceed with pension reform this spring. The IMF mission will remain in Serbia for ten more days. (B92, Beta, RTS, Tanjug - 11/02/10)

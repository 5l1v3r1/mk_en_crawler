BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu said on Wednesday (January 5th) that his country will not set conditions for Croatia's EU accession and urged Romanian authorities to focus on meeting criteria for joining the Schengen zone. Foreign Minister Teodor Baconschi had warned on Monday that Romania could seek the introduction of a Verification and Co-operation Mechanism (CVM) for Croatia if France and Germany continue to insist on delaying Romania's accession to the border-free area. He also threatened that his country could leave the CVM, which was imposed by the EU to measure the country's progress in fighting corruption and in implementing judicial reform. Basescu, however, stressed that Romania should stick to its own efforts to join the Schengen zone instead of dealing with what other countries should do.

ANKARA, Turkey -- President Ahmet Necdet Sezer signed a key package of constitutional amendments Friday (21 May), aimed at bringing domestic legislation closer to that of the EU. Under the changes, the death penalty and state security courts will be eliminated.
In other news, Europol Director Juergen Storbeck was quoted Saturday as saying his organisation considers Turkey an equal member in terms of crime prevention, even though Ankara is not a member of the EU. His statement followed last week's signing of an agreement between Turkey and Europol, designed to strengthen co-operation in fighting organised crime, terrorism, illegal migration and human trafficking.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK head Joachim Ruecker confirmed on Monday (June 16th) that he will leave Kosovo this week, as will his deputy, Lawrence Rossin. Ruecker met with the EU representative to Kosovo, Pieter Feith, a day after Kosovo's constitution came into force. Ruecker said that, though UNMIK will function as long as UN Security Council Resolution 1244 remains in effect, he will be the last "traditional" UNMIK administrator there. Italian diplomat Lamberto Zannieri is expected to take his place, overseeing a smaller, restructured mission.
In other news, a group of Serb youths in northern Mitrovica attacked two Albanian youths Monday evening, sending both to the hospital. The Serb-dominated area has proven difficult to control since Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in February. (Koha Ditore, Express - 17/06/08; Telegrafi, RTK, BBC, B92, KTV - 16/06/08)

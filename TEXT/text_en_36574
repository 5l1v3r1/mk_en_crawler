SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Senior officials reacted angrily to a Libyan court's decision to sentence five Bulgarian nurses to death on charges they infected more than 400 children with HIV in Tripoli. President Georgi Parvanov issued a statement Thursday (6 May) saying he does not accept the guilty verdict and expressed confidence that justice will be served on appeal. Justice Minister Anton Stankov and Foreign Minister Solomon Passy echoed the sentiment, noting that the Libyan court had ignored the findings of two leading experts who proved the HIV epidemic had preceded the appointment of the Bulgarians in the children's hospital in Benghazi by at least one year. In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher vowed that the United States would continue to raise this issue with the authorities in Tripoli. European Commission President Romano Prodi said the EU was "deeply disappointed" with the verdict and urged Libyan authorities to review the case.

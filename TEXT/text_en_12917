BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic survived an apparent assassination attempt Tuesday (30 November) night when an unknown attacker repeatedly tried to ram an Audi into the presidential limousine. Local media reported Wednesday that a security vehicle veered into the attacker's way, preventing him from reaching his target and forcing him to flee the scene. The security car was damaged but there were no injuries. Police are looking for a black Audi and its driver. In March 2003, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic was assassinated in central Belgrade.

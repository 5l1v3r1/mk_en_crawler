TIRANA, Albania -- Economy, Trade and Energy Minister Genc Ruli pledged on Sunday (February 17th) that Albania will help supply Kosovo with electricity, should Serbia stop its exports after Sunday's declaration of independence. "The Albanian power corporation KESH is in constant contact with the Kosovo energy company KEK and is ready to start supplying electricity to Kosovo if necessary," Ruli said, recalling that Tirana has helped Pristina before. However, Albania is battling chronic power shortages of its own. (ITAR-TASS, RIA Novosti - 17/02/08)

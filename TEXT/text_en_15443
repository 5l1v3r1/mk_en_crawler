SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador Douglas McElhaney said on Thursday (24 August) that BiH is a sovereign state and that secession by Republika Srpska is out of the question. "The status of BiH has been solved. I am not aware of any reference in the constitution about secession or a referendum. That is simply not an option," McElhaney said. Earlier in the summer, Bosnian Serb officials hinted at holding a referendum like the one in Montenegro to determine the future of the Serb entity. 
In other news, Danish authorities have indicted four Muslims on charges they plotted together with five others in BiH and three people in Britain to blow up unspecified targets in Europe. A prosecutor said the four suspects helped the two ringleaders in BiH obtain arms and explosives. 
Meanwhile, the BiH Central Election Commission says the number of people eligible to vote in the October parliamentary elections is up by 15 per cent compared to the 2002 elections. Officials credit the switch from the active to the passive registration system. (Nezavisne Novine, Dnevni Avaz - 25/08/06; Fena, PBS, RTRS - 24/08/06; UPI, AP - 23/08/06)

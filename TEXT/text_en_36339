BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Princess Jelisaveta Karadjordjevic of Yugoslavia formally announced her bid for the Serbian presidency on Sunday (23 May). "I will do my best for a better future and a more beautiful Serbia," she said after registering for the 13 June election. She promised not to seek the restoration of the monarchy. Karadjordjevic returned to the country in the early 1990s after fleeing in 1941, when the communists banned all royal property. She joins a field of 12 candidates.

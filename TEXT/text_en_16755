SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev arrived in Brussels Wednesday (7 June) to brief EU officials on the cabinet's action plan to remedy problems in the accession process. His first meeting was with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who confirmed the next EC monitoring report would be published in late September. Rehn also said that if the Bulgarian and Romanian governments work hard, they could implement all necessary reforms in time, paving the way for entry into the bloc on 1 January 2007.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The Supreme Military Council (YAS) on Wednesday (August 4th) blocked the promotion of 11 generals and admirals charged with involvement in plans to topple the government. The men are part of a group of 102 retired and active duty officers who were issued arrest warrants connected to the alleged 2003 coup plot. The YAS sent to the government a list of the proposed promotions after its annual meeting, excluding the names of the 11 officers. President Abdullah Gul approved the list. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is said to have firmly resisted the promotion of the suspected generals. 
The 1st Army commander, General Hasan Igsiz, who has been called to testify in the Ergenekon probe, was not promoted as the new land forces chief. General Necdet Ozel, who was expected to be appointed as the 2nd Army commander, was instead promoted to the Gendarmerie command. The 3rd Army commander, General Saldiray Berk, a suspect in the Ergenekon case, was appointed to Training and Doctrine command of the land forces, instead of being promoted at a higher level. Two other senior positions -- chief of staff and the commander of the land forces -- are still vacant. (Milliyet - 05/08/10; NTV, AFP, Hurriyet - 04/08/10)

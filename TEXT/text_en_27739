ATHENS, Greece -- Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said on Monday (April 26th) that Athens will announce new deficit-cutting measures after talks end with EU and IMF experts now in the country. "It would be wrong to believe that the IMF is here to impose various and stricter measures than the ones that we are discussing with our European partners," Papaconstantinou said. He added that it is clear that over time, Greece must cut its "draconian" deficit, control its debts and implement structural reforms necessary to keep the economy competitive. Athens announced last week it wants to activate a 45 billion-euro EU/IMF aid mechanism proposed by the eurozone, to help the country overcome its crisis. 
Meanwhile, hundreds of Greek air force pilots called in sick Monday to protest salary cuts imposed as part of the government's austerity measures. Hundreds of training flights were cancelled, but regular military flights proceeded as normal, according to one source. A separate strike by workers at the Piraeus port left several hundred tourists, mostly Spanish, unable to board a cruise ship. (AP, ANA-MPA, Bloomberg, AFP - 26/04/10)

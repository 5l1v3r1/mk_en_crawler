WASHINGTON, United States -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking, according to the 2010 Trafficking in Persons Report published by the US State Department on Monday (June 14th). The document assesses efforts by 177 countries to combat the crime. It ranks countries in three categories according to their anti-trafficking performance, with those lowest rated put in Tier 3. For the first time ever, BiH, a long-time Tier 3 country, has climbed to Tier 1.

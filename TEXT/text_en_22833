TIRANA, Albania -- The two main political parties in Albania -- the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and the opposition Socialist Party (SP) -- continued discussions Tuesday (October 7th) on a proposed reform of the country's election code. Both parties' representatives examined a proposal by the NGO Group 99 to grant voting rights to immigrants in the next elections. The NGO notes immigrants represent one-third of Albania's population and contribute about 1 billion euros to the country's annual income. (Koha TV, ALsat, Klan, Top Channel - 07/10/08)

ATHENS, Greece -- The foreign ministry announced on Wednesday (October 17th) that it has excluded Skopje from its ambitious Balkan reconstruction programme. "The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is not among the countries to receive extension of their co-operation within the programme ... because this country has not applied for such an extension," Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Theodore Kassimis said. He acknowledged that Skopje's request was filed in time, but the name used in the request was Republic of Macedonia. "Since Greece does not recognise the country by that name, the foreign ministry considered the letter as not having been received," Kassimis explained. Greece's Balkan reconstruction programme plans to finance more than 500m euros from 2007 to 2011. (ANA-MPA, RIA Novosti, BGNES - 17/10/07)

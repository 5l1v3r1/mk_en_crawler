SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Osman Bizanti, the Libyan lawyer representing five Bulgarian nurses sentenced to death after a controversial re-trial in Libya, officially appealed the verdict to a high court in Tripoli on Saturday (February 17th). Sofia media quotes him as saying the appeal, in part, cites numerous irregularities that occurred during searches of the defendants' houses and other evidence-collecting methods by Libyan authorities, as well as procedural problems during the December re-trial. The nurses and a Palestinian doctor were convicted of deliberately infecting hundreds of children with HIV, despite expert testimony to the contrary. (BNR, BTA - 17/02/07)

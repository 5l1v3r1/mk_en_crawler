TIRANA, Albania -- Judges and prosecutors announced on Wednesday (October 1st) they object to seven draft laws approved by the government that envision changes to the functioning of the judicial system. They argued the changes may undermine the judiciary's independence and subject it to government influence. Justice Minister Enkeled Alibeaj responded by saying the draft laws are in line with EU standards and do not jeopardise the judiciary's independence.

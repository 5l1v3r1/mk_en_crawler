PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic confirmed on Thursday (December 10th) that he plans to step down before the end of his four-year term, but declined to specify when exactly. The current government's mandate expires in 2013. Djukanovic said that he would like to devote time to other plans, unconnected to politics. "I don't think it is necessary to carry out my whole mandate as prime minister," he told Reuters several days ago. "I have given enough to politics, more than 20 years," he added.

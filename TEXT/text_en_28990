PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Government officials met with representatives of the European Commission (EC) on Tuesday (July 6th) in Pristina, the first plenary meeting of the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP) Dialogue. Discussions focused on Kosovo's EU ambitions and achievements since the last EC progress report in October. Prime Minister Hashim Thaci reaffirmed his government's commitment to fighting organised crime and corruption. He also said he expects that the number of countries recognising Kosovo's independence will rise after the International Court of Justice delivers its opinion on the legality of Pristina's declaration of independence. EC representatives urged Kosovo to step up efforts against corruption, implement judicial and public administration reforms and improve public procurement procedures.

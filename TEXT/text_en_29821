VIENNA, Austria -- The OSCE warned on Thursday (April 21st) that amendments to Bulgaria's criminal code may be used to limit media freedom. The changes, adopted by parliament on April 13th, envision prison terms of up to four years for journalists who instigate hatred, discrimination or violence. In a letter to Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nikolai Mladenov, OSCE media representative Dunja Mijatovic said the country should "find effective ways to address hate speech without endangering free expression, and ensure that legitimate criticism can be expressed. Imprisoning journalists â¦ is excessive and violates international standards on free expression." (Mediapool, bTV, Dnevnik, Trud - 21/04/11)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- US Ambassador to Serbia-Montenegro Michael Polt has again urged Serbs to participate in Kosovo's interim institutions, reiterating that a boycott is no solution to the problem. Polt spoke to B92 Radio on Wednesday (11 May) after it was reported that the Serbian government's Council for Kosovo confirmed the previous day its position on non-participation of Serbs in the provincial institutions. The US diplomat reiterated that full engagement by all sides is the only way to resolve the Kosovo issue. (Politika - 12/05/05; B92, KosovaLive - 11/05/05)

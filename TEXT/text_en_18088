ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader indicated at the weekend that the Croatian Privatisation Fund (HPF) would likely be disbanded because of a corruption scandal involving senior officials. Sanader spoke to reporters Saturday (June 16th) after prosecutors announced that three HPF deputy directors and other three people had been arrested on charges of misappropriations and corruption. The investigation, codenamed "Maestro", involves more than 20 people in all. The opposition says it could not have occurred without the knowledge of at least some members of the Croatian Democratic Union-led cabinet. 
In other news, two former Croatian generals went on trial Monday in Zagreb, in the first case to be referred back to Croatia by the UN war crimes tribunal. Rahim Ademi and Mirko Norac are accused of the 1993 massacre of Serb civilians in the "Medak pocket" of southern Croatia. (Vjesnik, Vecernji list, BBC - 18/06/07; HRT - 17/06/07; HRT - 16/06/07)

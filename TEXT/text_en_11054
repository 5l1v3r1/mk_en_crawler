BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The draft mandate for the European Commission's talks with Turkey sets Ankara's EU membership as the ultimate goal of the negotiations. "The negotiations will be based on Turkey's own merits and the pace will depend on Turkey's progress in meeting the requirements for membership," the document says, according to international media reports Tuesday (28 June). The commission meets late Wednesday to formally adopt the mandate, which will then have to be approved by all member states. According to the draft, the talks would not end before 2014, allowing the EU to prepare financially for Turkey's accession. The document also warns that negotiations could be broken off if Ankara fails to make good on its commitments. Accession talks are scheduled to begin on 3 October.

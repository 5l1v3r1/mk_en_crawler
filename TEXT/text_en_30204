PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi warned EULEX on Monday (May 16th) that if the EU mission hesitates to restore control over the Mitrovica District Court, then Kosovo police will do it. The police are undergoing a major reshuffle in the Serb-dominated north, replacing senior officials to strengthen rule of law there. While stressing that the troubled area is considered a priority to the mission, EULEX officials said that they've had no consultations with the Kosovo police regarding any possible operation.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- A delegation from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Romania revised the 18-month stand-by agreement signed one year ago. Rather than expiring in April 2003, it will be extended through August. The Fund cited "significant progress" in the country's macroeconomics performance in 2002, including lower inflation, strong output and increased business confidence.
In other news, parliament has adopted a highly controversial law, banning the use of foreign words. The bill's sponsor, Senator George Pruteanu, says it is the only way to save the Romanian language from the influence of English. But the media and cartoonists ridicule its implications. For example, those who fail to call a hot dog "a kind of sausage in a kind of roll" can be fined up to $1,500 (Rompres, Mediafax - 19/10/02; AP, AFP - 18/10/02)

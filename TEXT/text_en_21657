SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The new parliament held its constituent session Saturday (June 21st), approving the mandates of 114 of the 120 lawmakers. The mandates of the others will be approved later after a repeated vote in some polling stations on June 29th. Trajko Veljanovski from the ruling VMRO-DPMNE was elected parliament speaker. The coalition For a Better Macedonia, which won the most votes in the June 1st snap election, will enjoy an absolute majority with 63 seats.
On Friday, the State Election Commission annulled results from the June 15th repeated vote in 12 polling stations due to irregularities. Voting will be held for the third time on June 29th. (MIA, AFP, A1, AP - 21/06/08)

ATHENS, Greece -- Dimitris Ioannidis, who led the 1967 military junta in Greece, died on Monday (August 16th) at a hospital in Athens after being transferred there from the maximum security Korydallos prison in Piraeus. The 1967 junta ruled the country for seven years. Ioannidis, 87, was director of the ESA military police and the mastermind of the government that has since been deemed the darkest period in Greece's modern history. In November 1973, following a student uprising at the Athens Polytechnic, Ioannidis, a brigadier general at the time, toppled the military dictatorship of Georgious Papadopoulos. The following year, Ioannidis' dictatorship organised a coup d'etat in Cyprus to remove President Archbishop Makarios. Turkey invaded Cyprus in July 1974 and occupied the northern part of the island. Ioannidis' rule was toppled in July 1974 in another coup, which brought to power Constantine Karamanlis, who headed a civilian government of national unity. (AP, DPA, CNN, ANA-MPA - 16/08/10)

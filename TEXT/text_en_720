An IMF mission, in Tirana for talks on the 2007 budget, cautioned the Albanian government against taking out further loans on commercial terms, saying it was not affordable at present. The warning came shortly after the cabinet concluded a 418m-euro deal with the US-Turkish consortium Bechtel-Enka, which will build a segment (Rreshen-Kalimash) of the Durres-Kukes highway. The authorities have not indicated how they will fund the project. IMF mission chief Istvan Szekely said it would be unwise for Tirana to surpass the allowable limit -- around 50m euros a year -- on commercial credits.

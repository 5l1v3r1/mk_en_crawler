TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha has called on local institutions to complete the questionnaire sent by the European Commission (EC) experts on the visa liberalisation issue. The report needs to be prepared by the end of the month, Berisha told a government meeting on Wednesday (August 4th). In May, the EC proposed that Albania will be able to enjoy a visa-free regime with the EU if it focuses on three areas -- repatriation of immigrants, seizing the assets belonging to organised crime members and strengthening the capacities engaged in fighting this type of crime. The EC will report in September before the final proposal is sent to the European Parliament. (VoA, Shqip, Gazeta Shqiptare, Top Channel, Klan - 05/08/10)

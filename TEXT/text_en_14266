SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Suspicious deaths of wild swans have been reported in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, media in both countries reported Tuesday (14 February), adding to concerns over the spread of the bird flu in Europe. According to the Sarajevo daily Dnevni avaz, two dead swans were found in the central BiH region of Jajce. Initial tests for the avian influenza virus were negative, but samples are being sent to Britain for additional scrutiny. Separately, the Croatian media reported that several dead swans have turned up in the Zagreb area in the past two days and are being tested for bird flu. 
Also on Tuesday, the water utility company in Sofia reiterated that there is no risk of water in the local Iskar dam lake -- which supplies the Bulgarian capital -- becoming infected. Local residents are anxious after a dead swan turned up near Iskar.
Authorities in Greece, meanwhile, are testing a man for bird flu. If confirmed, this would be Europe's first case of the avian virus in humans. (Dnevni avaz, index.hr, BNR - 14/02/06; News Interactive, ANA, MPA, Reuters - 13/02/06)

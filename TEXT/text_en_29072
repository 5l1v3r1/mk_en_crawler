TIRANA, Albania -- Membership to NATO means more defence spending, local media reported on Monday (June 7th). To meet the criteria to join the Alliance, the government had to double defence spending, from about 9m euros in 2005 to about 19m euros in 2009. The money reportedly was used to modernise the military infrastructure, pay army salaries and buy goods and services in the sector. The bill is expected to rise over the next ten years: a study by the Institute for Economic and Legal Consultancy forecasts that Albania will invest about 3 billion euros in its defence sector by 2020.

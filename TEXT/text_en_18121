PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- US envoy for Kosovo Frank Wisner said on Friday (June 15th) that the West might agree to delay a UN Security Council vote on special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's Kosovo status plan, in order to allow more talks between Serbia and Kosovo's ethnic Albanian government. He was speaking several days after a meeting by the Western members of the international contact group for Kosovo -- France, Britain, Germany and Italy. The purpose of the talks, he explained, would not be to delay Kosovo's independence but to "make it clear to the world that every avenue was pursued". Wisner apparently was referring to Russia, which has threatened to veto the resolution if it is unacceptable to Serbia. Wisner also reaffirmed that the United States had not changed its position and continues to back supervised independence for Kosovo.
Also Friday, Italian Foreign Minister Massimo d'Alema met with Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and suggested more talks be held between Serbs and ethnic Albanians. However, Kostunica indicated that Belgrade would oppose new talks if the end goal is Kosovo independence. (The New York Times, AP, AFP, KosovaLive, Tanjug, RTS, Reuters - 15/06/07)

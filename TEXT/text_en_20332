BELGRADE, Serbia -- Rasim Ljajic, the official in charge of co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, said on Wednesday (September 12th) that Serbia will boost efforts to catch war crimes fugitives suspected of hiding in the country, in order to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU by the end of the year. "We are searching for three suspects and we will do everything to fulfil our obligations," he told the Beta news agency, referring to wartime Bosnian Serb army commander General Ratko Mladic, Goran Hadzic, a former leader of rebel Croatian Serbs, and Stojan Zupljanin, a wartime commander of the Bosnian Serb police. 
UN war crimes chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte said on Wednesday that Mladic is in Serbia and that Radovan Karadzic, a fourth key fugitive, is somewhere in the region â specifically, in Republika Srpska, Serbia or Montenegro. She said she is confident both "will soon be in The Hague". (Beta, AP, AFP, EUbusiness, Rez, Makfax, RTRS, SRNA - 12/09/07)

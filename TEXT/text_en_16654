TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Democratic Party (DP) announced an initiative Thursday (7 September) to track the assets and finances of all senior state officials. DP parliamentary caucus chief Bamir Topi says it is in response to the opposition Socialist Party's (SP) accusations against DP leader and Prime Minister Sali Berisha, whom SP says hid his family assets. Later Thursday, SP spokesman Sajmir Tahiri welcomed the initiative but said the party will insist on forming a special inquiry commission in parliament to examine Berisha's holdings.

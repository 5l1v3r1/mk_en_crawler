PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Kosovo and Serbia should talk without setting any agenda, in a spirit of regional co-operation and respecting each others' red lines, Italian Ambassador to Kosovo Michael Giffoni said in an interview published in Monday's (August 9th) edition of the newspaper Koha Ditore. The EU facilitator for the north said that Pristina and Belgrade should engage in a dialogue about the lives of Serb citizens in Kosovo. According to him, "a flexible arrangement that improves the lives of the citizens shouldn't be seen as an infringement on the sovereignty of Kosovo." Giffoni declined to comment on EULEX's announcements about arrests in the north, saying such issues belong exclusively to the EU mission. (Koha Ditore, Arta TV, Top News, RTK - 09/08/10)

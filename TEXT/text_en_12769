SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO HQ in BiH, together with EUFOR, have requested the dismissal of Republika Srpska (RS) Army chief General Novak Djukic, citing his failure to respond adequately to serious breaches of conduct that occurred during a pair of oathtaking ceremonies for new recruits in April. At a news conference Friday (3 June), NATO HQ Commander Brigadier General Steven P. Schook and EUFOR Commander General David Leakey said the behaviour challenged the terms of the Dayton Peace Accords, as well as the constitutional loyalty and military professionalism of the Bosnian Serb military command. 
In other news Friday, BiH Communications and Transport Minister Branko Dokic resigned, amid charges of abuse of office and embezzlement, stemming from his term as RS transport minister in 2001. Dokic denies the charges. (Nezavisne novine - 04/06/05; OHR Sources, Fena, RTRS, NTV Hayat - 03/06/05)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- At least four people drowned in Romania at the weekend when heavy rains caused a dam and rivers to overflow, flooding dozens of homes in the south. Two miners were reported killed by lightning, which also reportedly caused the deaths of four persons in neighbouring Bulgaria. A reservoir in the north overflowed, killing dozens of farm animals and forcing the evacuation of more than 650 residents. The railway line linking the port of Varna with Sofia was closed due to flooding. (AFP, AP - 03/07/05)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- An Appeals Court in Novi Sad has sentenced Damir Dokic, father of tennis player Jelena Dokic, to one year in prison for endangering the security of Australia's ambassador to Belgrade and unlawful possession of weapons, lawyer Bosiljka Djukic said on Tuesday (February 23rd). Dokic was originally sentenced to 15 months in prison. He was detained in May 2009 after threatening to blow up the car of Ambassador Clare Birgin if she did not prevent negative articles about him from appearing in the Australian media. Jelena had told an Australian daily that her father had abused her, both physically and psychologically. (Beta, Blic, B92, AFP, AP - 23/02/10)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The country began observing three days of mourning starting Monday (November 16th) in honour of Serbian Orthodox Church Patriarch Pavle. He died on Sunday at the age of 95, after spending two years at Belgrade's military hospital. Patriarch Pavle, who became leader of the Serbian Church in 1990, will be buried on Thursday at the Rakovica monastery, as he wished. Bishop Amfilohije will continue serving as acting head of the church until a new leader is elected. He has been in the post since Pavle became ill. (Tanjug, Beta, RTS, B92 - 15/11/09)

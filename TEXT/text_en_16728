ZAGREB, Croatia -- Controversial reporter Domagoj Margetic, who was detained by police last month at the request of the UN war crimes tribunal, was released from custody on Wednesday (6 September). His lawyer, Veljko Miljevic, said the decision followed the expiration of the 30-day detention term. Margetic was apprehended on 4 August after he ignored an injunction issued by The Hague tribunal. It reportedly stemmed from Margetic posting -- on his own website -- a list of 102 protected witnesses in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Croat General Tihomir Blaskic.

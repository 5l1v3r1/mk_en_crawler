NEW YORK, United States -- Greek and Macedonian negotiators continue on Wednesday (April 30th) the new round of talks aimed at resolving the dispute over Macedonia's name. Negotiations began late Tuesday in New York with a meeting between the UN envoy in the talks, Matthew Nimetz, and Macedonian representative Nikola Dimitrov. Nimetz will likely meet with Greek representative Adamantios Vassilakis on Thursday and Friday, but plans to make no new proposals. The long-standing dispute scuttled Macedonia's hopes for an invitation to join NATO earlier this month. (Vecer - 30/04/08; Makfax, BBC, Ð1, MIA - 29/04/08)

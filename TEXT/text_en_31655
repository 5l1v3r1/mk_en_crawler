BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic told a Belgrade newspaper on Tuesday (14 January) that his government has offered guarantees for the provisional release of former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic by The Hague tribunal. He promised that Milutinovic will co-operate with the international court. Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Zarko Korac was quoted as saying that Milutinovic was negotiating directly with the tribunal and could leave for The Hague as early as Wednesday.
Meanwhile, chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte said Tuesday that the tribunal may begin handing over the first cases to authorised judicial bodies in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) next year. A conference is underway in Sarajevo, focusing on ways to develop the capacity within BiH to prosecute cases not tried in The Hague. (OHR Sources - 15/01/03; AP, AFP, BHTV1, BBC - 14/01/03)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Hundreds of public employees protested in Bucharest on Friday (May 14th) against the government's plans to slash salaries and pensions. Joining the demonstration were police officers, teachers, health and public administration staff, who called for the government to resign. Labour unions plan a general "Greek-style" protest Wednesday to force the government to drop plans to cut public workers' wages by 25% as of June 1st. Both President Traian Basescu and Prime Minister Emil Boc have said that only sharp cost-cutting can stabilise the economy. (AP, Irish Times, Mediafax - 14/05/10)

Nokia, the world's leading mobile phone supplier, will open a production unit and a research centre in Romania, under a Memorandum of Understanding that was signed recently between representatives of the Cluj County Council and the Finnish mobile producer. 
Nokia will invest 60m euros in the plant -- its eleventh -- that will be built in the Tetarom III industrial park, 18km from Cluj. Nokia Vice President Raimo Puntala said the new factory would boost the company's production capacity. 
Nokia, said Puntala, sold 350 million mobile phones in 2006, up 30% from 2005. The mobile telephony market is expected to increase 10% this year. The Cluj factory will help meet the demand for Nokia products in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 
The Transylvanian city of Cluj-Napoca was chosen due to its skilled labour force, solid internal and external logistical connections and long-standing industrial tradition, according to Nokia. Local authorities say the area will become much more attractive to foreign investors as soon as the Transylvania motorway is finished. 
Nokia will start building the plant this spring. By year's end, 500 employees will be recruited, and production will start at the beginning of 2008. The main suppliers will join Nokia at the location, forming Nokia Village. Nokia will also set up a commercial company in Cluj. 
Local authorities expect that the Finnish investment will have a significant impact on the county's economic development, creating 15,000 jobs. 
Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said the government would support the project through infrastructure expansion. Cluj airport may require an addition, as Nokia delivers its products all over the world. 
Ericsson, Microsoft and Renault have also announced plans to open research, support or design facilities in Romania.

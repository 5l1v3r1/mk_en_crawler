ZAGREB, Croatia â Authorities charged ten university professors and more than 20 other people with bribery Wednesday (January 7th). Prosecutors say the professors allowed students at Zagreb University to pass exams regardless of their grades, in some cases even without showing up at the university, in return for bribes ranging from 200 to 2,000 euros. Eleven exam monitors, nine students, one student union member and the father and father-in-law of two students are among those charged. In September, a scandal erupted over grade-selling at the university. Several students and their parents have already received jail sentences of up to nine months for paying bribes to pass exams.

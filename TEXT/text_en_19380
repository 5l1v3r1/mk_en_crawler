SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament approved on Tuesday (November 27th) a resolution on the country's priorities in its European integration process, ending debate on the European Commission's report on Macedonia's progress in 2007. The document obliges parliament to prioritize legislation related to Macedonia's EU integration, and requires the government to inform lawmakers of any action related to the EU integration process. The opposition Democratic Union for Integration says it will draft its own version of the document. (Makfax, Kanal 5, Netpress, Utrinski Vesnik, MRT - 27/11/07)

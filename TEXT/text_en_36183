ZAGREB, Croatia -- Two retired Croatian generals left for The Hague Thursday (11 March) to surrender to the international war crimes tribunal. Ivan Cermak, 54, and Mladen Markac, 48, were indicted for waging a campaign of terror, pillage and destruction aimed at forcing the Serb population to leave Croatia's Krajina area in 1995. Their lawyers and the Croatian government will seek their provisional release pending trial.
In other news, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder assured visiting Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader that Berlin would back his country's candidacy for EU membership, saying it would have a stabilising effect on the entire Western Balkans. Schroeder added he is pleased with the new government's willingness to bolster co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. (AP, Reuters, AFP - 11/03/04; HINA, AFP - 10/03/04)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government will submit answers on Tuesday (10 May) to additional questions from the European Commission that supplement a massive questionnaire aimed at assessing the country's readiness to become an official EU candidate. Deputy Prime Minister Radmila Sekerinska said at the weekend that the new questions mainly concern the fulfillment of economic criteria. Later this month, she is expected to meet with EU officials to discuss the results of the recent local elections and the pace of judicial reforms. (Makfax, A1 TV - 08/05/05)

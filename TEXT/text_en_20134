ZAGREB, Croatia -- The deputy leader of the largest opposition party, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), resigned on Saturday (March 15th) amid disagreements with party leader Zoran Milanovic. Deputy leader Zeljka Antunovic said her decision was prompted by a lack of unity within the party, the loss of coalition potential and the lack of a clear strategy. Milanovic said her move was unexpected. Antunovic became acting party leader after chairman Ivica Racan died of cancer in April 2007. But at an SDP convention in June, the post went to Milanovic. Asked whether she might seek it at the SDP convention in May, Antunovic would not comment. (Vecernji List, Javno.com, HRT - 15/03/08)

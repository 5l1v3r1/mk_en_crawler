SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Thousands joined an anti-government protest in downtown Sofia on Saturday (March 26th). The rally was organised by the opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) under the slogan "Red Card for the Government". The BSP claims the rightist government that won the 2009 elections has led the country into a disastrous situation in terms of the economy and the people's well-being. 
"If the Socialists had formed a second cabinet in 2009, then we would have drowned altogether and become a country like Ireland, Portugal or Greece with their financial problems," Prime Minister Boyko Borisov commented on the protest. (Novinite, Sofia News Agency, RIA Novosti, BNT - 26/03/11)

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal said Monday (30 September) that it has indicted a Bosnian Serb police commander in connection with his alleged role in the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre. Ljubomir Borovcanin, 42, became the court's 77th indictee. He is accused of failing to prevent the murder of non-Serbs and of failing to punish the perpetrators of war crimes. Borovcanin remained a police officer until the end of 1995 and reportedly has been teaching at the police academy in Banja Luka.

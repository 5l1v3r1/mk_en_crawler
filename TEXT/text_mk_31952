SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) warned Thursday (24 October) that Michael Steiner's new plan to decentralise Kosovo could end up destabilising Macedonia. DPA says the UN mission chief's plan would allow Serbs in the province to make decisions directed by Belgrade, a violation of the autonomy of Albanian political parties in Macedonia. DPA said that Albanian political parties in Macedonia run their activities autonomously, without input from Tirana and Pristina. The party also said that the first priority should be defining the future of the Kosovo statute and recognising Kosovo's independence. "The demands of Serbs and other minorities should be put on the agenda once Kosovo acquires independence," DPA said. (MIA, Makfax - 24/10/02)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Four people were injured when members of two rival Muslim factions clashed in a Novi Pazar mosque on Friday (November 16th). According to eyewitness reports, the brawl started when about 200 people loyal to an imam appointed by Muslim leaders in Belgrade attempted to enter a mosque where the town's recently fired imam was leading prayers for 60 of his supporters. In the fight that followed, two policemen and a man were wounded by flying stones. A fourth man suffered a gunshot wound. The incident was seen by local media as part of a power struggle inside Serbia's Muslim community. (Reuters, DPA - 16/11/07)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The network supporting fugitive Ratko Mladic is losing its strength and size, the head of Serbia's national council for ties with The Hague war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, said on Tuesday (January 20th). The reason, he says, is that Mladic has stepped up intimidation of and threats against his helpers. Ljajic told Reuters that Mladic has threatened even the children of his supporters to ensure they don't betray him. (Reuters, Beta, B92 - 20/01/09)

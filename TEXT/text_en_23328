PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic's coalition won an absolute majority in Sunday's snap parliamentary elections, the Central Electoral Commission announced on Monday (March 30th). For a European Montenegro won 51.09% of the vote, translating to 48 of the 81 seats in parliament. The opposition Socialist People's Party was second with 17.99% and 16 seats, followed by the pro-Serb NOVA party with 9.06% and eight seats.
Also Monday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn praised Montenegro for the well-organised and largely problem-free elections, yet urged the country to fix imperfections in its electoral legislation. Separately, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana praised the free and peaceful parliamentary vote and urged the new government to continue working for EU accession.

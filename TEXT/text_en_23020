ANKARA, Turkey -- General James Cartwright, vice-chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, arrived on Thursday (July 3rd) in Ankara to discuss the fight against terrorism, including the operations against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The US Embassy says Cartwright met with Turkey's chief of the General Staff General Yasar Buyukanit, and his deputy General Ergin Saygun. This is Cartwright's third visit to Ankara since November 2007. Turkey, supported by US military intelligence services, has been conducting military operations against PKK bases in northern Iraq for months.

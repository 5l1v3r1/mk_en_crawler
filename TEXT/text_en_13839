SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The first round of technical talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between BiH and the EU was held Friday (17 March) in Sarajevo. According to BiH's chief negotiator with the EU, Igor Davidovic, the discussions focused on general issues related to trade liberalisation. He said the technical negotiations could be completed by the end of the year. 
European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso, meanwhile, has sent a letter to BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic, urging local authorities to ensure the enactment of reforms needed for the timely completion of the SAA negotiations. Priorities include police sector restructuring, adoption of the public broadcasting reform law, and full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
On Sunday, officials announced that a donor conference for BiH would be held on 31 March in Brussels. The funds would finance judicial reform over the next three years. (RTRS, Srna - 19/03/06; NTV Hayat, PBS BiH, Fena - 17/03/06)

TIRANA, Albania -- Representatives of parliament met with members of non-profit groups and NGOs on Monday (28 October) to discuss co-operative efforts. Parliamentary Speaker Servet Pellumbi commended the contributions of such groups towards improving communication between government and people. Kozara Kati, head of the Albanian Centre for Human Rights, said that increased co-operation between civil society and parliament is an immediate need, because in a democratic society, NGOs could and should play an important role.

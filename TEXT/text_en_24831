NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The UN is not working on any plan to reunify the divided island of Cyprus, nor attempting to interfere in the negotiating process between the Greek and Turkish communities, UN envoy to Cyprus Alexander Downer said on Wednesday (June 3rd). As another round of negotiations between Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat concluded, Downer explained he was responding to a recent article in the Turkish newspaper Milliyet, suggesting that the UN is preparing a blueprint for resolving the Cypriot issue. "The UN's task is to support the countries in the negotiations, and the drafting of any projects is none of its business," Downer said. 
As for Wednesday's meeting, Downer said Christofias and Talat basically wrapped up discussions on economic issues and will begin tackling territorial issues next week. (AFP, Kathimerini, Hurriyet, Xinhua, ITAR-TASS - 03/06/09)

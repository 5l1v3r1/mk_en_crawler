ANKARA, Turkey -- British Ambassador to Ankara Peter Westmacott said Wednesday (8 October) that Turkey's EU membership bid is in no way related to the country's decision to send peacekeeping troops to Iraq. He commended parliament for approving a government motion to deploy troops there, saying this would help achieve peace and security. Westmacott said the most important issue in deciding whether to launch accession negotiations with Turkey late next year would be compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria. Those EU aspirations are to be discussed by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Dutch counterpart, Jan Peter Balkenende, who arrived in Ankara on Wednesday.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The EU's screening of Croatian laws related to the Judiciary and Human Rights chapter of the acquis communitaire has been delayed from March to September. At a news conference Tuesday (28 February), the head of the European Commission (EC) Delegation in Zagreb, Vincent Degert, said the postponement was made at the request of the EC, to give Zagreb more time to improve the situation in this area. The delay would not affect the overall pace of negotiations, he said. (Novi list - 01/03/06; HINA - 28/02/06)

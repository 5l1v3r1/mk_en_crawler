NOVA GORICA, Slovenia -- World Formula 1 champion Michael Schumacher confirmed on Sunday (27 April) that he intends to play in a celebrity football match next month. The match will benefit a foundation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) that helps children injured by landmines. The German driver will show up in Nova Gorica on 14 May, along with fellow Formula 1 drivers Jarno Trulli, Gianfranco Fisichella and Fernando Alonso.
In other news, a new poll published in Sarajevo found that about a third of people living in BiH are prepared to settle abroad permanently if they are offered a chance to make a better living. About 44 per cent of respondents said they were prepared to work abroad for a limited period of time, while the remaining 25 per cent indicated they would be unwilling to leave the country.

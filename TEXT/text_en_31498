ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Foreign ministers from Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt and Syria met in Istanbul on Thursday (23 January) to discuss the Iraqi crisis as US and British forces gathered in the Gulf area. But a leading Arab official, requesting anonymity, told AFP Wednesday that participants had no illusions they could delay the crisis that threatens the region. He added that the ministers would most probably come up with a joint declaration urging Iraq to follow the UN Security Council resolutions and not obstruct the work of UN weapons inspectors. Furthermore, the declaration would include an appeal to the United States not to wage war without the approval of the UN. (Reuters - 23/01/03; AFP, Anadolu Agency - 22/01/03)

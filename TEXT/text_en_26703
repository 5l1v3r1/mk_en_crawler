BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police are looking for those responsible for making death threats against B92 Radio and Television journalist Brankica Stankovic, local media reported on Monday (December 7th). Stankovic received the threats via Facebook after reporting on criminal activities involving leaders of football fan groups in Serbia last week. Graffiti calling for hatred and violence have appeared on the B92 TV building and on other buildings in Belgrade. In response, President Boris Tadic said the government will not tolerate violence from hooligans, adding that measures have been taken to protect journalists. (B92, Politika, Tanjug, AP - 07/12/09)

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The trial of former Bosnian Serb General Zdravko Tolimir opened before the war crimes tribunal (ICTY) on Friday (February 26th). Prosecutor Nelson Thayer accused Tolimir of supervising and allowing the organised detention, execution and burial of thousands of Muslim men and boys in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. "This case is about general Tolimir's choice to forsake his duty to abide by the laws of war in pursuit of a mono-ethnic Serbian state and ultimately to take part in and lead organised brutality," Thayer said. Tolimir is believed to have been a key ally of former Bosnian Serb war crimes commander and war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic. Tolimir's trial was supposed to begin December 17th. Proceedings were adjourned when the defendant said he needed more time to study additional charges to his indictment. Tolimir is conducting his own defence. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. (BBC, AFP, Reuters - 26/02/10)

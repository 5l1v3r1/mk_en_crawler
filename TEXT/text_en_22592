ZAGREB, Croatia -- Some 300 journalists demonstrated in downtown Zagreb on Friday (June 6th) against corruption and organised crime. They organised the rally after assailants beat a Croatian crime journalist with baseball bats on Monday. Dusan Miljus of the Zagreb-based daily Jutarnji List is still hospitalised. "We demand the government declare real, uncompromising war against organised crime, growing violence and widespread corruption in the country," Luko Brailo, one of the leaders of the Association of Croatian Journalists, told demonstrators.

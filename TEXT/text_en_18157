STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- Former Republika Srpska President Biljana Plavsic, who has been in prison for four years, is seeking a pardon, according to the Swedish Justice Ministry on Wednesday (January 17th). Plavsic, sentenced by the UN tribunal in 2003 to 11 years in prison for crimes against humanity, is serving her sentence in Sweden. An official says she requested early release in writing, saying that at age 76, deteriorating health and poor prison conditions represent more of a punishment than her sentence required.

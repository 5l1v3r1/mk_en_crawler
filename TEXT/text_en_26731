ATHENS, Greece -- Dockers at Greece's biggest port, in Piraeus, announced on Sunday (November 8th) that they have decided to extend by 48 hours their strike against the sale of the facility to the Chinese company Cosco Pacific. The protest, which began on November 2nd, has caused huge losses to shipping companies across Greece. The government sold the port's cargo terminal to the Chinese company last year, specifying that the new owner must invest over 3 billion euros in the port. But the protestors insist that the new owner should guarantee there will be no job cuts. Economy Minister Louka Katseli said on Sunday that the government doubts it's possible to renegotiate with Cosco. (DPA, AFP, RIA-Novosti - 08/11/09)

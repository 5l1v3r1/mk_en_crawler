BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The finance ministers of the 16 members of the eurozone urged Greece on Monday (February 15th) to further slash spending and raise taxes or face possible sanctions next month. Athens must submit a progress report to the European Commission by mid-March so the bloc can assess actions by the government and their impact on the budget. Euro Group Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker refused to describe any concrete measures eurozone members might undertake to help Greece. Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou insists that Athens is only seeking EU political support, not economic help. The meeting continues on Tuesday in an expanded format that includes finance ministers of EU member states. 
Also Tuesday, Greek customs officials and finance ministry staff kicked off a three-day strike in Athens protesting planned salary freezes and reduced bonuses. Protestors argue the measures would cut between 300 and 700 euros of their monthly wages. The action is expected to affect cross-border trade, particularly fuel supplies. Only perishable goods and medicine will be allowed to pass in and out of the country. (Nafthemporiki, AP, Express, Ethnos, Ta Nea, Eleftherotypia - 16/02/10; AP - 15/02/10)

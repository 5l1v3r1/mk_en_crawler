WASHINGTON, United States -- High Representative Valentin Inzko insisted on Wednesday (May 11th) that the international community's response to Republika Srpska's (RS) referendum plans should be unified and decisive. Inzko met with US Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg in Washington and told him that in his view, the RS parliament's decision to hold a referendum on the legitimacy of the state-level judiciary threatens the very basis on which peace in BiH has been built. He also reiterated that seven months after elections, there are no prospects for forming a new state-level government, crippling the Euro-Atlantic integration process.

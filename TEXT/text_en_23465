ATHENS, Greece -- A bomb exploded early on Friday (March 27th) in front of a building with offices of marine companies in Piraeus. The explosion damaged nearby buildings and parked cars but caused no injuries. Anti-terror police are investigating.
In other news, police in Athens used tear gas Thursday to disperse a group of around 100 firemen who protested in the city centre, demanding permanent job contracts. A far larger group, more than 1,000 firemen, staged a peaceful rally outside the Labour Ministry on Wednesday. Around 5,500 Greek firemen work under non-permanent contracts. Their trade union says the government failed to provide them with permanent contracts as promised. (AFP, City - 27/03/09; BTA - 26/03/09)

ATHENS, Greece -- International rating agency Moody's warned on Monday (May 9th) it may downgrade Greece's rating by multiple notches. The warning came hours after Standard and Poor's cut Greece's rating further into junk status, to B and C for its long-term and short-term debt ratings respectively. Moody's currently has a B1 rating on the country's sovereign debt, implying a 20% risk of default or debt restructuring. The agency said on Monday that the downgrade may be implemented if it determines Greece's debt burden will become unbearable with time, adding that the economic targets Greece has set are ambitious and difficult to achieve. The country's planned return to the capital market in 2012 seems less and less likely, the agency pointed out. (Ta Nea - 10/05/11; Imerisia, SKAI, Kathimerini - 09/05/11)

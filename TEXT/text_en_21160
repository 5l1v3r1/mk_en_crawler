THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- No defence witnesses will be called to testify in the trial of former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, the UN war crimes tribunal said in a statement Friday (November 30th). Defence lawyers claim that prosecutors have failed to mount a strong case against Haradinaj and co-defendants Idriz Balaj and Lahi Brahimaj. The three former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army are charged with murder, rape, torture and other crimes. Spokeswoman Olga Kavran says this marks the first time in tribunal history that a defendant's attorneys have declined to put up a defence. The case against Haradinaj has been marked by concerns about witness intimidation. (AP, B92 - 30/11/07)

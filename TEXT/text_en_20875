SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia wants to join NATO at the Alliance's April summit in Bucharest, largely due to concerns about neighbouring Kosovo's impending independence. "As a country neighbouring Serbia and Kosovo, Macedonia will surely be among the first to feel the consequences -- both positive and negative -- of Kosovo's status settlement," President Branko Crvenkovski wrote in a letter to NATO members on Tuesday (February 5th).
On Monday, France expressed support for Macedonia's EU and NATO bids. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner met with his Macedonian counterpart, Antonio Milososki, in Paris. Kouchner said France is ready to work with Macedonia in its efforts to become part of the Euro-Atlantic structures. 
In related news, EU Enlargement General Director Michael Lee visited Skopje on Tuesday. He said the EU has a clear vision of the future, which includes the Western Balkans. (Vecer, Utrinski Vesnik - 06/02/08; AFP, Makfax, Naftemporiki - 05/02/08)

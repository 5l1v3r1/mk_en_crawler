BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu said on Monday (24 July) that he would not name new chiefs of the intelligence services until the government and parliament adopt the country's new security legislation. Basescu was speaking at a meeting of the Supreme Defence Council, which convened in Bucharest. The session was called after the heads of the Romanian Intelligence Service, the Foreign Intelligence Agency and the General Department of Internal Information and Protection resigned last week, following the disappearance of Syrian-born businessman Omar Hayssam, accused of masterminding the kidnapping of three Romanian journalists in Iraq last year. He was released from custody in April to receive cancer treatment. (Adevarul, Ziua - 25/07/06; Mediafax - 24/07/06)

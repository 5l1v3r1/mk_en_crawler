BELGRADE, Serbia -- The OSCE Mission in Belgrade expressed strong concerns Friday (November 17th) about an increasing number of environmental incidents in Serbia recently, warning of shortcomings in the country's mechanisms of environmental protection. It urged rapid adoption of pending laws in this sector and full realisation of existing legislation. The statement came after a November 14th incident involving a state-run petrochemical plant in Pancevo. According to the local authorities, the levels of benzene in the air increased that day to more than ten times the minimum safety level. (Beta, Tanjug - 18/11/06; OSCE website - 17/11/06)

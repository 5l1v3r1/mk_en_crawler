SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva met on Monday (27 October) with European Commission President Romano Prodi and EU security chief Javier Solana to discuss EU prospects and Skopje's intention to submit its candidacy for EU membership by year's end. According to local press reports, however, EU officials encouraged the country to focus on full realisation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and improved security, rather than rushing its application.
In other news Monday, the government approved the appointment of Siljan Avramovski as acting director of the Security and Counterintelligence Directorate. He has served as section chief there since 1995. (Utrinski Vesnik, Dnevnik - 28/10/03; MIA, A1 TV, Macedonian Radio, BBC Monitoring - 27/10/03)

LONDON, England -- The main opposition Socialist Party (SP) will run alone in next year's general elections, party leader Edi Rama said on Tuesday (November 4th) during a visit to the United Kingdom. He told the BBC that with the proposed new Election Code, every party will run on its own with its own programme, team and leader. 
In Tirana meanwhile, US Ambassador John Withers said on Wednesday that Barack Obama's presidential victory will change the course of history. He is the first African-American elected as commander-in-chief. (Koha Jone, Shqip, Top Channel, BalkanWeb, News 24, Shekulli - 05/11/08; BBC, Top Channel, BalkanWeb - 04/11/08)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The World Health Organisation (WHO) says the healthcare system in Kosovo is a disaster. "It is not only a mistake; it is a scandal," Antonio Duran, adviser at the WHO Regional Office for Europe, said on Monday (November 24th) while presenting a report on the healthcare system in Pristina. WHO experts say the health ministry lacks management and organisation. "Dreams, statements, and printed papers are not enough for a system; well-thought actions and improvement of the situation in Kosovo are required," said Duran.

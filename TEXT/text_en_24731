BELGRADE, Serbia -- Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic on Tuesday (March 3rd) reiterated that Serbia would apply for EU candidacy this year, despite the Union's recommendation not to go too fast. Djelic described integration as the best guarantee for long-term stability and economic prosperity, as 75% of foreign investment in Serbia comes from the EU.
Last month, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn advised Serbia against submitting a bid for candidate status until it completed its co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal. That would allow all EU members to ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia and report some progress before taking the next step in the country's EU integration process. Full co-operation includes arresting fugitive Ratko Mladic. (Radio Srbija, Beta - 03/03/09)

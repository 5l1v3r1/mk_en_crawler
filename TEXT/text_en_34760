BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Albanian National Army issued a statement on Tuesday (12 August) claiming responsibility for a weekend mortar attack against an army base in southern Serbia. Belgrade reported there were no injuries and little damage when three mortar shells landed in the compound. Government officials who visited the area afterwards accused the group of trying to stir up tensions in an area plagued by unrest until 2001, when a local militia disarmed under a US-sponsored peace plan.
The Serbian government, meanwhile, published a document on Tuesday demanding the reinstatement of Serbian rule over Kosovo. Belgrade argues that it wants to restore peace, order, and fair multiethnic relations in the province. The UN has insisted, however, that it is still too early to debate the future status of Kosovo.

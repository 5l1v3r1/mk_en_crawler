BERLIN, Germany -- Angela Merkel, the leader of Germany's Christian Democrats, warned on Thursday (14 July) that failure by Turkey to join the EU could lead to widespread disappointment in the country and result in significant damage. She warned that it would be wrong to reach a political agreement on Turkish membership if it could then be scuttled by several EU member states. In the past, Merkel has called for granting Turkey the status of a "privileged partnership" rather than full membership. Accession talks are scheduled to begin on 3 October.
In Ankara on Thursday, Italian Foreign Minister Gianfranco Fini assured Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul that his country fully supports Turkey's EU bid. The two ministers signed an Enhanced Co-operation Protocol that includes the fields of security, economy, culture, justice and science. (Zaman - 15/07/05; AFP, NTV - 14/07/05)

ANKARA, Turkey -- More than 5,000 protestors clashed with police during a rally in support of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in the southeast city of Diyarbakir on Sunday (July 11th). Demonstrators accused Turkish security forces of mutilating the bodies of PKK personnel killed in recent fighting, instead of returning them to their families. They threw rocks and sticks at police, who responded with tear gas. At least ten protestors were arrested. (AFP, Hurriyet, Haber 10 - 11/07/10)

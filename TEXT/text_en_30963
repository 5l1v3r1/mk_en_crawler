BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Deputies Chamber approved the pension law Tuesday (December 7th) by a vote of 172 to 130. The law will have to the promulgated by the president to become effective. Constitutionally, he has no choice, as he already sent it back requesting changes once. This amended version make the retirement age for women 63, rather than 65 as was first drafted. Adopting the legislation is crucial not only because it regulates a structural reform but because it is among the five preconditions set by the last IMF review mission in October. It was supposed to have been approved in mid-September, but was delayed due to a scandal that broke out after the opposition parties accused Deputies Chamber President Roberta Anastase of vote forgery. 
Meanwhile, the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) announced on Tuesday it will file a no-confidence motion against the government over the single wage law. PSD leader Victor Ponta explained that should the motion fail, the party will appeal the law to the Constitutional Court, as the legislation does not cancel a 25% public sector wage cut implemented in July as part of the austerity measures. It is supposed to disappear by the end of the year. 
The cabinet approved the single wage law late last month. Prime Minister Emil Boc has announced plans to initiate an emergency procedure next week for its approval. (Romania Libera, Cotidianul, Ziare, Bloomberg, Mediafax, Gandul, Evenimentul Zilei - 07/12/10)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatian President Stjepan Mesic has decided that the first session of the new Croatian parliament will be held on January 11th. He announced the date Friday (December 28th) after meeting with members of the State Election Commission, who presented him with the final official results of the November 25th ballot. 
Earlier this month, Mesic gave incumbent Prime Minister Ivo Sanader a mandate to form new cabinet. Sanader's Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) won 66 seats in the 153-seat parliament and is currently in coalition talks. (Vjesnik, Vecernji List - 29/12/07; Hina, HRT, AP - 28/12/07)

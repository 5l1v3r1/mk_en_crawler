ATHENS, Greece -- Russian Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov wrapped up a two-day trip to Greece on Wednesday (December 6th). He met with a series of officials to discuss military co-operation and the situation in the Balkans, particularly Kosovo.
In Belgrade meanwhile, Russian Ambassador to Serbia Aleksandr Alekseyev told a local radio station that his country would use its veto power at the UN Security Council to block a plan for the future status of Kosovo if it does not satisfy both the ethnic Albanian majority and Serbia. In response, US Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns told reporters in Brussels that he did not believe Moscow could have issued such an ultimatum before the plan for Kosovo's status has been unveiled.

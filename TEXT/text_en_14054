NEUM, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney reiterated on Sunday (16 October) that the future of BiH depends on completing co-operation with the UN tribunal and the arrest and transfer of Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic to The Hague. The comment came during a news conference aboard the destroyer USS Mitscher, which was visiting the BiH sea town of Neum on the 10th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords. McElhaney stressed that there could be no better way to commemorate the event than by bringing the top war crimes indictees to justice. (Dnevni avaz, Nezavisne novine - 17/10/05)

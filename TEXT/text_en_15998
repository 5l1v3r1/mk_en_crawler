PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Montenegrins headed for the polls on Sunday (21 May) for a referendum on whether their republic should gain independence or remain part of a state union with Serbia. To secede from the union, at least half the country's 485,000 eligible voters must go to the polls and 55 per cent of them must opt for independence. The first official results will not be available before Monday, but reliable exit poll results are expected soon after the polls close at 9pm local time. Some 3,400 local and foreign observers are monitoring the voting at the country's 1,120 polling stations. (AFP, AP, Beta, Tanjug, Reuters, RTS - 21/05/06)

ATHENS, Greece -- Citizens paid 790m euros in bribes in 2009 in wide-ranging corruption schemes, the Greek section of the NGO Transparency International said in a report Tuesday (March 2nd). The sum is 50m euros higher than 2008. The country's financial crisis "is largely due to corruption", Costas Bakouris, president of Transparency-Greece, said as he presented the findings of a survey involving more than 6,000 people. The report suggests that there is most corruption in the public sector, hospitals, urban planning institutions and tax offices. (ANA-MPA, ERT, Ethnos, AFP - 02/03/10)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- During a visit to Sarajevo on Friday (16 September), British Minister for Europe Douglas Alexander voiced disappointment that BiH would not be able to start Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) talks by the time the 10th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords is commemorated this autumn. According to Alexander, whose country currently holds the rotating EU Presidency, the symbolism of opening SAA negotiations as such an anniversary is marked would have been "tremendous". The main hitch is police reform required by the EU. (PBS BiH, Fena - 16/09/05)

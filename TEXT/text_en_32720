BELGRADE, Yogoslavia -- On Monday (16 December), the Serbian Supreme Court officially rejected Vojislav Kostunica's final bid to annul the results of the 8 December presidential election. The Yugoslav president's Democratic Party of Serbia had argued that the election commission's voter lists were inflated by more than 830,000 nonexistent individuals and that actual turnout had exceeded the 50 per cent legal minimum.

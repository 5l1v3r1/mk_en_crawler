BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU will launch separate negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Montenegro -- once it proclaims its independence -- Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Monday (29 May). He warned, however, that the republic should not expect a "shortcut to Europe" and would have to meet all relevant requirements. Rehn also urged Montenegro to increase its administrative capacity and to step up the fight against corruption and organised crime. Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said he hoped Podgorica would be able to meet the EU standards for membership in a few years. 
After a separate meeting with Djukanovic, EU security chief Javier Solana on Monday congratulated the Montenegrin people on the results of the referendum. "The high turnout and massive international involvement provided full legitimacy for the entire process. For us the question of the referendum is over," he said. Montenegro's unionists had sent a letter to Solana complaining of irregularities in the 21 May vote. (International Herald Tribune - 30/05/06; EU Observer, UPI, AP, Reuters - 29/05/06)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- European Commission Delegation to Macedonia chief Donato Chiarini has assessed the security situation in Macedonia as "decent". Speaking to reporters in the village of Lesok on Saturday (23 July), he said that the EU was closely following the developments in the country and that, although some cases needed to be examined, isolated incidents like the ones in Bit Pazar and Kondovo will not trigger destabilisation. Chiarini also called on the local media not to "dramatise" and generate additional tension. The EU believes that all problems should be resolved by the Macedonian police in accordance with EU police standards, said the diplomat. (Vecer - 25/07/05; A1 TV - 24/07/05)

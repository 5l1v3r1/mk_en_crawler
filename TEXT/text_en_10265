BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania's chief negotiator with the EU, Vasile Puscas, announced on Thursday (23 September) that the country has closed two more EU accession chapters: regional policies and structural instruments, and free movement of services. As had been hoped, the chapters were closed before the early October release of the regular progress report on countries seeking EU entry. Romania now has four chapters left to close.

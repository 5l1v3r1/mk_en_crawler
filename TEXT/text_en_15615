SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The State Election Commission (SEC) urged on Monday (21 August) the parties and coalitions that participated in the 5 July parliamentary elections to submit their financial reports on campaign spending as soon as possible. The deadline is Saturday (26 August). SEC spokesman Zoran Tanevski says thus far only the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration has filed its report, out of the 33 participants in the vote. Parties are obliged to provide information on contributors and the sums they received, to ensure transparency in campaign financing. (Vecer - 22/08/06)

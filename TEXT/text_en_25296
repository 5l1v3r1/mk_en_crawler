SOFIA, Bulgaria -- An impeachment motion against President Georgi Parvanov, initiated by the ruling GERB party, was introduced in parliament on Friday (March 26th) after it collected the signatures of 162 lawmakers, well over the required 61. The vote is scheduled for Wednesday. If it attracts at least160 votes, it moves on to the Constitutional Court for a final decision. The motion was initiated after Parvanov made public a closed-door conversation he had with Finance Minister Simeon Dyankov. (Darik, Dnevnik, bTV - 26/03/10)

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Patrick Robinson, president of The Hague war crimes tribunal, has appointed a new trial chamber for the case involving former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. According to Robinson's decision, the panel will be composed of judges O-Gon Kwon, Howard Morrison and Melville Baird. No date for the start of the trial has been set. The issue is expected to be discussed at a status conference Tuesday (September 8th). Judge Ian Bonomy, who presided over pre-trial proceedings so far, has stepped down for personal reasons. Karadzic is charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. (Beta, B92, RTRS, Fena, Dnevni Avaz - 07/09/09)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor has set up a working group that should solve the issue with the so-called artillery diaries in a move to improve the country's co-operation with the Hague war crimes tribunal (ICTY). The experts started work on Monday (October 5th). The establishment of the working group came shortly after the visit of ICTY chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz to Croatia late last month. His talks with local officials focused on Zagreb's failure to deliver the requested documents to the court. The so-called "artillery diaries" related to the 1995 Operation Storm could be used in trials against several Croatian indictees, including General Ante Gotovina. The main goal of the newly formed body will be to supervise the investigation which local authorities have been carrying out in relation to the missing documents.
In other news, Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor has asked Foreign Minister Gordan Jandrokovic to dismiss Croatia's honorary consul to Switzerland, Waldo Bernasconi, who was involved in a sex scandal. The ministry confirmed on Monday it has launched a procedure for his removal. Bernasconi, 64, is under investigation in Italy for violating medical ethics. He has allegedly raped one of his female patients whom he had been treating for nutritional disorders. The woman has committed suicide and charges pressed against Bernasconi are based on her diary, Croatian media have reported. (HRT, Index, Jutarnji List, Hina - 05/10/09)

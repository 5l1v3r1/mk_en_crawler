SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Zlatko Miletic, the police chief of BiH's Muslim-Croat entity, confirmed on Wednesday (11 May) that former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic was sighted having lunch with his wife in a restaurant in Republika Srpska (RS) on 7 April. The information, he added, was passed on to the state prosecutor's office, a special police unit and the RS police, but they failed to act on it. The British newspaper The Guardian recently reported that Karadzic, one of the UN war crimes tribunal's top indictees, was sighted twice in the past three weeks -- once in Belgrade and once in eastern BiH.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling has decided to allow four former BiH politicians to seek public office again. However, they will not be able to assume their old posts. The four -- Ivan Mandic, Emin Skopljak, Ahmed Smajic and Mirko Stojcinovic -- were banned from positions by previous high representatives, for obstructing the peace process. 
Also Thursday, Schwarz-Schilling and US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney met with Prime Minister Adnan Terzic to discuss the latest developments in the country. The three agreed that Republika Srpska's refusal to compromise in areas of police reform could have serious consequences. (Fena, PBS, RTRS - 17/08/06)

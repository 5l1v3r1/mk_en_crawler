BLAGOEVGRAD, Bulgaria -- A strong explosion rocked the town of Blagoevgrad, southwest Bulgaria early Monday (August 6th), halting supplies of Russian natural gas to Greece, which are transited through Bulgaria. Officials report extensive damage to the pipeline facility but no casualties. The state-owned company Bulgargaz delivered 2.7 billion cubic metres of natural gas to Greece last year. The monopoly carries natural gas from Russia to Turkey, Greece and Macedonia. (Darik, Mediapool, BTA, Naftemporiki, Reuters, Netinfo, BGNES, Javno.com - 06/08/07)

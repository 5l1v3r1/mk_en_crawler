SKOPJE, Macedonia -- US Ambassador to Macedonia Lawrence Butler said Sunday (12 January) he is optimistic that there will be no political violence in the country this year. In an interview with the Voice of America Macedonian language programme, Butler stressed that the security situation is improving and that no one takes seriously threats from the so-called Albanian National Army. He noted as impressive progress the fact that the leader of the Democratic Union for Integration, Ali Ahmeti, took his seat in parliament during a national address by President Boris Trajkovski.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Sunday (August 30th) is the International Day of the Disappeared and to mark the occasion, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) announced that the fates of almost 16,000 people who went missing during conflicts in the former Yugoslavia remain unknown. ICRC regional delegation head Paul-Henri Arni held a news conference in Belgrade on Friday and said the exact figure -- 15,655 -- "is too big to reach reconciliation in the western Balkans". He added, "The ICRC is deeply concerned about the slow progress of this process." (Makfax, Glas Srbije, Emportal - 28/08/09)

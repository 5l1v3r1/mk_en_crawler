THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said in a letter to The Hague war crimes tribunal on Tuesday (June 30th) that he is not guilty of the 11 counts in the indictment against him. Karadzic, who faces charges of genocide, murder and torture stemming from the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, had previously refused to enter a plea. His trial is expected to begin in late August. (B92, FoNet, AP - 30/06/09)

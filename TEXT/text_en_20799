SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) police searched the homes Wednesday (February 6th) of two men who served as bodyguards to war crimes indictee Radovan Karadzic. The former RS political leader is wanted for genocide. The two men -- Goran Kovacevic and Milomir Batinic -- are suspected of being part of the network that supports him. Kovacevic lives in Pale, where Karadzic lived before he went missing. Batinic's home is in a village near Socolac.
In other news, The Hague war crimes tribunal announced on Wednesday it will hold a four-day hearing in the trial against former Bosnian Muslim army commander Rasim Delic in BiH at the request of BiH prosecutors. This is the second time the tribunal will conduct a hearing away from its seat in The Hague. The first one, in September, also stemmed from Delic's trial. He is charged with allowing his subordinates to commit atrocities against dozens of Croats and Serbs between 1991 and 1995. (AFP, Beta, B92, AP, UN website - 06/02/08)

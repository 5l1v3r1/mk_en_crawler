SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), a member of the ruling coalition, proposed on Tuesday (March 17th) to shorten the campaign period for the June elections for the European Parliament, from 30 days to 21. The ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party supports the idea, making it likely that parliament will approve it. It is still unclear whether the changes will apply to parliamentary elections this summer.

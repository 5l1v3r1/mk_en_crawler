WASHINGTON, United States -- A senior US diplomat said on Tuesday (April 17th) that the international community must move quickly to grant supervised independence to Kosovo. Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns told a House of Representatives committee that failure to adopt UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for Kosovo would "strengthen the hand of extremists and lead directly to new conflicts". He said the ethnic Albanian majority in the province would never agree to remain under Serbian rule. 
Belgrade reacted strongly to Burns' statement, with President Boris Tadic insisting that any move towards independence would violate the UN Charter and the existing UN Resolution 1244. (Danas, Blic - 18/04/07; AP, AFP, Reuters, US State Department, Tanjug, RTS, Top-Channel, B92 - 17/04/07)

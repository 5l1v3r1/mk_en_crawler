SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The parliamentary commission for constitutional issues unanimously approved a proposal Wednesday (23 April) for a constitutional amendment that would legalise wiretapping. The surveillance technique would require a court order, but could not be used against political parties or journalists. The proposed amendment now requires approval by a two-thirds majority in parliament.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian government refused Wednesday (16 October) to comment on speculation that the EU is preparing serious sanctions against the country if it fails to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal with regard to the Gen Janko Bobetko case. Zagreb has so far refused to co-operate, despite mounting pressure from the international community. Government spokesman Sanja Kos acknowledged that any EU country might concur with the UK's decision to put off ratification of Croatia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU. Prime Minister Ivica Racan rejects the indictment and arrest warrant issued against the 83 year old Bobetko, whom many Croatians regard as a national hero. (HINA, BBC - 16/10/02)

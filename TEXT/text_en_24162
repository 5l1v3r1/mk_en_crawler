PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EU Special Representative and head of the International Civilian Office Pieter Feith said on Wednesday (January 14th) that interethnic reconciliation should be the government's priority on its path to the EU. Feith, together with Czech Ambassador to Pristina Janina Hrebickova, EULEX commander Yves de Kermabon and European Commission office head Renzo Daviddi, presented the EU's priorities for this year. Feith stressed it is time for institutions in Kosovo to reach all communities in the country and work harder on certain projects related to decentralisation, education and preservation of cultural and religious heritage in Kosovo. Hrebickova, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency, promised she will work to resolve the issue of visa liberalisation. 
In other news Wednesday, UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier met with officials and suggested that he could arrange a meeting this month between Kosovo and Serbian authorities to resolve technical issues between the two countries. President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci have said they would meet with Belgrade's representatives only as equal partners.
Also Wednesday, Thaci discussed establishing diplomatic ties with Montenegro, saying he thinks it will happen soon and "without any conditions". Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic has said Kosovo needs to include ethnic Montenegrins in its constitution and create conditions for the return of non-Albanians.

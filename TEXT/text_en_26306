PRISTINA, Kosovo â Days before his visit to Pristina, EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele made it clear on Tuesday (March 16th) that he will ask Kosovo authorities to strengthen their fight against corruption, organised crime and money laundering and to reform public administration. Fuele stated that Kosovars must be proud of their achievements but warned they have to know that a lot more needs to be done to keep up with their EU integration processes. In a press release issued by the European Commission Liaison Office in Kosovo, Fuele noted that maintaining stability and implementation of the rule of law in the entire Kosovo remain challenges facing Kosovo.

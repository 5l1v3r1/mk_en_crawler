ZAGREB, Croatia -- On Tuesday (4 March), the parliamentary panel on internal affairs and national security supported plans to establish a council to supervise national security services. The council would provide forms of civil control on intelligence structures in line with the law on national security services adopted last year. Panel Chairman Ante Markov says parliament would invite interested civil organisations to nominate candidates for director and six members of the supervising council in the next 15 days.

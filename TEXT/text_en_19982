SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Russian President Vladimir Putin wraps up his state visit to Bulgaria on Friday (January 18th) by overseeing the signing of two major energy agreements. The larger one involves the construction of a second 4 billion euro nuclear plant in Belene. The contractor is Russia's Atomstroyexport. The other project is the construction of the Burgas-Alexandrupolis oil pipeline that will connect Bulgaria's Black Sea with Greece's Aegean Sea. Putin and Bulgarian officials are also expected to discuss Bulgaria's inclusion in the South Stream natural gas pipeline, which will carry gas from Russia under the Black Sea to Bulgaria and then to central and southern Europe. Analysts say it will strengthen Moscow's monopoly of energy supplies to Europe. Accompanying Putin is the man he favours to succeed him in the Kremlin, First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police on Sunday (August 16th) arrested the suspected killers of Bosnian Amar Mistric, 23, who was murdered late Thursday in Sarajevo. Edin Vuk and Anel Herak were detained on the basis of an international arrest warrant issued by Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). An extradition procedure will follow their interrogation. Mistric was killed after refusing to serve drinks to the two men. The murder prompted hundreds of angry Bosniaks to block some of Sarajevo's main streets Friday and Saturday.

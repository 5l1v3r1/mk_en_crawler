BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Serbian Supreme Court on Thursday (April 5th) upheld the 13-year sentence of an ethnic Albanian man accused of raping and murdering Roma during the 1999 Kosovo conflict. A lower court had found Anton Lekaj, 26, guilty of abducting 11 Roma in June 1999. He and other KLA fighters were said to have raped a girl, sexually assaulted a man, and murdered four of their captives. Lekaj denied any wrongdoing and said he did not recognise the jurisdiction of the Serbian court. (Danas - 06/04/07; AP, Beta, RTS - 05/04/07)

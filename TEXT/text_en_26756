MADRID, Spain -- The current holder of the rotating EU presidency, Spain, said on Thursday (January 7th) that Greece should not expect a bailout from the 27-nation bloc and must instead deal with its ailing finances itself. Secretary of State for European Affairs Diego Lopez Garrido stressed that each country is responsible for its own budget. In Athens, government officials said that experts from the European Commission and European Central Bank -- who are now visiting Greece -- have asked them to provide a more specific three-year plan to restore financial stability. The plan is to be submitted by the end of the month. Unions have warned that they will launch strikes early next month if the measures are too tough. (AFP, European Voice, Reuters - 07/01/10)

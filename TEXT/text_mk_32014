BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- UN war crimes chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte is in Belgrade on Monday (21 October) to discuss Yugoslavia's relations with The Hague tribunal. She will meet with Goran Svilanovic, head of the federal council for co-operation with the tribunal, as well as with council members and Serbian government representatives. Her tour will include several Balkan capitals. Prosecution spokeswoman Florence Hartmann said the aim is to assess the level of co-operation concerning arrests, access to archives and witnesses. Quoting sources in the Serbian Justice Ministry, the magazine Slobodna Bosna reported Sunday that The Hague was mulling over 20 new indictments against several politicians, including Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj, former senior Yugoslav Left official Sinisa Vucinic and the president of the Serbian Unity Party, Borislav Pelevic.
In other news, Yugoslav Justice Minister Savo Markovic told the daily Politika Sunday that neither the Serbian Interior Ministry nor the Yugoslav Army knows the whereabouts of Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic. Del Ponte has maintained that she knows where the former general is hiding in Serbia and has called on the international community to press Yugoslavia to extradite him.

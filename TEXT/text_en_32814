ATHENS, Greece -- Over 47,000 people have applied to work as volunteers for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, according to the organising committee. Over 80 per cent of the volunteers speak English, which organisers say will be of great assistance. Greek President Constantinos Stephanopoulos hosted a dinner for representatives of various volunteer organisations Thursday (5 December), commemorating World Volunteer Day.

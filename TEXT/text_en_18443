ATHENS, Greece -- Regional issues, including the Kosovo status problem and the name dispute between Greece and Macedonia, are the focus of talks as US Undersecretary for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns wraps up a visit to Athens on Monday (June11th). On Sunday, he met with Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis, who reportedly told him that her country generally backs the aspirations of Western Balkan countries to join NATO. She stressed, however, that their bids should be assessed separately. Greece, which does not recognise its neighbour's constitutional name "Republic of Macedonia", recently warned that it might veto Skopje's bid for membership in NATO and the EU unless the dispute is resolved. 
Separately, US Ambassador to Athens Charles Ries said in a weekend interview with Kathimerini that his country understands the "Greek sensitivity" about the name issue. He suggested discussions would continue. (Kathimerini, Naftemporiki - 11/06/07; ERT, ANA-MPA - 10/06/07)

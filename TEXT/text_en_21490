SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- German Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung said on Tuesday (October 28th) he believes the EU peacekeeping mission EUFOR should stay in BiH for the time being. Visiting Sarajevo, Jung said, given the link between EUFOR and the Office of the High Representative (OHR), it would be illogical to suspend the mission before the OHR completes its mandate. He joins a chorus of EU and NATO officials who have voiced concern recently over the deteriorating political climate in BiH and the lack of communication between main Bosniak and Serb politicians. Last year, the size of EUFOR fell from more than 6,000 to 2,500 troops, reflecting an improved security situation in BiH. 
In other news Tuesday, officials announced they had discovered a new mass grave in eastern BiH containing the remains of Bosnian Muslims killed in the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre. Located in the village of Kamenica, about 50km north of Srebrenica, it is the 12th such mass grave found in BiH so far. (Fena, Dnevni Avaz, AFP, Makfax, Netpress - 28/10/08)

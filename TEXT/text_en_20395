PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Officials from the Kosovo Ministry of Internal Affairs announced on Saturday (August 11th) that preparations for new travel documents for Kosovo citizens have been completed, but cannot be produced until the province's final status is resolved. In light of new status negotiations, Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu reiterated on Saturday that Pristina will not negotiate independence or territorial integrity. 
On Sunday, KFOR Commander Lieutenant General Roland Kather called for a quick solution to the status issue. Regardless of whether they belong to the Serbian minority or to the Kosovo Albanian community -- accounting for 90% of the Serbian province's population -- people need this settled, Kather told Germany's DLF radio.

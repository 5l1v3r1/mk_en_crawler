TIRANA, Albania -- Interior Minister Bujar Nishani requested on Wednesday (August 20th) an extension of the moratorium on motorboats along the Albanian coast to fight drug and human trafficking to Italy and Greece. The suspension began two years ago and, barring an extension, will expire in October. The moratorium excludes foreign motorboats. "These measures have given great results, bringing to level zero the illegal trafficking for the last two years," Nishani said. Critics argue the moratorium harms tourism and the fishing industry.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU would like to resume its negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Serbia as soon as possible, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said on Tuesday (January 23rd). Talks on the agreement, seen as the first step towards actual membership in the Union, were suspended last year over Serbia's failure to arrest Ratko Mladic and other war crimes suspects. Steinmeier made it clear that Belgrade must demonstrate that it is fully co-operating with the UN tribunal. Germany holds the rotating EU presidency. 
Separately, Erhard Busek, the co-ordinator of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, said Serbia could resume SAA talks soon after its new government is formed. Elections were held Sunday. He went on to add that the democratic pro-Western parties were likely to form a cabinet. (AP, AFP, RTS, Tanjug - 23/01/07)

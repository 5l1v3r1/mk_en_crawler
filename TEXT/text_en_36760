ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Southeast Europe Media Organisation (SEEMO), a branch of the International Press Institute, voiced concerns Tuesday (20 July) over the suspended prison sentence given a Croatian journalist earlier this month. Croatian Television reporter Ljubica Letinic was given a two-month suspended prison sentence for libel for reporting in February 2002 about local businessman Jozo Parcina. SEEMO said any prison sentence for libel is a serious violation of internationally accepted standards.
In other news, the head of the Croatian Judges' Association, Vladimir Gredelj, said Justice Minister Vesna Skare-Ozbolt made a big mistake earlier this week when she paid the fine imposed on Miroslav Juric, editor-in-chief of the now-defunct weekly Novi Brodski List , for libel. The minister's action saved Juric from serving a 70-day sentence. Gredelj said the minister's act breached "the purpose of punishment and the desire of Juric himself". (HINA, HRT - 20/07/04)

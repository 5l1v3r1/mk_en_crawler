BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serb Health Minister Ranko Skrbic confirmed on Tuesday (November 13th) that nearly one tonne of radioactive waste has disappeared from a hospital in Banja Luka during the last couple of days. The material, kept in lead containers in the basement, was used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Skrbic says it poses no danger to the public. Local media reports suggest thieves likely stole the lead containers to sell as scrap metal. 
In other news Tuesday, the BiH presidency voted to donate an old World War II bomber to a French D-Day museum. The Douglas C-47 was manufactured in 1944 and took part in the Normandy landings, transporting supplies and injured troops. (Nezavisne Novine - 14/11/07; RTRS, Fena, BIRN, DPA, Reuters - 13/11/07)

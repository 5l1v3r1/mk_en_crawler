THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal's Referral Bench decided on Friday (November 17th) to transfer the case of former Yugoslav Army officer Vladimir Kovacevic, aka "Rambo", to the Serbian judiciary. It is the first such case to have been referred to Belgrade. Kovacevic is charged in connection with the shelling of the Croatian city of Dubrovnik in 1991. He was released provisionally to Serbia in June 2004. Earlier this year, however, Kovacevic was found unfit to enter a plea or stand trial. He will remain in Serbia under strict monitoring until his condition permits criminal proceedings against him.
In other news, UN prosecutors at The Hague tribunal have ordered medical experts to examine Serbian nationalist leader Vojislav Seselj. He is scheduled to go on trial November 27th on charges of participating in a criminal conspiracy to torture, murder, and expel thousands of non-Serbs from Bosnia and Croatia. His Serbian Radical Party claims he has begun a hunger strike. (B92 - 18/11/06; ICTY website, HRT, Reuters - 17/11/06)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia warned Hungary on Saturday (13 December) that it would impose tariffs in retaliation for Budapest's decision to levy punitive duties worth 12.7m euros per year on imports from Zagreb. "If Hungary does not quickly cancel its decision to raise tariffs on our products, then we will impose similar measures," Croatian Agriculture Minister Bozidar Pankretic said. Zagreb earlier this year banned imports of Hungarian meat products, citing concerns over mad cow disease. Hungary says the decision was not based on scientific findings and has taken its case to the WTO.
Also Saturday, hundreds of Bosnian farmers blocked a crossing at the border with Croatia for an hour, protesting the BiH government's trade policy. The farmers threatened to block all border crossings on 28 December, unless authorities agree to postpone enforcement of free trade agreements with Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro, planned for January. Farmers say the agreements will result in huge losses. (AFP, PBS BiH, NTV Hayat, Tanjug, BBC - 13/12/03)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Two parallel protests were held on Saturday (December 13th) at Marshal Tito Square in downtown Zagreb. The first, marking International Human Rights Day, brought together more than 1,000 people calling for the name of the square to be changed. Tito was a criminal responsible for mass murders, arrests and tortures, organisers said, demanding that the site be renamed Theatre Square.
Meanwhile, about 200 people attended a counter demonstration, accusing the first group of promoting the fascist Ustashe movement. No incidents were reported. (AFP, Javno, MIA - 13/12/08)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Foreign Minister Solomon Passy said on Thursday (4 September) that the government seeks an enhanced UN role in Iraq during the post-war reconstruction and democratisation of the country. He added that Bulgaria would also welcome larger involvement by NATO, the EU, and the OSCE. Passy spoke after briefing members of the parliamentary commission on foreign policy, defence and security on his visit to Iraq late last month. He called his trip a sign of solidarity with the Iraqi people and an attempt to open markets to Bulgarian companies. (Trud, Dnevnik - 05/09/03; BTA, BNT, BNR - 04/09/03)

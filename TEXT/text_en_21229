TIRANA, Albania -- Small left-wing parties in parliament began to collect signatures Tuesday (April 29th) for a nationwide referendum on constitutional changes approved last week by parliament. The two largest political parties, the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and the opposition Socialist Party, both backed the amendments, many of which address electoral reforms. The leader of the Socialist Party for Integration (SMI), Ilir Meta, is urging lawmakers from across the political spectrum to join the referendum initiative as "an obligation to the electorate". The SMI also plans a demonstration on May 10th against the DP-led government. (Panorama, Koha Jone, Shekulli, Shqip - 30/04/08; BalkanWeb, TopChannel - 29/04/08)

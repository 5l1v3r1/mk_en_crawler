SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski said Sunday (18 July) he is very pleased with the ruling coalition's draft agreement on local decentralisation, which he characterised as a difficult but brave step forward. "I am convinced that the worst possible solution would have been the postponing of laws or elections, blocking of decentralisation and the Framework Agreement and the Euro-Atlantic integration processes," Crvenkovski said.
The international community has welcomed the decentralisation accord. The United States said it strengthens democracy at the local level while respecting the spirit and the letter of the Ohrid Agreement. The EU, NATO and OSCE also praised the government for adopting the draft. (MIA - 18/07/04)

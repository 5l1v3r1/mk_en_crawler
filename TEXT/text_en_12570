SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament Speaker Borislav Velikov will not be calling an extraordinary session of the legislature this week to discuss the government's election spending plans, as demanded by the opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP). Parliament has been in recess for days, ahead of the 25 June parliamentary elections. BSP wanted members to return to work to debate the cabinet's controversial plans for an election lottery aimed at boosting voter turnout. (Mediapool, bTV - 08/06/05)

THE HAGUE, the Netherlands -- Hearings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the legality of Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence ended on Friday (December 11th) with Vietnam and Venezuela presenting their arguments. Both countries agree with Serbia, saying that Kosovo's independence is illegal according to international law and that it violates UN Security Council Resolution 1244.
On Thursday, Romania made that same case, while Britain and the Netherlands supported Kosovo's independence. "Serbia wants to turn back the time at the ICJ, but such a thing cannot happen," the British representative said. Most critics fear that Kosovo sets a precedent for other separatists around the world. In all, 36 states have filed written or verbal arguments regarding the case.

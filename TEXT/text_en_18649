MUNICH, Germany -- Speaking Saturday (February 10th), Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country would not support any international plan to resolve Kosovo's status that is not accepted by both Serbia and the province's ethnic Albanian majority. "Only the Kosovars and Serbs can resolve this," Putin told the 43rd Conference on Security Policy in Munich. "Let's not play God and try to resolve their problems." The three-day forum, which began Friday, gathered defence and foreign policy experts from 40 nations, including the defence ministers of all southeast European countries. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke Friday at the event, saying Belgrade's demand for additional time to prepare for the next round of status talks was reasonable. She also lauded the progress of reforms in Southeast Europe, reminding the international community that it bears responsibility for the region's future.

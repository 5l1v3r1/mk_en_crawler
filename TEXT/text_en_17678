NOVI PAZAR, Serbia -- A local Muslim religious leader, Sandzak mufti Muamer Zukorlic, said on Sunday (March 25th) that there is no room for fanaticism and extremism in the region. His comment followed a meeting with a delegation from the US State Department, led by the Deputy Chief of Mission to Belgrade, Roderick W. Moore. Zukorlic says talks focused on the recent discovery by Serbian police of a training camp for Wahhabi extremists in the Novi Pazar area. The mufti stressed that the local Muslim community must be united against anyone using religion as a pretext for extremist purposes.
Also Sunday, the leader of the Sandzak Democratic Party, Rasim Ljajic, urged authorities to fully investigate the Wahhabi case and to arrest the organisers and those who supplied weapons. (Danas - 26/03/07; RTS, Tanjug, Beta - 25/03/07)

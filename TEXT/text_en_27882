ATHENS, Greece -- Ferry service from the main port of Piraeus glides to a halt Tuesday (November 23rd) due to a 24-hour strike by seamen, who insist on a new collective bargaining agreement. The action will affect ferry traffic to the islands, but will not stop services to Italy. State hospital doctors are also protesting health cuts by treating outpatients for free all week. Municipal employees, meanwhile, entered a fourth day of protest against wage cuts and planned layoffs on Monday, leaving mounds of rubbish piling up in the streets of Athens. 
A fact-finding mission of the European Commission, European Central Bank and the IMF told a press conference on Tuesday that the government continues to follow its economic readjustment programme and all criteria that were supposed to be met by end-September have been met. Furthermore, representatives of the mission noted significant progress in meeting goals, including state spending cuts and fiscal reform, giving a green-light to the instalment of the next 9 billion-euro tranche of the 110 billion-euro bailout package for the Greek economy. At the same time, the EU/IMF mission noted that "data revisions for 2009 and weaker-than-projected revenue collection mean that an extra effort will be needed to meet the deficit target of 7.5% of GDP in 2011, which the government has reaffirmed".

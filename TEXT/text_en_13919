THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Serbia-Montenegro Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic, who is also chairman of the national council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, said on Wednesday (16 November) that Belgrade must extradite some indictees by mid-December. His comment followed a meeting with chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte in The Hague. According to Ljajic, Serbian authorities must take concrete steps before del Ponte presents her next assessment report on the federal union to the UN Security Council on 15 December. Otherwise, the process of Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with the EU would be jeopardised. (Beta, Tanjug, AP - 16/11/05)

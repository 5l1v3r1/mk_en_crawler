SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The House of Peoples on Thursday (29 July) rejected a key BiH framework law on higher education. The Croat caucus insists the measure damages the interest of Croats. The law was returned to the BiH Council of Ministers, which was asked to amend it. High Representative Paddy Ashdown criticised parliament's decision, saying it will further delay implementation of European higher education standards across BiH. He urged the cabinet to resubmit the bill to parliament as soon as possible. (FENA, PBS - 29/07/04)

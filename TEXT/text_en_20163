NEW YORK, Untied States -- High Representative to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Miroslav Lajcak and the country's recently resigned Prime Minister Nikola Spiric clashed in their speeches to the UN Security Council on Thursday (November 15th). However, their basic message was similar: the political crisis in BiH could deepen, resulting in another setback for the country. In his report to the Council, Lajcak said BiH has made no progress in reforms related to the criteria for signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, and said he expects no sudden breakthroughs.
Spiric, who spoke to the Security Council at Russia's urging, said he fears the crisis in BiH could spin out of control. He said he blames Lajcak for the turmoil, insisting the high representative should change the measures he proposed last month, which were aimed at making the government more efficient. Spiric also called on the Security Council to extend EUFOR's mandate in BiH, saying its presence is vital to security.
Also Thursday, EU Military Committee Chairman General Henri Bentegeat said the Union is prepared to quickly triple its number of troops in BiH, if warranted. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 16/11/07; RTRS, NTV Hayat, Fena, AFP - 15/11/07)

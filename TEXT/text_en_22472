BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Supreme Court is prosecuting former Democratic Liberal Party lawmaker Mona Musca for perjury, after she denied working for the secret police during the former communist regime, media reported on Wednesday (September 10th). The National Council for the Study of Securitate Archives later proved the opposite, and the Bucharest Court of Appeals upheld that finding. Musca already announced she will not run in the November parliamentary elections either as a member of a party or as an independent, saying she has lost confidence "in the way in which some state institutions function". Musca resigned from parliament in March 2007. (Mediafax, Agerpress, Realitatea TV, Ziare - 10/09/08)

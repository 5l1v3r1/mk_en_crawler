ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police have arrested seven people suspected of committing war crimes against Serbian soldiers in 1995, local media reported on Monday (October 19th). The crimes allegedly occurred on Bosnian territory at the end of the country's 1992-1995 conflict. Media reports suggest the detainees are former members of the Croatian Army who are suspected of killing five Serbian soldiers in the village of Mliniste, during an operation by Croat and Muslim forces against Bosnian Serbs. Under an agreement between the Croatian and Bosnian governments, the Croatian Army fought alongside Bosnian troops against Bosnian Serbs during the summer of 1995.

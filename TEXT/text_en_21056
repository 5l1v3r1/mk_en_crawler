THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Prosecutors at the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague appealed on Friday (February 1st) the 33-year prison sentence handed down to former Bosnian Serb General Dragomir Milosevic in December. Milosevic was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity for directing the 44-month siege of Sarajevo that resulted in more than 10,000 deaths during the 1992-1995 conflict. But the prosecutors say the sentence is "inadequate and fails to properly reflect Milosevic's guilt". Prosecutors are demanding a life sentence for Milosevic, just as Stanislav Gali, his predecessor as commander of the besieging Bosnian Serb forces, received. (Reuters, B92, RTRS, PBS - 01/02/08)

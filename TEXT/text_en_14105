PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The UN special envoy tasked with reviewing the implementation of standards in Kosovo, Kai Eide, considers the newly launched "Plan B" for decentralisation an important step forward, according to a statement he issued while on a five-day visit to the province Sunday (14 August). The Norwegian diplomat said that during his stay he would seek to discuss the plan with all sides involved. UNMIK deputy chief Larry Rossin reportedly launched the revised version of the government's decentralisation plan Friday. It still envisions the establishment of five pilot municipalities -- Gracanica, General Jankovic, Junik, Mamusa and Partes -- but adds more cadastral units to some municipalities. Although the Kosovo cabinet claimed the revision followed a request by local Serbs, the Serb community continues to disagree with the proposal, as does Belgrade.

VI. FINANCIAL MARKETS 
A. General 

1. Could you confirm that interest rates are generally market-determined? Are any rates administratively set? If so, which ones? If so, is there a timetable for full deregulation? 
Interest rates in the Republic of Macedonia are market based. Setting interest rates on market basis, as one of the basic principles of the market economy, is accepted and fully implemented in practice. Interest rates are an issue related to the business policy of the economic agents and they are subject to an agreement between the contracting parties. The legal grounds for setting interest rates on market basis arises from the provisions referred to in Article 388 of the Law on Contracts  (“Official Gazette of  RM”, No. 18/2001, 4/2002 and 5/2003), pursuant to which determination of the level of interest rate is at the disposition of the contracting parties (natural persons and legal entities).  Only the default interest is determined on administrative basis, i.e. the interest the debtor pays in cases  she or he is in default. This interest rate is regulated by the Law on the Amount of the Default Interest Rate (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 65/1992 and 70/1993). Pursuant to the Law, the level of default interest rate is pegged i.e. fixed as triple the level of the discount rate of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (the central bank). The discount rate is an integral part of the instruments of the monetary policy of the central bank. The fact that the default interest rate is derived from the discount rate makes no difference in the decision-making about its changing. No deregulation is planned for this interest rate. 
2. Do quantitative ceilings exist on credit creation? What instruments are available to prevent too fast credit growth and potential exchange rate volatility from eroding the quality of lenders' portfolios?  
There is no quantitative ceiling on the credit growth in the banking sector. Credit limits to MKD credits were applied by the central bank, as a direct instrument of the monetary policy from the moment of acquiring monetary independence (April 1992) to April 2000.  Auction of central bank bills and the reserve requirement are the basic instruments that the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) can use to prevent the rapid growth of credits and potential exchange rate volatility. By changing the interest rate and the type of the tender of central bank bill auctions, the NBRM sends signal regarding the course of the monetary policy. At the same time, reserve requirement can also be used as an instrument to prevent rapid credit growth, by increasing the reserve requirement rate of the banks at the NBRM. Clear example of the efficiency of the NBRM instruments in terms of preventing the pressure on the exchange rate is the crisis period in the Republic of Macedonia in 2001. In fact, in conditions of higher budget expenditures for security needs, withdrawal of the deposits from the banks by the citizens under the influence of psychological factors and the increase of the level of cash in circulation, the increased demand for foreign currency caused pressures for depreciation of the MKD exchange rate against the Deutsch mark. In such conditions, the NBRM intervened on two sides: on the supply side of the foreign exchange market – by selling foreign currency and on the side of demand for foreign currency by withdrawing MKD liquidity, mainly through auctions of central bank bills, the interest rates of which, for the purpose of greater attraction, were increased twofold (in a certain period, the interest rates reached 20%). Together with the other accompanying measures, among which the increase of the reserve requirement rates, the NBRM managed to maintain the MKD exchange rate stability, and the price stability, respectively.  These two instruments, the auction of the state treasury bills and the mandatory reserves are instruments  of the monetary policy and are used in order to realize and fulfill the objectives of the monetary policy. Except of an indirect use (in cases of rapid credit growth and volatility of the exchange rate), they are not used to provide protection from potential erosion of banks’ credit portfolio. In this sense, the risk of erosion of the credit quality, and in general as a result of other factors such as the rapid credit growth and the volatility of the exchange rate, is in the range of the supervisory function that is carried out by the Central Bank of the Republic of Macedonia. This risk is considered from the level of dependency a certain bank has. In this context, the rapid credit growth is not considered a factor that leads to erosion of the credit quality on its own, but is seen only as a potential indicator that this can occur on a bank level. The risk of deterioration of the credit portfolio due to volatility of the exchange rate is known on the level of banking supervision, but at this moment, it has not been graded that the intensity of this risk asks for introduction of special instruments which will be able to control that risk or regulate it.       
3. Does the Republic of Macedonia have access to international financial markets? If so, could the authorities provide an assessment of access to the international financial markets by the state and by the private sector? On what financial terms? Please give examples. 
The government sector and the private sector have access to the international financial markets, but in general, the access is limited. Reasons for this are the crises in the region, as well as in the country, and the absence of credit rating of the Republic of Macedonia awarded by international credit rating agencies, that was only received in mid 2004. All that caused the foreign creditors to set certain preconditions if credits were to be extended to entities in the Republic of Macedonia, i.e. higher exposure premium expressed through higher interest rate, request for cash collateral or mainly concluding arrangement for a period up to one year, request for guarantees by third parties, etc. The government sector used the most borrowing from the international financial institutions, such as the IMF, IDA, IBRD, EBRD, EIB, as main source of foreign financing. The only appearance of the Republic of Macedonia on the international capital market was on 26.03.1997, when part of the debt of former SFRY that belonged to the Republic of Macedonia towards certain foreign commercial banks organized as London Club of Creditors, was exchanged for new bonds. Two bonds were issued to the Republic of Macedonia for the amount of USD 228.727.000,00 with variable interest rate, one in the amount of US$ 221.214.000,00, the so-called Global Bond issued under C Regulation, and the other was the so-called Limited Bond, issued at the request by US creditors, in the amount of US$ 7.513.000,00. The Bonds are announced and listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The spread of these Bonds ranged between 311 to 670 basic points.   Dominant source of financing to the private sector in the Republic of Macedonia are the bank credits, manly financed with foreign credits from international financial institutions, such as EBRD, IBRD and foreign commercial banks. No company from the Republic of Macedonia is listed on any foreign stock exchanges, nor there are other securities issued by Macedonian enterprises on the financial markets abroad. In July 2004, the Republic of Macedonia acquired the first sovereign long-term credit rating BB, with positive prospects in the coming period, prepared by the international credit rating Agency Standard&Poor’s. With the acquired credit rating, the Republic of Macedonia, as well as the private sector, is expected to have facilitated access to the international financial markets. In the light of this context, worth mentioning is the syndicated loan  approved to Tutunska Banka AD Skopje on 21.12.2004, in the total amount of EUR 20 million, in which in addition to EBRD’s participation with EUR 7 million, several international banks, such as Erste Bank Austria, Raiffeisen Austria, BHV Germany and KBC Bank Belgium, etc., participate as well. The loan is approved on two years, with a possibility to be re-extended for one more year. 
4. What are the legal arrangements concerning central bank credit to the private sector? If so, how important are such credits in practice? Do the authorities envisage changes in any such arrangements? 
Pursuant to Article 83 of the Law on National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 3/2002, 51/2003, 85/2003 and 40/2004), (see 43H11_Annex_01), the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia is prohibited to carry out commercial activities unrelated to the performance of its functions (listed in Article 10 of the Law on NBRM) and to give guarantees and other types of security for the liabilities of the private sector.  The National Bank, in order to fulfil the function of regulating the general liquidity in the banking system, can approve short-term credits to the banks, provided that the credit is secured with security instruments (Article 16, paragraph 1 of the Law on NBRM). In this context, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, depending on the level of liquidity in the banking system, carries out credit operations through auctions of credits (Decision on Carrying Out Auctions of Credits of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 24/2000), and approves collateralized over-night loans  to the banks (Decision on Loans on Collateral, “Official Gazette of RM”, No. 11/2003). In the past period, starting from mid-2000, as a result of the creation of excess of liquidity in the banking system, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia did not approve credits to the banks through auctions.  Due to the same reasons, collateralized loans are rarely applied instrument. Thus, in the past two years, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia approved collateralized over-night loans only six times. During 2005, it is envisaged to introduce repo-operations with government securities, through which the technique for securitization of the credit operations of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia will be simplified. In addition, in June 2004, amendments were made to the Law on National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, providing legal possibility for the National Bank (to the end of maintaining the financial system stability), to approve short-term liquidity credit to a bank (credit as last resort), provided it is collateralized with security instruments.(Article 16, paragraph 2, of the Law on National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia). Both the procedure and the terms and conditions for approving these credits are regulated under the Decision on Short-term Liquidity Credits as Last Resort (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 84/2004).  
5. What are the main characteristics of the interbank clearing and settlement system? What has been the experience with these relatively new systems? Are there changes envisaged in the payments' system? 
The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) owns and manages the Macedonian Interbank Payment System – MIPS. The system commenced its operations on 30.07.2001. MIPS is a Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS). It means that the payments among the participants are executed immediately (for less than 1 second) on gross basis. After the settlement in MIPS, payments are final. Payment operations in the Republic of Macedonia are carried out fully through the banks, while the settlement among the banks is carried out in the settlement system at the NBRM –MIPS. Participants in the MIPS are the following: 1. NBRM; 2. Payment operations performers (the banks); 3. Brokerage companies; 4. Central Securities Depository; 5. Clearing systems; and 6. Treasury system.  MIPS can also include other participants not making payments, but using the system for a safe electronic communication with the banks. Participation in the MIPS is provided on the bases of the Agreement on Participation, according to which the participants accept the operational rules of the MIPS, stipulated by the NBRM. The operational rules regulate the following: participation, available accounts, procedures for log on and log off, the manner of forwarding messages, available messages and their form, message priorities and queues, fee paid by the participants, business days, time schedule, etc. Participants can choose the manner in which they will exchange messages through the MIPS. NBRM offers the following manner, through which messages can be exchanged:   FIN service of the SWIFT international network;   Frame Relay Network of Macedonian Telecommunications; and   Direct link to the system via local area network. With regard to protection and authorization of messages forwarded through the abovementioned networks, PKI technology is used. Main features of the MIPS are the following:   operates on real-time gross settlement basis;   carries out inter-bank payments;   executes payments of the NBRM (via the MIPS, payments are executed between banks and the NBRM arising from foreign currency operations, central bank bills and other activities related to implementation of the monetary policy);   payments are executed if there is enough coverage on the account of the participant (coverage on the account of the participant means account balance, increased by the allowed daily overdraft and reduced by the daily limits stipulated by the NBRM);    daily approval of the daily overdraft of the banks on the basis of collateral; overdraft within a day is interest-free;   carries out credit and debit transactions;   settled payments are irrevocable;   queues (payments that cannot be executed due to absence of coverage on the account of the payer are subject to queuing; when funds are received, payments are executed on the basis of priority, and within a same priority under the FIFO principle; MIPS has an incorporated option for gridlock resolution; If this option is activated, there is net settlement of the queued messages of all banks. The system incorporates possibility for many options: settlement according to priority, under FIFO, combination of FIFO + priority and priority + FIFO or under ascending/descending schedule according to the amount in the message, but according to the rules, only the option priority + FIFO is currently used);   payments not settled at the end of the day are returned to the payer;   the bank has a possibility to monitor the balance and the circulation on its account in the MIPS, as well as to manage the queues (change of priority and cancellation of payment);   the system enables query of sent messages, reports on the balance of the account, etc;   regarding communication among participants, standard inter-bank messages are used, in line with the international SWIFT standards;   documents in electronic form – signed with electronic signature are used in the system;   the system has options to keep several accounts of a single participant;   the system has a possibility to operate with several networks, by implementing the “V” scheme;   it is connected with the Central Securities Depositary, and settlement of securities on the basis of “delivery versus payment” (DVP) is carried out through the MIPS;   in average, 7,203 transactions with average daily value of MKD 2.640,07 million were settled through the MIPS in 2003. The information system serving the MIPS is manufactured by the Hewlett Packard. MIPS operates in accordance with the basic principles on systematically important payment systems, stipulated by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems at the Bank for International Settlement. During the last assessment made by the joint IMF and World Bank FSAP mission in September 2003, the following was determined:   4 principles are observed in the system;   4 principles are broadly observed in the system;   1 principle is partially observed in the system;    there is no principle that is not observed, and   one principle is not applicable to the system, having in mind that the MIPS is a RTGS system, and that principle refers only to net systems. This means that the FSAP mission concluded that all principles on systematically important payment systems are applied in the MIPS. In addition to the MIPS,, pursuant to the Law on Payment Operations, inter-bank payments can be also  executed through clearing houses, which will ultimately be settled in the settlement system at the NBRM – the MIPS. Currently, the largest clearing house is the Clearing Interbank Systems, joint-stock company Skopje –KIBS. It was established by 16 banks and is a joint-stock company. Pursuant to the Law on Payment Operations, the NBRM is in charge of the supervision over the operations of the KIBS. Participants in the clearing operations are performers of the payment operations (banks that acquired license to perform payment operations from the NBRM). The features of the KIBS are the following:   Ownership and management by 16 commercial banks;   Settlement of large number of small-value inter-bank payments by participants that do not exceed the amount of 1.000.000 MKD (this amount is determined by the NBRM);   Settlement of payment transactions is carried out under the multilateral net principle;   Clearing operations are carried out in one cycle per day;   Participants in the KIBS system have opened clearing accounts;   Final settlement of net positions of the clearing accounts of the participants in the KIBS system is carried out on their settlement accounts at the NBRM through the MIPS, thus the payments become final;   There is a procedure of “unwinding” (which has not been applied so far, due to the incorporated options for bank liquidity management in the MIPS);   Information system for multilateral netting has been prepared by KIBS. Taking into consideration the three-year experience, one can say that the MIPS have proven to be an efficient and safe system for payment and settlement. During 2003, there was 99, 8% availability of the system compared to the envisaged time. Introduction of the new payment system has enabled:   keeping the accounts of the banks at the NBRM;   keeping the accounts of the legal entities at the commercial banks on competitive basis;   several accounts at several banks upon choice by legal entities, thus providing for risk diversification at the legal entity;   introduction of new services by the banks for their clients;   execution of urgent payment at real time;   facilitated liquidity management of the banks, having in mind that the banks are informed in real time about large-value payments;   elimination of settlement-related risks for the NBRM;    settlement of securities on DVP basis, etc. With regard to further development of the payment systems in the Republic of Macedonia, pursuant to the regulations adopted by the NBRM for collection of data on payment operations, it is planned to systematically collect and disseminate data on payment operations, in line with the EU practice (the “Blue Book”). In addition, to the end of improvement of payment system efficiency and resolving the outstanding issues in terms of coordination, establishment of Payment System National Council of the Republic of Macedonia is underway, which should prepare strategic document for further development of payment systems in the country, in line with the EU Directives on payment systems.  
B. The banking sector (see also chapter 3 – Free Movement of Services) 

1. Please describe the current situation concerning access of private companies to bank credit and trend compared to previous years. To what extent have issues relating to property registration and enforcing bankruptcy hindered the access to credit? 
Pursuant to the current regulation in the Republic of Macedonia, private companies have equal access to bank credits. Terms and conditions under which bank credits are approved are determined by banks, with their business policy, thereby adhering to the stipulated supervisory standards and prudential management requirements. Restructuring, competition and client-orientation of banks have facilitated the access of enterprises to the credit market. Thereby, establishment of micro-credit banks, and inclusion of micro-credits in the standard products of the large banks as well, led to better access by small enterprises to credits.  By the end of 2002, due to the low level of savings in the banks, restructuring of the real sector of the economy, restructuring and consolidation of banks, high lending interest rates, slow execution of collateral and uncertainty caused by several shocks of non-economic nature, the credit market in the Republic of Macedonia was relatively “anemic”. Gradual  phase-out of the effects of these factors resulted in commencement of growth  of credits to the private sector from the beginning of 2003. More intensive crediting to corporate sector was also recorded, although with significantly lower intensity compared to credits to citizens.  Chart Credits to the corporate sector Source: National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia From the point of view of credits extended to enterprises, the Chart shows intensive annual growth of credits extended to enterprises in 2000 (15,7%), partly due to the abolishment of credit limits in April 2000 (the last direct monetary instrument). In 2001, as a result of the security crisis, credit contraction in the corporate sector was noticed (annual drop by 0,1%), and in 2002, the amount of credits 19992000200120022003Share of GDPAnnual changeallocated in the enterprise sector recorded insignificant annual growth (0,1%). During this period, the significant increase of the deposit potential of the banks (due to the conversion of the 12 currencies into euro) did not result in stronger credit activity of the banks, which was due to the uncertainty regarding the volume and dynamics of re-withdrawal of these funds from the banks. Stabilization of the economy in 2003, in conditions of further increase in the deposit base of the banks, reduced credit costs,  more active business policy of banks and liberalization of the foreign currency crediting, led to more intensive annual growth of credits to enterprises in 2003 by 8,1%. Still, in 2003, their share in GDP decreased (by 0,7 percentage points), reflecting greater orientation of the banks towards crediting the citizens. In the course of 2004, there was a continuous growth of credit allocated to the corporate sector, whereby the banks further strengthened their role in providing additional financial support for new investments. At the end of June 2004, compared to the end of the previous year, total credits extended to the enterprises increased by 7,7%. Thereby, such intensified credit activity was accompanied by gradual improvement of credit portfolio (evident in the reduced percentage of non-performing loans in the overall credit exposure).  Issues related to registration of ownership and conducting bankruptcy are important for the credits access of the companies. Although registration of collateral/mortgage is carried outside the courts (at notaries public), imposing mortgage depends on the possession of title deed. The procedure for acquiring title deed is very slow, and no real estate cadastre has yet been established in number of municipalities. Regarding collateral on movable property, huge progress has been achieved with the establishment of the Central Registry, where collateral on movable property is registered. In addition, the Central Depositary already operates and the ownership of securities is registered there.   Execution of collateral/mortgage is carried out in extra-judicial procedure, by sale of the mortgage/collateral through notary public. However, due to the absence of developed real estate market, sale of mortgage is slow. In addition, the existing legislation preserves certain rights to the debtors when the notary public sets the mortgage selling price. General Provisions in the Bankruptcy Law (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 55/1997, 53/2000, 37/2002 and 17/2004) impose fast and efficient manner of carrying out bankruptcy procedures, so as to protect the interests of the creditors. However, in reality, due to relatively low liquidity on the market, as well as the insufficient efficiency of the courts, the process of determining and claims and executing the bankruptcy is prolonged.  As a result, and in order to overcome the existing weaknesses in the bankruptcy procedures in the Republic of Macedonia, procedure for modifications and amendments to the Bankruptcy Law is underway. Modifications and amendments are aimed at acceleration of the bankruptcy procedure, paying special attention to elimination of weaknesses in the work of the courts that conduct the bankruptcy procedures, harmonization with the European legislation and harmonization with the laws related to the Bankruptcy Law, which have already undergone the procedure for harmonization with the European legislation.  
All previously stated factors significantly influence the design of credit policies of banks in terms of extending credits to solvent clients and investing funds at clients that have the capacity to provide collateral for which there is a liquid market.   
2. Please evaluate the degree of competition in the banking system (price competition, new products, changes in market share, other indicators). Are there any particular concerns on the share of market of the two largest banking groups?  
The banking system in the Republic of Macedonia is of universal nature. It consists of 21 banks and 15 savings houses.  Banking industry underwent comprehensive restructuring. In the period 1994 – 1999, there was a financial restructuring of the banks, which included conversion of part of the non-performing loans of the old banks into government bonds, and bankruptcy of the second largest bank at that time – Jugobanka Skopje. The second period (2000 – 2004), includes operational restructuring of the banking industry, which included the following elements: introduction of new risk management policies and procedures, new information technologies, higher efficiency, launching new banking products, increasing client orientation of the banks, greater competition and introduction of transparency in the banks’ operations.  According to the size of total assets of the banks in the Republic of Macedonia, they can be categorized in three groups as follows:   large banks (with assets over MKD 15 billion);   medium-size banks (with assets from  MKD 2 to 15 billion); and    small banks (with assets up to MKD 2 billion). According to these criteria, the group of large banks comprises of 2 entities, the group of medium-size banks consists of 7, while 12 banks have total assets less than MKD 2 billion and fall within the group of small banks.  The concentration in the banking industry corresponds to the level of concentration for a small and open economy. The market share of the two largest banks accounts for 55,9%. The market share of the group of medium-size banks is 30,2%, while the share of the small banks is 13,9%. Distribution of capital within the above defined groups of banks is more equally dispersed. The two largest banks participate with 30,7% in the total capital of the banking system, the share of the medium-size banks is 36,5%, while the share of the group of small banks is 32,8%.    Regarding distribution of the participation on the credit market and the deposit potential of the banks, the dominant share goes to the two largest banks; their share in the credit market is 47,9%, and 66,3% in the total deposit potential. The Chart below shows the market share of separate groups of banks according to the following criteria: total assets, deposits and credits. Source: National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia Large banks Medium-size banks Small-size banks During the period of restructuring the banks, foreign bank groups (mainly from Greece, Slovenia, Austria, Turkey and Bulgaria) acquired the majority share in the equity capital of the banks. Foreign investors participate with 60% in the total equity capital of the banks (47.5% in the total assets).

In 2003, pursuant to the Law on Micro-finance Banks (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 61/2002), ProCredit Bank AD Skopje was established. Several international financial institutions for development support and micro-finance appear as shareholders in the Bank:    EBRD - European Bank for Reconstruction and Development;   IFC - International Financial Corporation;   IMI - International Micro Investitionen AG;   FMO - Nederlandshe Financierings Maatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden N.V;  KfW Bank. Competition, market discipline and transparency are constantly promoted. The banks are obliged to publish their annual and semi-annual financial statements. Thereby, the banks constantly publish data on the operations on their websites. Competition is evident in three domains: gradual reduction of the interest margins (see more details in 44HII_VI_B_3), permanent offer of new products and orientation of the banks towards the clients and aggressive promotion and marketing campaign. However, the competition in the banking industry did not lead to mergers and takeovers of banks. Regarding the group of large banks, as well as banks with foreign strategic investors, is evident the trend of investments in new banking technologies and access to know-how of the parent banks for development of new banking products. The banking market in the Republic of Macedonia is relatively small and concentrated. The concentration of the financial potential and the banking services offered by the top banks, not only that draws historical roots from the early establishment of the banking system in the previous stage, but it’s a result of the lack of foreign banks present on the market today. At the moment, there are not any significant indications for any concerns regarding the stability of the banking system because of the size of the market share that the two big banks have. This is important, especially if one takes into considerations the stability of both financial institutions, where in one of the banks the international banking group NBG (National Bank of Greece) is founder, and in the other the EBRD is the major shareholder.  From the point of view of market competition and price creation of the banking service, and at the same time taking into consideration the concentration, the offer of financial services and the financial potential the banks possess, there are theoretical possibilities for creating a probable oligopolistic position on the market. On the other hand, the fragmented offer of financial services and relatively high criteria for granting credits, introduced by the larger banking subject present on the market, in circumstances of relatively low credit demand and other financial services from the solvency clients that can fulfill the criteria established by these banks, unables the creation of pre-conditions for such position on the market.  Market discipline, transparency and strict supervisory standards are in line with preventing the creation of monopolistic market structures. Along with the efficient corporate governance, they permanently strengthen the risk management and promote the reputation and stability of the leading banks and of the banking industry as a whole.  

3. What is the average interest rate spread (lending/deposit rates in domestic and foreign currency respectively) in banking over recent years? Please supply data on the profitability of banks during recent years and comment on developments. 
The Table and the Chart below show the movements of the interest rate spreads between credits and deposits expressed in MKD. Financial instruments denominated in domestic currency account for 44% of total assets of the banks. Average interest rate spreads (difference between average ponder interest rates of MKD credits, with maturity to one year and average ponder interest rates of MKD deposits with maturity of three months) of the MKD denominated financial instruments, up to 2003, were kept unchanged. The same were at high level, reflecting the influence of several limiting factors. They were significantly reduced in 2004. At the end of June 2004, interest rate spreads of MKD funds were reduced to 6,1%, from 8% at the end of 2003. Decline of the MKD interest rate spreads in the first half of 2004 was due to higher competitiveness in the banking sector, completion of the process of operational restructuring of banks and reduction of the share of interest-free and low-interest-bearing assets expressed in foreign currency in total assets, whose share at the end of 2003 was 45%.  Important factors that have contributed in maintaining high interest spreads are the following: (1) low level of bank savings, (2) restructuring of real sector in the economy, with reduction of number of quality investment projects, (3) prudent policy of banks, with inherited and acquired bad credit portfolio, (4) restructuring and consolidation of banks, determining additional time for adoption of new credit policies and procedures, (6) inadequate legal frame, in the sense of enforcement of collateral, (7) uncertainty from the post-transitional period as well as from several non-economic external shocks.

From the point of view of foreign exchange interest rates spreads, methodology is in the process of preparation, which will generate consistent inputs for their calculation.

Thereby, data on 2002 and 2003 (in both Tables below) do not incorporate data  for one bank, which, in January 2003, was under conservatorship, and bankruptcy procedure was initiated against it in March 2004.

Thereby, the effects from the operational restructuring of banks were aggravated by the effects from the internal conflict in 2001.  From the tables given above, one can see that the banking system in 2001 had an operating loss. This loss was as a result of the safety crises in 2001, which resulted with a significant deterioration of payments of due claim, i.e. the quality of the credit portfolios. The deteriorated quality of the credit portfolios contributed towards significant increase in the necessary amount of the special reserve for the credit risk that absorbed the existing frail revenues.  The lower profitability indicators presented through indicators of restitution of resources and equity in high interest rates surroundings, are result of the relatively high degree of credit risk in the banks portfolios, the high participation of the low interest placements in the total assets of the banking sector and the high operational inefficiency of the banks. The relativly hihg level of credit risk in the banks protfolios, continiously imposes the need for allocation of additional reserves for credit risk , as a revenue burden.  The high level of non-interest and low-interest placements in the total assets of the banking system has an effect on the total quantum of interest revenues that the banks realize on their assets. At the end of 2003, these placements participated with ,aprohimately,  45% of the total assets of the banking system. The high operational ineficiency is expressed through the sum of net assets of the banking system per employee, who by the end of 2003 were MKD 22,8 million, while financial results per employee for the same period were MKD 0,098 million. By the end of 2003, from the total number of employees in the banking system, more then 50% are emploied in the two largest banks.  Operational restructuring of the banks in this period was mainly expressed through qualitatively changes in the industry: efficient risk management policies, higher competition, launching new products, sound banking practices, introduction of new IT, greater efficiency etc. Thereby, banks became capable to respond to all challenges, which will accordingly be reflected (is already reflecting) in their profitability as well in the coming years.   
4. What is the average maturity of bank loans to the private sector over recent years? What is the share of loans with maturity of up to one year? 
Within the monetary statistics, maturity of credits is monitored according to the contractual maturity.  Thus, distinction is made only between short-term credits (maturity period up to one year) and long-term credits (maturity period longer than one year).  Thereby, when calculations are being made, the private sector does not include the central government, the extra-budgetary funds and the non-residents. Analysis of maturity structure of the credits extended to the private sector shows stronger orientation of banks in the last two years toward extending long term credits.   Table: Maturity structure of credits to the private sector (share in the total credits in %, monthly average for the year) Description 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 first half of 2004 Short-term credits  62 66 69 70 63 59 Long-term credits  38 34 31 30 37 41 Source: National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia Data processed by: National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia Thereby, the positive trend of increasing the share of long term credits compared to the short-term credits  refers to  both: the credits to the enterprise sector and the credits to the citizens (whereby, it is more evident at the citizens sector).

Pursuant to this Decision, the National Bank monitors the residual maturity structure and the expected maturity structure of the assets and liabilities of the banks, broken down by separate balance positions. Monitoring the residual and the expected maturity structure and the results from analyses to be carried out on the basis of collected data should result in defining prudent limits for liquidity risk management within the legal framework during the next several years.  
5. What is the degree of euroisation/dollarisation of both assets and liabilities of the banking system? Please provide data on foreign currency denominated and foreign currency indexed deposits/loans. Are banks taking specific measures to hedge against currency risk? 
Euroisation of the Macedonian economy and of the financial system is extensive. The share of foreign currency liabilities in the total liabilities of the banks at the end of June 2004 was 59%. Thereby, the share of foreign currency deposits in the total deposits of banks was 52,92%, of which 70% is share of euro deposits in the total foreign currency deposits. Currency structure of banks assets is similar. Foreign currency assets participate with 55,89% in the total assets, whereby the share of foreign currency denominated credits (foreign currency credits and credits with foreign currency clause) in the total credits is 39,24%. Like in the case of deposits, the leading currency used in credits is the euro.  The Table below shows the data for the period from 1999 to 30.06.2004, including data on the level of euroisation of the banking system in the Republic of Macedonia.

Thus, the open foreign currency (long) position by separate currency can amount to 20% of the guarantee capital at the most, except for the open foreign currency position of the euro, which can be up to 30% of the guarantee capital at the most. The open (short) foreign currency position by separate currency, like the open aggregate short foreign currency position, can show negative value of 10% of the guarantee capital of the bank. At the same time, the open aggregate (long) foreign currency position can amount to 50% of the guarantee capital of the bank at the most. Thus, the introduced quantitative restrictions provide partial prevention of larger foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Protection against foreign exchange risk forces the banks to have balanced foreign currency positions.  In the first half of 2004, banks had long total aggregate open foreign currency position. The long foreign currency position, compared to the total aggregated guarantee capital, amounts to 50,6%, while the long exposure to the euro, as the most dominant currency, compared to the aggregate guarantee capital, amounts to 38,8%. Thereby, when calculating the open foreign currency position, euro-denominated government bonds are also taken into consideration, owned by the banks as a result of their financial restructuring (conversion of part of the non-performing loans into euro-denominated government bonds).  Taking into account the insufficiently developed financial market and the absence of futures and options, the efficient management of open foreign currency position, i.e. balancing the foreign currency assets and foreign currency liabilities, is the only strategy enabling efficient foreign currency risk management.  
6. How do you assess the stability of the banking sector? What is the current situation concerning bad loans of banks(Please indicate the accounting rules concerning bad loans.)? Please provide an estimate of non-performing loans in state owned and in private banks (as an absolute amount, as a % of total assets, Please indicate the accounting rules concerning non-performing loans..) What has been the development over the past few years? Do you see an effect of the past rapid credit growth on the average quality of the loan portfolio? 
In general, the banking system can be evaluated as a stable. This statement can be supported by several indicators for performance of the banking system, such as the capital adequacy ratio, share of liquid assets in the total assets of the banking system, coverage of short-term liabilities with liquid assets, as well as the participation of non-performing loans and potential losses for credit risk in total credit exposure.  The average Capital adequacy ratio of the banking system as of 30.06.2004 is 25,7%, which is more than three-times higher compared to the minimum prescribed capital adequacy. At the same time, it points out to the low level of credit activity of banks in the past period and the high potential for more intensive credit expansion in the coming period.  The banking system shows relatively high liquidity, which is result of the efficient liquidity risk management of the banks. Despite the maturity transformation of the assets by banks, liquidity is constantly maintained within the prudential banking standards.  Thus, the average share of highly-liquid assets in the total assets of the banking system is around 45%, which has negative implications on the banks’ profitability. The largest parts of the liquid assets are kept as short-term deposits at the foreign banks, bearing low interest or being interest free. Another indicator, also showing the high banking system liquidity is the coverage of sight deposits and the short-term deposits with liquid assets. At the end of the first half of 2004, this indicator was 65%.  Maturity transformation carried out by the banks from short-term deposits into long-term loans in the course of 2003 and the first six months of 2004 resulted in residual maturity gap between assets and sources of funds on very short term (up to 7 days). Maturity gap in the first maturity period (with 7-day maturity period) is overcome in a period of over 12 months. Cumulative residual maturity gap between assets and sources of funds in the shortest maturity period up to 7 days, as of 30.06.2004 was negative and amounted to MKD 22,8 billion. The level of coverage of sight deposits up to 7 days with liquid assets with residual maturity up to 7 days is 47,4%.  However, incorporation of short-term deposits being permanently kept with the banks results in matching maturity of both the assets and the liabilities on short term.  Comparative analysis per bank shows that the achieved residual maturity gap of the assets and the sources of funds of the banks is determined by the two largest banks and partly by the group of medium-size banks. Despite this, the group of medium-size banks achieves matching maturity in all maturity periods.  The Republic of Macedonia, unlike most of the countries in transition, which faced banking crises in the second half of the 90s, managed to avoid systemic banking crisis. The situation was similar in the years when the country was affected by sever non-economic shocks - the Kosovo crisis in 1999 and the crisis caused by the internal conflict in 2001.   Pursuant to the Decision on Determining the Methodology for Classification of Active Balance and Off-Balance Sheet Positions of the Banks According to Their Risk Level (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 21/2002 – cleared version), classification of credits and loans of the banks according to their risk level is carried out in five risk categories. The methodology for classification of bank claims incorporates the basic Basel standards on banking supervision. However, certain adjustments are necessary, in order to be fully harmonized with the international accounting standards (especially with the international accounting standard 39 – at the moment, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia applies much stricter criteria than IAS 39). The operational restructuring of banks, strengthened banking supervision, greater market discipline and transparency, resulted in permanent reduction of the share of non-performing loans in the total loans of the banks. Thus, the share of non-performing credits of 33, 7% at the end of 2001 was reduced to 15, 1% at the end of 2003. Credit exposure, subject to classification by banks, in terms of the provisions referred to in item 4 of the Decision on Determining the Methodology for Classification of Active Balance and Off-Balance Sheet Positions of the Banks According to Their Risk Level (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 21/2002 – cleared version) covers the following:   Active balance sheet claims on the basis of: due and undue short-term and long-term credits, non-performing claims, claims from the Republic of Macedonia and the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, paid guarantees, letters of credit, securities and other balance sheet claims occurred on the basis of bank off-balance sheet exposure, other due claims, calculated interest, fees, commissions, deposits at domestic and foreign banks, investments in securities, capital investments at domestic and foreign banks and other legal entities, as well as other claims that can be distributed per individual debtors;   Active off-balance sheet positions on the basis of: issued uncovered guarantees, opened uncovered letters of credit, securities, bank acceptances, uncovered performance guarantees, and other forms of off-balance sheet positions, constituting contingent liability of the bank.  In the first half of 2004, total credit exposure classified under risk categories C, D and E was 13,8% of the total credit exposure of the banking system, and 13,96% of the total assets of the banking system. Although credit risk exposure has relatively high share in the credit portfolios of the banks, if compared to the net value of credit risk exposure, meaning reduced by the amount of the provisions for potential losses for credit risk covered by the bank’s profit with the aggregate guarantee capital at the level of the banking system, an indicator of 28,6% is obtained. This indicator also shows that even in the worst-case scenario, i.e. conversion of all risk credits, classified as C, D and E, into losses, the guarantee capital of the Macedonian banks will be able to absorb the losses and the solvency of the banking system as a whole will not be affected severely.  In the first half of 2004, total identified potential losses on the basis of credit risk amounted to 10, 1% of the total credit exposure of the banking system. Accounting rules on the basis of which non-performing claims are registered are contained in the Decision on Determining the Methodology for Classification of Active Balance Sheet and Off-Balance Sheet Positions of the Banks According to Their Risk Level (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 21/2002 – consolidated version) and the Instruction on Implementation of the Decision on Determining the Methodology for Classification of Active Balance Sheet and Off-Balance Sheet Positions of the Banks According to Their Risk Level (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 65/2004 – consolidated version). Pursuant to item 15 of the aforementioned Decision, all credits classified in risk categories D and E or credits at which the interest has not been paid over 90 days after the day it falls due, the bank is obliged to record (together with the principal of the loan that refers to the client) the credits in a special account, as non-performing credits, while the interest is recorded in the account for non-performing interest. Credit of a client can be excluded from the category of non-performing credits only if all due claims under that credits are collected.  The Table below shows information on the movements of non-performing loans classified under risk categories C, D and E, as well as on the non-performing loans classified under risk categories D and E in absolute amounts and as a percentage of the total assets of the banks in the Republic of Macedonia in the period from 1999 to 30.06.2004. In addition to the data on the overall banking system, the data in the Table are also broken down depending on the ownership structure, as follows: banks in domestic private ownership, state-owned banks, and banks owned by foreign residents.

Total credit exposure of this bank under the risk categories C, D and E on 30.06.2004 was 7,19% of the total assets.  In the period from 1999 to June 2004, there was a constant rise in the total credit exposure of the banks, being most evident in the period from 31.12.2001 to 30.06.2002. This rise in credit exposure was mostly result of the change in the methodology of classification of active balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions, according to which the scope of the term “total credit exposure of the banks” was expanded. However, even when excluding the effect of the changed methodology, the conclusion of permanent (slight) growth of total credit exposure is still valid. Contrary to that, the identified potential losses for credit risk, together with potential losses for country risk, declined in the same period. Thus, indicator of the ratio between the potential losses and the total credit exposure of 22, 5% at the end of 1999 was reduced to 10, 3% at the end of 2003. In the first half of 2004, total credit exposure of the banks recorded upward trend of 5, 7% compared to end-2003. During this period, claims classified under the risk categories C, D and E declined by 3,2%, while the performing claims classified under the risk categories A and B increased by 7,2%.

7. What specific measures have been taken in order to limit the creation of new bad loans and improve the evaluation of credit risk? Are proper standards in relation to the recognition of bad debts and provisioning in place? 
Credit operations and investments of banks, as well as the prudential supervisory standards related to operations of the banks are regulated in item 3 in Chapter III, named “Supervisory standards”, in Articles 34 to 39 of the Banking Law (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 63/2000, 37/2002, 51/2003, 85/2003).  They are more precisely elaborated in many bylaws of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia and instructions for their application, regulating in more detail the credit activity of banks, assessment of the credit risk, manner of determining the credit exposure, standards for determining related entities, manner of determining and setting credit exposure limits. In addition, there are specific instructions regarding designing the credit policies and procedures and the type and contents of the documents that should contain the credit files. The above-stated is regulated by the following bylaws of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia:   Decision on Determining the Methodology for Classification of Active Balance Sheet and Off-Balance Sheet Positions of the Banks According to Their Risk Level (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 21/2002 – cleared version);   Decision on the Amount and the Manner of Setting Special   Provisions for Potential losses of the Banks (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 50/2001);   Decision on the Supervisory Standards for Regulating Outstanding Claims of the Banks (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 19/2003);   Decision on Defining the Manner of Determining the  Related Entities pursuant to the Banking Law (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 28/2001);   Decision on Credit Exposure Limits of the Banks (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 1/2004 – consolidated version);   Decision on the Methodology for Determining the Net Debtors to the Banks (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 28/2001);      Decision on the Terms and Conditions and the Manner of Concluding Foreign Exchange Credit Operations between Residents (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 66/2002); and   Instructions on Keeping Credit Files, No. 2869 dated 4.09.2001 and No. 2479 dated 16.07.2003.  All the aforementioned legal provisions, and bylaws and instructions for their implementation, are  directed to limit the occurrence of risky investments, as well as to limit undertaking excessive  credit risk of banks, by defining and introducing high prudential standards and narrow exposure limits, to the  highest standards possible.   The banks in the Republic of Macedonia are obliged to classify the active balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions into groups according to their risk level, as well as to estimate the amount of the contingent losses that can occur at these positions.  When making assessment of credit risk of a client, the bank is obliged to take the following into account:   Assessment of the financial situation and the outlook of the client;   Assessment of the probability to use funds in line with the agreed purpose, i.e. whether future cash inflows of the client, by volume and dynamics, will enable him/her to respond in the agreed manner of repayment of the credit liabilities;    Assessment of the type and value of the collateral;   Assessment of the credit background of the client;   Status, economic and financial situation of the client;   Credit exposure of the client to the banks in the Republic of Macedonia by conducting checks in the Central Credit Registry kept at the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia.  According to the above-stated criteria, the banks in the Republic of Macedonia classify the clients under five risk categories – A, B, C, D and E, whereby clients with the lowest credit risk are classified under category A, and clients, i.e. credit exposure being 100% loss for the bank are classified under category E. Regarding the five-level system for classification of credit exposure, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia has determined appropriate rules for setting special reserves for identified potential credit losses, which amount 0% or 2% for A risk category, 10% for B, 25% for C, 50% for D and 100% for E risk category, respectively.  The banks inform the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia on the quality of the portfolios on quarterly basis. The NBRM has stipulated detailed rules which are referring to: the extension of the deadline of the maturity period of the demand, the restriction of the credit claims (capitalization of the interest), crediting the payment  of previously approved credits, the method, the procedure and the conditions that need to be fulfilled in order to write off the credit claim.  The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia has stipulated, with a special bylaw, the manner of defining and the rules of determining the  related entities pursuant to the provisions in the Banking Law. Pursuant to this bylaw,  related entities are defined as entities being a single credit risk to the banks, since one of them, directly or indirectly, controls the other entity or several other entities. It also defines the business connection among the entities, the criteria to be met for an entity to be considered as an entity  related to the bank, the meaning of “control”, and the manner of their determination and reporting to the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia. The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia,  in order to limit  the level of credit risk that the banks can  undertake by investing funds at a client or group of  related clients, defined a matrix for credit exposure limits  for banks.  For this purpose, the following limits are set:   Credit exposure towards single client cannot exceed 25% of the guarantee capital of the bank;   Credit exposure towards single shareholder of the bank, holder of  voting shares,  that exceed 5% of the total number of  voting shares, and entities related  to it,  can not exceed 10%  of the guarantee capital of the bank;   Credit exposure towards single company in which the bank has participation in the share capital  and entities related  to it shall not exceed 10% of the guarantee capital of the bank;   Credit exposure towards internal persons and entities  related to  them shall not exceed 3% of the guarantee capital of the bank;   Total amount of the credit exposure towards the entities stated in the previous three indents  shall not exceed the guarantee capital of the bank;    Large credit exposure towards single entity is an exposure equal to or higher than 10% of the guarantee capital of the bank, while the total amount of  Large  exposure shall not be higher than eight-times the amount of the guarantee capital of the bank (800% of the guarantee capital);    In addition, corrective measures are also envisaged, to be undertaken towards the bank or its management, defined in the provisions in Chapter X , named “Measure to Improve the Conditions of a Bank” in the Banking Law (Articles 85 through 99), if the management bodies of the bank fail to adhere to the previously stated legal acts and bylaws (for instance: to prohibit any increase of the credit exposure to borrowers classified under risk categories C, D, and E; impose measures to improve the bank’s procedures for collection of overdue claims towards the bank; prohibit the bank to extend credits and other forms of credit exposure to affiliated entities, except in cases when they are collateralised by securities issued or guaranteed by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia or the countries of the European Union, which are kept by an individual third party – a deposit institution, and the market value of which at all times exceeds 125% of the total amount of the credit, or other form of credit exposure; limiting the growth of investments). Since 1998, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia  is compiling a credit registry, containing data on the credit exposure of all banks in the Republic of Macedonia towards all business entities (domestic or foreign). This credit registry is updated on quarterly basis and is an important instrument when evaluating the credit risk, which, apart from the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, is actively used by the commercial banks as well, when evaluating the credit risk of their clients. The functioning of the credit registry within the NBRM is regulated by Act 10 and Act 41-a in the Law for National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 3/2002, 51/2003, 85/2003 and 40/2004) and the Decision for the content and the manner in which the registry will function (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 61/2004).The credit registry is in a process of updating with data from other registries in the Republic of Macedonia, thus increasing the frequency of updating the data and including information on the credit exposure of the physical persons as well. 
8. What developments have taken place in bankruptcy legislation and what plans are envisaged? Could the authorities also comment on the practice as well as the legal framework? How easily can banks mobilise their claims through such proceedings? 
1. Legislation 
The Bankruptcy Law (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 55/1997, 53/2000, 20/2002 and 17/2004) regulates the objectives of bankruptcy procedure, the reasons for initiating bankruptcy procedure, the conducting of bankruptcy procedure, the legal consequences from initiating bankruptcy procedure, settlement of creditors’ claims, as well as other issues of relevance to bankruptcy procedure, stipulated by the Law. As it could be observed, the Bankruptcy Law was amended three times in order to promote legal solutions enabling larger concentration of procedural actions in bankruptcy procedure, as well as actions undertaken in relation to bankruptcy procedure. For the purpose of strengthening the legal safety in the legal traffic, the deadline, after the expiry of which the debtor is deemed unable to make payments, was shortened; the deadline within which the Bankruptcy Council is obliged to reach a decision upon the proposal for initiating bankruptcy procedure was limited; the deadlines within which undertaking certain procedural actions in the bankruptcy procedure is mandatory were set; the legal framework regarding the terms and conditions to be met by the physical person, i.e. legal entity for acquiring licence to perform activities of bankruptcy trustee were extended; the right, the powers and the responsibilities of the bankruptcy trustee in the procedure were extended; more favourable legal possibilities for continuation of work of the bankruptcy debtor and the implementation of the reorganization plan were created; legal framework for the contents of the reorganization plan was designed; solutions for determining the manner of sale of property from the bankruptcy estate and the solutions for settlement of creditors’ claims were improved, as well as the schedule for settlement of creditors’ claims on the basis of claims related to pension and disability insurance; and other provisions of relevance to the bankruptcy procedure were envisaged. Despite improvement of the legal solutions in the Bankruptcy Law, number of weakness have been identified in the Law, as  a result of which the bankruptcy procedure is slow and the bankruptcy creditors are unable to collect their claims. On the other hand, legal and economically unfavourable conditions are prolonging for both the bankruptcy debtor himself and the employees at the bankruptcy debtor. Due to all this, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia started the preparation of new Bankruptcy Law, which will ensure fast and efficient bankruptcy procedure in which the creditors, without any delays, will be able to collect their claims. Inter-ministerial working group, comprising representatives from the line ministries, representatives from the judiciary, scientific circles and foreign consultants works on the preparation of the new Bankruptcy Law. Pursuant to the European Partnership Action Plan, the adoption of the new Bankruptcy Law is envisaged for the second half of 2005.  In parallel with the commencement of activities related to the new legal solutions, additional observations are done regarding the solutions that failed to show the expected results in the existing Law and are obstacle to the fast and efficient conducting of the bankruptcy procedure. Accordingly, the new legal solutions will revise the competencies and the composition of the court in the bankruptcy procedure, depending on the value of bankruptcy, the solutions in terms of the manner of organization of the creditors in the bankruptcy procedure for the purpose of collecting their claims, realizing the procedural actions and other activities undertaken for that purpose; competencies and organization of bankruptcy trustees, the legal possibilities for reorganization in the operations of the bankruptcy debtor, and the deadlines, the separate stage and the remedies in the bankruptcy procedure will be re-evaluated.  The new Bankruptcy Law will incorporate solutions aimed at further implementation of the European Union regulations in the field of bankruptcy.  The existing legislation makes no distinction between banks and other creditors in terms of exercising their rights as bankruptcy creditors and mobilization of their claims via bankruptcy procedure. Accordingly, everything that is stated above regarding the general bankruptcy procedure also applies in the cases when the banks appear as bankruptcy creditors. In practice, the banks do not see the bankruptcy as an instrument to protect or collect their claims. It is mainly determined by the fact that bank claims are usually collateralized, and the banks do not see the bankruptcy as process to collect the unsecured claims (except in the cases when it is a matter of bankruptcy of banks, when the banks appear with uncollateralized inter-banking claims). Due to this, the main interest of banks in the bankruptcy procedure is the functioning of property title rights in terms of the set collateral. Experience of the banks shows that the property title right is efficiently applied in general, and the banks can efficiently collect their claims, although sometimes there are complaints on their side.  9. Are there particular areas of difficulty in banking supervision? What is the degree of independence of the supervisory authorities and how has this changed in recent years? How efficient is co-ordination of supervisory authorities and institutions? 
During its ten years operation, the banking supervision has been experiencing continuous development, both from the aspect of methods and techniques applied, and from the aspect of additional staffing and training of professional staff. One of the problems the banking supervision faces is the absence of legal possibility to revoke the prior issued consent for qualified holding in the bank capital by a shareholder that suffered significant changes regarding solvency and maintenance of fit-and-proper criteria. The Banking Law (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 63/2000, 37/2002, 51/2003 and 85/2003) stipulates a series of fit-and-proper criteria the fulfilment of which is a condition for issuance of prior approval for qualified holding in the bank capital, however, it lacks provisions giving authority to the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia to revoke the prior issued approval for qualified holding in the bank capital by shareholder that suffered significant changes in these terms. The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia and the Ministry of Finance prepare coordinated activities with the competent institutions in the country that would enable this problem to be solved.   Another major problem the banking supervision faces when performing its function is the following of applicative banking technology, taking into account that banking is one of the sectors where latest technologies arrive first. Although in 2003 the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia began activities for regulation of security of banking information services with the adoption of the Decision on Defining Standards for Preparation and Implementation of Banking System Security (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 77/2003), still, there are important activities in terms of regulating and actively implementing IT supervision, coupled by lack of professional staff that would regularly perform IT supervision of banks.  The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia is responsible for the supervision over the application of anti-money laundering measures and activities by banks and savings houses. An appropriate training of personnel in banking supervision is underway, and more comprehensive methodology on the manner and procedures for performing this type of supervision is under preparation.  The experience with regard to implementation of bank receivership in practice outlined significant problems and ambiguities in the legal solution on the manner of implementation of bank receivership in the Banking Law.  This hinders, even disables, the implementation and full realization of bank receivership and bank rehabilitation procedures. The fundamental problem arises from the absence of legal mechanism that should prevent any obstruction to bank rehabilitation by the existing shareholders. In this respect, legal basis should be provided for implementation of assets sale mechanism, or for placing part of the bank assets under receivership, a mechanism yet unknown in the Macedonian practice. According to the Law on the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 3/2002, 51/2003, 85/2003 and 40/2004), the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia is an independent and autonomous institution in the performance of the functions assigned to it under this and other laws. The supervisory function of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia is carried out by separate organizational section not falling within any of the departments, but is rather reporting directly to the management, i.e. to the Governor of the National Bank.  According to the regulations, the Governor reports on his/her operations, including the performance of the supervisory function, to the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia. On the basis of the evaluation of the degree of harmonization of the banking supervision of the National Bank with the 25 Basel Principles for Effective Banking Supervision, made by the joint IMF/World Bank team in 1999, recommendation was given for establishment of direct line of reporting and accountability between the Banking Supervision Department and the Governor, representing the National Bank, as the single institution competent for supervision of banks and savings houses. The expert IMF/World Bank team concluded that the fulfilment of this recommendation would enhance the independence of the Banking Supervision Department, and at the same time, place responsibility for implementation of the supervisory function. The organizational structure of the National Bank and positioning the banking supervision under direct responsibility of the Governor enables full harmonization with the Basel Core Principle No.1 which also reflects the best international practices and experience for effective banking supervision. This conclusion was confirmed in 2003 in the IMF/World Bank joint FSAP Mission report. Pursuant to Article 38, paragraph 1, of the Law on National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia can exchange information with national supervisory bodies, as well as with bodies from other countries, regarding the supervision of internationally active banks. So far, the National Bank has signed memorandum of cooperation regarding the performance of supervisory function with the central banks of the following countries: Republic of Slovenia, Republic of Bulgaria and the Russian Federation. Within the performance of the supervisory function, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia successfully cooperates with the Securities Commission and the Money Laundering Prevention Directorate. With respect to this, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia is undergoing procedure for signing memorandum of cooperation with the Securities Commission of the Republic of Macedonia, and memorandums of cooperation are planned to be signed with other supervisory bodies, such as the Ministry of Finance (Money Laundering Prevention Directorate, Directorate for Supervision of Insurance Companies and the State Foreign Exchange Inspectorate) and the Pension Supervisory Agency.  The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, via special organizational section, carries out supervision over the foreign exchange operations of banks and exchange operations of exchange offices, as well as indirect supervision of other residents, according to the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations. Banking Supervision Department closely coordinates its activities and exchanges data on banking supervision with this organizational section.  Pursuant to Article 44 of the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 34/2001, 49/2001, 103/2001, 54/2002 and 51/2003), supervisory bodies competent for its implementation, are obliged to cooperate and exchange all information and data regarding supervision performance. Previously (mid-1990s), certain parts of the legislation lacked preciseness and caused dilemmas with regard to the actual competence of certain supervisory bodies related to certain issues (for example, collecting deposits by legal entities without banking license), as well as problems regarding their efficient coordination. These dilemmas were resolved with a series of legal amendments and modifications, which precisely placed the responsibilities of the supervisory bodies and other government bodies, thus significantly enhancing the efficiency of coordination.

1. Please indicate the principal legislation adopted in this area and its implementation. 
The Securities Law was adopted by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia on 26.07. 2000 and it was published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia, No. 63/2000. This Law stipulates the types of securities, the conditions and the manner of issuance, trading and registering, definition and settlement of transactions with securities, the manner and the conditions for establishment and operations of the long-term securities market and the Central Securities Depositary, as well as the status and the competences of the Securities and Exchange Commission. After the adoption of the basic text of the Securities Law several modifications and amendments were made (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 63/2000, 103/2000, 3420/01, 4/2002, 37/2002, 31/2003 and 85/2003). (See 45H11_Annex_16)  There is an ongoing procedure for adoption of new Securities Law which, in accordance with the Operational Program of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, is envisaged to be adopted in March 2005. The Law on Taking Over Joint-Stock Companies was adopted by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia on 16.01.2002 and it was published in the “Official Gazette of RM” No. 4/2002. This Law stipulates the manner and conditions for purchasing shares of an issuing joint-stock company by a legal entity or a natural person that acquired or intends to acquire more than 25% of the securities with voting rights of that joint-stock company. After the adoption of the basic text of the Law on Taking Over Joint-Stock Companies one modification and amendment were made and published in the “Official Gazette of RM” No. 37/2002. The Law on Investment Funds was adopted by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia on 4.02.2000 and it was published in the “Official Gazette of RM” No. 9/2000. This Law stipulates the conditions for establishing investment funds and investment funds management companies and the manner of their operations, the selection of depository bank (custodian bank) and the control of their operations. On 30.04.2004 the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, adopted the Company Law (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 28/2004) and it is fully harmonized with the European legislation. The following bylaws of the Company Law are in adoption procedure:   Rulebook on Trade Registry and the Manner of Entry into the Trade Registry. This Rulebook regulates the following: keeping the trade registry in hard copy and in electronic form, the manner of entry, the format, the content and the number of forms for entry into the trade registry and for the electronic entries, the connection with the Central Registry for keeping the trade registry by the Central Registry in electronic form and on the implementation of the one-stop-shop system; and    The Rulebook on the Procedure for Implementation of the One-Stop-Shop System, which stipulates the manner and the procedure for provision of data stipulated under the Company Law and other laws, which the Central Registry of the Republic of Macedonia provides via its IT infrastructure, on behalf and for the account of the entities registered in the trade registry. Regarding the implementation of the legal framework regulating the capital market, see the next question, (46HII_VI_C_2). 
2. How developed is the equity market? Does it provide, in practice, an alternative source of finance for enterprises? How much was raised on the market in recent years? Please provide data on a) market capitalisation (total and by categories of companies) b) number of listed shares and volume of trading c) development of the general share price index d) holding of foreign investors. 
The capital market in the Republic of Macedonia has noted significant growth since its establishment, and this trend is expected to continue for the future period.  Source: Ministry of Finance Source: Ministry of Finance In the period 1999-2003, according to data from the Securities Commission, there were 128 new issues of securities in the Republic of Macedonia, with a total approved value of EUR 270 million. The percentage of actual realization of these issues is EUR 232 million (86%). The trend of further development arises from the fact that the total number of issues and their total value refer to issues for additional capitalization of banks and to private investments for known buyers for the purpose of consolidation of ownership in the joint-stock companies. Thereby, out of 128 issues in the period under observation 71 issues (i.e. 55,5%) were made by banks, savings houses, brokerage firms and other institutions on the securities market, while the remaining 57 issues are made by join-stock companies, all of which have been realized as investments for known buyers. In the past period of the functioning of the securities market in the Republic of Macedonia it  is noted that the underwriting and payment of securities on the primary market were carried out exclusively in the headquarters of the issuing joint-stock companies, while non of the public offers were realized via the stock-exchange, an investment bank or a bank syndicate (as underwriters of the new issue). The amount of new issues of shares proves that the capital market in Macedonia is not yet a significant alternative source of financing of enterprises, since enterprises mostly use bank credits as sources of funds. According to the data of the Securities Commission for the last five years the degree of funds mobilization on the capital market was as follows: YEAR TURNOVER (000 MKD) 1996 34.798 1997 1.101.987 1998 4.764.168 1999 1.552.771 2000 7.780.523 2001 28.800.112 2002 5.743.416 2003 7.559.802 01.01 – 30.09. 2004 4.787.077

3. What percentage of business is carried out outside the stock exchange? Is the Over The Counter market regulated?  
At present the overall trading with securities in the Republic of Macedonia is centralised and is carried out through the only institutionalised and organised securities market - the Macedonian Long-Term Securities Stock Exchange.  Since beginning of the trading on Macedonian Stock Exchange (28.03.1996) until 15.09.2004, the overall turnover on the stock exchange amounted to USD 1.015.853.035. The JSC Macedonian Stock Exchange was established in September 1995 and it began operating in March 1996. The 1997 Law on Issuance and Trading in Securities, besides the additional clarification of the conditions for establishing a long-term securities stock exchange in the Republic of Macedonia (establishment of multiple stock markets is not an excluded option), envisaged the establishment of “over-the-counter market”, thereby stipulating that the Securities Commission would adopt special rules governing its manner of organization and operations. At the same time, the transitional provisions of this Law introduced an obligation for mandatory trading in all securities in the Republic of Macedonia on the Stock Exchange, listed or unlisted. This concept continued with the 2000 Securities Law (currently in force). The provision introducing mandatory trading on the Stock Exchange has been extended several times, bearing in mind the conclusion that such centralisation and transparency in securities trading is exceptionally positive in the present phase of development of the securities market for the market setting of securities prices. The Securities Commission has not yet adopted the envisaged rules of organization and operations of the “over-the-counter market”, due to the fact that in the past period the market participants have not raised any initiative for this segment on the Macedonian securities market.  The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, as the money market regulator, is currently focused on stimulating the securities trading. To that end, rules on trading and settlement in treasury bills on the OTC markets have been prepared, and are envisaged to begin being applied early 2005. In the new Securities Law, scheduled to be adopted in 2005, it is envisaged to enable trading in securities in the Republic of Macedonia exclusively on the organized securities market – the authorised stock-exchange. Hence, a broader definition of an authorized stock - exchange is proposed, envisaging certain centralised alternative of the “over-the-counter market” as one of the trading modalities. According to the provisions envisaged in the new Law, the Securities Commission will continue to have the obligation to prepare special Rulebook that would regulate the OTC market. 
4. To what extent did choices on the early methods of privatisation of state owned companies affect the development of the stock market? Are flotations on the market being considered in the future? Given the growth of institutional investors, do limitations on certain investment in real estate and prudential rules on investment in securities of one issuer, etc. mean that the assets of funds are channelled into government bonds?  
The overall assessment of the initial model of privatization in the Republic of Macedonia could be that it was not largely favourable for the development of the national securities market.  The voucher system was not applied in any stage of the privatization process in the country, which resulted in the absence of privatization investment funds, which, in many countries, led to establishment of institutional investors industry. Therefore, today, there are still no active domestic investment funds of any type on the securities market. Furthermore, the privatization, due to a series of objective and subjective factors, was ultimately reduced to privatization dominated by managers and employees, whereby in some companies, the government remained significant (less often dominant) owner for quite long period of time, and foreign portfolio investors have almost not appeared. In the first two years of the privatization, the privatization models were chosen by the companies themselves and the transformation was not carried out via sale of the state/socially-owned capital on the stock-exchange, but via public auction. The shares of the Macedonian joint-stock companies appeared on the stock-exchange later, in the phase subsequent to their transformation/corporatization.   The most significant consequences for the development of the Macedonian securities market arising from such privatization are the following: a) instead of being securities market (led by financial motives), the stock-exchange turned into almost exclusive market for gaining domination in ownership structure of the companies (led by the need for consolidation of ownership); b) privatized companies undergoing the ownership consolidation, as a rule, experienced information asymmetry, i.e. the buyers of shares (most frequently – the managers and employees in the firms) had no interest in disclosing the data on company operations to the public; c) the financing of the operations of the privatised companies was carried out exclusively via the banking sector, by way of extension of credits, rather than with new issues of securities.   With regard to the market flotation, in near future, as planed, one of the models for conducting the process of privatization in the health sector (state pharmacies) will be the capital market i.e. via public auctions on the stock-exchange. The securities market in the Republic of Macedonia still lacks domestic investment funds of any type (open-ended or closed-ended investment funds, privatization investment funds or private pension funds), although the legislation covering the traditional investment funds does exist since 2000.  One of the possible reasons for the absence of institutional investors on the securities market, especially the traditional investment funds, is not the absence of legal possibility to invest in real estate, but rather the relative illiquid securities market, as well as the possibility to invest the resources of the funds in other type of securities for the purpose of diversification of the funds’ portfolios.  Taking into account the mandatory nature of the capital funded pension insurance and the guarantee by the Government for the Pension Funds’ assets, the development of this type of insurance is expected to stimulate the capital market development in Macedonia. The assets of the Pension Funds are to be invested on the basis of the following principles: security of the Pension Funds’ assets, risk diversification of investment and maintenance of adequate liquidity. For more details, see 47HII_VI_E_4In accordance with the aforementioned principles, the investment in real estate is prohibited, except in securities on the basis of mortgages issued by banks having licence obtained from the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia and indirect investment in investment funds. Investments in securities of the same issuer are limited to 10% of the nominal value of an individual security issued by that issuer, except in case of bonds and other securities issued or guaranteed by the Republic of Macedonia, and to 5% of the value of the Pension Fund assets placed in securities and issued by the same non-government entity registered in the Republic of Macedonia or in the EU member states, Japan and the USA, to the end of ensuring sufficient diversification of investments. It is to be expected that such prudential investment rules might channel significant amount of the funds into government bonds. It should be noted that the Ministry of Finance plans to issue new securities, thus increasing the supply and the diversity of government securities on the market.  
5. How developed is the bond market? Who are the main participants in the market and which are main financial instruments used? Are there private issues? Is there a secondary market? Please supply detailed information on the size, activity and structure of the bond market, including average maturity of the most important securities.  
The following data can serve as an indicator of the development of the bond market. Since 2001, 4 issues of government bonds were carried out, where:   One issue of government bonds for the frozen saving deposits of citizens, in total value of EUR 550.000.000 with 10-year maturity period,   Three issues of denationalisation bonds, with 10 years maturity period, in a total value of:  a) First issue – EUR 2.500.000 a) Second issue – EUR 39.500.000 c) Third issue – EUR 47.000.000

Source: Macedonian Stock Exchange Total value of the issues – EUR 639.000.000Participants and instruments - Since no institutional investors exist, main participants on the bond market in the Republic of Macedonia are individual investors, brokerage firms and banks. The instruments on the bond market are shown in the last part of this question, as well as in II_V_11. Private issues: Pursuant to the Securities Law (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 63/2000, 103/2000, 34/2001, 4/2002, 37/2002, 31/2003 and 85/2003), initial (primary), sale of corporate securities can be executed via public offerings, direct sale to known buyer (placement) and auction (bidding). So far 4 private issues of corporate bonds were carried out in the Republic of Macedonia by 3 issuers. Secondary market: there is a secondary bond market in the Republic of Macedonia. Government bonds are traded on the official market on the JSC Macedonian Stock Exchange. According to the purpose of utilization - these are annuity bonds and have various purposes of utilization; the major participants on the bond market are individual investors. Corporate bonds, issued by several companies in the Republic of Macedonia, were not traded on the secondary market until now, since they are convertible into shares and are intended for known buyers.

A. Bonds of the Republic of Macedonia for settlement of claims by citizens on the basis of foreign currency deposits According to the Law on the Manner and the Procedure for Payment of Foreign Currency Deposits of Citizens Guaranteed by the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 38/2000, 108/2000, 4/2002 and 42/2003), the Republic of Macedonia issued bonds for payment of the foreign currency deposits of the citizens. The total value of the bonds is EUR 550 million. The principal and the interest are paid semi-annually, on 01.04 and 01.10. The repayment period is 10 years. The repayment of the first installment of the principal and interest began in 2001, and the last installment is due on 01.10.2011. The interest rate is 2% annually. The citizens can use the foreign currency deposit bonds for purchase and repayment of government property, redemption of claims of the Asset Management Agency (which ceased operating in April 2004 and the competences of which were assumed by the Ministry of Finance), payment of concession fee and for purchase and lease of government property. 
B. Bonds for settlement of liabilities on the basis of denationalization (I, II and III issue). 
Pursuant to the Law on Issuance of Denationalization Bonds by the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 37/2002), the Republic of Macedonia should carry out 6 issues of denationalization bonds within the next 6 years. Until 3.0.04.2004, 3 issues of denationalization bonds were carried out as follows: 1)  In June 2002 the Republic of Macedonia issued the First issue of denationalization bonds in the total value of EUR 2,1 million. This issue covered all denationalisation decisions that came into effect until 31.12.2001, and which provided for giving bonds as compensation. The principal and the interest are paid in 10 annual instalments. The repayment of the first instalment of the principal and interest began on 01.06.2003, and the last instalment is due on 01.06.2012. The bonds bear 2% annual interest.  2)  In January 2003 the Republic of Macedonia issued the Second issue of denationalization bonds in the total value of EUR 39,5 million. This issue covered all denationalisation decisions that came into effect until 31.12.2002, and which provided for giving bonds as compensation. The principal and the interest are paid in 10 annual instalments. The repayment of the first instalment of the principal and interest began on 01.06.2004, and the last instalment is due on 01.06.2013. The bonds bear 2% annual interest. 3)  In January 2004 the Republic of Macedonia issued the Third issue of denationalization bonds in the total value of EUR 47 million. This issue covered all denationalisation decisions that came into effect until 31.12.2003, and which provided for giving bonds as compensation. The principal and the interest are paid in 10 annual instalments. The repayment of the first instalment of the principal and interest will begin on 01.06.2005, and the last instalment is due on 01.06.2014. The bonds bear 2% annual interest.  The citizens can use the denationalization bonds for purchase and repayment of government property, for redemption of claims of the Asset Management Agency (which ceased operating in April 2004 and the competences of which were assumed by the Ministry of Finance), for payment of concession fee and for purchase and lease of government property. Since these bonds are issued for settling certain liabilities of the state, their features do not match the need of potential investors (long maturity periods, above all). Small part of these securities is relatively liquid on the secondary market (the Macedonian Stock Exchange) and their trading is stimulated by the government via granting certain favourable opportunities.  Taking into account the positive experience with the issues of the three-month treasury bills (since January 2004), as well as the major interest of the investors to invest their money in this risk-free financial instrument, the payment of which is guaranteed by the government, introduction of long-term treasury bills in the first half of 2005 is envisaged. 
2. Secondary bond market  
The volume of bonds traded on the secondary market is presented below:   In 2000, bonds in total value of around EUR 4 million were traded on the secondary bond market of the Macedonian Stock Exchange;   In 2001, the turnover reached total value of EUR 15,97 million;   In 2002, total turnover of EUR 11,56 million was realized (transactions in government bonds)   In 2003, the total turnover of bond trading on the official market of the Macedonian Stock Exchange was around EUR 33 million. 
6. As regards the regulatory and supervisory framework, is there a Law on the Securities Market? If so, what are the main features of the law? Is supervision now considered to be satisfactory? As in banking (above), what steps are planned to address potential problems of co-operation between supervisors on a consolidated basis? 
The Securities Law was adopted by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia on 26.07.2000, and it was published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia, No. 63/2000. After the adoption of the basic text of the Securities Law, several modifications and amendments were made and published (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 63/2000, 103/2000, 34/2001, 4/2002, 37/2002, 31/2003 and 85/2003). (see 48H11_Annex_16
Main features of the Securities Law (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 63/2000, 103/2000, 34/2001, 4/2002,  37/2002, 31/2003 and 85/2003) are the following: 
  Full dematerialization of securities by introduction of electronic entry as dematerialized form of records   Introduction of Central Securities Depository, established as central database incorporating electronic data (entries) regarding issued securities, rights arising thereof and the holders of rights. The Central Securities Depository also determines and settles the liabilities on the basis of transactions and keeps registers of securities.   Brokerage firms and banks being authorized participants on the Macedonian Stock Exchange can perform long-term securities trading operations after they acquire adequate approval from the Securities Commission of the Republic of Macedonia (SC).          One of the novelties in the Law is the introduction of capital-based authorizations of brokerage firms when performing certain activities stipulated under the Law. The Law envisages placing connection between the capital and the activities for which that firm is registered. Thus, depending on the activity of the brokerage firm, the capital amounts to EUR 75.000, 150.000 or 500.000, and the level of liquid capital, i.e. liquid assets, depending on the activity the brokerage firm performs, must be EUR 15.000, 30.000 or 50.000. The brokerage firm is obliged to maintain the value of the capital in any period of its operation.   The Assembly of Republic of Macedonia appoints and discharges the members of the Securities Commission. The Securities Commission has a status of a legal entity and is independent and autonomous institution, carrying out regulation and control over all participants when trading in long-term securities on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia. The Securities Commission has six members and a President, and their term of office is seven years, with right to a second term.   Strengthening the independence of the Securities Commission.   Introduction of Register of Joint-Stock Companies managed at the Securities Commission, including companies that issued securities via public offering after their establishment, or that have more than 100 shareholders and capital exceeding EUR 1.000.000.   Obligation for mandatory listing of securities on the JSC Macedonian Stock Exchange, for the shareholding companies entered in the Register of the SC, and are in compliance with the listing conditions, with a remark that this legal obligation for mandatory listing applies until 31.12.2004.   Until 31.12.2004, the trading in the issued securities not registered on the official markets on the Stock Exchange was carried out on the unofficial market of the Stock Exchange, bearing in mind that over-the-counter trading has not begun in the Republic of Macedonia. There is an ongoing procedure for adoption of new Securities Law, which will incorporate the respective European Directives, as well as the IOSCO principles. The Securities Commission (SC), successfully deals with all anomalies and irregularities occurring on the capital market.  Article 157 of the Securities Law stipulates that the SC is independent and autonomous organization, responsible for implementation of the Securities Law, the Law on Investment Funds and the Law on Taking Over Joint-Stock Companies and all by-laws adopted on the basis of these laws. The SC regulates and controls all participants in long-term securities trading on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia. Within its legal competences and powers the SC is responsible for lawful and efficient operations of the long-term securities market and for protection of the investors rights to the end of continuous raising of public confidence in the institutions on the long-term securities market in the Republic of Macedonia. Within its legal competencies the SC carries out regular and special controls, full and partial controls, on-site (i.e. direct) and off-site (i.e. indirect) controls. Twice a year the SC carries out full direct control of the operations of the participants in the long-term securities market (long-term securities market, central securities depository, brokers, brokerage firms and banks in the area of securities operations). At the same time the SC indirectly and directly controls the operations of the participants in the long-term securities market, as well as of the joint-stock companies – securities issuers. In case the control discloses irregularities and illegal activities in the long-term securities operations, the SC passes a decision on elimination of the disclosed irregularities within specified period. Should they not be eliminated, the SC is authorized by law to pass a decision on temporary suspension of the operations of the stock exchange, the central securities depository, the broker, the brokerage firm, i.e. the bank in the area of securities operations, as well as a decision on revoking the licence, temporarily or permanently. The SC is authorized to undertake other measures, regulated under Article 103, Article 121, Article 122, Article 124, Article 126 and Article 151 of the Securities Law, for carrying out the fundamental functions of the SC, stipulated under Article 163 of the Securities Law. To the end of avoiding potential problems in the cooperation between the supervisors on consolidated basis, one of the basic functions of the SC, defined in the Securities Law, is to cooperate with other institutions in the Republic of Macedonia and abroad via exchanging information, etc.  In terms of the cooperation with national supervisors, upon an initiative by the SC, activity was commenced for signing of Memorandum for Co-operation with the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia. The commenced procedure for signing of Memorandum of Co-operation is being finalized and it is expected to be signed soon. On international level, the SC has signed six bilateral Memoranda of cooperation with the capital market regulators in the following countries:  Republic of Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republic of Bulgaria, Republic of Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro and Romania. The Securities Commission of the Republic of Macedonia is a full member of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSO) since 1994. 
D. Money market 

1. How developed is the market for short-term financial instruments? Who are the main participants in the market and which are the main financial instruments used? Is there a secondary market? Please supply detailed information on the size, activity and structure of the money market. 
Dominant segment on the money market in the Republic of Macedonia is the inter-bank short-term deposits trading. Deposit trading is carried out between banks, directly and via the institutionalized money market. Most frequent in this segment of the money market are transactions with one-day maturity. They accounted for 68% of the total turnover in the first nine months of 2004. The average daily inter-bank value of trading for the first nine months of 2004 was MKD 92 million, 50% of which were realized outside the institutionalized money market, i.e. on bilateral basis.  Trading in short-term securities, as a segment on the money market in the Republic of Macedonia, is in the initial stage of development. Central bank bills issued by the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia and the treasury bills issued by the Ministry of Finance fall within the group of short-term securities issued on continuous basis in the Republic of Macedonia. Central bank bills are short-term, dematerialized and negotiable securities of the National Bank, sold at discounted amount in MKD. The registry of holdings in central bank bills is kept at the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia. Central bank bills are sold at auctions, and all banks in the Republic of Macedonia have right to participate. Currently, the frequency of central bank bill auctions is twice a week (Wednesday and Friday), while the maturity period of the central bank bills is 7 and 28 days.  In order to stimulate the trading in central bank bills, rules were prepared covering settlement of transactions in central bank bills concluded at the OTC markets, adhering to the delivery vs. payment principle. However, the short maturity period and the frequent presence of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia on the money markets via the auctions is the cause for small volume of trading in these securities on the secondary market.  As of 2004 the Republic of Macedonia commenced issuing short-term government securities - treasury bills. Treasury bills are short-term, dematerialized (registered in the Central Securities Depository) and negotiable securities issued by the Ministry of Finance, sold at discounted amounts in MKD. Treasury bills are sold on auction, and all banks in the Republic of Macedonia have the right to participate, while other non-banking legal entities and natural persons can participate in the auctions indirectly, via the banks. Currently the frequency of treasury bill auctions is twice a month, while the maturity period of the treasury bills is 3 months.  Non-banking legal entities and natural persons prevail in the ownership structure of the treasury bills (63% of the total value of issued treasury bills as of 3009.2004). Bearing in mind that the primary market of treasury bills in the Republic of Macedonia began operating in early 2004, the total value of the issued treasury bills is low (MKD 2 million or 0,8% of the GDP projected for 2004). Due to that, as well as the high transaction costs of trading in treasury bills on the stock exchange, trading on the secondary market is minimal. In the period January – October 2004, only one transaction of treasury bills, via the Macedonian Stock Exchange,was carried out on the secondary market, which is 0,5% of the total value of issued treasury bills. Thereby, the higher value of issued treasury bills (total value of issued treasury bills is expected to reach 1,6% of GDP by the end of 2005), as well as the planned activities for development of OTC markets are expected to contribute to the revival and the development of the secondary market. The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, as regulator of the money market, is currently focused on stimulation of trading in securities. To that end, rules were prepared covering the trading and settlement of treasury bills on the OTC markets, envisaged to commence applying in early 2005. (The answer to the next question includes more detailed explanation of the development activities with regard to money markets; see 49HII_VI_D_2). 
2. What changes are considered necessary in order to improve market organisation and efficiency? 
The Ministry of Finance undertakes activities for completion of the legal regulation in the area of securities, which would significantly improve the market organization. To the end of efficient operations of the securities market, new Securities Law will be adopted in the first half of 2005, prepared in accordance with the EU Directives and the principles and standards of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). After the adoption of the Law, the enactment of secondary legislation will follow. In parallel with the adoption of the new Securities Law, the Law on Investment Funds will be amended. The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, as the regulator of the money market, is currently focused on finding solutions for stimulation of the segment covering trading in securities on the money market. The activities undertaken by the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia are focused on supporting the development of the treasury bills market, which the Republic of Macedonia began issuing in January 2004. Rules were adopted covering the trading and settlement of treasury bills on the OTC markets, envisaged to commence applying in early 2005. All the organizational and technical preparations for establishment of the system for trading in short-term government securities within the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia have been completed and the system is planned to start operating in January 2005. Special market committee was established for monitoring and development of the money market. The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia and the Ministry of Finance will undertake activities in order to motivate the banks to perform the function of treasury bills market-makers. Also, to the end of increasing the efficiency of the money market, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia will take part in the preparation of General Master Repo Agreement that would become the basis for conclusion of repo transactions. Money market efficiency and transparency is of significant importance to the monetary authorities from the viewpoint of the transmission of monetary policy signals. Due to that, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia is interested in modernizing the manner of trading on the money market via developing competitive market infrastructure that would enable efficient and transparent trading.  
E. Non-bank financial institutions (see also chapter 3 – Free Movement of Services) 

1. Please outline the legal framework concerning insurance companies in place. Are further measures envisaged in this area? 
The legal framework regulating the conditions and the manner of performing operations covering insurance, intermediation and representation in insurance is the Insurance Law (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 35/2001 – consolidated version), the Law on Supervision of Insurance Law on Supervision of Insurance  (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 27/2002, 84/2002, 98/2002 and 33/2004) (see 50H11_Annex_12),  the Law on Contracts and Torts in the part referring to insurance agreements (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 18/2001, 4/2002 and 5/2003) and the Company Law (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 28/2004).  The legal framework regulating the operations of the insurance companies and the insurance brokerage companies is described in details in the answers to the questions in the section of financial services, the insurance sector, (See 51HII_V). In accordance with the Stabilisation and Association Agreement of the Republic of Macedonia with the European Union, the legal framework in the area of insurance will be additionally completed to the end of further and full implementation of European Union Directives and IAIS standards and principles. To that end, the following activities are planned:   modifications and amendments to the Insurance Law for strengthening the supervisory function in the Ministry of Finance, improvement of the risk management measures, strengthening the provisions pertaining to issuance of licenses and approvals to insurance companies, etc;   adoption of new Law on Motor TPL Insurance for implementing the IV Directive of the European Union relating to insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles and improvement of the efficiency of the system of mandatory insurance;    enactment of secondary legislation regulating specific issues related to the operations of insurance companies (solvency requirements, technical requirements, fit-and-proper requirements, etc.).  In accordance with the European Partnership Action Plan these activities are envisaged to be realized during 2005. 
2. What is the authorities' overall assessment of the degree of competition in the sector? 
Currently, on the insurance market in the Republic of Macedonia, there are nine insurance companies having license for performing insurance operations, out of which one insurance company performs non-life insurance and reinsurance activities, one insurance company performs life insurance activities, and the remaining seven perform non-life insurance activities. The table below shows the share of the two largest insurance companies on the insurance market in the Republic of Macedonia with regard to the realized gross insurance premium within the period 1999-2003. Table: Structure (two elements) by realized gross premium 
Domestic 98,0% EU  non-life 98.0% Foreign / Other  Domestic 100% EU  1999 life 100% Foreign / Other  Domestic 97,8% EU  non-life 97.8% Foreign / Other  Domestic 100% EU  2000 life 100% Foreign / Other  Domestic 97,2% EU  non-life 97.2% Foreign / Other  Domestic 100% EU  2001 life 100% Foreign / Other  Domestic 83,0% EU  non-life 83.0% Foreign / Other  Domestic 100% EU  2002 life 100% Foreign / Other  Domestic 78,1% EU  non-life 78.1% Foreign / Other  Domestic 100% EU  2003 life 100% Foreign / Other  Source: Ministry of Finance (on the basis of data from the annual statements of insurance companies) Although the insurance market in the Republic of Macedonia is characterized by small number of insurance companies, nevertheless, with regard to the supply, one could conclude that its structure is well established.  The adoption of the Law on Supervision of InsuranceLaw on Supervision of Insurance  (“Official Gazette of RM” No. 27/2002, 84/2002, 98/2002 and 33/2002) enabled liberalization of the insurance market, thus creating conditions for attracting foreign capital and strengthening the competition. Data in the Table show that the share of the two largest insurance companies on the insurance market with regard to the realized gross insurance premium is in constant decline. There is a clear trend of dispersion of the total gross premium to multiple insurance companies, reflecting the higher degree of market competition.   Entrance of new insurance companies on the insurance market, from the standing point of the service beneficiaries, creates conditions for better choice and higher quality of services and reduction of their price. 
3. What is the situation regarding new financial markets and instruments, for example venture capital companies, factoring, leasing, etc.? Is the legal framework in place for such operations? Please provide any available information on market developments. 
The structure of the financial markets and instruments in the Republic of Macedonia is still insufficiently diversified. Banks and insurance companies dominate the market, offering mainly traditional banking and insurance services. Although authorized, the banks do not engage in financial leasing and factoring. In general non-banking activities such as leasing, factoring, crediting, issuance of guarantees, etc. are regulated by the Law on Contracts and Torts (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 18/2001, 4/2002 and 5/2003) and the Company Law (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 28/2004). These laws do not impose special requirements with regard to establishing and rendering these services.   
Leasing - In 2002 to the end of promoting and stimulating the development of leasing industry a Law on Leasing was adopted (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 4/2002 and 49/2003). The Law regulates only the fundamental principles of leasing and enables freedom in service contracting. Pursuant to Article 3 paragraph 1 of the Law, a lessor can be a company or a subsidiary of foreign company established in accordance with the Company Law. In order to perform financial leasing companies and subsidiaries need to obtain permit from the Ministry of Finance (Article 3 paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of the Law on Leasing). The procedure for acquiring financial leasing permit is simple and fast and is regulated by the Rulebook on the Manner and the Conditions for Acquiring Financial Leasing Permit (“Official Gazette of RM”, No 13/2004).  Pursuant to the Rulebook, an application form is submitted to the Ministry of Finance along with the following documents:   certificate from the court of competent jurisdiction that no measure against the legal entity for prohibition for performing an activity has been imposed;   certificate from the court of competent jurisdiction that no measure against the authorised executive in legal entity for prohibition for performing a profession, an activity or duty has been imposed;   certificate from competent institutions that public fees are regularly paid; and   certificate from the court of competent jurisdiction that no bankruptcy or liquidation procedure has been initiated. The Law provides security to service providers by ensuring collection of claims with a possibility to terminate the agreement and return the object in cases of improper utilization (Article 11 paragraph 5) or bankruptcy of the user (Article 8), as well as through the obligation for compulsory insurance of the object by the user (Article 13). The security of the lessee is provided via the granted possibility to refuse the object subject to leasing in case of failure of delivery or untimely delivery (Article 11 paragraph 3), as well as via the granted obligatory registration of the object being subject to leasing (Article 12). Since the enactment of the Law on Leasing in February 2002, by October 2004 8 requests were submitted for acquiring financial leasing permit in the Republic of Macedonia, and permits were issued in all cases (four permits were issued to companies established by foreign legal entities, three to companies established by domestic and foreign legal entities, and one to a company established by a domestic natural person).   During 2003 and 2004, within the EU-funded Banking Sector Reform Project, the leasing was promoted as new financial product in the Republic of Macedonia.  
Factoring - At present there is no special regulation on factoring. Hence there are no restrictions regarding the performance of this activity, which can be carried out on the basis of contracts concluded in accordance with the general rules on contracts and the special rules on transfer of claims regulated under the Law on Contracts and Torts (“Official Gazette RM”, No. 18/2001, 4/2002 and 5/2003). Pursuant to Article 20 of the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 34/2001, 49/2001, 103/2001, 54/2002, 32/2003 and 51/2003), residents can perform factoring with non-residents. The level of development of the financial instrument factoring, in the Republic of Macedonia, is insufficient. In order to reverse this the Southeast Europe Enterprise Development (SEED) in 2004 carried out a market research, as a result of which, the preparation of a Study on Factoring in the Republic of Macedonia is being finalized, containing recommendations on the activities needed to stimulate the emergence and the development of this instrument.   
Swift money transfer - In 2003 the Law on Performing Services of Swift Money Transfer (“Official Gazette of RM”. No. 77/2003) was enacted. Swift money transfer services can be rendered by companies registered in the Republic of Macedonia in accordance with the Company Law (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 28/2004), which also have to acquire permit from the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia for performing swift money transfer, and by companies – subagents which conclude a contract with a service provider (Article 3 of the Law). The company intending to provide swift money transfer services should mandatorily fulfil the following requirements (Article 6 of the Law):   be registered in the Company Register for performing auxiliary activities of financial intermediation;   to have appropriate business premises, technical equipment and information system;   to provide appropriate protection and security of the financial resources, property and employees;   not to be under bankruptcy or liquidation procedure;   there should be no security prohibition measure for performing a profession, activity or duty imposed against the authorised executive and/or the employees which perform the services of swift money transfer, plus there should be no verdict imposed to them for a criminal act in the area of finances; and   to have authorization in the form of contract from an authorized global system for electronic money transfer. In order to obtain permit an application should be submitted to the National Bank, along with the following documents (Article 7 of the Law):   information confirming the fulfilment of the conditions referred to in Article 6 of the Law (abovementioned);   statutory acts on the manner of operations and money-laundering prevention program;   proof for obtained personal identification number and taxpayer identification number;   company headquarters and address of the place where swift money transfer service will be carried out;   confirmation from a competent institution that it does not have outstanding liabilities on the basis of public fees;   positive opinion on the solvency from the Central Register (for companies operating longer than six months);    data on the identity (place and address of birth, place and address of residence, personal identification number of the citizens and ID number), degree of education and experience of the authorised executive and the employees in the company that will perform the transfer money services;   residence permit and permit to work in the Republic of Macedonia for foreign individuals which will be authorised executives in the swift money transfer service providers or that will perform swift money transfer services;   audit reports for the past two years on the authorized global system for electronic money transfer prepared by internationally recognized audit firm; and    proof that the global system for electronic money transfer with which contract has been concluded is a legal entity performing electronic money transfer in accordance with the regulations in the country of registration and that it operates in at least 100 countries. Before issuing the permit, the National Bank evaluates the fulfilment of the conditions for service provision, as well as the integrity and the reputation of the founders. Since the enacting of the Law one request for obtaining permit for providing swift money transfer service and a permit has been issued thereof.   Future development perspectives The development of the Leasing industry that followed after the adoption of the Law on Leasing proves that the development of new financial markets and instruments can be stimulated by establishing special legal framework. Hence, during 2005 an analysis on interest of potential providers and users of certain financial services and products is envisaged, after which adoption of regulation on financial companies and services will follow. Thereby, services covered in Annex II of Directive 2000/12/C will especially be taken into account. The analysis, as well as all activities arising thereof, are expected to be realized with support from experts, preferably from EU. 
4. Please provide information on the establishment of the two-pillar pension system. What are the main challenges for its development? What are the next steps of the authorities to tackle these challenges? 
The Law on Modifications and Amendments to the Law on Pension and Disability Insurance (“Official Gazette of RM”, No. 24/2000) is the legal framework which defines the concept of the pension system reform for establishing a three-pillar pension system in the Republic of Macedonia.  The modifications and amendments of the Law on Pension and Disability Insurance undertaken in 2000 led to reforms of the first pension system pillar (or the unique pillar in the previous pay-as-you-go system), with the goal to reduce the costs of the pension system, and to put the bases of a capital funded pension insurance.  For regulating the operations of the second pension system pillar, the Law on Mandatory Capital Funded Pension Insurance (“Official Gazette of RM", No. 29/2002, 85/2003 and 40/2004) was adopted in April 2002. The fundamental objectives planned to be achieved with the reform are the following:   to secure the exercise of rights to pension and disability insurance,   to ensure short- and long-term solvency of the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund of the Republic of Macedonia,   to enable maximum security with a minimal risk,   to guarantee just pensions for all generations,   to strengthen the public confidence in the pension system through the achievement of the other objectives.    The establishment and maintenance of a three-pillar pension system in the Republic of Macedonia, being a combined system of public, pay-as-you-go and capital funded pension system, are expected to create gains and advantages for individuals, for the overall pension system and for the economy.  From individuals’ point of view, this system allows for greater security since pensions will be financed from two, i.e. three sources. Inherent risks of each system (pillar) will be diversified; hence the combined pension system will ensure offsetting of risks and achieving greater degree of security. Also, the introduction of individual accounts and through investing the funds accumulated on them will create greater revenues for the period after retirement. Transparency in the operations of such type of pension system is an important feature, since individuals will, at any time, know the amount of funds available on his/her account, the instruments in which his/her assets are invested and the profit earned from such investment. From the overall pension system point of view, the existence of several pillars enables having long-term solvency of the pension system, which is a goal of each country in designing the social policy. By reducing the scope of the state (public) pension system through the introduction of a capital funded system, the liabilities of the state system will be reduced on the long run, which will lead to reduction of budget expenditures (transfer payments from the Budget) for pensions. Unlike the pay-as-you-go pension scheme which does not stimulate savings of the population on the account of generations’ solidarity, a capital funded pension scheme influences the increase of national savings in medium and long run. It will also be an instrument for developing the financial market and increasing investments that will affect the growth of the economy.  Main challenges for the development of the two-pillar pension system The reform of the administration which administers the existing Pension and Disability Insurance Fund of the Republic of Macedonia is especially important for successful implementation of the pension system reform. During the last two years such reform have been intensively implemented, tackling in particular the implementation of the new single collection procedure function and the control and distribution of contributions to state-owned and the (future) private pension funds. During the preparation of the pension system reform the Government of the Republic of Macedonia assessed the possible risks (challenges) of the introduction of the multi-pillar pension system and  envisaqed ways to deal with them. They comprise of the following:  1. Dimensioning and carrying transition from the old to the new system:     development of actuarial models with assistance from foreign consultants and assessment of the transition costs;   careful planning and testing before the beginning of the implementation;   Macedonian model of the reform is a gradual model without stimulating entrance of huge number of employees in the system   development of market for government securities; 2. Tackling the lack of instruments in which the private pension funds can invest through:   provided possibility to invest 20% of private pension funds resources abroad;   ensuring the possibility for additional restrictions on investments by pension funds in accordance with the Law on Mandatory Capital Funded Pension Insurance which can be introduced by the Agency for Supervision of Fully Funded Pension Insurance in the first five years;   undertaking analyses of the domestic market and drafting recommendations for its development by engaging experts;   securing bank deposits, earmarked government bonds, operation of the domestic securities market and mandatory listing of companies on the Stock Exchange;   development of new government securities, which is undergone;   adoption of a Strategy for development of government securities market along with an Action Plan. In addition to the strategy for development of long-term securities and for successful implementation of the new pension system the Government of the Republic of Macedonia will issue long-term government bonds, which are of huge importance for establishing the second pension system pillar.  3. Ensuring quality of the pension fund management companies through:   announcement of international tender for awarding two licenses for management with pension funds;   implementation of a pre-qualification procedure with strict conditions to eliminate unqualified bidders;   creating strong on-site and off-site supervision for timely identification and resolution of problems;   strict legal regulation and by-laws to preven misuse; 4. Building efficient and specialized Agency for Supervision of Fully Funded Pension Insurance through:   undertaking staff training (supported by the World Bank and USAID);   selecting a trained director with experience in the field;   creating a high-quality IT system for off-site supervision and a network connection with the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund, pension fund custodian and other relevant institutions;   securing an adequate budget and salaries for the authorised executives in the Agency. 5. Tackling the possibility of incomplete collection of contributions through:   reorganization and improving the management in the existing Pension and Disability Insurance Fund;   securing monthly collection and adjustment of data and contributions;   continuous checking and adjustment to databases of other government institutions;   connecting the contribution databases;   strengthening the functions of the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund in the collection of contributions for both pillars; 6. Prevention of bad investments with resources of the pension funds through:   adopting laws and bylaws strictly regulating in what and where to invest;   securing that investments must be made on the basis of principles of security, liquidity and diversification;   making pension funds able to buy securities traded on the official markets;   daily checking of the portfolios by the Agency;   securing that custodian would report on the illegal transactions to the Agency;   securing that the custodian is independent from the pension fund management companies. 7. Better information and education of the public regarding the new system through:   broad public information and education campaign;   focus on the persons who can and the ones who must join;   giving impartial advise regarding the decision on entrance in the system and selection of pension fund;   application of computer software, call-centres and information centres; 8. Overcoming possible unethical conduct of sales agents through:   securing that agents obtain licenses after passing a specialized exam;   creating strict marketing regulations which prohibit unethical conduct;   securing that marketing and advertising materials of companies must be approved by the Agency prior to being distributed;   prohibiting promises of yield, as well as advertising future revenues. 9. Preventing the possibility that members lose their resources in case of bankruptcy of a pension fund management companies or of the property custodian, through:    securing that the resources of the pension fund are separated from the resources of the pension fund management company;   securing that the resources of the Fund are placed for safekeeping to the custodian bank;   securing that the resources of the pension fund cannot be subject to claims by creditors of the pension company;   securing strictly regulated restrictions of investments with regard to securities, issuer, etc. Only few selected banks can “accept” investments by the Funds;   making investment abroad possible only in cases of obtained investment rating or in case of investment in securities issued by governments or central banks of the USA, EU member states and Japan 10. Building public confidence in the new system through:   transparent and regulated tender for licensing pension fund management companies, with strict criteria;   legal separation and protection of pension fund resources;   strict control of the marketing activities of the pension fund management companies;   impartial advises by the Government;   building strong regulatory and supervisory agency;   strict control of investments on daily basis;   regular reporting on the balances of individual accounts to the members;   important role of the Fund, institution that has credibility wiht the public.  
Observed preconditions for development of the two-pillar pension system 1. Fostering economic development accompanied by job creation. Focus on real sector of the national economy that should enter dynamic development cycle, increasing the production capacities and stimulating job creation.  2. Stimulating real salaries growth Salaries growth means enrichment of the pension and disablement insurance contribution base, which results in increase in the inflow of resources to the Funds. 3. System improvement i.e. digitalization of the contribution recording and payment system. Electronic records of pension insurance contributions leads to increase of efficiency, but also towards control of the contribution collection. 4. Stimulating the capital market development, especially development of long-term government securities market. Increasing the supply of high-quality financial instruments, especially long-term government securities with fixed return, contributes to building higher-quality portfolio of funds. 5. Promotion of the Agency for Supervision of Fully Funded Pension Insurance into high-quality regulatory and supervisory body on the market. Efficiency and development of multi-pillar pension system and the Funds will depend on the manner of implementation of the laws and bylaws, as well as on the supervision carried out by the Agency.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU's Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) launched excessive deficit procedures Tuesday (July 13th) against Bulgaria and Cyprus, as recommended by the European Commission. This is a consequence of Bulgaria's general government budget deficit exceeding the 3%-of-GDP benchmark threshold. It was 3.9% of GDP in 2009. The Council urged the government to take corrective measures by January 2011 and bring the deficit to within the acceptable threshold by the end of next year. As for Cyprus, the ECOFIN gave the government an extra year, until 2012, to slash the deficit to within the 3% limit. Cypriot authorities say the deficit reached 6.1% in 2009.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Parliamentary House of Representatives approved the candidacy of Borislav Paravac as the Serb member of the tripartite presidency on Wednesday (9 April). The nationalist Serb Democratic Party nominated him to fill the position left vacant by last week's resignation of Mirko Sarovic, over the so-called Orao affair. Next, Paravac's nomination will be considered by the BiH House of Peoples. If approved, he says economic reforms will be his priority.
In other news Wednesday, the BiH State Border Service acknowledged that security at borders and airports has been tightened. Officials say two events propelled the move: the assassination of late Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic and the crisis in Iraq.

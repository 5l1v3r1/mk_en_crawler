NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council has decided to send a fact-finding mission to Pristina and Belgrade this month, Russia's envoy to the UN said on Friday (April 13th). Vitaly Churkin added that the Council has agreed to make a comprehensive review of Kosovo's progress since the 1999 conflict. Belgium's UN Ambassador Johan Verbeke is expected to lead the mission to the Balkans. Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica praised the move, insisting it would represent the "first and important step in launching a new negotiation process".
In other news Friday, Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer said in an interview with Reuters that the international community should find a solution to the Kosovo issue that would not humiliate Serbia. He said his office is holding talks with President Boris Tadic on ways to implement key elements of the plan for Kosovo drafted by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, in a way that would allow Serbs and ethnic Albanians to "emerge from the situation holding their heads high". 
In Kosovo meanwhile, local police have arrested seven ethnic Albanians in connection with a failed attempt to assassinate Anton Berisha, the chief of the province's telecommunications company. Three of the suspects were picked up immediately after the attack on Thursday that left a police officer critically injured.

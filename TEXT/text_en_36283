SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Former Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski announced on Friday (28 May) he would withdraw as honorary chairman of the country's main opposition party, VMRO-DPMNE. His decision came after a recent escalation of his conflict with the new party leader, Nikola Gruevski. Georgievski has criticised Gruevski for being preoccupied with internal party reshuffles, rather than focusing on VMRO-DPMNE's rivalry with the ruling SDSM.

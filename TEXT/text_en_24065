ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ali Babacan said on Saturday (January 17th) that Turkey does not intend to break its diplomatic ties with Israel, despite sharp criticism against the Israeli offensive in Gaza. "We believe that it is important for the communication channels to remain open," Babacan said. However, he admitted that Turkey's tone has changed in its communications with Israel. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has described the Israeli offensive as an act of barbarism.
Elsewhere in the Balkans, there were demonstrations Saturday against the offensive. In Sarajevo, hundreds of prominent members of BiH's cultural elite took part in a rally, including movie director Jasmila Zbanic. In Athens meanwhile, the two biggest trade unions in Greece organised a rally calling for an end to the Israeli military strikes.
Hamas militants declared a conditional ceasefire Sunday, in response to the unilateral one declared by Israel. (BBC - 18/01/09; Anadolu news agency, Hurriyet, AFP, Nafthemporiki - 17/01/09)

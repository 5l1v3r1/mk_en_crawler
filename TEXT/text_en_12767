NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on Friday (3 June) appointed Kai Eide, Norway's ambassador to NATO, to conduct a review that will determine whether talks on Kosovo's final status should begin. The diplomat will examine the province's efforts to meet an international set of standards in such areas as human rights, security, law and democracy. Eide is considered an expert on the Balkans and has served as a UN envoy to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Also Friday, UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen said status talks for Kosovo would likely begin in September. (Reuters, UN Web site, FoNet, B92 - 03/06/05)

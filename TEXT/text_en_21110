ANKARA, Turkey -- Former chief of the Turkish General Staff General Hilmi Ozkok said on Wednesday (August 1st) that any decision on launching military operations in northern Iraq depends on the government. Ozkok said that while he has his own opinion, all views must be taken into account. Turkey claims Kurdistan Workers Party terrorists are using bases in northern Iraq to stage attacks in Turkey.
Ozkok also reiterated Turkey's position that Iraq's integrity must be preserved. "An Iraq torn into pieces may serve someone's interests, but it would be very dangerous to the security and flourishing of the region," the general said.

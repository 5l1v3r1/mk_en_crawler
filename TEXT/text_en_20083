SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EU and European Commission officials issued a joint statement Monday (March 17th), urging parliament to choose the path that leads to Euro-Atlantic integration. They also asked parliament's joint Defence and Security Committee to reverse its recent rejection of two police reform measures. Police restructuring is key to signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. Special Representative Miroslav Lajcak, along with the head of the European Commission's delegation to BiH, Dimitris Kourkoulas, and the head of the EU Police Mission in BiH, Brigadier General Vincenzo Coppola, signed the statement, ahead of debate in the full parliament Tuesday.

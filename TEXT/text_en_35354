LISBON, Portugal -- In the European Championship on Wednesday (16 June), Greece held Spain to an impressive 1-1 draw. Jubilant coach Otto Rehhagel said his team is now a step away from playing in the next stage of the tournament. Greece's final match in the first round is against a dispirited Russia, which lost to Portugal on Wednesday and has no chance of qualifying for the next round.

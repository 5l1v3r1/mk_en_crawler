TIRANA, Albania -- At the request of the government, the OECD has agreed to conduct a study on minimising the country's informal economy. Albania's Economy Ministry announced on Wednesday (13 August) that researchers would first determine the scale of the informal economy, and then suggest possible solutions. Previous studies estimated the size of illegal economic activity at between 40 per cent and 60 per cent of Albania's GDP. (ATA - 13/08/03)

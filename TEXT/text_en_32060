BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- The Yugoslav Constitutional Court ruled Wednesday (16 October) that 45 deputies from Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) should be allowed to return to the Serbian Parliament. They were expelled in July after leaving the ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia coalition. Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic dismissed the ruling, saying the federal court had no jurisdiction over the republic's affairs. He insisted that only the Constitutional Court of Serbia should rule on the issue. That ruling is expected Thursday. Kostunica responded by threatening a major crisis if DSS deputies are not allowed to return to parliament. (AP, AFP, Tanjug, B92 - 16/10/02)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A UN Security Council session whose agenda included Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's report on Kosovo and EULEX's deployment saw another postponement on Tuesday (November 11th). The Council gave no reason and did not announce another date. Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic was supposed to take part in the meeting and reiterate Serbia's stance, namely, that it would support Ban's six-point report as long as it complies with Belgrade's conditions for reconfiguring the international presence in Kosovo. Serbian authorities insist that EULEX should not apply former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for the supervised independence of Kosovo. They also want the mission to be neutral and to have a mandate approved by the Security Council. Kosovo authorities have problems with Ban's report as well, saying on Monday that parts of it are unacceptable to Pristina.
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner weighed in on Monday, urging Kosovo's leaders to accept all six points of the proposal. Following a meeting of EU foreign ministers, Kouchner, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency, emphasised that EULEX is intended for the good of all Kosovo's citizens. Separately Monday, EULEX commander Yves de Kermabon said the mission is critical to the success of the democratic state.

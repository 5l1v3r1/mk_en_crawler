VIENNA, Austria -- The first set of talks on the rights and protection of national minorities in Kosovo were held in Vienna between delegations from Belgrade and Pristina on Tuesday (8 August). They ended without progress. Hua Jiang, spokesperson for UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari, says that while the Kosovo team offered concrete proposals, the Serbian team did not. Bernhard Shlagek, a representative of Ahtisaari's office who served as chairman of the meeting, said Serbia instead insisted that minority rights must be tackled within the framework of concrete talks on Kosovo's future status. 
While Belgrade's delegation participated in the session, Kosovo Serb representatives did not. They objected to being termed a "minority", insisting they are part of the Serbian nation. Shlagek said the boycott was a missed opportunity. (Glas javnosti, Blic, Danas - 09/08/06; Beta, Tanjug, KosovaLive - 08/08/06)

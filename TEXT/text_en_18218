SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Delegations representing BiH and the European Commission (EC) met on Thursday (December 14th) in Sarajevo for the final round of technical negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA). BiH's chief negotiator with the EU, Igor Davidovic, says just a few technical issues remain. But the formal final round of SAA talks will be postponed until BiH meets all political criteria, including police reforms, restructuring the public broadcasting sector and the establishment of a single economic space. 
Also Thursday, the leaders of BiH, Montenegro and Serbia went to NATO headquarters in Brussels where they signed the official framework document for accession to the Alliance's Partnership for Peace programme. The three countries were invited to join last month. 
In other news, Serbian President Boris Tadic and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice spoke by phone Wednesday about bilateral ties. Tadic says Rice reaffirmed US support for the Balkan country's further integration into Euro-Atlantic structures and the continuation of dialogue between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians on the future status of Kosovo.

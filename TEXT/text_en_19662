SOFIA, Bulgaria -- An estimated 10,000 people joined a rally organised by Bulgaria's opposition parties Thursday (February 21st) to protest high-level corruption. Demonstrators marched through downtown Sofia and gathered outside parliament. Inside, lawmakers spent eight hours debating a vote of no confidence against the cabinet. It was filed by the opposition. Analysts say the motion lacks the support it needs for parliamentary approval Friday. (24 Chasa, Trud, Sega - 22/02/08; Mediapool, BNR, bTV - 21/02/08)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The State Census Commission and the Statistical Bureau say the second stage of the national census, this one involving quality control, was successfully completed at the end of last week. Commission Chairman Zoran Krsteski concedes there were problems reported, particularly in western Macedonia, related to politicising the headcount. He said, however, that those issues have been resolved. The census, required under the terms of the Ohrid peace agreement, was conducted from 1 November to 15 November. Results are expected in January. (Vest - 23/11/02; MIA, A1 TV - 22/11/02)

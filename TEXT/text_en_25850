PRISTINA, Kosovo -- As expected, Italian Ambassador to Kosovo Michael Giffoni was named on Friday (October 16th) as the EU's facilitator in northern Kosovo. Giffoni's task will be to co-ordinate EU activities in the Serb-dominated part of Kosovo. A statement issued after Friday's meeting between Giffoni and EU Special Representative Pieter Feith stressed that Giffoni's appointment in no way changes Feith's mandate. It added that opening the office in the north aims to secure the bloc's stable presence in the region. (Makfax, Tanjug, Emportal - 16/10/09)

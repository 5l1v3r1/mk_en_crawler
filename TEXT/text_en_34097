BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Justice Minister Vladan Batic said Sunday (20 July) that the framework of the new draft Serbian Constitution could be ready by the weekend, but only if members of the constitutional commission return early from vacation. Batic, who is also head of the commission, says he opposes a proposal by Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), which would divide the country into six regions to elect the president. He was also critical of the DSS decision not to attend the commission's sessions. (Beta, BBC - 21/07/03)

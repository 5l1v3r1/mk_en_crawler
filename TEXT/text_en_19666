SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The leaders of the four largest political parties in Macedonia failed to agree Thursday (February 21st) on the latest name proposal by Matthew Nimetz, the UN envoy in the dispute with Greece,. The parties asked for more time and plan to meet again on Sunday. Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said that while Macedonia's wish to join NATO is very strong, its name cannot be sacrificed to achieve that goal.
Meanwhile, Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman George Koumoutsakos confirmed that Athens has prepared its response to the Nimetz proposal. In it, the government notes which elements are unacceptable and which are subject to further negotiation. (Makfax, MIA, MRT, ANA-MPA, Naftemporiki - 21/02/08)

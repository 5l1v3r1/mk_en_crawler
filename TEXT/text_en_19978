ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis will make an official two-day visit to Turkey next week, government spokesman Evangelos Antonaros announced on Thursday (January 17th). Karamanlis has made informal trips to Turkey in the past, but this will be the first official visit by a Greek prime minister in almost 50 years. Antonaros stressed it would aim to ease somewhat strained bilateral relations. The two countries have stepped up economic co-operation recently, though serious disagreements remain as far as Cyprus and the disputed Aegean airspace are concerned.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Vice President Joe Biden arrived on Tuesday (May 19th) for an official visit to Sarajevo, the first leg of a Balkans tour that also includes stops in Serbia and Kosovo. The first high-level representative of the new US administration to visit BiH, he will hold talks with the members of the tripartite presidency and other political leaders. He will also address parliament. Accompanying him are EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and High Representative to BiH Valentin Inzko. The goal is to underscore US commitment to the entire region.
Inzko's predecessor, Miroslav Lajcak, weighed in on that to some extent Monday. He called on both Washington and the EU to "re-arrange" their presence in the Western Balkans, to "prevent pockets of ethnic tension and instability from inflaming passions throughout the region". Speaking to foreign-policy experts in Washington, Lajcak warned the situation is marred by widespread stagnation and even deterioration in some areas, "especially in Bosnia, Kosovo and Serbia". He said "Only diplomatic co-operation between the US and the EU can promote democracy and stability in the region." Lajcak left his post in BiH recently to become Slovakia's foreign minister.

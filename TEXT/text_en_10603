TIRANA, Albania -- Officials of the European Commission (EC) and the OSCE stressed Saturday (11 September) that the conduct of free and democratic elections is a major condition of Albania's EU integration. The head of the EC delegation, Lutz Salzman, and the head of the OSCE mission, Osmo Lipponen, spoke during the official presentation of Albania's European Partnership Action Plan. Salzman said next year's elections would test the country's political maturity. Lipponen pledged OSCE and EC support during the elections. 
Albania got more support Friday from Bulgaria. President Georgi Parvanov told his visiting Albanian counterpart, Alfred Moisiu, that Bulgaria is committed to backing Tirana's EU bid. He said Sofia also strongly supports NATO's open-door policy towards Adriatic Charter members, including Albania. (ATA, BTA - 11/09/04; BTA, BNT, ATA - 10/09/04)

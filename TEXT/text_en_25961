ANKARA, Turkey -- A third letter sent to civilian prosecutors in charge of the alleged Ergenekon case is ratcheting up tensions. As details of the letter -- sent last Sunday -- emerged on Tuesday (November 17th), the public learned more about alleged plans to destroy the ruling Justice and Development Party. The unnamed military officer also attached a CD, which included 590 folders of confidential military documents. The letter was sent to President Abdullah Gul, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the main opposition Republican People's Party leader Deniz Baykal and Nationalist Movement Party leader Devlet Bahceli. It is believed that previous letters, sent to the Ergenekon prosecutors in October, were from someone in the military other than the author of this last letter.

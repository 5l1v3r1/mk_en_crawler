STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament voted on Wednesday (27 September) to adopt a non-binding report that criticises Ankara for failing to live up to its promises regarding human rights and other areas. The document says Ankara has made "insufficient progress" regarding freedom of expression, religious and minority rights, women's rights and the rule of law. It also urges Turkey to open its seaports and airports to Cypriot traffic, reduce the 10% election threshold, and enable more parties to serve in parliament, including Kurdish formations. The deputies rejected a clause that would have made Turkey's recognition of the alleged Armenian genocide a condition for EU accession.

I. TERRITORIAL ORGANISATION 

1. What is the relevant territorial organisation of your country and what are your plans to introduce a provisional NUTS classification? 
The territorial organisation of the Republic of Macedonia, pursuant to the Law on the Territorial Organization of the Local Self Government of the Republic of Macedonia, adopted on 11 of August 2004 (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 55/04), is structured in 84 municipalities and the city of Skopje as a separate unit of local self government. This Law regulates the forming, the establishing of the areas of the municipalities and the city of Skopje, the establishing of names, seats, municipality borders, as well as the procedures for joining, separation and change of municipality borders. This law will apply after the local elections, which, pursuant to the amendments of the Law on Local Elections (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 60/04) shall be held on 13 of March 2005. Until the enforcement of this law, the territory of the Republic of Macedonia is structured in 123 municipalities and the city of Skopje as a separate unit of local self government, in accordance with the Law on Territorial Organisation of Republic of Macedonia and Establishing of Regions of the Local Self Government Units (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 49/96). A municipality is a unit of local self government, as a community of residents in a certain area established by law, which, through its bodies, administration and organised public services enables carrying out of competencies prescribed by law. A municipality is established for the area of one or more settlements in which the citizens are connected with mutual needs and interests, area that has conditions for material and social development, as well as for participation of the citizens in the decision-making for the local needs and interests. The area represents a naturally, geographically and economically connected unity, with communication between the settlements, and gravitation towards the centre of municipality. The municipality borders are shaped with the borders of the cadastral municipalities of the settlements composing the municipality. The city of Skopje is a separate unit of local self government in which the mutual needs and interests of the citizens are fullfilled, stemming from the nature of the city of Skopje which is the capital of the Republic of Macedonia established by the Constitution of Republic of Macedonia (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 52/91 and 91/01). The city of Skopje consists of 7 municipalities (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 49/96), and with the new Law on the City of Skopje (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 55/04), it shall consist of 10 municipalities with the same competencies as the other municipalities in the country. The competencies of the municipalities are determined with the Law on Local Self Government (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 5/02). The city of Skopje carries out the matters of public interest significant for the city, and which are not within the competencies of the state administration bodies. The separation of competencies between the municipalities in the city of Skopje and the City of Skopje are determined by the Law on the City of Skopje (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 55/04). The organisation and operation of the bodies of the local self government units (the municipalities), their scope of activities, the monitoring of legality of work of the institutions and their bodies, are regulated by the Law on Local Self Government (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 5/02) and the Law on the City of Skopje (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 55/04).  The establishment of the areas of the municipalities as units of local self government and the area of the city of Skopje as a separate unit of local self government is within the competencies of the Assembly of Republic of Macedonia. The existing municipalities (123) in the Republic of Macedonia are different by their area, the number of inhabitants, the number of settlements, the population density, the national composition, etc. The average size of a municipality in the Republic of Macedonia is 209 square kilometres, with a population of 16.443 and a median population density of 79 inhabitants per square kilometre. According to the size of the territory, 6 municipalities are with an area greater than 500 square kilometres, 8 with an area from 401 to 500 square kilometres, 13 with an area from 301 to 400 square kilometres, 25 with an area from 201 to 300 square kilometres, 34 with an area from 101 to 200 square kilometres, and 37 with an area from 0 to 100 square kilometres. The size of the municipalities, according to the population, is the following: 
Municipalities Number of municipalities Percentage (%) from the total number of municipalities Less than 1.000 citizens 1.001 – 5.000  42 34 5.001 – 10.000 24 20 10.001 – 20.000 26 21 20.001 – 50.000 15 12 50.001 – 100.000 
More than 100.001citizens Source:  Census of population, households and dwellings in the Republic of Macedonia, 2002, Volume Х, State Statistical Office, Skopje, May 2004. Pursuant to the Law on Territorial Organisation of the Republic of Macedonia and Establishing of Local Self Government Units (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 49/96) there are 1.795 settlements in our country. They are distributed unevenly across the municipalities. The municipalities Resen and Stip have the greatest number of settlements – 44, and the municipality of Vevcani has only one settlement within its borders. Most of the municipalities have between 1 and 10 settlements (38,2% of the municipalities in the country) or between 11 and 20 settlements (39,8%).  The city of Skopje consists of 7 municipalities: Gazi Baba, Gorce Petrov, Karpos, Kisela Voda, Centar, Cair and Suto Orizari, with a total of 467.257 inhabitants. The biggest is the municipality of Kisela Voda with the population of 125.379 (it is the biggest municipality in the country as a whole), and the smallest, the municipality of Suto Orizari with a population of 17.357. These municipalities, except for the municipality Centar, apart from parts of the city area, also encompass the villages around them. The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics – NUTS, has been adopted by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia in April 2001, and published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 31/2001, and it was standardised with the EU Regulations of that time. According to this Nomenclature, at NUTS level I and II the whole territory of the country is one unit (politically-administrative unit), there are 8 units at NUTS level III (statistical region, i.e. non-administrative region), 34 units at NUTS level IV (municipalities group – non-administrative unit), and 123 units at NUTS level V (municipality – politically-administrative unit).  The territorial unit at the NUTS level IV (municipalities group) which is not a political-administrative unit encompasses the areas of the municipality as it existed until 1996, and from which new municipalities have been formed.  In the following period, the coordination of the Decision on NUTS (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 31/01) with the Law on Territorial Organisation of the Local Self Government in the Republic of Macedonia (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No.55/04), and the EU Regulation 1059/2003 will be carried out at the local level (NUTS level IV and NUTS level V).

2. How many regions are there in the existing regional breakdown which correspond to the future NUTS level II? 
According to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 52/91 and 91/01), the Law on Local Self Government (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 5/02) and the Law on the Territorial Organization of the Local Self Government of the Republic of Macedonia (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 55/04), there are no regions listed as administrative-territorial units. The existing legal framework does not define any regions corresponding to the NUTS level II. Pursuant to the Decision on Establishing the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics – NUTS (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 31/01), NUTS level II corresponds to NUTS level I which includes the whole of the territory of the Republic of Macedonia.  3. How many regions are there in the existing regional breakdown which correspond to the future NUTS level III? 
There are no administrative-territorial regions in the Republic of Macedonia corresponding to the NUTS level III. Pursuant to the Decision on Establishing the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics – NUTS (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 31/01), eight (8) statistical regions have been established: Pelagonian, Vardar, North-Eastern, South-Western, Skopje, South-Eastern, Polog, and Eastern, which correspond to the future NUTS level III.

4. Do any entities for regional development exist at the regional level at present? 
There are no entities for regional development on the regional level. Pursuant to the Law on Organization and Operation of State Administration Authorities (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 58/00), there is a Bureau for Economically Underdeveloped Areas, as a ministerial body within the Ministry of Local Self Government. The Bureau is an implementer of the measures for support and promotion of the settlements’ development in the economically underdeveloped areas in ways and by criteria stipulated by the Law on Promotion of Economically Underdeveloped Areas (Official Gazette of Republic of Macedonia No. 2/94, 39/99). The economically underdeveloped areas are determined by a decision of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. The Bureau distributes the funds allocated from the budget of the Republic of Macedonia (1% from the budget) and controls their usage according to the procedure stipulated by law (21_II_3e).  Within the ministries (Agriculture, Economy, Transport and Communications) there are departments or agencies which deal with the developing activities of certain economy branches (industries) which are not coordinated with a common institutional framework. The Agency for Promotion of Agricultural Development in the Republic of Macedonia has 6 regional centres (Bitola, Kumanovo, Tetovo, Skopje, Strumica and Stip) and 30 regional units. These centres provide consulting services, monitoring and distribution of budgetary funds for agriculture development. The Entrepreneurship Promotion Agency of Republic of Macedonia (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 60/03) implements the Programme of measures and activities for entrepreneurship support and generating small business competitiveness, as well as the development of the institutional network. In a certain number of municipalities there are structures formed through different projects for promoting of local economic development. These projects are financially and technically supported by international institutions such as the European Commission, UNDP, GTZ, USAID, etc. For example, through the Local Government Reform Project (LGRP) in the Republic of Macedonia, funded by the USAID, 13 Offices for local economic development were formed. These offices will be involved in preparing of the profiles of their municipalities and strategic and action plans for the economic development. Through the PHARE programme, financed by the European Commission, 5 regional centres for support of small and medium sized enterprises were formed (in Skopje, Bitola, Kumanovo, Strumica, and Veles); also, 3 Enterprises Support Agencies (ESA) were opened through the British Know-how Fund in Ohrid, Tetovo and Gostivar. Within Swiss Aid, a regional agency for development of small and medium sized enterprises was formed in the Prilep region (PREDA – Prilep Region Enterprises Development Agency).  The local self government units (municipalities) are responsible for the local economic development. The Law on Local Self-Government provides the opportunity for the local self government units to join their funds and to form joint public services, in order to realise their competencies. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia on 01.11.2004, adopted the Information on the legal and .institutional framework for balanced regional development with a proposed Action Plan which anticipates:   Development of Regional Development Strategy;   Development of a draft Law on Regional development;   Establishment of adequate institutions for implementation of regional development policy at NUTS lll level;   Establishment of institutions for regional development;   Defining criteria for measurement of the development level;   Provision of statistical data on NUTS lll level;   Development of a draft national development plan;   Development of draft regional development plans;   Provision of financial resources for implementation of the regional policy;   Introduction of instruments for support of the development, and   Human resources development. Need for staff for a) central government bodies, and b) regional bodies;   Transformation of the Bureau for Economically Underdeveloped Areas;   Securing financial control over the implementation of the regional policy;   Provision of consistency between the legislation of public procurement, competion, government assistence, environment, and financial control. With the implementation of this action plan, the entities/bearers of the regional development on the national and regional level shall be defined, and assessment for the possibilities of co-financing with the EU funds shall be made.  
5. What type of regions corresponds to the future NUTS level II: political, administrative or other (define)? 
There are no political, administrative or other types of regions corresponding to the NUTS level II in the Republic of Macedonia. Because of the relatively small territorial area of the Republic of Macedonia of 25.713 square km, and the population of 2.022.547, the NUTS level II is identical with NUTS level I (the Republic of Macedonia). In accordance with the Regulation 1059/2003, in the Republic of Macedonia it is possible to introduce 2 regions on NUTS level II (with a minimal population of 800.000). However, the introduction of NUTS level II would not aid realistic and comparative regional statistics because of the disparities of the units that would be a part of them. That is to say, if a NUTS level II region were created, the cumulative indicators for the units in NUTS level III that would be a part of this region would not establish realistic basis for conducting regional policy. On the other hand, the natural, communicational and functional heterogeneous characteristics of the regions in NUTS level III do not allow establishing of NUTS level II, which can appropriately solve certain regional-national problems. 6. What type of regions corresponds to the future NUTS level III: political, administrative or other (define)? 
There are no political, administrative or other types of regions corresponding to the NUTS level III in the Republic of Macedonia (8 statistical regions). The statistical data are not published at this level, but there are personal and technical conditions for their processing. 
7. Do you intend to create a NUTS I level statistical division of your territory according to EC Regulation 1059/2003? 
The statistical division of the territory of our country on NUTS level I is not anticipated with the planned harmonisation of the Decision on Establishing the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics – NUTS (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 31/01) with the EC Regulation 1059/2003. Instead, only a creation of a single unit on the level of the whole country is anticipated. The harmonisations relate to the local levels (NUTS level IV and NUTS level V). 8. At which future NUTS level are representatives elected? a) Do they play a role in the structures in place for regional development? b) In what form? 
The representatives for the representative bodies in the Republic of Macedonia are elected: on a national level; and    on the level of the local self government units (the municipalities and the city of Skopje as a separate local self government unit). On the national level, which corresponds to NUTS level I and level II, the representatives of the Assembly of Republic of Macedonia are elected on general, direct and free elections, with a secret ballot, for a mandate of four years. The procedures and the election pre-conditions are regulated by the Law on Election of Members in the Assembly of Republic of Macedonia (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 42/02, 46/04). On the level of municipalities as local self government units, which corresponds to NUTS level V, the representatives of the Municipal Councils and the mayors are elected on general, direct and free elections, with a secret ballot, for a mandate of four years. The procedures and pre-conditions for election of members of Councils are regulated by the Law on Local Elections (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 45/04 – purified text; 52/04).  On the level of the city of Skopje as an individual unit of local self government which does not correspond to any NUTS level, members of the Council of the City of Skopje, as well as the Mayor of the City of Skopje are elected in general, direct and free elections, with a secret ballot, for a mandate of four years. The procedures and pre–conditions for election of members of the Council of the City of Skopje are regulated with the Law on Local Elections (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 45/04 – purified text; 52/04).  

) The Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, being a representative body of the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, has the legislative power in the country. In the given context, the Assembly, within the scope of its Constitutionally determined obligation to promote more homogeneous spatial and regional development, is obliged to pass a physical plan for the country as a long-term development document which defines the physical organisation of the country and the concepts of physical development of the areas in the individual sectors, as well as the pre-conditions for their implementation. Pursuant to the Law on Local Self Government (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 5/2002) municipalities should be consulted during the procedures for preparing the physical plan of the country in an appropriate and timely manner determined by law. The mechanisms for consultation with the municipalities during the preparation of the physical plan of the country are not yet determined. The Councils of the local self government units, being representative bodies of the citizens, within the scope of their duties determined by law, as: urban and rural planning; local economic development planning; development of their competencies determined by law, are responsible to pass on the plans, determined by the law.  
b) In June 2004 the members of the Assembly have adopt the Physical Plan of the Republic of Macedonia 2004-2020 (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 39/04). The Plan pays special attention to the regional and the inter-regional aspects of development and the reduction of regional disproportions. At the same time, the Law on Implementation of the Physical Plan of the Republic of Macedonia (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 39/04) has been adopted. The law stipulates that the physical plan is implemented with preparation and passing of physical plans of regions, physical plans of areas of special interest, and physical plans of municipalities and the city of Skopje, as well as with urban plans and other documents for planning and organizing, envisaged by law. The new Law on Physical and Urban Planning is being prepared as one of the new laws envisaged with the Operational Programme for Decentralisation of Government 2003-2004, and, among other things, it should regulate the matters relating to the procedures of preparation and adoption of all types of physical and urban plans.  The final form of the structures for regional development and the role of the representatives in the representative bodies on the national level and on the level of the local self government units are not yet determined. However, with the adoption of legislation for balanced regional development, appropriate bodies shall be established, and the competencies of the representatives on different levels in the country shall be defined. 
9. Do municipal governments have their own funding through local taxes? 
Yes, the municipal governments have their own funds through local taxes.  The Law on financing of local self-government (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 61/2004) units regulates the sources of financing the local self-government units and the City of Skopje, which financing is also regulated by the Law on the City of Skopje. The law determines the personal income sources, including local taxes, for which the amount of rates and amount of taxes is prescribed by the municipality council within frameworks regulated by law.  According to the provisions of this law, municipal taxes include property tax, tax for property turnover, and heritage and gift tax, which are also regulated with the Law on Property Taxes that was adopted by the Macedonian Assembly, and is to be applied after the 2005 local elections, i.e. after constitution of the municipality councils. According to the provisions from the same law, municipal taxes include: communal taxes and part of administrative taxes, these laws were adopted by the Macedonian Parliament, and will be applied after the 2005 local elections, i.e. after the constitution of the municipality councils. Law on Communal Fees (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 61/2004) regulates the payment of communal taxes, which are paid for use of certain rights, items or services of local public interest by legal entities and citizens, which perform activities, and by the citizens. The law contains provisions on the subject of taxation, payer of communal taxes, determination of the amount of communal tax, exemption from payment of communal taxes, determination and payment of communal tax, supervision and penalty provisions. Communal fees are the following (except for those identified in the group of the property taxes, and fees for usage and maintenance of public lights): the company name or business premises display fee; camping on public land and other similar temporary usage fee; using sidewalks in front of business premises for conducting business fee; posting advertisements, announcements and ads in public places fee; live music in restaurants fee; having gambling equipment in bars fee; placing display cabinets out of business buildings fee; usage of public spaces designated by the municipality for parking passenger motor vehicles, freight motor vehicles and their trailers, and buses fee that are established by the municipality for this purpose; usage of public squares and other places in cities or other settlements for displaying goods, organizing exhibitions and other entertainment activities for economic purpose fee; usage of streets with passenger, freight motor vehicles, buses, special vehicles and motorcycles fee. Law on Administrative Fees (amendments to the law) (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 61/2004) contains part of the provisions that regulate the payment of administrative taxes for documents and activities in administrative procedures among municipality bodies and bodies of City of Skopje, for act on establishing an activity, act that approves construction/building conditions, act that approves construction of objects, technical review and issuing of an act for putting into operation of building objects. Own funds are also provided with the temporary residence fee (tourist fee), the construction land organisation fee, and urban and physical planning fee. The Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia passed a package of laws: the Law on Financing the Local Self-Government Units (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 61/2004); the Law on Property Taxes (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 61/04); the Law on Communal Fees (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 61/2004); and the Law on Amending the Law on Administrative Fees (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 61/2004), which establish the municipalities’ own funding through local taxes, and which will be enforced after the next local elections in March 2005, i.e. after constituting the municipality councils and the election of mayors.(See 10_I_A_01).  
10. Do municipal governments have a role in: a) Preparing local development strategies and programmes; b) Implementing development strategies and programmes; c) Initiating and selecting projects in the context of government or donor-funded programmes; d) Management and/or monitoring of projects; e) Implementing national employment policies and adapting them to local needs? 
In accordance with the Law on Local Self-Government (LLSG), (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 5/2002), the municipalities independently, and within the law, regulate and carry out the activities of public interest of local importance, determined by the Law on Local Self-Government or other laws and are responsible for the carrying out thereof. The municipalities can collaborate in carrying out their competencies. Further, pursuant to the same Law, the municipalities have own and other funds at their disposal and have the right to manage and operate property, funds and rights. In accordance with Article 22 of LLSG, the municipalities, among other matters, are also competent for the matters relating to the local economic development, and especially for: local economic development planning, establishing of development and structural priorities, management of the local economic policy, supporting the development of small and medium sized enterprises and of the entrepreneurship at the local level, and in the same context in participation in establishing of local network of institutions and agencies, as well as in promotion of partnership.  a) and b) LLSG verifies that within the execution of municipal competencies, the municipal bodies pass and implement a Statute, programmes, plans and other regulations. The municipal administration is responsible for their preparation, with the possibility of engaging external experts and institutions. Further, pursuant to Article 8 of the LLSG, the municipal bodies, the commissions of the Council and the municipal public services, are obliged to inform the citizens, about the plans and the programmes significant for the municipality development, without compensation, and in a manner determined by the municipal Statute. In brief, the legal framework gives the municipal governments possibilities for preparing, adopting and implementing strategies for local development, but on the other hand, also gives them independence in the choice of ways and methodology of approaching that issue, and because of that, the situation in every municipality can be different. This is regulated in details by the municipal governments through their municipal Statutes. An exception from this are situations when, for the purpose of realisation of certain national development plans and strategies, it is possible to oblige the local self-government units by law to prepare appropriate plans for their territory. The most important example for this is the realisation of the Physical plan of the Republic of Macedonia, a governing document with a character of an integral development project, and for which the Law on Implementation of the  Physical Plan of the Republic of Macedonia (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 39/2004), Article 16, obliges the city of Skopje and all the municipalities to coordinate their physical plans with it in a given period, and the municipalities that do not have physical plans to start procedures for their adoption. At the moment there are already a number of municipalities in the Republic of Macedonia that have adopted development strategies and are preparing annual development programmes. Very often, donation funds are used for such activities. In many municipalities, in accordance with their Statutes, special Municipal Council’s Commissions for Development are constituted and are functioning (in some cases they are expanded in their work, the mayor and external experts being involved). Nevertheless, generally speaking, the situation is very diverse, depending on the Statutes and the administrative and financial capacities, and also on the size of the municipalities, which for the time being varies a lot.  c) and d) Although a unified answer to this part of the question is not possible, it can be said that there is a practice in the Republic of Macedonia of distribution of the municipal programmes that are financed by Government funds or by donors to projects that were submitted as initiatives by the municipal governments themselves, according to their own priorities. Depending on the type of the programme (the sector, the goals of the programme, the sum of available funds, etc.), most often there are established criteria that point out the municipalities and/or the types of projects that are relevant for the respective programme, while the actual projects are proposed by the municipal governments.  The methodology of selecting projects for funding varies from one programme to another. The involvement in management and monitoring of projects varies from one programme to another, also. The programmes of the European Commission in the Republic of Macedonia are still managed within a centralised system through the Centre of the European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR) in Skopje. This in itself shows that the management and monitoring are also done by EAR, in collaboration with the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. Nevertheless, even in a constellation like this, with the purpose for gradually approximation to the way of management of programmes to the one typical for the EU cohesion and structural funds, within the CARDS Local Infrastructure Development Program 2002-2003-2004, which is being implemented through the Ministry of Local Self-Government, the municipal governments are represented in the Administrative Committee of the Programme (which, among other things, approves the list of projects selected for financing on the bases of a public call and previously established criteria) through the Association of Local Self-Government Units (ALSG). The municipal governments of the municipalities that have been granted funding of a project, have the obligation to appoint a technical representative that track the implementation of the project for them, in addition to the regular monitoring by the EAR and the Government. Complementing this, within the same programme, there are activities for training local governments and municipal civil servants.  
) The national employment policy and strategy are determined by the macroeconomic policy, the National Action Plan (NAP), and other projects and programmes. These acts are the bases of the local economic development strategies and the employment policies on the local level. On the basis of the same acts, and in accordance with the employment policy of EU and NAP, territorial local employment agreements which contain employment related measures may also be prepared and implemented. Actual projects for local development and increasing of employment have already been implemented on the local level in the past. 11. Do you have local or regional employment offices in your country? Do local employment offices have a role in: a) Implementing national labour market policies; b) Making use of active labour market policies to combat structural unemployment; c) Management and/or monitoring of projects? 
The Employment Agency of the Republic of Macedonia, apart via the Central Office, also carries out its functions via 30 local employment centres. The employment centres perform their functions for the territories of one or several municipalities. More details about this subject can be found in Chapter 13 - Social Policy and Employment, Section VI-, question 3, (see 13_VI_A_03). a) Implementing national labour market policies The employment centres implement the national labour market policy with management, coordination and monitoring help of the Central Office of the Employment Agency of the Republic of Macedonia with the seat in Skopje. b) Making use of active labour market policies to combat structural unemployment The employment centres have an active role in implementing the practical aspects of the labour market policy to combat structural unemployment, by carrying out the activities for analysing the labour force structure, as well as the other aspects of the local labour market, and by planning and implementing appropriate measures, according to the situation and the needs. Bearing in mind the situation that most of the unemployed persons have low or inadequate qualifications and skills for the needs of the labour market, the employment centres implement active employment measures, such as employment counselling and employment preparation programmes, i.e. training, re-qualification and additional training programmes. The purpose of these employment preparation programmes, is labour force adjustment to the real needs of the labour market. With the recent changes in the legislation, other than the most often applied forms of unemployed persons’ training for a known employer and training of persons proclaimed as redundant, in the next period new types of training are planned, such as training in pre-dismissal phase, training at the workplace, short-term trainings for the needs of public work, and specialised type of training for disabled persons. Apart from the vocational trainings, they will be carried out at the additional skills level. c) Management and/or monitoring of projects The local employment centres, in coordination with the Central Office of the Employment Agency and the project offices, are active participants in many projects in the area of employment. In most of the projects (e.g., within the CARDS program, carried out through the Ministry of Labour and Social Politics, or the donation projects of USAID, UNDP, MRFP and others, or for the needs for workers in local businesses, etc.) they participate by providing relevant information from the local labour market for the projects’ needs, by assistance during selection of persons from the unemployed persons' records for participation in the project activities, by giving professional help for the planning of certain activities within the projects, such as public announcements for persons needed for training, employment, etc. The employment centres participate in the projects by monitoring the realisation of the project activities, as well as by evaluating their effects. 
12. How has the administrative reform foreseen for 2004 affected the regions? What impact has it had on: i) Regional breakdown; ii) Decision-making structures; iii) Implementing structures? 
There are no administrative-territorial regions in the Republic of Macedonia. The statistical regions on NUTS level III shall be harmonized with the new municipal borders (NUTS level V) stipulated with the Law on the Territorial Organization of the Local Self Government of the Republic of Macedonia (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 55/04).   
i) This harmonization shall not cause significant changes of the borders of the statistical regions. The only changes of the borders of the statistical regions shall be caused by the transfer of the settlements: the village of afa from the municipality of Oslomej (South-Western region) to the municipality of Gostivar (Polog region); the villages Mogorce, Osoj and Gari from the municipality of Mavrovo - Rostuše (Polog region) to the municipality of Debar (South-Western region). The total number of inhabitants in the transferred villages from the Polog to the South-Western region is 1.805. 
ii) The package of laws on the administrative reform in 2004 does not concern the issue of regional development and the defining of administrative regions, i.e. it does not cover the issue of decision-making structures on the regional level.  For more information on the changes of the municipal borders with the new Law on Territorial Organisation of the Local Self Government in the Republic of Macedonia, please see the answer of question 19, Section C, Chapter I (see I_C_19).

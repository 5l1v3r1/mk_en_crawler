TIRANA, Albania -- During parliamentary debate on the 2009 budget bill Thursday (November 20th), Prime Minister Sali Berisha described the draft bill as historic and said it represented a promise kept. "For the last four years, we have collected 100% more funds than you have," Berisha told members of the opposition Socialist Party (SP), adding that the budget will promote economic growth. Berisha pointed out that expenditures will go to salary and pension increases in order to keep a campaign promise. The SP reacted sharply to the proposed figures. The 2009 budget is expected to disburse 4 billion euros, making it the largest in Albania's history. (BBC, News 24, Top Story, Klan - 20/11/08)

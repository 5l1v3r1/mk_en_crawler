SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government on Wednesday (March 31st) approved a set of 59 anti-crisis measures, agreed upon by the social and economic council, as well as an additional one, addressing state coverage of expenses during hospital stays, according to an official statement. In addition to alleviating the effects of the recession, the plan aims to strengthen public finances, as well as provide stimuli for a faster economic recovery. The net effect of the measures is to save or raise around 800m euros, or 2.4% of projected GDP, and does not include a possible VAT hike. Prime Minister Boyko Borisov insists the hike remains a possibility, if 150 contracts signed by the previous government in 2007-2009 cannot be cancelled. They are worth about 1.05 billion euros.

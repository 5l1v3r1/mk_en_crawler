SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government on Wednesday (December 20th) called for international pressure on Libya to resolve the case of five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor, who were again sentenced to death this week for allegedly infecting more than 400 children with HIV at a Benghazi hospital. In a joint letter to the leaders of EU and NATO member states, as well as international organisations, Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov, Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev and Parliament Speaker Georgi Pirinski urged "real and active support" for the release of the medics. They insisted that the Bulgarians be treated and defended as European citizens.
Also Wednesday, Russia joined the EU, NATO and the United States in condemning the death sentences. (Sega - 21/12/06; Bulgarian Government website, Darik, BNR - 20/12/06)

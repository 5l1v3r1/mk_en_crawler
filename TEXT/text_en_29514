NEW YORK, United States -- Kosovo Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni met officials from several countries at the UN headquarters in New York on Friday (July 30th), urging them to recognize his country's independence. "Kosovoâs independence does not represent a precedent for any country in the world," Hyseni said, expressing hope that Greece and Spain will soon extend recognition. The two countries are among five EU members that have refused to do so.
Meanwhile, Russia, which is taking over the presidency of the UN Security Council on Sunday, has said the council will hold a session on Kosovo on Tuesday. (Makfax, Beta, FoNet, B92, DPA, Kohanet - 31/07/10)

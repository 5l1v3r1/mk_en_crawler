ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivica Racan said Monday (16 June) that he is unaware of the whereabouts of fugitive Gen Ante Gotovina, who is being sought by the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. Racan was responding to a weekend comment by his deputy, Goran Granic, who said Gotovina might be in Austria. Vienna issued a statement of its own Monday, stressing that if Gotovina were in Austria, he would have been arrested. He disappeared two years ago.
In other news, Croatian President Stipe Mesic told journalists Monday that his country was calling on refugees to return to their homes. "Only then we can become a serious state," he said. His statement echoed a similar call from Racan last week. (HINA, Croatian Radio, BBC, PBS BiH, AFP - 16/06/03)

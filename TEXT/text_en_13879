SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown has expressed his appreciation for the US administration's commitment to maintaining its engagement in BiH, as well as for the support provided so far. In a statement released Thursday (17 November), Ashdown noted that the "continued US engagement in implementing crucial reforms, including those in the fields of defence and the police, is essential".
This weekend, the leaders of BiH political parties will meet in Washington to discuss draft constitutional changes that would restructure the government. US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney says differences should be ironed out by Tuesday. 
In other news, the Council of Europe on Thursday criticised BiH for failing to adopt several conventions crucial to membership. Secretary General Terry Davis cited in particular conventions on money laundering, terrorism and human trafficking. (Nezavisne Novine, Dnevni Avaz - 18/11/05; PBS BiH, Fena, RTRS - 17/11/05)

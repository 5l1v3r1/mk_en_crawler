DEVNYA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg said Sunday (13 July) that the economy ministry would be restructured and a separate department on tourism would be established, but as an agency, not a ministry. Economy Minister Nikolay Vassilev seemed to concur, saying tourism is of strategic importance to the economy and should be run by a separate department.
In other news, European Affairs Minister Meglena Kuneva began an official visit to Italy on Sunday, saying she wants to ensure that Rome supports a timetable for the EU's safety review of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant. Italy assumed the EU rotating presidency earlier this month. (Dnevnik, Trud, 24 Chassa - 14/07/03; BTA, BNT - 13/07/03)

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Police arrested on Wednesday (February 17th) dozens of former workers of tobacco maker Tekel, who briefly occupied the Cervantes Spanish Cultural Centre in Istanbul. The demonstrators put Turkish flags on the windows of the building and chanted anti-government slogans, insisting that the government should find new work for the estimated 10,000 former Tekel workers who lost their jobs in 2008 after the company was sold to British American Tobacco Investment Ltd. The protestors say they decided to occupy the centre in order to attract the attention of the international community. (Zaman - 18/02/10; Reuters - 17/02/10)

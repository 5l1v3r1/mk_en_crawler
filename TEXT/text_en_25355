BUCHAREST, Romania -- When members of the European Commission (EC) elect new commissioners in November, Romania wants the post of agriculture or transport commissioner, Democratic Liberal Party lawmaker Teodor Stolozhan said on Monday (August 24th). "What is important for Romania is to have not only a nomination in one field, but two or three candidate options in two or three areas, for example agriculture, transport, regional development," Stolozhan said. He added that candidates should be competitive, experienced and familiar to the EU and the EC. Commissioners are nominated by their respective governments and approved by the European Parliament.

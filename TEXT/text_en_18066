SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Peace Implementation Council (PIC) board for BiH wraps up a two-day session in Sarajevo on Tuesday (June 19th). Chris Bennett, director of communications at the Office of the High Representative, said board members planned to deliver a "strong message" to the country's politicians over the stalemate that has blocked BiH's EU integration process. The key issues include stalled police and constitutional reforms, war crimes co-operation, the consequences of the International Court of Justice's recent verdict on the BiH's genocide lawsuit against Serbia, and the Srebrenica massacre. 
Also attending the PIC meeting is the new High Representative, Miroslav Lajcak, who succeeds Christian Schwarz-Schilling next month. In an exclusive interview Tuesday with Nezavisne Novine, Lajcak said reforms are key to BiH's future. (Nezavisne Novine - 19/06/07; PBS BiH, EU website, RTRS - 18/06/07)

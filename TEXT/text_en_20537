ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised union leaders Tuesday (March 11th) for their opposition to a social security reform bill passed last week by a parliamentary panel. Speaking to party members, Erdogan said the bill aims to provide generally the same retirement conditions for all workers, but not for 20 more years. "Those who direct criticism at this part of the bill forget that workers will not be affected by it until 2028," Erdogan noted. Several labour unions vowed to launch strikes on Friday to protest the bill. They say it will impose heavy burdens on workers. (Zaman - 12/03/08; Hurriyet - 11/03/08)

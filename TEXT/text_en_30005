BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu said on Sunday (April 17th) that his country is ready to accept 200 Tunisian immigrants in response to solidarity calls from Italy, which faces a growing influx of immigrants seeking to escape turmoil. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi recently expressed concern about the low level of solidarity from other EU member states, after more than 20,000 Tunisian immigrants arrived in Italy over the course of two weeks.

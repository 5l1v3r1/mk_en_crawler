ATHENS, Greece -- Government spokesperson Giorgos Petalotis said on Wednesday (November 3rd) that the recent series of parcel bombs targeting embassies and officials across Europe "is not related to international terrorism and groups like al-Qaeda". Police spokesperson Major Thanassis Kokkalakis announced two arrests in connection with the attacks, men described as suspected "domestic terrorists without international connections". Authorities imposed a 48-hour suspension of international airmail Tuesday after several parcel bombs were found in embassies and international organisations in Athens. The suspension is necessary to conduct checks, authorities explained. (CNN, AFP, AP - 03/11/10)

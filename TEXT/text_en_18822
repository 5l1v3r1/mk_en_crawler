ATHENS, Greece -- The education trade unions decided on Sunday (March 4th) to continue their protests against the government's legislative proposals for higher education reforms. The Panhellenic Federation of University Teachers' Associations also urged the conservative New Democracy-led cabinet to withdraw the set of educational reform bills from Parliament, rejecting the measures as anti-constitutional, undemocratic and inappropriate. They also warned that if Parliament adopts the draft, the union would approach the country's top administrative court, the Council of State. The most controversial provisions allow private universities in Greece, which critics say would spell the end of free public education. (Kathimerini, Estia - 05/03/07; ERT, ANA-MPA - 04/03/07)

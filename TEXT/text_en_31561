SKOPJE, Macedonia -- French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin stopped in Skopje briefly Wednesday (16 April) on his way to the EU summit in Athens. Meeting with President Boris Trajkovski, Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski and Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva, Raffarin discussed the deployment of the EU mission "Concordia", which replaced the NATO mission in Macedonia. They also discussed progress in improving interethnic relations and in the fight against organised crime and corruption.
Meanwhile, at a joint press conference, representatives of the international community said the situation in the northern border villages of Tanusevci, Brest and Malino Maala is under control and both sides are willing to compromise. Residents there threatened civil unrest last weekend over army patrols and because local self-governance has not yet been established. (MIA, Makfax, A1 TV - 16/04/03)

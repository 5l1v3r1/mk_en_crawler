BELGRADE, Serbia -- Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) leader Vojislav Kostunica said that the DSS and Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) have failed to agree on proposed constitutional amendments. "It is obvious that the DSS and SNS have different attitudes and different policies regarding this basic and most fundamental problem," Kostunica said after meeting with SNS leader Tomislav Nikolic on Saturday (January 15th). 
The SNS submitted a petition to parliament Thursday to amend the constitution. The petition suggests reducing the number of lawmakers by half to 125, and envisions cutting the number of ministries from the current 24 to no more than 15. They also want to eliminate the state secretary posts in a bid to cut budget costs. (Tanjug, B92, RTS - 15/01/11)

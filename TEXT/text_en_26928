BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic, who heads the Democratic Party (DS), met on Monday (March 8th) with Istvan Pastor, leader of the Vojvodina Hungarians' Union (SVM), to discuss the strategic partnership between their two parties in regard to Serbia's EU integration bid. They agreed to resolve any future problems through dialogue. Relations between the two groups grew strained after the SVM, part of the ruling coalition, refused to support the budget bill during a vote by parliament in December.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The retrial of the highest Croatian politician ever charged with war crimes, former Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) lawmaker Branimir Glavas, started over again in Zagreb on Tuesday (November 4th) more than a year after the original trial kicked off. In September, the court ordered the restart of the trial because by law, court sessions must be held within two months of the start of a trial. Glavas, 52, a former general and commander of the Croatian army in Osjek, faces charges of involvement in the 1991 kidnapping, torture and murder of 12 Serbian civilians. Glavas and six co-defendants pleaded not guilty during Tuesday's court session. 
In other news, a Zagreb court on Monday sentenced 22 people to a total of 80 years in prison for smuggling three tonnes of marijuana from the Netherlands to Great Britain. The court also confiscated property worth more than 2m euros that the group had bought to launder its proceeds, the biggest such property seizure to date in Croatia.

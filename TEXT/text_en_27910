PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Institutions in Serb-dominated Mitrovica say that the number of Kosovo Serbs who are interested in obtaining Kosovo documents has increased lately, local media reported on Monday (August 23rd). Civil Registry Office official Arife Hoxha says Albanian, Serbian and Bosnian citizens applying for documents are from Leposavic, Zubin-Potok and the Bosniac neighbourhood in Mitrovica. "The number of applications has reached 30. Of them, eight are from Serbs, five Bosnians and we received two passport applications," Hoxha said. When the Civil Registry Office opened in Mitrovica two months ago, it prompted protests among local Serbs. The office remains under police surveillance.

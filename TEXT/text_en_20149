BELGRADE, Serbia -- The opposition Serbian Radical Party (SRS) on Friday (December 14th) once again nominated deputy leader Tomislav Nikolic to be its candidate in the upcoming presidential elections on January 20th. Although the party continues to criticise the decision to call the elections as unconstitutional, it has said it will participate. Nikolic has been the de facto SRS leader for the past several years. Official party leader Vojislav Seselj is being tried by the UN war crime tribunal in The Hague. The SRS won the legislative elections this year but did not manage to find partners to form a government. (Blic - 15/12/07; FoNet, B92, Tanjug, Beta - 14/12/07)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Capital punishment should remain within Turkey's legal codes whether it is implemented or not, Burhan Kuzu, a lawmaker with the ruling Justice and Development Party and head of parliament's Constitution Commission, said on Tuesday (March 29th). Several added that though it may be desirable, re-institutionalising the death penalty does not seem feasible. Tuesday's debate was sparked by the rape and murder of three children whose bodies were discovered after months and the murder of another child by his stepmother. 
Members of the main opposition Republican People's Party oppose even discussing the death penalty, while a lawmaker from the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party condemned Kuzu's remarks. Turkey abolished capital punishment in 2001 within the framework of EU accession reforms via an implicit entente between the three coalition parties at the time.

MOSCOW, Russian Federation -- Ambassador Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko, Russia's envoy for Kosovo, criticised UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's proposal on Kosovo's future status Thursday (February 15th), saying it needs adjustment. During a news conference in Moscow, Botsan-Kharchenko said Russia would not accept a decision that is unilaterally imposed against the will of Serbia. However, he also said Russia has not made any plans to use its veto power at the UN Security Council over the issue. "The veto is not a goal in itself for Russia," he said, while adding that the Council should discuss a new Kosovo resolution only with the approval of both Belgrade and Pristina.
Speaking the same day, Ahtisaari told the AP that he views chances for a compromise between Belgrade and Pristina as "slim". He added that he was not surprised by a resolution passed earlier this week by the Serbian parliament, which rejected Ahtisaari's blueprint as "unacceptable".

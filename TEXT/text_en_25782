ANKARA, Turkey -- Police have smashed a Balkan drug production and trafficking gang that is believed to have operated a laboratory in Bulgaria, media reported on Wednesday (October 21st). The operation was carried out after police officers in Istanbul seized five tonnes of acetic anhydride, a substance used in the production of heroin. A total of 500 policemen and 250 gendarmerie officers took part in the operation. The alleged drug dealers tried to escape to Greece but were caught at the Ipsala border checkpoint. The gang is suspected of having trafficked drugs in Turkey and throughout the Balkans. It included Slovenians, Turks and Macedonians. Authorities say they were manufacturing the raw materials used in drug production in a former yoghurt factory in Tekirdag province. (Haberler, BTA - 21/10/09)

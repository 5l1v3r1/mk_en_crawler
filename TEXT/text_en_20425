ANKARA, Turkey -- Kurdish militants have abducted seven people, including two guards, in the eastern Van province, near the border with Iran, news agencies reported on Monday (November 12th). Members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) blocked a bridge, leading to the Ogulveren village near the border with Iran, and kidnapped two guards and another five young men late Sunday, the sources said. CNN Turk reported that in response, Turkish security forces have launched a major operation in Van.
Meanwhile, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani said on Monday that his country is actively looking for ways to co-operate with Turkey in the fight against terrorism and will not allow more Kurdish separatists to establish bases on Iraqi territory. "We are making every effort to eliminate the terrorist threat, which obstructs both Turkey and Iraq," Talabani told a joint press conference with Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa, in Cairo.

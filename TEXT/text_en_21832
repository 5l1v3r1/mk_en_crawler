SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Press freedom is a very serious problem in Macedonia, EU Ambassador to Skopje Erwan Fouere told Radio Free Europe on Sunday (November 23rd). He said media in the country are subject to huge political influence. "Private TV networks are being connected with political parties. It is very important to establish really independent media free of political influence," Fouere said. He added that the spring presidential elections will be a test of Macedonia's readiness to join the EU. (Utrinski Vesnik - 24/11/08; Makfax, MIA - 23/11/08)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Many Kosovo Albanians have applied for biometric Serbian passports in order to benefit from visa free travel to EU member countries, local media reported on Tuesday (January 19th). Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro were offered the privilege in mid-December, and a building run by Serb parallel structures in Gracanica, outside Pristina, is frequently visited by Albanians seeking Serb citizenship. Pristina residents tell Klan Kosova TV that Serbian passports offer more opportunity for travel and that they are frustrated with empty promises of free movement.

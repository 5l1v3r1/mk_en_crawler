BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) will review the Turkish Constitutional Court's upcoming verdict in the trial against the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the judges' reasons for it, EC spokesman Amadeu Altafaj Tardio said on Monday (July 28th). He stressed, however, that the EC would not comment on the AKP trial's possible impact on Turkey's EU accession negotiations before the case is concluded.
On Tuesday, the Constitutional Court began its second day of deliberations on the closure case against the AKP, which is accused of undermining secularism. (Hurriyet, Anadolu news agency, Sabah, Zaman, Turkish Press, Euronews, AFP - 29/07/08, Hurriyet, Turkish Press - 28/07/08)

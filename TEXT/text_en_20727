ZAGREB, Croatia -- Government spokesman Ratko Macek rejected claims Sunday (October 7th) that Croatia is pressuring The Hague war crimes tribunal over the verdict returned last week in the so-called "Vukovar Three" trial. Tribunal President Fausto Pocar reportedly has sent a letter that will be distributed to all UN members, complaining that Croatia is pressuring the court and is trying to influence its independence. Croatia rejected the sentences handed down as too lenient.
In other news Sunday, Croatian Justice Minister Ana Lovrin said that Zagreb will ask Russia to extradite former Yugoslav People's Army General and Defence Minister Veljko Kadijevic. He is charged with committing war crimes in Vukovar between 1991 and 1995. (Javno.com, Vecer, Vecernji List - 08/10/07; A1, Index.hr, HRT, Novi List, Beta, B92, Jutarnji List, RTS - 07/10/07)

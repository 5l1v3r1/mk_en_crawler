ZAGREB, Croatia -- NATO Secretary General George Robertson evaluated Croatia's chances for joining the Alliance as "very good". However, Robertson noted during a visit to Zagreb on Monday (31 March) that accession would be conditioned on the pace of reforms. Major challenges include commitments to the UN war crimes tribunal; fighting crime and corruption; reforming the judiciary, the military, and procedures for classified information; and the return of refugees. Asked whether Croatia could join NATO in 2006, Robertson said timetables were not yet specified. (Vjesnik, Vecernji List - 01/04/03; 31/03/03)

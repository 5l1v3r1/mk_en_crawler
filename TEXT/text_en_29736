PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi insists that Kosovo should request that Serbia return of original civil registry books, instead of copies as Belgrade has suggested. "For us, copies of the civil registry books have no value," Rexhepi said on Tuesday (March 29th). Pristina and Belgrade reached an initial agreement in Brussels at the beginning of this week that only copies will be provided, as was the case with other former Yugoslav republics, says the head of the Pristina delegation, Edita Tahiri. Serbia took all registries 12 years ago when its administration pulled out of Kosovo. (Koha Ditore, Zeri, Info Press - 30/03/11)

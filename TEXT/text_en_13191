BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro military officers have maintained contacts with Ratko Mladic, the Serbian official in charge of co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal said Friday (27 January). The defence ministry will issue a report next week identifying those in the army who have helped the former Bosnian Serb military commander evade justice, Rasim Ljajic said. A report published in Blic Saturday speculated that the report may contain the names of two officers who were authorised to receive Mladic's pension on behalf of the fugitive.
Meanwhile, Serbian police have arrested the former head of Ratko Mladic's security, Jovo Djogo, on suspicion that he was involved in hiding Mladic. Djogo, a retired Republika Srpska Army officer, will remain in custody for a month. (Politika - 29/01/06; Tanjug, Blic - 28/01/06; AP, AFP, Reuters - 27/01/06

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Appellate Panel at BiH's state court in charge of war crimes sentenced Boban Simsic to 14 years in prison Tuesday (August 14th) for crimes against humanity committed in 1992, while he was a guard at a Serb-run detention facility in the eastern town of Visegrad. Simsic has no right to appeal the sentencing, which nearly triples the original five year sentence he received last summer. This retrial was ordered after requests by both prosecutors and defence attorneys, who cited serious procedural issues. Simsic has already spent more than two and a half years in custody, which will count towards his sentence. (RTRS, SRNA, AP - 14/08/07)

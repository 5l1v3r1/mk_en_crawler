ANKARA, Turkey -- Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on Wednesday (November 12th) urged the EU to speed up accession talks with Turkey and to commit to supporting Ankara's membership bid. Turkey started its accession negotiations in 2005 but has been able to close only eight of the 35 negotiating chapters so far. Turkey's refusal to open its ports and airports to ships and airplanes from EU member Cyprus has frozen eight other chapters. "Next year, the Czech Republic, and then Sweden, will assume the EU's presidency. These are friends of Turkey, and they intend to speed up the process," Berlusconi said at a joint press conference with Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in Izmir.

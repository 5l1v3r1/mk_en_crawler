NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council voted unanimously on Monday (21 November) to extend the mandate of the EU peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) by one year. The decision coincided with the 10th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords. The resolution reaffirmed the council's commitment to the terms of the Accords and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries in the region. The EU took over the BiH peacekeeping mission from NATO in December 2004 and currently has some 6,500 troops there. In a statement on the UN Web site, the council also stressed that BiH authorities are primarily responsible for the peace process and for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.

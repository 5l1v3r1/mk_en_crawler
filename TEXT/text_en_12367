ANKARA, Turkey -- A panel discussion on the future of Turkey-EU relations was held in Ankara on Tuesday (10 May). The event drew politicians, experts, and foreign diplomats, who discussed issues related to the Turkish bid for EU membership and implementation of reforms ahead of the expected launch of accession talks on 3 October. However, a poll sponsored by the ruling Justice and Development Party found that support for Turkey's EU bid has been declining since the end of last year. According to results released Tuesday, 63 per cent of the public now favours accession compared to 75 per cent last December. Experts attribute the drop to Turks' disillusionment over debate heard in some EU member states. (TurkishPress.com, Anadolu Agency, Financial Times - 10/05/05)

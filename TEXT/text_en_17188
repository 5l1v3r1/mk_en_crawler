SOFIA, Bulgaria -- As expected, the cabinet endorsed on Friday (29 September) the deployment of the 160-crew military frigate "Drazki" to the UN Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Parliament must give the deployment final approval. 
Separately Friday, Albanian Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu announced that his government was considering whether to send a contingent to UNIFIL. Media reports suggest the Albanians would serve under Italian command. (Sega, Darik, Albanian News - 30/09/06)

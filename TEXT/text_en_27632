ANKARA, Turkey -- Relations between Turkey and Greece are improving, officials from the two countries agreed on Monday (October 25th) at the fourth meeting of the Greece-Turkey Inter-ministerial Committee in Ankara. "We believe that there is no problem between Turkey and Greece that cannot be resolved. With mutual good intentions, honesty and courage, we can easily resolve issues concerning the Aegean, Cyprus, the Halki Seminary and the Turkish minority in Greece," Egemen Bagis Turkish State Minister and chief negotiator for Turkey's EU accession talks, commented after talks with Spyros Kouvelis, Greek deputy foreign minister. Kouvelis stressed the importance of a meeting last week between Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Greek counterpart George Papandreou on the sidelines of a climate change summit in Athens, noting it showed "how closely we are working".

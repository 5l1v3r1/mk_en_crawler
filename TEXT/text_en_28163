ANKARA, Turkey -- As the unilateral ceasefire declared in August by the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) draws to a close Monday (September 20th), Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called a surprise security summit in Ankara late Sunday, attended by civilian and military brass, as well as intelligence staff. The meeting focused on the implications of the ceasefire ending, as well as on last week's landmine explosion in Hakkari that killed nine civilians aboard a minibus. Participants also discussed differences of opinion within the terror group and with PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who has been confined to a high-security prison for the last ten years, reportedly expected to advocate extending the ceasefire. The Independent Commission on Turkey, a group of former European statesmen known as the "wise men", is urging the PKK to do just that, without any preconditions. They insist however they are in no way acting as mediators. (Zaman - 20/09/10; Hurriyet - 19/09/10)

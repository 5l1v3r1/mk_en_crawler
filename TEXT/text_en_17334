SKOPJE, Macedonia -- By expressing support for former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's blueprint on Kosovo's future status, Macedonia is guided solely by national interests, Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said in an interview with the Belgrade newspaper Nin on Thursday (May 24th). He stressed that Macedonia does not want to complicate relations with either Serbia or Kosovo. Gruevski also noted that Macedonia cannot ignore the fact that 25% of its population are ethnic Albanians. 
In other news, a Macedonian court sentenced 13 police officers Wednesday to jail terms of six months to two years. The officers, who worked at the Bogorodica border crossing, were arrested in February on corruption charges as part of a larger operation against border police and customs officials. One officer was acquitted. (MIA, Makfax - 24/05/07)

TIRANA, Albania -- All Albanians should respect the law and the constitution and have a common national goal of EU integration, said British Ambassador to Tirana Richard Jones. Speaking Thursday (15 December), he said pursuit of narrow party, factional or personal interests could only obstruct EU accession efforts, adding that EU membership should be the basis of all party platforms. Acknowledging that Albania has a long way to go in harmonising its laws with those of the EU, he vowed the international community would actively support Tirana in the process.

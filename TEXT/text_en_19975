EDIRNE, Turkey -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan unveiled a pipeline Sunday (November 18th) that will transport the first non-Russian supply of natural gas to Europe. The ceremony took place on a bridge over the Evros River, separating Greece and Turkey. The 285km-long project, known as the Southern European Gas Ring Project, will connect the Karacabey terminal in Turkey with the town of Komotini in Greece. With construction costs of 300m euro, the project received both financial and political backing from the EU. The new pipeline is expected to ease Russia's domination of Europe's energy supplies. It will carry Azerbaijani natural gas to EU countries, providing their first supply of gas from the Caspian region, bypassing Russia and the Middle East. It is also expected develop vast areas of both Greece and Turkey, historic rivals. 
Following talks at the pipeline ceremony, Karamanlis announced he will travel to Turkey sometime next year -- the first state visit by a Greek prime minister in nearly 50 years. A visit initially scheduled for 2005 was scrapped amid tensions between Turkey and the EU.

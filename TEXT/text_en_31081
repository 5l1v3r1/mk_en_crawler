PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Four Albanian teenagers were attacked in northern Mitrovica on Saturday (February 5th) while crossing the main bridge that divides the town.

A group of Serbs started chasing the youth and attacked them, critically injuring one, a 14 year old. Police say the attack was ethnically motivated. Police officials say this was the second such attack in as many days. (RTK, Kohavision, Arta TV, TV 21 - 05/02/11)

SPLIT, Croatia -- The Council of Ministers dismissed Deputy Interior Minister Stipe Cacija on Tuesday (3 February) amid allegations that he refused to pay alimony on behalf of his 18-year-old son. Following press reports last month, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader urged Cacija to resign. The press, meanwhile, came out with other allegations that he violated election laws during last year's campaign. (Vjesnik, HINA, HRT - 03/02/04)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK advisor Nenad Radosavljevic told the Belgrade-based news agency Tanjug that the restoration of Kosovo Serb facilities is not going according to plan. In an interview Sunday (20 June), he said the restoration of schools and hospitals damaged during the mid-March riots was not completed by the promised deadline of 1 June. Nor, he said, does he expect damaged Serb homes to be restored by 1 September. The international community has pushed recently for increased efforts to make necessary repairs. (Tanjug - 20/06/04)

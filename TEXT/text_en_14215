SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- International community High Representative Paddy Ashdown sent a letter to BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic on Monday (12 December) about transferring more power to domestic authorities in the area of administrative appointments. Next year, for instance, relevant BiH panels would carry out the process of conducting background checks on candidates for state-level minister positions. 
Also Monday, Romanian Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu voiced his country's full support for BiH's EU aspirations. During a visit to Sarajevo and talks with Terzic, Tariceanu said Bucharest is ready to assist with expertise and advice. (Dnevni avaz, Nine o'clock - 13/12/05; Fena, PBS BiH - 12/12/05)

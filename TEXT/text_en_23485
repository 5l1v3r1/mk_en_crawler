ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Czech presidency of the EU decided on Wednesday (June 24th) to cancel an intergovernmental accession conference with Croatia, planned for Friday. The presidency announced that Zagreb can neither open nor close any negotiating chapters because of Slovenia, which has blocked progress until the maritime border dispute with neighbouring Croatia is resolved. Zagreb hoped to wrap up the accession process by the end of next year, so it can join the bloc by 2011. Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader blamed Slovenia for undermining not only Croatia's EU accession talks but also the idea of a united Europe. Sweden, which assumes the rotating EU presidency next week, plans to hold four intergovernmental accession conferences with Croatia, an EU source told the HINA news agency Wednesday.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal (ICTY) has turned down a motion for acquittal filed by Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj. In its ruling on Wednesday (May 4th), the court determined there are no grounds for halting the trial and releasing the defendant, as the prosecutors presented sufficient evidence for the proceedings to continue. Seselj is accused of war crimes committed against non-Serbs in Croatia, Vojvodina and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 1993. (Tanjug, RTS - 04/05/11)

TIRANA, Albania -- Edi Rama said on Tuesday (August 18th) that he will seek a third term as leader of the Socialist Party (SP), despite opposition he faces from some quarters. In an interview with Shekulli, Rama also reiterated that he does not recognise the results of the June 28th election, which he maintains were manipulated. Former Finance Minister Arben Malaj also plans to run for SP leader in the August 29th vote. (MIA, Shekulli - 18/08/09)

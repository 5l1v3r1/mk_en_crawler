SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prime Minister Nikola Spiric and Dimitris Kourkoulas, head of the EC delegation to BiH, met on Wednesday (September 5th) to discuss the reforms that must be implemented for BiH to receive a positive progress report from the EU in November. In addition to police reform, Kourkoulas cited environmental protection legislation. 
Late Wednesday meanwhile, the BiH House of Representatives ratified the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA). BiH negotiated and signed CEFTA last December but ratification has been delayed amid opposition from producers worried about increased regional competition.

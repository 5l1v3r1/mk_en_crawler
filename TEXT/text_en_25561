SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The UN mediator in the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece, Matthew Nimetz, is urging both countries to accelerate negotiations to resolve the long-standing row. "I believe it is very important to speed up the talks and make certain decisions," Nimetz said after meeting Tuesday (February 23rd) with Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki in Skopje. Nimetz added that if there is the necessary political will, the issue could be resolved in a relatively short time. He said that he did not come with any specific new proposal, rather with ideas on moving the process forward. Nimetz is due to visit Greece on Friday. (MIA, Makfax, A1, Alsat, AFP - 23/02/10)

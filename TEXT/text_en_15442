PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic denied on Thursday (24 August) that he plans to leave politics. The leader of the ruling Democratic Party leader says he is focusing on victory in September's elections and that it is too early to discuss plans after the polls. 
Also Thursday, the government adopted a proposal by the International Committee on Standardisation that identifies Montenegro by the national code ME and the three-letter international code MNE. The same codes will be used on Montenegrin ID cards and passports and MNE probably will be used as the national internet domain. At the same session, the cabinet approved a draft action plan to fight corruption and organised crime, a strategic priority in view of Montenegro's EU integration aspirations.

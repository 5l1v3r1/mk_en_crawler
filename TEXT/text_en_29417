NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The country marked 50 years of its independence from British colonial rule on Friday (October 1st). Greek Cypriots celebrated statehood with festivities and a large military parade in Nicosia. Several international leaders attended the celebrations in Nicosia, including Greek President Karolos Papoulias, his Maltese and Serbian counterparts -- George Abela and Boris Tadic -- and Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme. 
In speech marking the event, Cypriot President Demetris Christofias said authorities remain committed to finding a way to reunite the divided island. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barosso urged leaders of its two communities to reach a speedy solution. "I strongly wish that in the next months I will be able to be with you in person to celebrate the success in the negotiation and the reunification of your country," he said.

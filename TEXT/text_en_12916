BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte said Tuesday (1 March) that "in the past few days" the Serbian government agreed with her that one of the tribunal's most-wanted men, Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic, is in Serbia. In an interview published Wednesday by the daily Blic, however, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica again said there is no proof Mladic is in the country. 
On the subject of Kosovo, meanwhile, Kostunica told Blic that the province should be offered an "exceptionally high degree of autonomy" within the framework of the Serbia-Montenegro union. He said such a solution would be a compromise in which no one side stood to gain or lose everything. (Danas, Beta - 02/03/05; B92, Beta, Tanjug, Vecernje Novosti - 01/03/05)

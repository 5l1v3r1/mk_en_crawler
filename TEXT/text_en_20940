BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) congratulated Democratic Party (DS) leader Boris Tadic on his victory in the presidential elections. DSS spokesperson Andreja Mladenovic also said on Monday (February 4th) that the DSS does not expect instability in the ruling coalition. The DSS and coalition ally New Serbia (NS) did not support coalition partner DS during the campaign. In the first round, the DSS backed NS leader Velimir Ilic. In the second round it endorsed neither Tadic nor his opponent, Tomislav Nikolic. Mladenovic insisted that strategy would not affect the cabinet.
Vladimir Goati, president of Transparency Serbia, disagrees. He says it will affect both the government coalition and relations within parties. Goati says Tadic's victory could lead to Kostunica's resignation, as well as prompt a change in the leadership of Nikolic's Serbian Radical Party.

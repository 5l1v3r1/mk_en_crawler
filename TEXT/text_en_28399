WASHINGTON, United States -- Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasian Affairs Philip Gordon said the Western Balkans are "crucial to Europe's future" during testimony Thursday (April 15th) to a US Senate subcommittee.
Gordon noted the "tremendous" progress Kosovo has made in the two years since declaring independence, including the first democratic elections managed by Kosovo's Central Elections Commission. Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Gordon said, "has made significant progress addressing the problems and challenges that are the legacy of the war. Today, Bosnia has a single military, is a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace, and has taken the first major step on the road to EU membership." 
"Serbia has elected a pro-European, democratic government, which is moving to institute rule-of-law and market reforms and pursuing improved relations with its neighbours -- with the important exception of Kosovo," Gordon said. Albania, he added, must fight corruption and boost development. 
Gordon expressed US support for Croatia's EU candidacy, saying membership may be possible in early 2012. In terms of NATO membership, "Macedonia will receive an invitation ... as soon as the dispute with Greece over its name is resolved." Montenegro, Gordon noted, was given a Membership Action Plan (MAP) in December and will start its first MAP cycle this fall.

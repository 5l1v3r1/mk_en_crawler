BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica plans to send a letter this week to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, asking that all Serbian citizens indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal be allowed to serve their prison sentences in Serbia. Officials hope the change might provide an incentive for the remaining high-profile fugitives to surrender. 
Meanwhile, Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic confirmed on Wednesday (July 25th) that Ilija Jurisic, a suspect held in Serbia in connection with the 1992 Tuzla Column case, will not be extradited to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Vukcevic said Jurisic, who faces up to ten years in prison if convicted, was detained on Serbian territory and would serve his sentence there if found guilty, even though the crime was committed in BiH. Serbia views the case as one of the most serious war crimes committed against the Yugoslav People's Army during the 1990s conflicts. (Vecernje Novosti, Tanjug, Beta, UPR, B92 - 25/07/07)

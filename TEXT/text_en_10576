PARIS, France -- Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin told the National Assembly on Thursday (14 October) that Turkey must persevere with its bid to join the EU despite the fact that it is still not ready for membership. He added that the EU itself is not ready to welcome such a big country into its ranks. The debate in the Assembly reflected deep divisions in France and its ruling party over Turkey's EU bid. 
In other news Thursday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair told the German newspaper Bild that Turkey would need at least ten years to meet the requirements for EU membership. He stressed that he would back the launch of accession talks with Turkey during the December summit. (Financial Times - 15/10/04; AFP - 14/10/04)

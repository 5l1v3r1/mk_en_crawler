ATHENS, Greece -- Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul told an international conference Thursday (17 April) that his country is destined to become a member of the EU. "Turkey is determined to actively contribute to the promotion of democracy, stability, prosperity and security of a wider Europe," he said. But Gul did not attend the official ceremony marking the accession of ten new members of the Union. His absence indicated the Turkish government's disappointment with the European Commission's refusal to set a date for the start of negotiations with Turkey.
Meanwhile, Greek government spokesman Christos Protopappas said in a statement Thursday that if Turkey wants to join the Union, it must start working to settle the Cyprus issue and accept that the Greek part of the island has already signed the accession treaty. Greece currently holds the EU's rotating presidency. (AFP, CAN - 17/04/03)

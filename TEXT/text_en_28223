ANKARA, Turkey -- Ten people, including six police officers, were injured on Friday (September 17th) in an explosion following a funeral in the southeastern town of Yuksekova in the Hakkari province. Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse a small group of mourners who attacked them. An explosive device placed in a garbage can near a taxi stand blew up as the police intervened. 
The funeral was for two of the victims of Thursday's deadly incident in the same province. Nine people died when their minibus struck a landmine near the city of Hakkari. (Hurriyet, Reuters, AP, AFP, Zaman - 17/09/10)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The EU launched its largest peacekeeping mission ever on Thursday (2 December), taking over NATO's effort in BiH. The formal transfer of duties took place at Camp Butmir in Sarajevo in the presence of EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer. More than 30 countries, including 22 EU members, are contributing to the 7,000-strong "Althea" force, commanded by British General David Leakey. NATO will retain small units in Sarajevo and Tuzla, focused primarily on hunting down war crimes suspects.

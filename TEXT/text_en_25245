ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor reiterated on Tuesday (September 29th) that she is not considering a cabinet reshuffle. In a recent interview, Zeljko Lovrincevic, an economist acting as an adviser to Kosor, said she should form a new cabinet in the spring and replace ministers who are in charge of managing state companies. There have been numerous media reports over the last few weeks about problems in such companies. The most recent involve allegations concerning contracts by HEP, the state-owned power utility, and a loan scandal involving Podravka, a food and pharmaceutical company, in which the state also has a significant interest.

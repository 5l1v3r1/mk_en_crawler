PODGORICA, Montenegro -- NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer visited Podgorica on Friday (March 16th), telling officials that the Pact relies on its partnership with Montenegro and that Euro-Atlantic integration is key to stability in the Balkans. He noted that Thursday's sealing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU was the best proof that Montenegro was on "the right path". He added that the Alliance is willing to seal a security agreement with Montenegro soon, and would welcome the opening of a Montenegrin mission at NATO HQ.
In other news Friday, OSCE Ambassador to Montenegro Paraschiva Badescu presented the first annual report on the country to the organisation's Permanent Council in Vienna, since Montenegro separated from its union with Serbia last year. She concluded that Podgorica had made considerable progress in reforming its public administration, establishing a functional economy and achieving macro-economic stability. She also urged the country to quickly adopt a new constitution following broad consensus among the various political parties. (Vijesti, Pobjeda - 17/03/07; Mina - 16/03/07)

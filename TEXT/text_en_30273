SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Some progress concerning the opposition's demands regarding early elections was made during a leaders' meeting Sunday (March 20th). Attending were Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, leader of the ruling VMRO-DPMNE, his coalition partner Ali Ahmeti, leader of the Democratic Union for Integration, as well as the leader of the opposition SDSM Branko Crvenkovski and New Democracy's Imer Selmani. They agreed on the composition of the election boards to set a 30-day deadline for control of voters' lists. They also reached a consensus on redefining borders of the sixth electoral unit in the northwest, due to the larger number of voters there. 
However, Gruevski continues to view SDSM's demand to unfreeze the bank accounts of A1 TV as unacceptable, saying the issue is for courts to decide. Crvenkovski said that the opposition will not return to parliament unless its demands are met. Talks will resume on Tuesday. (MIA, Makfax, Alsat M - 20/03/11)

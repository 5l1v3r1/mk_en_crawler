PARIS, France -- A deal with the United Kingdom on the possible extradition of a suspect in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie was key to resolving the case involving jailed Bulgarian medics, according to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's son. Seif al-Islam told France's Le Monde Wednesday (August 1st) that he hopes former Libyan secret service agent Ali Mohamed al-Megrahi, sentenced to life in prison for the bombing, would soon be released. He also said a weapons purchase agreement with France played a role in the deal securing the medics' release. (Le Monde, AFP, AP, BTA, Darik - 01/08/07)

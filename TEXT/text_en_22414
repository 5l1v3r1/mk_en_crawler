BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Lawmakers overwhelmingly adopted a resolution Monday (July 14th) in support of efforts by the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus to reunify their divided island. The resolution calls on the Belgian government to encourage Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders to start direct reunification talks, as well as to contribute to a climate of trust and mutual respect. Belgian lawmakers likewise welcomed the appointment of former Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer as the new UN envoy to Cyprus. (CNA, Philelefteros, Politis, ANA-MPA - 14/07/08)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Constitutional Court on Tuesday (12 September) abolished a controversial amendment that provided parliament with the right to launch an impeachment procedure against the chairmen of the two supreme courts -- appeals and administrative -- and the chief prosecutor. The constitutional court ruled that such powers were beyond the scope of an ordinary assembly. The provision was part of a package of constitutional amendments introduced by lawmakers in the ruling coalition earlier this year. The changes were criticised by the European Commission as an attempt to manipulate the judicial system. (Dnevnik - 13/09/06; Darik, Mediapool - 12/09/06)

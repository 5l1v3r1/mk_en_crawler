YEREVAN, Armenia -- Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanyan said Saturday (13 March) that the reopening of the Kars-Gyumri-Tbilisi railway linking Turkey, Armenia and Georgia would benefit not only the individual countries but the region as a whole. Oskanyan pointed out that the reopening would require Georgia to focus on improving long-strained relations between Turkey and Armenia. The railway was constructed over 100 years ago, but disputes have kept it from becoming operational.

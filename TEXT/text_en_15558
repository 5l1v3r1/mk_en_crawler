WASHINGTON, United States -- Russian firm Gazprom has threatened to suspend all deliveries of natural gas to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) for failing to pay debts accumulated during the 1992-1995 conflict. BiH owes nearly $105m to Gazprom. The Russian company, BiH's only natural gas supplier, has set a 1 October deadline for the government to take action. (VOA - 22/08/06)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The former chief of the Bijeljina Public Security Centre, Mile Pejcic, was released by SFOR late on Friday (13 August), two weeks after he was detained for suspected involvement in activities contrary to the Dayton Agreement. SFOR said he was questioned about support for war crimes indictees and related smuggling activities. High Representative Paddy Ashdown sacked Pejcic from his post as police chief in June.

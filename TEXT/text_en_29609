ATHENS, Greece -- The Democratic Alliance Party's founding congress wrapped up on Sunday (May 29th) with a speech by leader Dora Bakoyannis. In her closing address, the former foreign minister said Greece's future is not identified by destruction and back-tracking, but rather with the choice of all those who are trying to build careers there. Bakoyannis, a former member of the opposition New Democracy Party, was expelled from the party's ranks after she supported the country's bailout package. She served as foreign minister between 2006 and 2009 and announced the establishment of the new party last November. (Imerisia, Ethnos, SKAI, ANA-MPA - 29/05/11)

TIRANA, Albania -- Meeting with members of the business community in Berat on Saturday (September 9th), Prime Minister Sali Berisha promised that the power crisis will be resolved through a new strategy equally based on energy produced by hydro power plants and thermal plants. He announced that a significant part of the 2008 budget will be earmarked to rebuild thermal power plants in Albania, aiming to guarantee power supplies in the years to come. 
Separately Sunday, representatives of the Alliance for the Vlora Bay Protection protested the construction of a new thermal power plant in the Bay. Hundreds of people joined the rally, arguing the plant would pollute the bay and drive away tourists. (Kohajone, Shekulli, Panorama - 10/09/07; Balkanweb, Albanian President web site - 09/09/07)

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Three candidates have registered to run in the 11 May presidential elections, according to a statement Tuesday (22 April) by Montenegro's election body. Dragan Hajdukovic, who registered just prior to the deadline, will run as an independent. Filip Vujanovic was nominated by the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists and the Social Democratic Party, while the Liberal Alliance nominated Miodrag Zivkovic. Vujanovic and Hajdukovic participated in the previous rounds, which were nullified due to low voter turnout. (Mina, Tanjug, BBC, B92 - 22/04/03)

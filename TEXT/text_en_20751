ATHENS, Greece â Dock workers at the state-owned Thessaloniki and Piraeus ports staged a 24-hour strike on Monday (January 7th) to protest government plans to privatise Greece's two biggest commercial ports. The government intends to lease the ports to concessionaires for the next 25 to 30 years, including loading and unloading activities. Companies from Dubai, China and Denmark have expressed an interest in becoming strategic investors in the facilities. (Vecer - 08/01/08; Reuters, AP, Focus - 07/01/08)

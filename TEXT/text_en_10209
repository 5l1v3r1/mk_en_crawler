SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR troops searched houses Monday (29 November) belonging to relatives of Bosnian Serb Vujadin Popovic, who is wanted by the UN war crimes tribunal. According to an announcement, the troops searched the home of Popovic's mother in the Sekovici municipality, as well as Popovic's brother in Zvornik, Republika Srpska (RS). 
In other news, the head of the RS council for appointment and control of police staff, Nusreta Sivac, confirmed on Monday that RS Interior Minister Darko Matijasevic has demanded the replacement of the entity police head, Radomir Njegus. At issue is the police force's failure to take action to arrest wanted war crimes indictees. 
Also Monday, High Representative Paddy Ashdown announced that he has decided to reduce the wages of the BiH judiciary, in order to cut excess spending and create a healthy budget in the judicial sector. Salaries would be lowered by 16 per cent in the Federation of BiH and by 4 per cent in RS. (Nezavisne novine - 30/11/04; PBS BiH, Pincom.info, OHR Sources - 29/11/04)

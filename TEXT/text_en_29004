SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Ethnic Albanian NGOs on Monday (June 7th) urged Public Prosecutor Ljupco Svrgovski to launch an investigation into a shootout last month near the village of Radusa that left four Albanians dead. The May 12th incident began when police tried to stop a van suspected of carrying illegal weapons from Kosovo, near the border. The Council of Albanian organisations insists on the probe due to "suspicions" among relatives of the victims. The NGOs are urging the public prosecutor's office to investigate the role and responsibility of police involved in the shootout. (Alsat, A1, Makfax - 07/06/10)

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- The government rejected media reports Tuesday (March 18th) suggesting it may sue Croatia over implementation of the protected environmental fishing zone (ZERP). "Slovenia does not intend to sue Croatia due to losses suffered by Slovenian fishermen during the period in which the ZERP was active," the agriculture ministry in Ljubljana said in a statement Tuesday. According to the ministry, the report, in the Slovenian newspaper Delo and picked up by Croatian media Monday, was erroneous. Zagreb recently dropped implementation of the zone, bowing to EU pressure. (Vecer - 19/03/08; Makfax, MIA, Tanjug, Delo, HRT, HINA, Javno.com - 18/03/08)

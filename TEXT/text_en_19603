ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish military planes launched an attack against suspected positions of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in northern Iraq on Wednesday (December 26th), a representative of the Kurdish security forces in Iraq said. The strikes, conducted in Dohuk province, followed an attack that reportedly killed five people on Tuesday. No victims or damage were reported in Wednesday's attacks.
Meanwhile, the Turkish General Staff announced on Tuesday that the December 16th air strike against the PKK in northern Iraq, which marked the start of the ongoing Turkish offensive, killed 150 to 175 Kurdish guerrillas. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed that Turkey will continue its anti-terror efforts. "No matter who says what, we are using and continue to use air and land operations within the framework of authority granted by international law," he said in a speech to officials of his Justice and Development Party on Tuesday.

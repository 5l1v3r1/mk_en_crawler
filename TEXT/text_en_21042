ANKARA, Turkey -- Deniz Baykal, leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party, urged the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) Thursday (August 2nd) against unilaterally choosing its candidate for president. Baykal said no party should use the political environment to engineer the election. He added he would expect Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to keep his pre-election promise and organise consultations with opposition parties. Consensus and co-operation would be key to any nomination, Baykal said.
However, it appears Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul's nomination may be a foregone conclusion. The issue reportedly was settled during a five-and-a-half-hour meeting Thursday among AKP leaders Erdogan, Gul and Parliament Speaker Bulent Arinc.

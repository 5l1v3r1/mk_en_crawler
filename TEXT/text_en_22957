ANKARA, Turkey -- The Constitutional Court is expected to rule Thursday (June 5th) on amendments that allow women to wear headscarves in universities. Though two-thirds of Turkish women cover their heads and opinion polls suggest more than 70% support allowing headscarves at universities, the issue has been debated for years. In February, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) acted to lift the headscarf ban on the basis of religious and personal freedom. Analysts say how the court rules in this case may indicate how it will rule in another pending against the AKP, which accuses the party of working to undermine secularism.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In an interview with Oslobodjenje on Monday (12 June), the head of NATO Headquarters in Sarajevo, General Louis Weber, rejected recent comments by UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte, who criticised NATO and EUFOR for failing to arrest fugitive Radovan Karadzic. If NATO or EUFOR were aware of Karadzic's whereabouts, they would have done everything possible to capture him, Weber said. He also described the level of co-operation by Republika Srpska's government as unsatisfactory. (Oslobodjenje - 12/06/06)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign ministers agreed on Monday (December 10th) to begin unofficial preparations to launch a mission in Kosovo to replace UNMIK. The EU member-states also came closer to consensus on recognising Kosovo after it declares independence from Serbia. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told reporters after the meeting that Cyprus was the only country opposed to a generally shared conclusion that further talks between Serbs and ethnic Albanians are pointless. 
Slovakia reportedly has also signaled that it would find it difficult to recognise Kosovo, but would not prevent the deployment of an EU mission there. Spain and Greece were also reluctant to support a unilateral declaration of independence in Kosovo but did not rule out a change of policy altogether. There were differences, too, on how to treat Serbia, with some countries pushing for the conclusion of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Belgrade despite its failure to relinquish to the UN tribunal Ratko Mladic and other war crimes suspects. 
Meanwhile, an estimated 3,000 people gathered in Pristina on Monday to mark the formal end of the talks on Kosovo's future status. Demonstrators demanded immediate independence for the province, a call echoed by ethnic Albanian politicians.

STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament (EP) on Thursday (7 July) authorised the entry of Bulgarian and Romanian observers in the legislature on 26 September. The centre-right caucus of the European People's Party and European Democrats had demanded a postponement, arguing the observers' arrival would be well in advance of the two countries' actual accession. By an overwhelming majority, however, the EP decided to adhere to the same format applied in previous enlargements. Romania and Bulgaria sealed their EU Accession Treaties in April.

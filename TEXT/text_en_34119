BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Justice Minister Vladan Batic said Thursday (17 July) that Serbia is ready to take over war crimes cases from The Hague tribunal. "I think that the tribunal will give us cases which are not so high-profile, meaning cases without top former government officials." Belgrade authorities are now choosing the local-level prosecutor who would head the prosecution against locally tried criminals. Batic, a reformer who helped oust Slobodan Milosevic, said the domestic judiciary is ready to try Serbs and others accused of atrocities during the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s. "Nobody wants to pardon anyone here," Batic told Reuters, dismissing concerns by human rights groups who suggest Belgrade would target only low-level perpetrators. (B92, Reuters -17/07/03)

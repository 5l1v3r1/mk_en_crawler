SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski has left for an official visit to the United States, where he will hold talks with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other top officials. The centerpiece of his trip will be a meeting with President George W. Bush on Thursday (27 October). Macedonia's aspirations for membership in NATO and the EU and the situation in Kosovo are expected to dominate the agenda. Talks at the World Bank and IMF headquarters also are planned. 
In other news, British Ambassador to Macedonia Robert Chatterton Dickson is urging Skopje and Athens to intensify collaboration with UN mediator Matthew Nimitz to resolve their name dispute. Speaking on Radio Free Europe at the weekend, Dickson stressed that a quick resolution would release a lot of "diplomatic energy" required elsewhere.

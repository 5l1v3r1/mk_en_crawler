BUCHAREST, Romania -- Government officials said Monday (21 April) that state authorities will launch a three-year programme to rehabilitate the water supply network in towns with fewer than 100,000 residents. EU structural funds will secure 380m euros for the project, and the government will also apply for loans from the EBRD. The local development agency will co-ordinate the programme with authorities at the central and local levels. (Rompres - 22/04/03)

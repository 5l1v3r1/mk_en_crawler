PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Police on Wednesday (January 13th) expelled Serbia's Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic over illegal political activities in the municipality of Strpce. Bogdanovic was stopped around noon, ahead of a meeting with local Serb representatives elected by Belgrade institutions. Shortly afterward, police accompanied him to the Merdare border checkpoint in the north. Police Assistant Director of Operations Shpend Maxhuni said they followed an order from the Kosovo government to stop Serbian officials who enter the country without permission. Pristina says it did so after consulting with international community authorities. Bogdanovic says the police violated his rights. 
In response, Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic on Wednesday summoned the ambassadors of Germany, France, the UK, the US and Italy to protest the expulsion. (Telegrafi, Koha Ditore, Express - 14/01/10; TV 21, Kohavision, Beta, Tanjug, RTS, Reuters, AP - 13/01/10)

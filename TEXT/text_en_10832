ANKARA, Turkey -- Prosecutors have officially pressed charges against 14 aides to alleged mafia boss Alaattin Cakici, according to a statement released Wednesday (3 November). The prosecutors charged the suspects -- including a senior intelligence officer and an ex-manager of the Istanbul-based Besiktas football club -- with having helped Cakici flee the country several months ago, only hours before an arrest warrant was issued for him. Cakici was detained in Austria last month and extradited to Turkey, where he faces charges of organised crime and murder. 
 In other news, the state statistical office announced consumer prices rose 2.22 per cent in October and 9.86 per cent over a one-year period. Wholesale prices increased 3.23 per cent last month and 15.48 percent since October 2003. Analysts had expected lower figures, but were reassured by the fact that consumer price inflation was well below the government's 12 per cent target for the year. (NTV - 04/11/04; AFP - 03/11/04)

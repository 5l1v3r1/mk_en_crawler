BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Thursday (September 4th) that Macedonia has to invest significant efforts before it can start accession talks. Macedonia has made clear progress towards meeting the eight Copenhagen criteria required before membership talks can start, but there is work to be done, Rehn told a press conference after meeting with Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs Ivica Bocevski in Brussels. The criteria refer to strengthening democracy, adopting a law on the police, tackling corruption, implementing judicial and administrative reform, as well as reforming the business environment and the labour market. "These are essential conditions for creating a truly European society," Rehn stressed. He pointed out that Macedonia's weak point is the ninth criterion -- holding free elections.

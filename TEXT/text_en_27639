SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko said on Saturday (September 25th) that the leaders of BiH should exit the "blind street" they have entered and instead start explaining to the EU why their country should become a member of its ranks. Speaking at an international conference in Medjugorje, Inzko said that for four years now, nothing from BiH's EU integration programme has been fulfilled. He said it is up to the leaders to decide if they want to fulfil the wishes of more than 80% of the electorate and return to the path of EU integration by adopting and implementing the necessary measures. He noted that in the October 3rd general and presidential elections, voters will get the opportunity to express their opinion on the matter. (Radio Free Europe, RTRS, Srna - 25/09/10)

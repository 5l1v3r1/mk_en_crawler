PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said on Wednesday (April 29th) that the return of citizens to their homes should not be politicised, adding that local institutions will not surrender to any extremists of any ethnic background. His statement came amid recent incidents in the divided town of Mitrovica, where Serbs have been protesting the return of several Albanian families who have started to rebuild their houses. "The government ... continued to take on responsibilities in the process of returning all citizens to their properties. Rebuilding of the houses in Mitrovica is also part of this process," Thaci said. (Zeri, Koha Ditore, Express, Kosova Sot - 30/04/09; Kohavision, Klan - 29/04/09)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci believes that the recently launched Pristina-Belgrade talks are of a technical character and will end with Serbia's recognition of Kosovo and with the integration of both countries into NATO and EU structures. Thaci ruled out the possibility Sunday (March 13th) of Kosovo's status and territorial integrity being part of the dialogue, as well as any possibility that the talks will produce special status for northern Kosovo. "I reiterate that it will never be a topic," Thaci said. He will be attending the Leaders of Change Summit in Istanbul early this week. (Kohavision, Arta TV, RTK, Klan Kosova - 13/03/11)

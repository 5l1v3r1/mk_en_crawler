SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A meeting of the main Bosniak, Croatian and Serbian parties originally scheduled for Thursday in Sarajevo has been cancelled. Talks on constitutional changes were initiated by Sulejman Tihic, president of the Bosniak Party of Democratic Action. But his party announced on Tuesday (November 10th) that the meeting will not take place, as two parties have refused to participate in it -- the Social Democratic Party and the Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina.

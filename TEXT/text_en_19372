BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police have banned a neo-Nazi march in support of Belgrade's efforts to retain control over Kosovo. A group calling itself "Nacionalni Stroj", or National Guard, planned to hold a rally in Novi Sad on October 7th, triggering protests from Jewish and human rights groups. The World Jewish Congress had also voiced concern. In 1942, about 800 Jews and 400 Serbs were massacred by Nazis in Novi Sad. (AP, Channel 4 News, PA News - 26/09/07)

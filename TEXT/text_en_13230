TRIPOLI, Libya -- The country's Supreme Court on Sunday (25 December) ordered a retrial in the case of five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor who were sentenced to death in 2004 on allegations of deliberately infecting several hundred children with HIV in Benghazi. Chief Justice Ali al-Alous said the original guilty verdicts were overturned because of "irregularities" in the detention and interrogation of the defendants. The nurses said they had been tortured into confessing. International HIV experts have said the outbreak was caused by poor sanitation conditions and likely started before the nurses arrived in Libya.

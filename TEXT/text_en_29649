TIRANA, Albania -- Police in Tirana announced on Sunday (January 30th) the arrest of three people who allegedly made death threats against Socialist Party leader Edi Rama. Authorities say the threats were sent to Rama's mobile phone a day before Friday's peaceful rally in Tirana. 
Meanwhile, the parliamentary commission investigating the violent January 21st opposition protests that took three lives has asked mobile companies to provide them with lists of phone conversations involving senior state officials. The commission says this will help in to investigate the events. But the opposition Socialists say the move is illegal and accuse the parliamentary panel of participating in "a plan to implement a system of violence and scare people".

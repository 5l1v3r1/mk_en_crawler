ZAGREB, Croatia -- Participants in the fifth Croatia Summit voiced support Saturday (July 10th) for efforts by countries in the Western Balkans to join the EU and NATO. On day two of the conference, held in Dubrovnik, they asked Brussels to confirm the region's progress towards EU membership. Participants also discussed global challenges confronting Southeast Europe during this time of economic crisis. Attending the summit were the prime ministers of Croatia, Kosovo, France, Poland, Slovenia, Bulgaria, and Albania as well as foreign ministers of countries in the region. Serbia boycotted the meeting because Kosovo sent representatives. (Danas, FoNet, DPA - 10/07/10)

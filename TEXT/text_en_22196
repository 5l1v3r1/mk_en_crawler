PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu insisted on Tuesday (August 12th) that Kosovo cannot be compared to any other area in the world, including the breakaway region of South Ossetia, the scene of fierce fighting between Russia and Georgia. During a debate outside Pristina, Sejdiu said Kosovo belongs to all of its citizens and maintains good relations with all of its neighbours. "Dualism and other supra-institutional forms cannot be tolerated in an independent Kosovo," he said. He gave "institutional guarantees" that Kosovo will respect the rights of all its citizens, when asked if he was ashamed of the difficulties Kosovo Serbs face.

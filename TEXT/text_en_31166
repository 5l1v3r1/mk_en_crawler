PARIS, France -- Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said on Thursday (March 3rd) he has received France's support for his country's bid to join the EU. After talks with French counterpart Alain Juppe in Paris, he said Belgrade will co-operate closely with Paris in order to achieve this strategic priority. Jeremic also announced that President Boris Tadic will visit France in the coming weeks for talks with counterpart Nicolas Sarkozy. 
Meanwhile, Serbian media reported on Thursday that the British Parliament has ratified the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Serbia. The bill, already adopted by the House of Lords, will now be forwarded to the Queen for approval. The UK thus becomes the 14th EU member state to ratify the SAA with Serbia.

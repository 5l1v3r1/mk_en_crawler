BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) re-elected Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica as leader at a party congress Sunday (October 14th). The DSS also elected six deputy party chairmen and 170 members of its main board. A new manifesto was also adopted that formally opposes Serbia's membership in NATO. Addressing the forum, Kostunica reiterated that there is nothing more important at the moment than the protection of Serbia's interests regarding the Kosovo issue, which is why he wants presidential and local elections postponed until next year.

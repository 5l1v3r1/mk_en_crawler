TRIPOLI, Libya -- During visits to Libya on Wednesday (1 September), Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Prime Minister Adnan Terzic and European Commission (EC) President Romano Prodi met to discuss implementation of reforms in BiH. Terzic says he briefed Prodi on the pace of realising the 16 requirements outlined in the EC Feasibility Study for BiH. At the same time, Terzic acknowledged the country would need at least six months more to adopt all the legislation, and might not meet the previous end-of-year deadline. Prodi and Terzic were in Libya to observe a national holiday. (Fena, OHR sources - 01/09/04)

MOSCOW, Russia -- Croatia has little chance of taking part in the South Stream gas pipeline project, President Stipe Mesic said on Monday (December 14th) after meeting with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Mesic said that while there is a possibility for talks on Croatia's potential inclusion, the likelihood is slim. Moscow offered Zagreb the opportunity in 2007, but the government declined it. Mesic also met with Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev. (Vjesnik - 15/12/09; HINA, Tportal, Vecernji List - 14/12/09)

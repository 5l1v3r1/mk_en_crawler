In other news, an IMF mission arrives in Bucharest on Wednesday to assess implementation of the $413m stand-by arrangement between Romania and the Fund. This will be the IMF's last review of the 18-month agreement, which has been subject to repeated delays since it was initiated in October 2001. When completed, the stand-by arrangement would be the first one finalised by post-communist Romania. (Rompres, Romania Libera, ACT Media - 16/07/03; Rompres - 15/07/03)

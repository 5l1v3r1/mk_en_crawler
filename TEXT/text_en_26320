PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Kosovo Serbs in Gorazdevac, near Pec, marked on Thursday (August 13th) the sixth anniversary of an attack against Serb teenagers who were swimming in the Bistrica River. Gunmen killed two young men in the incident and wounded four others. Families, friends and Serbian State Secretary for Kosovo Oliver Ivanovic attended a church memorial service for the victims. Ivanovic said that solving the crime will be "a serious test for EULEX". One of the survivors, Bogdan Bukumiric, told Tanjug news agency that he plans to file a lawsuit at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. He wants to sue members of the international judiciary in Kosovo over the lack of progress in investigating the crime. (Beta, Tanjug, RTS, B92, EMportal - 13/08/09)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- United Serbia (JS) leader Dragan Markovic said on Wednesday (May 28th) that he is enduring pressures similar to those exerted by secret services in talks aimed at forming a coalition government. However, he did not identify who is trying to intimidate him. Markovic, who was re-elected mayor of Jagodina, said that "United Serbia is going towards Europe, Jagodina is going towards Europe, and without Europe, Serbia has no future." Serbian media suggest Markovic's cryptic allegations refer to Serbian Democratic Party leader and outgoing Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, who purportedly has the most influence on the Serbian secret service. The JS is part of the Serbian Socialist Party-led coalition, which became a kingmaker after the inconclusive May 11th parliamentary elections. (Blic - 29/05/08; RTS, Beta - 28/05/08)

ATHENS, Greece -- A hearing in the trial of nine Greeks suspected of links to a terror group was postponed on Monday (January 24th) after the defendants refused to attend and returned to their cells in a maximum security prison in Athens. Supporters clashed with plainclothes officers in the courtroom; reinforcements were called in to restore order. The nine suspected members of the Conspiracy Nuclei of Fire anarchist group are charged with belonging to a terror group and of plotting several bomb attacks. Four other indictees are still at large. Proceedings began on January 17th. (AFP, Ta Nea - 24/01/11)

DECANI, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- A representative of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo, Father Sava Janjic from the Decani Monastery, extended an apology Saturday (18 June) to ethnic Albanians in the province for the suffering they endured during the war. âWe are genuinely sorry and understand the pain which many Albanians have gone through during the war in this region," Jancic said, voicing regret that the Church had been unable to prevent the tragic events or change the general politics of the regime at the time. At the same time, he called for an improved security situation that would allow Serb refugees to return to their homes.

TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament approved on Thursday (April 23rd) the establishment of a special commission to investigate Tirana Mayor Edi Rama for alleged irregularities in issuing construction licences. The motion, proposed by the ruling Democratic Party (DP), won support only from the ruling majority. Rama's Socialist Party boycotted the vote. The DP claims that Rama issued two-thirds of the licences to members of his staff. He rejects the allegations and accuses the DP of "playing political games" ahead of the June parliamentary elections. (Shekulli, Top Channel, VoA, Alsat, Balkan Web - 23/04/09)

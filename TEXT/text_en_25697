PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Two former police officers were sentenced on Tuesday (September 22nd) to 25 years in prison each for a blast in downtown Pristina two years ago. The explosion killed two people and wounded seven others. The jury, presided over by a EULEX judge, found Besnik Hasani and Shpend Qerimi guilty of first degree murder, serious injuries and putting the public at risk. The jury acquitted the third defendant, Nysret Cena, a former member of the Kosovo Protection Corps. A coffee bar owned by Enver Sekiraqa, a main suspect in the killing a policeman in August 2007, is believed to have been the target of the blast.

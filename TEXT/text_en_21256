STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon met in Stockholm on Thursday (May 29th), where they agreed to transfer considerable powers from UNMIK to the government of Kosovo after June 15th, when Kosovo's constitution enters into force. They also discussed the future deployment of EULEX, the EU's police and justice mission in Kosovo.
In Kosovo, President Fatmir Sejdiu said on Thursday that UNMIK will retain a symbolic presence in Kosovo as long as UN Security Council Resolution 1244 is in effect. "We want UNMIK's mandate to end," he stressed.
Separately Thursday, Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa said the EU expects NATO to stay in Kosovo for another five years, along with EULEX. Jansa, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, told French TV channel France 24 that he expects NATO's peacekeeping mission to withdraw gradually during that time. 
Meanwhile, at the 14th meeting of the Stabilisation and Association Tracking Mechanism for Kosovo, held Thursday in Pristina, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci described EU integration as "a national agenda that depends on the dynamics of reforms of Kosovo institutions". The European Commission's director for the Western Balkans, Pierre Mirel, urged judicial reforms and a stepped-up fight against corruption and crime.

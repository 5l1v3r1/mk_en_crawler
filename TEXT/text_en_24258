ANKARA, Turkey -- Police conducted a series of simultaneous raids in 18 provinces across Turkey on Monday (April 13th) as part of the controversial Ergenekon probe, media reported. Targets included the home and office of Baskent University rector Professor Mehmet Haberal, as well as the headquarters of Kanal B TV in Ankara. In addition, they searched several branches of the Association in Support of Contemporary Living in Istanbul, Izmir, and Adana and the homes of Professor Mustafa Yurtkuran, deputy chairman of the Kemalist Thought Association and former rector of Uludag University, in the western province of Bursa, and of Professor Ferit Bernay, former rector of Ondokuz Mayis University, in the Black Sea province of Samsun. The shadowy secularist Ergenekon group allegedly planned to incite chaos and disorder in order to overthrow the Justice and Development Party's government. A total of 86 suspected Ergenekon members are already on trial. (Anadolu news agency, Hurriyet, CNN Turk, NTV, TRT - 13/04/09)

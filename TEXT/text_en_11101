SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) in BiH on Monday (27 June) criticised a weekend statement by Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic linking the issue of Kosovo's status to BiH's Republika Srpska (RS). The OHR said such suggestions were "damaging, destabilising and completely unacceptable". It noted that BiH is a sovereign state with internationally recognised borders, guaranteed by treaty and by law. "These borders are not a matter for negotiation and Serbia-Montenegro, as a Dayton signatory, has an obligation to uphold them. The days when Belgrade brings into question Bosnia and Herzegovinaâs borders are long gone and will never be allowed to return," the statement said.
 EU security chief Javier Solana's spokeswoman, Cristina Gallach, also criticised drawing any parallel between the situations in Kosovo and RS. (OHR press release, Fena, Tanjug - 27/06/05)

TIRANA, Albania -- Six new investigative offices will be established by the General Prosecution in Tirana to help fight corruption and financial crime. Combating organised crime is the road to the EU, Chief Prosecutor Ina Rama said on Thursday (October 29th), during a ceremony for new prosecutors. Rama asked tax offices to help in these investigations. "We are dealing with crimes committed by more than a person, a sophisticated crime that asks for more integrity, professionalism and courage to fight it," Rama added.

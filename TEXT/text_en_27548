BELGRADE, Serbia -- War crimes prosecutors announced on Friday (August 27th) they have launched financial investigations against individuals charged with and convicted of war crimes. The investigation covers 22 people connected to war crimes committed in Ovcar and Zvornik in 1991 and 1992. Prosecutors say they have reason to believe that the property owned by these people does not correspond to their declared incomes during this period. (B92, Beta, Radio Free Europe - 27/08/10)

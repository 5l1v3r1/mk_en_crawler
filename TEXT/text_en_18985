PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UNMIK announced on Wednesday (January 3rd) that an international prosecutor in Kosovo has charged the former manager of the Pristina Airport, Ioan Woollett of Britain, with taking bribes in exchange for jobs. According to the statement, the indictment against Woollett, who was hired by UNMIK in 2003 and discharged in September 2005, was issued last month. Ten Kosovo nationals were charged with corruption in the same case. 
In other news, Kosovo Police Service (KPS) troops, backed by UNMIK police and KFOR personnel, searched 11 houses Wednesday in the mainly Serb-populated Babin Most village. Four residents reportedly were detained after illegal weapons were found in their homes. Media reports suggest the police action was related to the murder of a KPS member, who was shot dead Tuesday night. (Politika, B92 - 04/01/07; KosovaLive, Tanjug, Beta, RTS - 03/01/07)

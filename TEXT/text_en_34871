SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- An SFOR representative told a press briefing on Thursday (31 July) that international peacekeepers were concerned about the quantity and quality of the ammunition kept by the armies of Bosnia and Herzegovina. To reduce the threat to public safety, SFOR is developing plans with the armed forces of the Muslim-Croat and Serb entities to scale back the number of ammunition dumps from 160 to fewer than 10. The new storage facilities would meet NATO standards. (AFP - 31/07/03)

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- UN war crimes tribunal (ICTY) President Patrick Robinson announced on Friday (December 18th) that the court has decided to allocate additional funding for the defence of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. Robinson explained that the previous decision of the court to pay for 4,500 working hours to Karadzic's team of legal advisors did not take into account the huge volume of the case. He added that now the court has decided that the lawyers will have to be paid for around 7,500 hours -- about 165,000 euros. The trial against Karadzic at the ICTY started in October, but has been boycotted by the former Bosnian Serb leader who argues he has not been given enough time to prepare his defence. Proceedings are set to continue on March 1st. (AP, MIA - 18/12/09)

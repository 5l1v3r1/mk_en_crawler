BUCHAREST, Romania -- Two people with heart problems died on Wednesday (January 2nd) in Romania's southern Mehedinti County after huge snow drifts prevented ambulances from reaching their villages in time. Weather forecasts predict more snow and sub-zero temperatures in the coming days. Entire areas in eastern and southern Romania are cut off from other parts of the country due to roads covered with 70cm of snow. Two ports in Constanta -- one in Midia and another in Mangalia -- as well as the channel that connects the Danube with the Black Sea, were closed due to the bad weather and waves reaching up to seven metres. Bulgaria was also battered by heavy snow, forcing its three main Black Sea ports to close. Many roads in the country were blocked by snow 50cm deep. The main airport in Sofia said carriers were forced to cancel 28 flights on Wednesday. (AFP, Makfax, Mediafax, Rompres, HRT, AP - 02/01/08)

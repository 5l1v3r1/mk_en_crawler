BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels are sidestepping whether to unblock the interim trade accord signed with Serbia in April 2008. The matter was removed from the agenda at the request of the Netherlands, EU integration directorate chief Milica Delevic said Thursday (June 18th). Amsterdam insists that there should be no implementation of the trade accord or the Stabilisation and Association Agreement until Serbia arrests the two remaining war crime fugitives -- Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic. Earlier this week, the EU foreign ministers recommended eliminating visa requirements for citizens of Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro as of 2010, with the Netherlands' consent, which raised Serbia's hopes for compromise on the trade agreement as well.

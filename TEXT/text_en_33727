THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Tuesday (2 September) denied a request by Slobodan Milosevic for a two-year adjournment to enable him to prepare his defence. Presiding Judge Richard May told the former Yugoslav President that it was impossible to have such a long recess. He also denied his request for provisional release. Milosevic appeared before the court to outline his plans for the defence phase of the trial, due to start next year. The judges promised to let him have as much time as the prosecution and assured him that he would be able to call as many witnesses. (AP, Reuters, AFP - 02/09/03)

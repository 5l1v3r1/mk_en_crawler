SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Milorad Dodik, Republika Srpska's prime minister and leader of the largest Serb party, the Union of Independent Social Democrats, confirmed on Tuesday (December 4th) that his party would likely propose Nikola Spiric for another term as BiH prime minister. He added the ruling coalition and the parliamentary majority would remain the same. Spiric submitted his resignation on November 1st to protest new voting regulations for the Council of Ministers and the BiH parliament imposed by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak. Since then, Bosnian Serb politicians have come to accept the changes. (Nezavisne Novine - 05/12/07; RTRS, Fena - 04/12/07)

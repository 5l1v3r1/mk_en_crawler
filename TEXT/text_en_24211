BUCHAREST, Romania -- Interior Minister Gabriel Oprea resigned on Tuesday (January 13th) at the request of his own Social Democratic Party (SPD). Oprea's resignation came only three weeks after the new government's formation. The SPD decided on Monday to withdraw its political support for Oprea after he failed to request party approval before appointing Virgil Ardelean as head of Romania's intelligence services.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- On Thursday (24 October), authorities intercepted a Tonga-registered merchant vessel suspected of carrying Scud missile igniters to Iraq. Local media reported that the ship had sailed from the port of Bar in Montenegro and was headed for Iraq. Border guards were seen unloading and inspecting a number of containers, but there has been no official word on their content.
Earlier this week, the Bosnian Serb government fired the chief of the entity's Air Force, the head of the Orao military company and a defence ministry official for their involvement in deals to supply aircraft spare parts to Iraq. An inspection of the company by NATO apparently uncovered copies of a contract under which Orao was helping Iraq maintain its MiG-21 and MiG-29 aircraft by providing parts and expertise. Yugoslav authorities have come up with evidence that Belgrade-based state-run defence contractor Jugoimport served as an intermediary. (Reuters, AP, AFP - 24/10/02)

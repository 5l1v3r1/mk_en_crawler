PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Leaders including President Filip Vujanovic, Parliament Speaker Ranko Krivokapic and Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic sent a letter Wednesday (22 February) to the EU member states' foreign ministers, as well as the UN Security Council's permanent members. They are asking the EU revise it proposal regarding the margin required in the April independence referendum. They say that the EU suggestion, under which 55 per cent of participating voters must back independence for the poll to succeed, would contradict democratic principles. They want a plurality margin of 41 per cent of registered voters instead. (Politika - 23/02/06; Mina, Tanjug, RTS - 22/02/06)

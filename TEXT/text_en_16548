SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The nuclear power plant at Kozloduy reported on Monday (October 9th) that a crack in a heating device had allowed a radioactive solution to leak into an internal pipeline. The leak was discovered on Saturday at one of the large 1,000-megawatt reactors. There was no contamination and people were not exposed to radiation, the plant said. A special commission has been appointed to investigate the incident. (Dnevnik, Sega - 10/10/06; Reuters, Darik - 09/10/06)

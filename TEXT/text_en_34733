ANKARA, Turkey -- Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu said on Saturday (16 August) that 700 people, mostly Kurdish fighters, have applied for amnesty under a new law. While the majority of applicants are prison inmates serving sentences for subversion, Aksu said the government expects "militants to surrender en masse". He warned, however, that the leaders of the Kurdistan Workers Party, now known as KADEK, have denounced the new law and could prevent fighters from laying down their arms. The government expects to receive 5,000 applications for amnesty. (AFP - 16/08/03)

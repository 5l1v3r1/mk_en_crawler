THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal said Sunday (12 March) that former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic died in his detention cell Saturday from a myocardial infarction, or heart attack. These were the preliminary results of the autopsy conducted by Dutch forensic pathologists and observed by senior pathologists from Serbia-Montenegro. A final report is to be released in the coming days.
Meanwhile, toxicology testing is underway amid reports that Milosevic may have ingested a drug that counteracted those being given to him for heart problems and high blood pressure. On Monday, Dutch toxicologist Donald Uges said he found traces of an unprescribed antibiotic in Milosevic's system earlier this year after the former Yugoslav leader did not respond to blood pressure medication given at the UN detention centre.
Milosevic's body was to be released to family members Monday. Some are requesting that he be buried in Moscow, where his wife Mirjana Markovic and son Marko are living. Serbian President Boris Tadic has ruled out pardoning Markovic -- who faces charges in Serbia -- and said a state funeral for Milosevic would be "absolutely inappropriate considering the role he has played in Serbia's recent history".

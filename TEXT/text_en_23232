BUCHAREST, Romania -- The senate adopted a bill Tuesday (September 30th) that grants compensation to people persecuted on ethnic grounds. According to the bill, all those who suffered persecution on ethnic grounds will have the right to indemnities regardless of whether they were living in Romania or Romanian territories temporarily occupied by other states at the time of expulsion or deportation. The legislation covers those who underwent deportation or relocation to other localities, who underwent deportation to ghettos or concentration camps abroad, who lost their freedom to prisons or concentration camps or who had to take refuge due to persecution. The bill is awaiting action by parliament's lower house. (Mediafax, Agerpes, Ziare - 30/09/08)

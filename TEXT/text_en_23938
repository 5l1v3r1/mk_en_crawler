ANKARA, Turkey -- The Istanbul Criminal Court launched a second trial Monday (July 20th) as part of a controversial investigation into the shadowy secularist Ergenekon group, local media reported. A total of 56 people, including retired generals Mehmet Sener Eruygur and Hursit Tolon, prominent journalists and businessmen, will stand trial on charges of masterminding and participating in an alleged plot to oust the Justice and Development Party's government. Another 86 alleged Ergenekon members are already on trial. The group is accused of having planned bombings and assassinations of high-profile public figures to incite chaos and overthrow the government.
On Saturday, about 5,000 people rallied in Istanbul in support of the Ergenekon investigation, media reported. During the demonstration, organised by a coalition of leftist and Islamist civic organisations, protestors called for the free and fair trial of Ergenekon suspects without "foreign intervention".

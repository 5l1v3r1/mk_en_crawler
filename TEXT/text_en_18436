ATHENS, Greece -- Public Order Minister Vyron Polydoras announced on Friday (January 12th) that the government would form a special police task force to investigate the missile attack on the US Embassy in Athens earlier in the day. The group, headed by deputy police chief Stelios Syros, reportedly would include specialists who helped smash the "November17th" terrorist group in 2002. The attack caused minor damage to the embassy but no injuries. A leftist militant organisation calling itself Revolutionary Struggle has claimed responsibility. 
The ruling New Democracy and opposition parties strongly condemned the incident on Friday. They and US Ambassador to Athens Charles Ries agreed that the attack would not affect bilateral relations. (Kathimerini, Ta Nea, ANA-MPA, ERT - 13/01/07)

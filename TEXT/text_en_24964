ANKARA, Turkey -- Sunday's local election results signalled "fundamental changes" in Turkish politics, Deniz Baykal, leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), said on Tuesday (March 31st). He said the cracks in the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP)'s dominant position reveal a significant decline in its popularity. "Politics will be different after these elections," Baykal told a press conference. In Sunday's elections, the AKP secured 38.76% of the vote for provincial councils, a decline of nearly eight percentage points from its 2007 general election results.
In other news Tuesday, two people died and 13 suffered injuries when supporters of two rival candidates clashed over election results in the eastern province of Erzurum. Local authorities stepped up security measures to prevent further violence. In all, election-related violence has claimed 13 lives. 
Meanwhile, in Brussels Tuesday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn criticised press-freedom violations in Turkey. Media reports quoted him as citing the case involving the Dogan Yayin media group, whose bank accounts the government recently froze for alleged tax violations. The media group is known for publishing critical reports about the AKP and government policies. (Anadolu news agency, Hurriyet, NTV, Dogan news agency, Reuters, Zaman - 31/03/09)

SIRNAK, Turkey -- Five members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) were killed in renewed clashes between the Turkish security forces and PKK in the southeast Sirnak province on Tuesday (December 5th). Local authorities also say the military seized tonnes of food, weapons and other items from an apparent PKK winter base. The army began conducting an operation in Sirnak earlier this week. On Wednesday, a vehicle carrying soldiers struck a landmine near Sirnak, killing three and wounding 14 others. (Hurriyet, Reuters - 06/12/06; Zaman, NTV - 05/12/06)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Following talks with new Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski in Brussels, EU security chief Javier Solana was reluctant to cite a specific date Wednesday (13 September) for starting EU membership negotiations with Skopje. But he stressed that the EU's doors remain open. Skopje media quoted him as praising reform efforts and voicing hopes that Macedonia would continue advancing on the road to full EU integration. In Brussels, Gruevski also met with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and with European Parliament President Josep Borrell. 
On Thursday, he met with UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte at The Hague, and with Macedonian indictees Ljube Boskovski and Johan Tarculovski at the nearby detention unit. (MRT, Vecer - 14/09/06; A1 TV - 13/09/06)

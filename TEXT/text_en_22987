PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK customs authorities announced the release of previously seized Serbian elections materials on Friday (May 2nd). The shipment, destined for use during the May 11th vote, was confiscated on Thursday. It contained UV lamps, ballot boxes, spray bottles and partitions for polling stations. UNMIK said the materials were seized because its customs value did not appear in the relevant paperwork. Serbian Elections Committee co-ordinator Veljko Odalovic criticised the seizure as both ungrounded and unprecedented. He reiterated that Serbs in Kosovo have the legitimate right to organise and elect local government authorities and their representatives in the Serbian government.

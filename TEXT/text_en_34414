BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) in BiH said Friday (17 October) that Republika Srpska (RS) should co-operate fully in the war crimes investigation into the Srebrenica massacre. OHR spokeswoman Sonja Pastuovic said RS President Dragan Cavic would be personally responsible for any possible obstruction or scrapping of documents linked to events in Srebrenica in July 1995. Amor Masovic, president of the BiH Federation Commission for Missing Persons, said Friday the RS government had achieved some progress in the case. "The Serb Republic government clearly and precisely determined that crimes were committed by members of the army of Bosnian Serbs, police, civil authorities, municipal commissioners, and local population."

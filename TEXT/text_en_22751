PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Both Montenegro and Macedonia recognised Kosovo's independence in a co-ordinated move Thursday (October 9th). Montenegrin Foreign Minister Milan Rocen announced his government's decision. "This is not a decision against Serbia, but for our future," he said. In response, Serbia expelled Montenegrin Ambassador to Belgrade Anka Vojvodic, saying she "is no longer welcome in our country".
In Skopje, Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki announced the Macedonian government also recognises Kosovo's independence. Lawmakers overwhelmingly adopted a resolution filed by the two ethnic Albanian parties, the Democratic Party of Albanians and the Democratic Union for Integration. Crucial support for the resolution came from the ruling VMRO-DPMNE. The opposition Social Democratic Union of Macedonia abstained. "This is a move that corresponds with reality. We believe it will not endanger our relations with Serbia," Milososki said.
Also Thursday, Serbia announced it is reinstating its ambassadors to the United States and other countries -- including Japan, Canada and Australia -- that recognised Kosovo's independence earlier. In July, Belgrade returned its ambassadors to 22 EU member states that had recognised the former Serbian province's independence.

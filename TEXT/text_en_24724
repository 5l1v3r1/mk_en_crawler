SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A Bosnian Jew and an ethnic Roma have filed a case against BiH at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), in a bid to overturn a constitutional provision that prevents minority representatives from running for a seat in the tripartite presidency. Only Serbs, Muslims and Croats may run for the office. The case was filed by Jakob Finci, head of the Jewish community in the country, and Dervo Sejdic, a member of BiH's Roma Council. They say the provision violates the European Convention on Human Rights, as well as related UN conventions and international treaties. The ECHR's ruling is expected in September. 
In other news, prosecutors on Friday (June 5th) filed charges against former Bosnian Serb police officer Zeljko Ivankovic for genocide and war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 conflict. Ivankovic, a former member of a Bosnian Serb special police unit, is accused of participating in the murders of at least 1,000 Bosnian Muslim men from Srebrenica, in a warehouse there.

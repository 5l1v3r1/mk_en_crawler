BRDO PRI KRANJU, Slovenia -- The interior ministers of Albania, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Yugoslavia decided Monday (28 October) to work together to stem the tide of illegal immigrants who use the Balkans as a bridge to the West. Afterwards, they issued a statement saying their countries would adopt common policies and legislation on illegal immigration, and would co-ordinate visa policies and procedures for deporting and re-admitting illegal aliens. Representatives of the European Commission attended the conference, hosted by Slovenia.
In other news, a survey by the Centre for Interethnic Tolerance and Refugees found that state institutions and police in the Balkans were involved in many cases of human trafficking last year. (AFP, Television Slovenia web site, BTA, HRT, BBC, SEeurope, MIA - 28/10/02)

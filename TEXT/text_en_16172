ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prosecutors submitted to the court a request Wednesday (17 May) for investigative proceedings against parliament member Branimir Glavas, accused of committing war crimes against Serb civilians in Osijek in 1991. According to court officials, the prosecutors did not seek custody for Glavas. The investigative judge in the case, Kresimir Devcic, later said that up to 45 witnesses could be summoned. Last week, parliament voted to lift Glavas' immunity, clearing the way for the investigation. He denies the allegations. (Vecernji list - 18/05/06; HRT, HINA - 17/05/06)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Government leaders say Serbia's initiative to ask the International Court of Justice whether Kosovo's unilaterally declared independence was legal will fail. "It is clear for everyone that Kosovo is an independent and sovereign country that is recognised by 46 countries worldwide. The recognition process continues, and there is no turning back," Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said on Monday (September 15th) ahead of Tuesday's 63rd UN General Assembly session in New York. Serbia's initiative is on the agenda. Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi agreed, saying "political activity in Kosovo has been developed in line with international law." Later Monday, Samoa became the 47th country to recognise Kosovo's independence. (Zeri, Express, Koha Ditore, Lajm, Telegrafi - 16/09/08; RTK, RTS, Tanjug, Beta - 15/09/08)

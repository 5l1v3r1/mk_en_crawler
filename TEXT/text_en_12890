BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for enlargement, said Thursday (2 June) that expansion would continue despite the rejection of the new European Constitution by the French and the Dutch. Rehn admitted that Europe was suffering from "enlargement fatigue" but insisted that the process would continue nonetheless. He also revealed that the EU is about to send warnings to Bulgaria and Romania. Sofia reportedly will be criticised for a delay in judicial reforms, insufficient independence of courts, and issues related to agriculture and ecology. Bucharest will be urged to boost reforms in justice and internal affairs, the fight against corruption, and border control. As for Turkey, Rehn insisted that authorities there have made significant progress in pursuing democratic reforms. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said Thursday that it remains hopeful that accession talks would begin on 3 October. (Mediapool - 03/06/05; BBC AP, AFP, FT.com, CNN, Reuters, Sega - 02/06/05)

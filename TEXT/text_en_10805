SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Voters headed for the polls on Sunday (7 November) in a referendum called by the opposition in its attempt to scuttle the country's new local decentralisation laws. The legislation, adopted under the Ohrid Accords, gives more power to local governments and redraws the borders of several municipalities. Opponents of the legislation argue that this would divide the country along ethnic lines. Government officials have urged the public not to vote, so turnout would drop below the required 50 per cent. International organisations and Western capitals have warned that approval of the referendum would delay progress in the Euro-Atlantic integration process.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Presidential and local elections should be held on the same day next autumn, Infrastructure Minister Velimir Ilic, who leads the New Serbia (NS) party, told the Vecernje Novosti daily on Wednesday (September 19th). Echoing the words of his closest ally, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica of the Democratic Party of Serbia, Ilic said there is nothing more important than keeping Kosovo in Serbia. He did not rule out the possibility that his party would boycott the presidential and local elections if they are called before the Kosovo issue is resolved this year. Ilic plans to run for president and expects Kostunica's support. (Vecernje Novosti, Tanjug - 19/09/07)

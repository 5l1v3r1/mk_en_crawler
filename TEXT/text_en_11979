SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown and BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic returned from Brussels Wednesday (15 June), saying they had received encouraging news from EU security chief Javier Solana and Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who signaled that the doors to the EU remain open to BiH and that there is a chance Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks could start in November. At the same time, both Rehn and Solana stressed that BiH must fulfil two key conditions -- police sector reform and an overhaul of public broadcasting. 
Also Wednesday, 14 state- and entity-level institutions in BiH signed a co-operation agreement, providing for co-ordination of intelligence, security and policy activities in the country. To that end, a new panel would be established in an effort to strengthen the rule of law, fight crime and boost ties with The Hague tribunal.

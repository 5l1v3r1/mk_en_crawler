TIRANA, Albania -- The military destroyed 20,660 tonnes of old ammunition in 2010, Deputy Defence Minister Ekrem Spahiu said in an interview Tuesday (January 4th). The army continues to destroy old ammunition inherited from communism and its main aim is to eliminate all of it by 2013, he added, pointing out that under plan, another 24,000 tonnes should be dismantled this year. Removing ammunition dismantling depots from populated areas is one of the successes that the ministry is promoting. An accident in March 2008 at the depot in Gerdec killed 26 workers and injured many others. There are about 63,000 tonnes of old ammunition on Albanian territory.

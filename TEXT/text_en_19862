SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak visited Srebrenica on Tuesday (October 23rd) and vowed he would not allow the town to be used for any personal or political interest. In 1995, an estimated 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed there by Bosnian Serb forces. Earlier this year, the International Court of Justice ruled that the massacre amounted to genocide, which prompted some Srebrenica officials to demand the separation of the town from Republika Srpska. The genocide verdict also became the basis for some Federation of BiH politicians to seek the revocation of the Serb entity.

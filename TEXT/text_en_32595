THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Prosecutors in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic filed a motion Monday (3 March) asking the UN tribunal to give them 200 more business days to present their case. The court has held 162 sessions since the hearings began on 12 February 2002. Prosecutor Geoffrey Nice argued that Milosevic's cross-examination of witnesses has taken much of the time allocated to the prosecution. He added that while the number of witnesses has been reduced, new individuals, such as former US Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith, have stepped forward to testify. Prosecutors originally had until 16 May to complete their case. They will get 30 extra days as compensation for Milosevic's illness-related absences from the courtroom. (AP - 03/03/03)

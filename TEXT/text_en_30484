ANKARA, Turkey -- The government plans to build two new cities close to Istanbul, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on Wednesday (May 11th), only a couple of weeks after proposing another massive infrastructure project to build a new Istanbul strait. One of the two cities would be located on the Asian side of Istanbul while the other would be built on an area of abandoned mines on the European coast of the Black Sea. The European-based city would serve as a commercial centre with ports and other facilities. Under the plan, Istanbul itself would become a leading financial centre. Erdogan did not explain what the two new cities would cost or how construction would be funded but did say it would begin after the June 12th elections.

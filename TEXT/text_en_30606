TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi signed a decree Monday (December 13th) approving the country's 2011 state budget, thus ending speculation about a possible review. The main opposition Socialist Party (SP) has been insisting for the past two weeks on a review of the budget in order to redirect funds to address the emergency situation stemming from floods in northern Albania. However, their demand was not met. The budget aims to mainly support sectors such as education, agriculture, health and infrastructure. It also covers a slight increase in salaries and pensions. Parliament adopted the budget on December 2nd with only the votes of ruling coalition. (Balkan Web, Ora News, Top News, Alsat - 13/12/10)

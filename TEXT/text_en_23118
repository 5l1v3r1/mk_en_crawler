ANKARA, Turkey -- It is time for Turkey to update its constitution in a way that reflects the whole country and society, Krisztina Nagy, spokeswoman for EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, said on Thursday (October 2nd). Turkey must implement a comprehensive and stable political reform programme, Nagy added. The country should also implement judicial reform and strengthen the rights of unions, she said, describing Turkey's accession to the EU as a long and difficult process, with the reform process every bit as important as eventual membership. Nagy noted that new chapters would be opened in Turkey's negotiation process in December, in addition to the eight already opened. (Milliyet - 03/10/08; Anadolu news agency, Hurriyet - 02/10/08)

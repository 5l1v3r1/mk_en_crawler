ANKARA, Turkey -- Dozens of Kurds charged with links to the terror organisation Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) spoke in Kurdish when answering questions in court Tuesday (October 19th), ignoring a decision by the court obliging them to speak in Turkish. The trial against the group of 151 Kurds, including 12 mayors, began on Monday in Diyarbakir. The court rejected a request by the defendants to use Kurdish, arguing they understand and speak Turkish and "the use of interpreters would only extend the course of the hearings". Despite this decision, most of the suspects responded in Kurdish to questions about their identities and addresses. The trial is expected to run through November 12th.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, whose country currently holds the EU's rotating presidency, welcomed on Tuesday (July 21st) lifting visa requirements for citizens of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro who want to travel to EU countries. But he also refuted criticism levelled against the European Commission for excluding Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina from the so-called White Schengen List. "The political leadership of Bosnia is chronically incapable of reaching agreement. They are re-fighting a war of 15 years ago with words," Bildt said, adding that BiH citizens are "victims of the inability of their political leaders to agree".
Meanwhile in Pristina, several public groups are asking the EU to include Kosovo in the visa liberalisation process. Nineteen public figures, including a Kosovo Serb politician, have signed an appeal requesting that the European Commission review its decision.

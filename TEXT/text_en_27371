ZAGREB, Croatia -- Daniel Srb, leader of the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP), said on Friday (October 29th) that his party will organise peaceful protests across the country during Serbian President Boris Tadic's planned visit to Vukovar in November. Vukovar was the scene of one of the bloodiest episodes of the 1991-1995 war in the former Yugoslavia. "Tadic must assume responsibility for the politics led by his predecessors," Srb said. President Ivo Josipovic, meanwhile, said on Friday that Tadic's visit is highly important, not only politically but also from a psychological point of view. In an interview with Jutarnji List, the Croatian president stressed the visit will open opportunities for full co-operation and good neighbourly relations.

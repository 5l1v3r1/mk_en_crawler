TIRANA, Albania -- A day after the opposition Socialist Party (SP) returned to parliament, OSCE and EC ambassadors reiterated on Tuesday (May 25th) that lawmakers should take advantage of this development to hold debates, rather than "insult each other", OSCE Ambassador Robert Bosch said. One SP lawmaker was expelled from this week's session after attacking physically a political opponent. 
Meanwhile, SP leader Edi Rama said an offer to resolve the political stalemate is on the table, and it is up to the government to agree to a compromise. He stressed that his party will not back down from its demands for transparency related to the June 2009 general elections. (Shekulli, NOA, Ora News, Balkan Web - 26/05/10)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Roman Catholics across Southeast Europe mourn Pope John Paul II, who died on Saturday (2 April) evening. In Croatia, where Catholics make up nearly 88 per cent of the population, President Stipe Mesic issued a statement saying he will be remembered as a great pope who "spread the message of peace, love and faith". In neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cardinal Vinko Puljic declared that a "great supporter of peace" had passed away. In Albania, President Alfred Moisiu sent a message of condolence to the Vatican, noting that the Holy Father would always be remembered as the pope who accelerated the beatification process of Mother Teresa. In Bulgaria, masses for the pope were celebrated in Sofia, Plovdiv and other cities. (HINA, Fena - 03/04/05; Albanian presidential Web site, HINA - 02/04/05)

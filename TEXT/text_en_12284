BLED, Slovenia -- At a regional conference in Bled, the parliament speakers of six EU member states in Central Europe -- Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia -- unanimously backed the EU integration of Western Balkan countries. In a joint declaration, the participants stressed that the rejection by Dutch and French voters of the proposed EU Constitution should not affect the EU enlargement process. The joint statement also called on EU hopefuls to proceed with accession-related reforms, particularly co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. For the first time, the parliament speakers of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro attended the forum together with their EU counterparts.

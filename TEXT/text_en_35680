SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The candidate of the ruling Social Democratic Union for Macedonia (SDSM), Branko Crvenkovski, said he would step down as prime minister if he loses the 14 April presidential election. In an interview Monday (5 April) with Skopje TV, Crvenkovski rejected accusations that his decision to run for president is an attempt to escape promises he made as head of government. Meanwhile, officials announced that in advance of the election, efforts will be launched to educate voters about the process, and that an estimated 3,800 monitors will observe the election.

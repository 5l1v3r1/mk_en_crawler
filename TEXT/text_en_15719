TREBINJE, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country's first civilian heliport officially opened in Trebinje on Saturday (19 August). The project, which cost some 50,000 euros, was financed and built by two local companies, Neimarstvo and Agrokop, and supported by the Republika Srpska (RS) government. Dejan Todorovic, head of the RS Civil Air Transport Directorate, described it as a small project of great importance, as it would serve helicopter traffic in the region of eastern Hercegovina and would be very useful in emergency situations and rescue operations.

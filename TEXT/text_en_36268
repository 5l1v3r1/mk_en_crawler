SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgarian Defence Minister Nikolai Svinarov said Friday (27 February) that the government wants to cancel a contract signed in 2001 with Russia's RSK-MiG for the overhaul and modernisation of 20 MiG-29 fighter planes. According to the ministry, the Russian firm has so far repaired six planes, but has failed to modernise their communications and navigational systems to make them compatible with NATO standards. Bulgaria is due to join the Alliance on 2 April.
Svinarov denied reports that Britain's BAE Systems has been chosen for the overhaul of the Air Force's fleet of 36 combat and transport helicopters. Two Israeli companies -- Elbit and Israel Aircraft Industry -- and France's Sagem, are also bidding for this contract. Elbit is in consortium with US giant Lockheed Martin. (AFP, bTV - 27/02/04)

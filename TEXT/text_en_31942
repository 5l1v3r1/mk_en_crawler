SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Basic Courts in Skopje and Tetovo have decided to hand over five alleged war crimes cases to the UN war crimes tribunal, which officially requested jurisdiction a month ago. Barring any appeals, the transfer could be complete by 3 December, the deadline set by the UN court. Four of the cases deal with war crimes allegedly committed by members of the former National Liberation Army. The fifth involves war crimes allegedly committed by Macedonian security forces.

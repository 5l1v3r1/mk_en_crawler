BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Anti-Corruption Department (DNA) announced on Thursday (May 8th) plans to begin a probe into possible corruption and match fixing in Romania's soccer league. Police arrested five people Wednesday for their alleged involvement in the scandal. Though the DNA refused to identify the men, local media reports suggest say they were arrested in a restaurant shortly before a decisive local league derby between Universitatea Cluj and CFR Cluj. Police reportedly found 1.4m euros with the group possibly meant to fix the match. CFR Cluj defeated Universitatea Cluj 1-0, becoming the first non-Bucharest team to win the national championship since 1989. (Rompres, Mediafax, Hotnews.ro, Reuters - 08/05/08)

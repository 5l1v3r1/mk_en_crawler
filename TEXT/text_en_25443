TIRANA, Albania -- As promised, lawmakers from the opposition Socialist Party (SP) returned to parliament Thursday (February 25th), ending their six-month boycott of the institution. "This parliament has a conflict to resolve and we are here to give it a chance to resolve it," said Gramoz Ruci, head of the 65-member SP group. He stressed that his party will not drop its demand for a thorough investigation into the June 2009 general elections, which the SP says were manipulated. The party is requesting the establishment of an inquiry panel to investigate possible violations during that vote. SP members returned to parliament after international mediation in the conflict.

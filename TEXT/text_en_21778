ANKARA, Turkey -- EU officials reiterated their support for Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in the closure case to be reviewed by the Constitutional Court. On Thursday (June 19th), the Slovenian EU Presidency and the European Commission both issued statements saying that the EU expected the final verdict to be in line with Union principles -- meaning the party should not be banned. European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pottering and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the AKP's closure would lead to serious consequences. EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokeswoman, Krisztina Nagy, said the outcome of the case should be compatible with democratic principles, the rule of law and the guidelines of the Venice Commission.
In other news, Turkey's top business group, TUSIAD, called for a wider platform for building a new constitution. The group said that the preparation of a new constitution should include not only politicians but civil society representatives, academics and judicial institutions as well. AKP officials welcomed TUSIAD's call. (Hurriyet, Sabah, Zaman - 20/06/80)

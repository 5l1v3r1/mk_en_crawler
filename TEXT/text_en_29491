PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Efforts by the government and the International Civilian Office (ICO) to install institutional authority in northern Kosovo may be affected by Serbia's plan to hold municipal elections in the area in May. Newly appointed Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi said on Thursday (April 1st) that elections could indirectly harm the strategy for the north. He added that regardless of what happens, the strategy will be implemented. 
On Wednesday, ICO chief Pieter Feith said that he is not going to recognise the Serbian elections. State Secretary of the Serbian Ministry for Kosovo Oliver Ivanovic dismissed that, saying "We didn't ask for support to hold the elections, since [Feith] doesn't exist for us."

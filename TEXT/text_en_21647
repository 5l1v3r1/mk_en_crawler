SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Opposition parties in parliament and the Citizens for Bulgaria's European Development announced on Wednesday (November 26th) they are mulling a no-confidence motion against the government, or a demand for the immediate resignation of Finance Minister Plamen Oresharski and Regional Development Minister Asen Gagauzov. They are responsible for the two payment agencies that used to manage funds under the PHARE programmes. On Tuesday, the European Commission (EC) announced it would not restore the accreditation of either agency, which means that no more projects will be approved, as the programme expires by the end of this year. In effect, 220m euros under the programme will be withheld, while another 340m euros earmarked for projects already approved remain blocked. The EC cited a persistent failure by Bulgaria to tackle corruption and organised crime. (Netinfo, Focus, Sega, Dnes.bg - 26/11/08)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- In separate statements, senior EU and US officials have expressed support for Romania's embattled Justice Minister Monica Macovei, who faces a no-confidence vote in parliament on Tuesday (February 13th). Opposition parties charge she has failed to reform the country's judiciary, while supporters say she has been instrumental in rooting out corruption and helping secure Romania's EU accession. At the weekend, European Commission (EC) Vice-President and Commissioner for Justice Franco Frattini told Deutsche Welle that he appreciates Macovei's efforts. Noting that the vote is an internal matter, Frattini said he hoped parliament would make the right decision. 
Separately, Saturday Romania Libera quoted US Ambassador to Bucharest Nicholas Taubman as saying that it is crucial for the country to proceed with judicial reforms and fighting corruption. He praised Macovei's contributions to both processes. (Ziua, Nine o'clock - 12/02/07; Mediafax, Romania Libera - 11/02/07)

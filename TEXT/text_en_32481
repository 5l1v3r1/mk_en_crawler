ATHENS, Greece -- NATO and the EU signed a landmark accord on Friday (14 March) opening the way for the deployment of the new European force in Macedonia. Belgian Defence Minister Andre Flahaut told reporters that the Union would take over NATO's mission in Skopje on 31 March. Under the accord, NATO agreed to share with the EU intelligence information and facilities. The transfer was expected to take place by the end of last year, but was delayed by wrangling between the EU and NATO. (MIA - 15/03/03; AP, AFP, BBC - 14/03/03)

ANKARA, Turkey -- The present situation in northern Iraq is not a concern for Turkey, says Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, who spoke at a cabinet meeting Monday (14 April). He said Turkish authorities would continue to monitor the situation closely, but believes that the United States has sent enough forces to the cities of Mosul and Kirkuk.

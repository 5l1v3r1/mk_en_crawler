WASHINGTON, United States -- As required, all NATO member states sent the US State Department their ratified documents regarding Croatia and Albania's entry into the Alliance, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer confirmed on Monday (March 30th). Portugal and Slovenia were the last two countries to comply. De Hoop Scheffer is sending a formal letter of invitation on Tuesday or Wednesday, which means both Croatia and Albania can expect to participate in NATO expansion ceremonies during the Alliance's summit later this week.

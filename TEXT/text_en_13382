SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament on Wednesday (29 March) adopted the country's new election code, seen as one of the major prerequisites for fair and democratic elections later this year. The code envisions, among other things, that lawmakers would elect the seven-member State Election Commission (SEC) by a two-thirds majority, as proposed by the opposition. SEC members would be appointed to five-year terms with the option for re-election. The new code also provides for restructuring of the municipal election panels, to include three representatives from public administration -- one from the ruling party and one from each leading opposition party.
Also Wednesday, two days of talks on liberalising the EU visa regime for Macedonian citizens ended in Skopje. In making its case, Skopje cited progress made in reforming the interior and judicial sectors. The EU did not announce any decision.

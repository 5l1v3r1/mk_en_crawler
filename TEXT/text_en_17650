BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said on Monday (March 26th) that the country is witnessing the death of the coalition deal between the National Liberal Party (PNL) and the Democratic Party (PD), which in turn may lead to the break-up of the current government. Tariceanu accuses the PD of staging the split, as the PD intends to run without PNL in elections for European Parliament. PD President Emil Boc said the PNL is looking for excuses to push PD out of the coalition, clearing the way for an alliance with the main opposition Social Democratic Party. Boc urged Tariceanu to present a reshuffled government as soon as possible, to calm the situation. (Ziua - 27/03/07; Mediafax, Rompres - 26/03/07)

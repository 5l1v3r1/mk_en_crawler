SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Libya's Supreme Court has decided to hear the appeal of the death sentences of five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor on 25 December, rather than on 31 January, as originally planned, a Bulgarian Foreign Ministry spokesman said Saturday (17 December). The nurses were convicted last year on allegations they infected hundreds of children with AIDS in Benghazi. International experts have disputed the charges and world leaders have called for the prisoners' release. (Nova TV, BNR, Mediapool - 19/12/05; Reuters - 17/12/05)

TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu again called for dialogue and compromise on the part of Albanian politicians regarding electoral reform. In an interview with the daily Shekulli on Wednesday (30 August), Moisiu said the political situation is deteriorating despite his efforts at mediation. He insisted that the ruling party and the opposition must overcome the ongoing political stalemate, especially in light of new obligations that accompanied the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.

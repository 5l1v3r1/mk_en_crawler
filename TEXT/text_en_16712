SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Border police chief Krassimir Petrov met with EU ambassadors in Bulgaria on Thursday (6 July) to brief them on progress in the fight against illegal traffic of drugs and humans. Petrov noted that since the start of the year, border police have prevented some 5,800 people, mainly with criminal records, from fleeing Bulgaria and at the same time, stopped another 2,200 illegal immigrants from entering the country. He also cited the significant decrease in the number of Bulgarians deported from EU member states. (Mediapool, news.bg, Novinite - 06/07/06)

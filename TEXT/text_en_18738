PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- New general elections in Kosovo are expected some nine months after the final decision on the province's status is made, according to OSCE Mission chief in Pristina Werner Wnendt and Kosovo Deputy Prime Minister Lutfi Haziri, who met on Tuesday (February 6th). They said the timeline was envisioned in the UN roadmap for resolving the status issue, presented last week by UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari.

NEW YORK, United States -- Kosovo's Albanians and Serbs must do more to ensure the success of the upcoming negotiations on the province's final status, UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari said on Monday (28 November). The former Finnish president reminded the ethnic Albanian government of Kosovo that more progress must be made in meeting the internationally established set of standards before the status issue could be resolved. Ahtisaari plans to set up offices in Vienna early in 2006 when the first direct meeting between Serbian and Kosovo officials is expected to take place.

VIENNA, Austria -- The situation at the EU's external land border between Greece and Turkey constitutes a fundamental rights emergency, the Vienna-based EU Agency for Fundamental Rights said in a report Tuesday (March 8th). "There is no evidence of a comprehensive emergency response to address conditions in the detention centres despite the availability of EU funds," it added. According to the document, many detention facilities are severely overcrowded, with virtually "a complete absence of independent social and legal counselling", the agency said. 
In other news Tuesday, authorities arrested two women who doctors say prevented medical staff from giving food to hospitalised hunger-striking migrants. A group of around 300 have been refusing to eat for over 40 days, demanding residence permits. Nearly 100 of them have been taken to hospital. According to organisations supporting the strikers, the two women were affiliated with a support network and accompanied the migrants to the hospital.

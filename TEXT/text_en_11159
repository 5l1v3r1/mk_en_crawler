BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The OSCE Ambassador to Serbia-Montenegro, Maurizio Massari, called on Belgrade to acknowledge the truth about atrocities committed during the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and to bring perpetrators to justice. During a judicial seminar Sunday (26 June), Massari said it is in Serbia-Montenegro's vital interest not to "postpone" the moment of truth, given the federal union's aspirations to join the EU. Belgrade should fulfil its international obligations and arrest and extradite all fugitives to the UN tribunal, he said, adding that it is a disgrace that top war crimes indictees Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic remain at large.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Some humanitarian organisations that the UN says support al-Qaeda continue to operate in BiH under new names, Deputy Security Minister Vjekoslav Vukovic told the Banja Luka-based Nezavisne Novine newspaper Thursday (June 26th). "We are investigating certain reports and indications that some of these organisations are active in BiH but under different names. The persons who worked in the forbidden organisations are currently heading other organisations, an indicator that they are still active in BiH," Vukovic said. The UN's list of organisations suspected of affiliation with al-Qaeda includes the Al-Furkhan, Al-Harmain and Al-Masjed Al-Aksa humanitarian foundations, Bosnian Ideal Future, the Global Relief Foundation and Taibah International, all of which have offices in BiH.

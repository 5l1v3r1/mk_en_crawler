PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Both ruling and opposition parties condemned on Sunday (February 21st) an attack on the leader of the main opposition Movement for Change (PzP), Nebojsa Medojevic, who was assaulted outside his home in Podgorica on Saturday. The ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) vowed that authorities will do their best to shed light on the circumstances related to the incident. Medojevic said he fears for his life but refused police protection. He vowed to continue fighting organised crime. Three opposition parties -- the Socialist People's Party (SNP), the New Serbian Democracy and the PzP -- say they will ask President Filip Vujanovic to convene a session of the Defence and Security Council to discuss the fight against organised crime. 
The opposition leader was attacked by Nenad Micunovic, who tried to hit him and warned him "to stop mentioning the name of Branislav Micunovic", a wealthy businessman that Medojevic has described as "the most powerful person" in the country, allegedly controlling even the police. His relative, the alleged assailant, is in custody but will only be charged with disturbing the public order. (RTS, Cafemontenegro, RTCG, Beta, Tanjug, B92 - 21/02/10)

TIRANA, Albania -- A day before the new parliament convenes Monday (September 7th), President Bamir Topi invited incoming members Sunday to contribute to a stronger democracy. "We have to get working by thinking as responsible citizens, in order for Albania to finish the difficult years of political transition and strengthen the basis of a democratic society, where freedom and respect of values are considered the key to success and security," said Topi in a statement. He recalled that the speed of Albania's EU integration, among other things, depends on the continuation of reforms aimed at establishing the rule of law, real political equality and a justice system that meets European standards. The opposition Socialist Party says its members will boycott Monday's opening session to protest what they described as the government's manipulation of the June 28th general election.

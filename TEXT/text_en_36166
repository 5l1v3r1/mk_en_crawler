BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said Thursday (11 March) that the war crimes trial of six Serbs, which started in Belgrade earlier this week, is of great importance to his country. He expressed confidence that the proceedings will dispel doubts abroad about Serbia's ability to handle such cases. All six defendants pleaded not guilty, insisting they were not present when nearly 200 Croatian hospital patients were executed at a farm near Vukovar in November 1991. (AFP - 11/03/04)

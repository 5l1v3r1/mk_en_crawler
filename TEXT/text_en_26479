BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Albania's hopes to obtain the status of EU candidate country suffered a setback Thursday (October 8th) when Germany asked the EU Permanent Representatives Committee to remove the topic from its agenda. Reportedly, Germany said it needed more time to decide its position on the issue. Albania submitted its EU membership application in April when the Czech Republic held the rotating bloc presidency.

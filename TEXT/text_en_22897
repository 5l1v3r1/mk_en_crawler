PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Pieter Feith, head of the International Civilian Office in Kosovo, welcomed this week's decision by Pristina to extend the mandates of the legally appointed municipal chiefs in the Serb-dominated towns in Kosovo. "This decision makes the legal status of the governing structures in these five municipalities clear," Feith said on Saturday (July 5th). Former UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker appointed the municipal chiefs in December 2007. Last week, Serbs in Kosovo formed their own parliament of representatives from 26 municipalities in Kosovo, basing it on results of May 11th parliamentary and local elections in Serbia. UNMIK said the Kosovo Serb parliament has no legal authority. (B92, FoNet - 06/07/08; RTRS - 05/07/08)

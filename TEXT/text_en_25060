ZAGREB, Croatia -- The main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) announced plans Friday (November 27th) to request the dismissal of Transport Minister Bozidar Kalmeta, blaming him for corruption within the Croatian Motorways (HAC), the leading highway operator. They say he should take political responsibility for other key companies under control of the transport ministry such as Croatian Railways and the Croatian Post. On Thursday, police arrested five HAC officials, including the former CEO and a former member of the management board, for allegedly negotiating contracts that resulted in huge losses to the state company. Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor defended Kalmeta following the arrests, insisting he was unaware of fraud in the HAC. (Index, HINA, Nacional - 27/11/09)

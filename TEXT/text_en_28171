SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- An IMF mission arrives on Wednesday (August 18th) for a several-day visit to assess performance and reforms mandated by a 1.2 billion-euro stand-by arrangement. Some local media speculate there's little chance the Fund to approve the release of the next 38m-euro tranche, as the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) failed again to meet a precondition, the implementation of required reforms. The IMF made clear during the last review in May that FBiH's failure to address the situation was the main reason for its decision to delay funding. (BHRT, Sarajevo-x.com, RTRS, Fena - 18/08/10)

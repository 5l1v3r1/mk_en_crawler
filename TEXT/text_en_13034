SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Council of Ministers appointed members of the executive and managing boards of the directorate for implementing police reforms Thursday (29 December). Taib Spahic will lead the executive board, with Perica Stanic and Marko Dominkovic as his deputies. The operational panels of the directorate will include three legal experts, two for logistics and finance, two for budget, two for police operations and one for human resources. All those involved in the work of the executive panels will resign from their current positions, allowing them to focus only on this issue.
In other news, the Republika Srpska Parliament and the Federation of BiH House of Representatives adopted measures for temporary financing after the two entities failed to pass the 2006 budget.
Also Thursday, British Ambassador to BiH Matthew Rycroft said he hopes a spirit of compromise will prevail when talks resume next week on constitutional reforms. The effort is aimed at streamlining the entity and central governments, with an eye to boosting institutional efficiency. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 30/12/05; RTRS, PBS BiH, Fena - 29/12/05)

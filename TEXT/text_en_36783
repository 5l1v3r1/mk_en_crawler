THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal decided Monday (19 July) that the defence phase of the trial of Slobodan Milosevic should be completed by October 2005. Starting on 31 August, the court will hold a total of 150 trial days at a rate of three sessions per week. The judges also signaled that they were considering the possible appointment of a defence attorney to represent the former Yugoslav leader during his frequent illnesses. The court asked the prosecution to submit its opinion on the role such a counsel would play in the trial and on what should be done if the defendant refuses to accept the appointment. Prosecutors have until 26 July to do so. (AFP - 19/07/04)

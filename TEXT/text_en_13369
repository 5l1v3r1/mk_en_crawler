SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Defence Minister Veselin Bliznakov refuted remarks on Wednesday (21 September) by General Nikola Kolev, chief of general staff, who says Washington has asked Bulgaria to postpone the withdrawal of its 450 troops from Iraq by three months. Bliznakov insisted that the defence ministry is working on the assumption the peacekeeping force would come home at the end of the year. The final decision on timing rests with parliament.

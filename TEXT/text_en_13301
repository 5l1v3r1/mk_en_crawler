WASHINGTON, United States -- The Special Co-ordinator of the Stability Pact for Southeast Europe, Erhard Busek, says border demarcation issues between Macedonia and Kosovo must be resolved, but only after the settlement of the Kosovo status issue. Skopje media reports quote Busek as saying this during a speech at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Centre late last week.
In other news, EU envoy to Macedonia Erwan Fouere urged local politicians Monday (20 February) to ensure that reforms proceed regardless of elections later this year. Acknowledging the significance of the vote as a measure of democratic maturity, Fouere stressed that the reforms must continue since their pace is crucial to the launch of EU accession negotiations. 
Also Monday, 30 opposition parties led by the VMRO-DPMNE issued a joint declaration calling on the government to suspend the privatisation procedure for the state power utility ESM Distribucija. The opposition says ESM should be privatised only after Macedonia joins the EU. (A1 TV, Makfax, Macedonian Government Web site - 21/02/06; Makfax, A1 TV, Telma TV - 20/02/06)

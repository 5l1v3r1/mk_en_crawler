SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Croatia will not impose reciprocal import duties on BiH goods for now, despite BiH's recent introduction of such duties on Croatian meat and dairy products, it was said after a meeting between BiH Foreign Trade Minister Dragan Doko and Croatian Agricultural Minister Petar Cobanovic on Friday (22 April). The two met in Sarajevo to discuss recent problems with implementation of the bilateral Free Trade Agreement. BiH authorities have insisted that the new duties -- imposed by the government under pressure from local farmers -- would have no serious impact, as they affected only 2.8 per cent of Croatian imports to BiH. Doko and Cobanovic agreed that the negotiations would continue. (Fena, HRT - 22/04/05)

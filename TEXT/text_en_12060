BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica is proposing that he and Kosovo counterpart Bajram Kosumi meet for the first time on 24 May in Prizren, according to a statement released Sunday (15 May). Kostunica and the Serbian government's co-ordinator for Kosovo, Nebojsa Covic, say they are prepared to meet Kosumi and his associates for talks concerning all problems facing the province. Kosumi's spokesman Daut Dauni said Sunday that no official invitation had been delivered. 
In other news, the OSCE Mission to Kosovo announced on Friday the launch of an internship programme aimed at assisting parliament's functions. The project envisions assigning university students to all Kosovo parliamentary groups, to strengthen the democratic process for future generations. 
Also Friday, a new mass grave, believed to contain the bodies of Serbs missing since the 1998-1999 conflict, was found in Kosovo. A UNMIK forensic team has started exhumation work at the site, located in the town of Malisevo which was an ethnic Albanian guerrilla stronghold during the conflict.

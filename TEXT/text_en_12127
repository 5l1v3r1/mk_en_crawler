ANKARA, Turkey -- Budget airline Onur Air has rejected claims that its planes are unsafe and vowed to fight a ban imposed by several European countries. Germany and the Netherlands temporarily withdrew landing rights from the airline on Thursday (12 May), leaving many tourists stranded in Turkey. France and Switzerland also later imposed a ban on the airline. "The safety claims are not fair. We would not allow a plane to fly if it had any faults," the airline's Deputy Chairman Sahabettin Bolukcu told Reuters on Saturday. He said up to 50,000 passengers had been affected by the new restrictions, though many had reached their destinations via other airlines. (CNN, Reuters - 14/05/05

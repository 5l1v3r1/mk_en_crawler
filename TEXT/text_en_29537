SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Ahead of Sunday's (October 3rd) general elections, British and German foreign ministers William Hague and Guido Westerwelle are urging Bosnian voters to support leaders who will work to achieve EU integration. In a joint statement Thursday, Hague and Westerwelle said that BiH has clear European prospects. They urged politicians to "turn the page on the past" and embrace the future. "Bosnia deserves a secure and prosperous future in the EU. It needs determination, compromise and genuine leadership to get there," they said. The two officials also called on the politicians to co-operate with the EU, NATO and the international community. Separately, US Ambassador to BiH Patrick Moon urged leaders to choose compromise over confrontation in order to implement crucial reforms. (Fena, RTRS, AFP, AP - 30/09/10)

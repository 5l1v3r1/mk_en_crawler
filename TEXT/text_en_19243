ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Police say a group of three boys threw Molotov cocktails Sunday (March 30th) at the office of a newspaper known for its sharp criticism of the government. A fire broke out after the attack against the Cumhuriyet headquarters in the European part of the city, but no damage or injuries were reported. Police arrested one of children, a 13-year-old, who reportedly said the attack was ordered by someone else. The Cumhuriyet is an ardent supporter of Turkey's secular principles and has accused the ruling Justice and Development Party of having a secret agenda to introduce religious rule. The newspaper's chief editor and prominent columnist, Ilhan Selcuk, was detained on March 21st for suspected links to the outlawed ultranationalist Ergenekon organisation.
Meanwhile, a court in Istanbul filed more charges against Ergenekon members suspected of drawing up a secret plan to topple the government. Two politicians and one journalist were arrested on Saturday on suspicion of stealing secret documents. In all, 47 people have been arrested.

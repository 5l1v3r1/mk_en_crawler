ANKARA, Turkey -- Two people were killed, and at least seven were injured, when a bomb exploded in the southeastern town of Catak on Sunday (3 September) evening. One of the dead was a police officer. The device had been placed in a garbage bin and was detonated when police arrived to check the suspicious package. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but a Kurdish extremist group, the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons, admitted carrying out a series of similar bombings last week.

TIRANA, Albania -- Education Minister Myqerem Tafaj promised on Tuesday (September 29th) to further change a newly revised history textbook, which was slammed as incorrect by opposition parties and the media. Tafaj added that every mistake in the textbook will be corrected by year's end. In the textbook for 12th graders, events related to a 1997 state crisis caused by the collapse of fraudulent financial pyramid schemes, are described as "a communist revolution orchestrated by the socialist opposition". The crisis led to the collapse of a government led by Democratic Party (DS) leader Sali Berisha, who now heads the cabinet. (Shekulli, Start, Balkan Web, Telegrafi - 29/09/09)

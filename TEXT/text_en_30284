ATHENS, Greece -- The government unveiled on Saturday (December 18th) an ambitious privatisation programme designed to pump 7 billion euros into the state budget and help deal with the financial crisis. The plan includes the sell-off of state stakes in railway and transport companies, the Athens airport, water supply and utility firms, the postal service, the state lottery, and port and highway concessions. It is to be implemented over the next three years. 
The announcement came a day after the IMF said it has approved the payment of another 2.5 billion euros of Greece's 110b-euro bailout plan. According to the Fund, Greek authorities are "to be commended" for their efforts to implement budget cuts, but should implement additional reforms in order to meet growth targets.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan lashed out Sunday (11 April) at critics of the UN-proposed plan for the reunification of Cyprus. Erdogan blamed them for failing to read the 9000-page proposal. He defended the plan as the best possible solution, crafted by UN experts who have studied the problem for years. Erdogan added that should either the Turkish Cypriots or Greek Cypriots fail to approve the plan during the 24 April referenda, Turkish troops would remain in northern Cyprus. Both Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash have called for the plan to be rejected.
Erdogan is now on an official two-day visit to Tokyo. The focus will be on further strengthening already solid bilateral ties and on boosting economic co-operation. (MSNBC - 12/04/04)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic headed to the United States on Wednesday (August 13th), where he will present the UN General Assembly with Serbia's official proposal to refer the issue of Kosovo's independence to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Jeremic said he is confident Serbia has summoned enough support in the UN to receive the green light to address the ICJ. He added that Belgrade would continue to press countries that have not yet recognised Kosovo's independence to refrain from doing so until the court rules on the matter. It will also attempt to block Kosovo from full membership in important international organisations. (Tanjug, Blic, Beta, RTS - 14/08/08; AFP - 13/08/08)

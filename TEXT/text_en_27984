BELGRADE, Serbia -- An agreement to establish a multi-ethnic local government in the southern Serbian municipality of Bujanovac was signed on Thursday (October 21st). Previously, the local administration consisted exclusively of Albanians, who make up more than half the population in the municipality. But under the agreement, representatives of Serb parties will get several positions. Dimitrios Kypreos, director of the OSCE mission in Serbia, attended the signing ceremony and said, "It is a crucial development that the ethnic Albanian leaders of Bujanovac decided to form a coalition with their Serbian co-citizens and to govern this important town together. I hope this decision, which underlines that constructive co-operation is, after all, possible, will receive the echo it deserves." (Tanjug, Beta, Radio Free Europe - 21/10/10)

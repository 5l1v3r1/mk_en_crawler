SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government decided on Thursday (25 August) that the ministries of interior and justice should prepare and submit information about the so-called Krasniqi case next week. The decision came a day after President Branko Crvenkovski strongly reacted to allegations that a local court had lifted the arrest warrant against Agim Krasniqi, an extremist leader whose heavily armed group has barred police from patrolling the village of Kondovo for months. Crvenkovski demanded that the government clarify the issue as soon as possible. 
In other news, Denmark has reiterated its backing for Macedonia's Euro-Atlantic integration bid. Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva was assured of the support during meetings in Copenhagen on Wednesday. (Makfax, A1 TV, Macedonian Government Web site - 25/08/05)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Marking the third anniversary of Kosovo's independence Thursday (February 17th), acting President Jakup Krasniqi decreed amnesty for 103 citizens who have been serving time in local jails. He based his decree on the constitutional provisions and amnesty law, Kosovo's penal code, as well as data collected from departments of prisons, and verdicts of an ad hoc professional commission he had established.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The government adopted a statement Tuesday (12 August) responding to Albanian Defence Minister Pandeli Majko's decision not to attend an upcoming regional security conference in Montenegro. Majko has said he is staying away from the conference in protest of Serbia's move to accept a constitution that describes Kosovo as a constituent part of Serbian territory. Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic said the Serbian cabinet views his stance as a flagrant interference in the country's internal affairs, adding that it has damaged relations between the two countries at a time when all efforts were focused on integration and improved co-operation. The statement has been forwarded to the Serbia-Montenegro government for approval, Zivkovic said. (Beta, B92 - 13/08/03; Tanjug, Serbian Radio - 12/08/03)

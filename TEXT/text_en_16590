TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha vowed radical measures to fight crime and corruption, during a news conference Wednesday (10 May). He said his government is drafting severe penalties against individuals or structures with proven links to organised crime. Also under consideration are budgetary changes aimed at allocating more funds to the police, as well as possible changes to the penal code, which would tighten sanctions against those trafficking women and children. 
In other news, local media reports suggest ties between Albania and China have grown strained over a case involving five Chinese Uighur Muslims, who were released recently from the US prison at Guantanamo Bay and given asylum in Albania. According to the Albanian News, US authorities did not send them back to China, in light of human rights concerns there. China continues to seek their extradition.

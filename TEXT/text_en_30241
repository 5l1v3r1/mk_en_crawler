PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The leader of the New Kosovo Alliance (AKR) party, Behgjet Pacolli, will test the parliament Tuesday (February 22nd) to see if he has the votes needed to make him president. "I don't know," Pacolli said on Monday when asked whether he has enough support. The governing coalition agreement signed among the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), the largest parliamentary group with 34 seats, and minority parties, does not mean Pacolli has a lock on the job. PDK members in parliament have indicated they will decide individually about Pacolli, the Koha Ditore daily reported on Tuesday. Parliament is also expected to vote on the new government.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski told the newspaper Dnevnik on Thursday (July 17th) that he will not seek another term. Crvenkovski, who leads the main opposition Social Democratic Union of Macedonia, said his decision is final. "Carrying out the presidential functions makes me co-exist with the government [led by Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski from the VMRO-DPMNE], and I disagree with its policies on many issues," Crvenkovski explained. His five-year mandate expires in 2009. (Dnevnik, Utrinski Vesnik, Vecer - 17/07/08; A1 - 16/07/08)

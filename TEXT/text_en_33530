ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul met on Monday (22 September) with members of the Iraqi Interim Governing Council, including President Ahmad Chalabi, Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari and government member Adnan Pachadji. Gul expressed support for the council, stressing the stability it would bring to the region. He added that Turkey might send troops to Iraq if this would "reduce the impression of a foreign occupation there". Washington has requested Turkish peacekeepers but Ankara has postponed its decision due to strong opposition at home.
In other news Monday, the United States and Turkey signed the agreement on a loan worth $8.5 billion to support Turkey's economic programme. The funds will be used for repayment of foreign and domestic debts in a bid to reduce the impact of the war in neighbouring Iraq. Washington insists there is no link between the loan and Turkey's pending decision on peacekeepers. The loans would carry a maturity of 10 years, with a four-year grace period (Anadolu Agency, AFP, Reuters, AP, Dow Jones - 22/09/03)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The leaders of Serbia's ruling coalition will meet this week to discuss the timing of presidential elections, the Beta agency reported on Sunday (October 28th). Sources say Democratic Party (DS), Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) and G17 Plus leaders Boris Tadic, Vojislav Kostunica and Mladjan Dinkic did not meet at the weekend as expected. Instead, intensified discussions will be held over the next few days.
The DS reportedly backs elections on December 9th, but the DSS wants them postponed at least until after the Kosovo status negotiations end on the 10th. The law on implementing the constitution stipulates that presidential and local elections must be called by the end of this year. (Vecernje Novosti, Blic - 29/10/07; Beta, B92, Tanjug - 28/10/07)

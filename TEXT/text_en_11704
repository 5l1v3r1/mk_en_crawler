BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown has confirmed that Republika Srpska (RS) still might face sanctions for obstructing the reform process. In an interview published in Tuesday's (21 June) edition of Nezavisne novine, Ashdown said punitive measures might be introduced if RS and the ruling Serb Democratic Party decide to choose the path of isolation instead of EU integration. He refused to elaborate. Ashdown instead reiterated that BiH still has a chance to start Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with the EU this year, but only if it implements set reforms. 
In other news, newly appointed Senior Deputy High Representative Martin Ney outlined his priorities in remarks Monday. He mentioned the realisation of EU-related reforms in two sectors, police and public broadcasting. Ney took over the post on 7 June. (Nezavisne novine, Dnevni avaz - 21/06/05; RTRS - 20/06/05)

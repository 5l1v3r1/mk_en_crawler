TIRANA, Albania -- UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions Philip Alston warned on Tuesday (February 23rd) about the widespread acceptance of resolving personal conflicts with violence. Wrapping up a nine-day fact-finding mission to Tirana, he issued a statement saying, "blood feud killings -- revenge killings by a victim's family against the killer's family -- continue to have corrosive effects on society", and he urged the government to collect data on such incidents and boost measures to reconcile families. 
In a speech to parliament Tuesday, Alston also called for Albania's full co-operation in investigations into the alleged trafficking of human organs, removed from Serb civilians kidnapped during the 1999 conflict in Kosovo. He accused the government of creating "formal obstacles" to an ongoing investigation. (Reuters, UN News Centre - 23/02/10)

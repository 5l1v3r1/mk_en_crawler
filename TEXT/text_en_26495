ATHENS, Greece -- Staffers at Greece's national radio and television, ERT, staged a 24-hour warning strike Wednesday (November 11th), stopping all news shows. The protestors demand that all employees working under temporary contracts get permanent ones, and those who have been dismissed should be re-hired. They also want back wages and benefits for all employees. ERT chief Christos Panagopoulos resigned on Monday after the new government ignored his repeated calls to discuss "crucial and pressing issues". (ANA-MPA - 11/11/09; Kathimerini - 10/11/09)

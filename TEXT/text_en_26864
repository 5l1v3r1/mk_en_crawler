SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Austrian Major General Bernhard Bair took over command of the European peacekeeping force in BiH, EUFOR, on Friday (December 4th), now that Major General Stefano Castagnotto has completed his one-year mandate. "I am ready to face the challenges ahead and to seize all opportunities the coming year may offer for the progress of security," Bair said in a speech at Camp Butmir. EUFOR took over peacekeeping operations in BiH from NATO in 2004. Currently, it includes around 2,000 personnel from 25 countries. (EUFOR website, AFP - 04/12/09)

NEW YORK, United States -- Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou and his Turkish counterpart, Abdullah Gul, agreed on Thursday (25 September) that the Cyprus issue should be resolved by the end of 2004. That is when the EU is to take up Turkey's request for a concrete date to start accession negotiations. The two ministers met in New York within the framework of the 58th UN General Assembly session. They agreed to continue negotiations during Gul's visit to Athens on 21 October. (BTA - 26/09/03; ANA, CAN - 25/09/03)

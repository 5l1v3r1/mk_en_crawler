ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Ivo Josipovic is reacting sharply to Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor's criticism of a speech he made in Sarajevo last week, in which he apologised for Croatia's policy toward Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) during the 1990's. Local media reported on Saturday (April 17th) that he has all but invited Kosor to initiate an impeachment procedure against him, if she believes that his statements were unconstitutional. If, however, it turns out they were not, he will ask for her resignation. This is the first serious political confrontation between the cabinet and the president since Josipovic took office in mid-February. (Poslovni, Business.hr - 18/04/10; Nova TV, HINA - 17/04/10)

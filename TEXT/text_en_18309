ANKARA, Turkey -- Italian Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema pledged that his country would continue supporting Turkey's bid for EU membership, during a visit to Ankara and talks with Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul on Wednesday (June 13th). D'Alema said Italy would seek the start of negotiations on more chapters of the acquis with Turkey, even before Portugal assumes the rotating EU presidency from Germany next month. D'Alema also urged Turkey to restrain from any moves that could increase tensions, such as a cross-border operation against Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) bases in northern Iraq. He also called on Iraqi authorities to work with its neighbours to combat terrorism. 
In other news, a roadside bomb killed a Turkish army major near the town of Yuksekova in Hakkari province on Wednesday. Two soldiers were injured in the blast, which occurred only a day after the PKK announced a unilateral ceasefire. (Zaman - 14/06/07; NTV, EPA, AFP, AP - 13/06/07)

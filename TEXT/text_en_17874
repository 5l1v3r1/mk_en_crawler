BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has again urged the leaders of Serbia's democratic parties to reach an agreement on forming a new government as soon as possible. Rehn warned on Monday (April 16th) that delays in establishing the new cabinet -- still elusive nearly three months after the January 21st parliamentary elections -- are affecting the possibility of resuming negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. War crimes co-operation remains a key requirement, he added.
Rehn also met in Brussels with Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs Gabriela Konevska-Trajkovska, telling her that the timing of EU membership depends on the pace of reforms. He praised the resumption of political dialogue and efforts to improve the political climate after months of stalemate.

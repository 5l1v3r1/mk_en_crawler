VIENNA, Austria -- Former Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader on Sunday (December 12th) told a court in Salzburg, Austria, that he is not guilty of charges Croatia has brought against him and denied he was trying to evade justice there. He is in custody in Austria, pending possible extradition to Zagreb. Sanader was apprehended on Friday after Croatia issued an international warrant for his arrest. He fled his country just hours before parliament voted to strip him of his immunity as a lawmaker. He is reportedly under investigation for possible criminal actions and abuse of power.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki is expected to visit Ankara next month, with August 13th as the most probable date, the Anadolu news agency quoted Iraqi government sources as saying. The goal would be to reassure Turkey of Baghdad's commitment to dealing with security issues in the northern part of Iraq.
Meanwhile, Turkey said on Saturday that four leaders of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terrorist group were killed in a suicide attack in northern Iraq. The PKK has denied the reports, and accused Turkish media of regularly broadcasting false reports. (Anadolu news agency, AP, AFP, Cihan, Kathimerini, Reuters - 28/07/07)

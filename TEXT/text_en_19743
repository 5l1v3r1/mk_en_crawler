PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UNMIK has ordered an independent inquiry into the escape of seven dangerous inmates from Kosovo's Dubrava prison, officials announced on Wednesday (August 22nd). The escapees include a Saudi national wanted on murder and terrorism charges in Macedonia, and a leader of the Albanian National Army, a terrorist group blamed for several bombings in Kosovo and Macedonia. Five prison guards have been charged as accomplices. Four other guards have been implicated. 
Kosovo police suggest the convicts may have fled Kosovo and are hiding in neighbouring Macedonia or Albania. On Wednesday, the Macedonian Interior Ministry said it had no such information. (Vecer, Dnevnik - 23/08/07; Tanjug, Reuters, B92, A1, dpa, AFP - 22/08/07)

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Two shots were fired Saturday (February 26th) at the front door of a newspaper office in northern Cyprus, in an apparent warning to its editor. Afrika has supported ending the north's partial occupation by Turkish troops. The newspaper has also encouraged protestors who carried anti-Turkish banners at a recent rally against austerity measures to bring them to another rally this week. (Cyprus Mail, Xinhua - 26/02/11)

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The government has suspended its controversial "economic citizenship" programme, foreign ministry official Zeljko Stamatovic said on Sunday (November 7th). Under the programme, launched in August, Montenegro offered citizenship to any member of the business community who invests over 500,000 euros in the country. The programme was suspended in order to harmonise policies with those of the EU. (RTCG, TV Vijesti, Pcnen - 08/11/10)

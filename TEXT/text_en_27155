ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government approved a proposal on Thursday (October 1st) on constitutional changes required for EU accession and forwarded it to parliament. Some of the amendments cover conditions for holding referendums -- easing requirements somewhat. Also proposed is the possibility of extraditing Croatian citizens sought under EU arrest warrants, following accession to the Union. Another stipulates that the National Bank of Croatia, the National Audit Office and the State Judicial Council will be independent. The role and activities of the army would also be redefined, in line with NATO membership. Any decision to deploy military personnel would require majority backing, rather than the current two-thirds margin. Lastly, Bosnians and Slovenians would be included among the minorities listed in the preamble of the constitution. (Vjesnik, HINA, HRT - 01/10/09)

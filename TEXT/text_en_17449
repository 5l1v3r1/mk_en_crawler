ANKARA, Turkey -- The Cassation Court denied on Tuesday (June 26th) the right of the Istanbul-based head of the Orthodox Church, Bartholomew I, to be called universal or ecumenical patriarch. According to the ruling, as the Patriarchate is based in Turkey, it is subject to Turkish law, which does not permit granting "special status" to any minority group. As a result, Turkey will continue to recognise Bartholomew only as head of the local Greek Orthodox community, numbering around 3,000. The ruling is being seen as another attempt by Turkish authorities to trim the influence of Bartholomew and prevent the Patriarchate from gaining Vatican-like status.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday (February 1st) that the Alliance supports all strategies that strengthen peace and security in Kosovo, including the integration of all communities into society. The strategy for the Serb-dominated north, which was drafted by the International Civilian Office (ICO) in support of Kosovo's government, failed to get formal support from NATO or the EU. Media reports say diplomats in Brussels are reporting that the plan is backed by many EU and NATO members, including the EU states that do not recognise Kosovo. Speaking to journalists in Brussels ahead of an informal meeting of NATO defence ministers in Istanbul this week, Rasmussen said that the Alliance's priorities are Afghanistan, Kosovo and plans for a new strategic concept. Rasmussen announced that a further, gradual reduction of NATO troops in Kosovo could be considered only "if circumstances ... will allow".

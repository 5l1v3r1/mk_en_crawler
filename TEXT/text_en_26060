BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) wants to see concrete results from efforts to solve the political stalemate in Albania, according to a spokesperson for EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele. Angela Filote made the statement Monday (February 15th). Albanian opposition parties have been boycotting parliament since September over alleged fraud in the June 2009 general election. Fuele has said the crisis hurts Albania's application to become an EU candidate. 
In Tirana, Vice Prime Minister Ilir Meta said Monday that negotiations between the government and the opposition aimed at ending the ongoing political stalemate should not involve ultimatums. Meta's made the statement a day after opposition Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama and Prime Minister Sali Berisha met to discuss ways to end the SP boycott of parliament. Meta maintains that a probe of the 2009 election would violate the country's constitution. (Top Channel, Lajmifundit, Telegrafi NOA, Ora News - 16/02/10)

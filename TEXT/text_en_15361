PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The third official round of negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU began in Podgorica on Tuesday (26 September). SAA talks had been suspended while Montenegro was part of a state union with Serbia, but the newly independent state now hopes to wrap up the negotiations by the end of this year. Montenegrin authorities say the current round will deal with the judiciary and internal affairs, opening of markets, agriculture and ecology. 
Also Tuesday, US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld arrived in Podgorica, becoming the first senior US official to visit since Montenegro declared independence in May. He voiced Washington's full support for Montenegro's bid to join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme. Rumsfeld next travels to Tirana for Wednesday's annual meeting of the Southeast Europe defence ministers. (MINA, Pobjeda - 26/09/06; Montenegrin government website - 25/09/06)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Justice Minister Barisa Colak says BiH will not extradite its citizens to other countries, regardless of the type of the arrest warrant involved, local media reported on Sunday (July 26th). He was responding to his Serbian counterpart Snezana Malovic, who visited Interpol's headquarters in Lyon to ask for the reactivation of arrest warrants against 19 Bosniaks suspected of war crimes against Serbians in Sarajevo in 1992. Colak stressed that Malovic's move does not contribute to the resolution of pending issues between the two countries. Interpol decided to suspend the arrest warrants earlier this month.

STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament (EP) holds a joint debate Wednesday (July 7th) on two European Commission resolutions regarding progress Kosovo and Albania have made to join the EU, ahead of votes on the documents Thursday. The EP's Foreign Policy Committee adopted the resolutions on June 23rd. The one on Albania welcomed the country's progress, but urged more efforts to curb corruption, which continues to be a "prevailing problem". It also calls for a solution to the ongoing political stalemate in Tirana. The other resolution calls on EU member states that have not recognised Kosovo's independence to do so. It also urges local authorities and EULEX to demonstrate specific results in combating corruption and organised crime, including in high-level cases. The motion also supports including Kosovo in the EU's visa liberalisation process. (Koha.Net, Shekulli, Balkanweb, Deutsche Welle, Alsat TV - 06/07/10)

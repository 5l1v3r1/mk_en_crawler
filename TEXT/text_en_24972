BUCHAREST, Romania -- Education trade unions announced on Thursday (April 30th) that they will hold a national strike on the days of national exams -- on May 5th, 13th and 21st. Representatives of the unions are protesting against the cut in education budget and an urgent governmental decision dated April 28th which froze salaries in the public sector until December 31st. Trade unions believe that the measure will result either in the dismissal of some teachers or in reducing the salaries in the sector by at least 10%. (AP, Romania Libera, Realitatea - 30/04/09)

TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Democratic Party of former President Sali Berisha announced on Monday (13 October) that it would contest the results of Sunday's elections in the two largest cities, Tirana and Durres. Berisha accused the ruling Socialist Party of fraud, manipulation, and tampering with the voter lists. Socialist Party Secretary General Gramoz Ruci rejected the charges and claimed victory in 36 of Albania's 65 largest towns. The Democrats also declared victory, saying that they made significant inroads in the south. The electoral commission has not yet released official results. The OSCE is expected to report on the fairness of the election later on Tuesday. Government spokesman Aldrin Dalipi described the vote as "fully free, fair and democratic", and said it showed the type of maturity essential to Euro-Atlantic integration.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash said Wednesday (17 March) that he would not attend the second round of Cyprus reunification talks, due to start in Switzerland on 24 March. He told reporters that there has been no progress on the main issues. According to an earlier understanding, the two sides have until 22 March to reach an agreement. Greece and Turkey are to join the talks on 24 March and will have one week to reach a deal on ending the island's division. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan will act as arbiter on all unresolved issues after that.
Turkish and Greek officials meanwhile met in Athens on Wednesday to discuss the security aspects of reunification. A Greek spokesman praised the atmosphere of the talks as "positive and constructive", adding agreements were reached on some issues. (AFP, TRT 2, Anadolu Agency, NTV - 17/03/04)

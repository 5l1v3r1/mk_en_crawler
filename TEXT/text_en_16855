BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Ratko Mladic's wife alleged Thursday (6 April) that four relatives of Mladic were detained in a police raid the previous day. Reuters quoted Bosa Mladic as also saying a business owned by her son had been probed. The report comes as pressure mounts for Belgrade to resolve the Mladic case, a key obstacle to efforts to rejoin the international community. A spokesperson for UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte said Thursday that Serbian officials have pledged to hand over Mladic this month. In other news Wednesday, Serbian prosecutors announced that they are investigating war crimes allegedly committed in Slovenia in 1991. At issue is the murder of three soldiers of the former Yugoslav Army by the Slovene military, as the three -- waving white flags -- attempted to surrender at the Holmec border crossing. A probe is also under way in Ljubljana. (Danas, Blic - 06/04/06; Tanjug, Xinhua - 05/04/06)

STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor and Croatian counterpart Jadranka Kosor signed the arbitration agreement aimed at resolving their countries' long-standing border dispute in Stockholm on Wednesday (November 4th). Swedish counterpart Fredrik Reinfeldt also signed the agreement, as his country holds the rotating EU presidency. The Croatian parliament approved it on Monday, along with a unilateral statement underscoring that the agreement does not pre-judge the outcome of international arbitration. The agreement should end Slovenia's opposition to Croatia's EU accession bid. (HRT, Javno, STA - 04/11/09; HRT, STA, HINA, Poslovni, Index, Vecernji List, Reuters - 03/11/09)

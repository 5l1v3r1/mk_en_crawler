ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on Friday (May 1st) that he replaced nine ministers in a major cabinet reshuffle. The move came following the ruling Justice and Development Party's disappointing performance in the March local elections. President Abdullah Gul approved the changes. The ministers of foreign affairs, economy, finance, justice, energy, education, housing, industry and trade, were changed in the reshuffle. 
In other news, an Ankara court on Saturday ordered the arrest of two people who allegedly attempted to assassinate former Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk. On Wednesday, a woman detonated a small bomb near Turk's office at Ankara's Bilkent University, and police arrested a second suspected suicide bomber hours after the incident. Turk said he has received death threats following a prison uprising in December 2000 when he was justice minister, in which several inmates and prison guards were killed.

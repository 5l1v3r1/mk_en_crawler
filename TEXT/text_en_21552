ATHENS, Greece -- Serbian Socialist Party (SPS) leader Ivica Dacic met on Friday (May 23rd) with the president of Socialist International (SI), George Papandreou, who is also the leader of PASOK, Greece's top opposition party. Papandreou said that the SI was ready to initiate the process for the SPS's membership. The two officials reviewed the political situation in Serbia, given the SPS's kingmaker status in the future government coalition. Papandreou said earlier that the SPS could join the SI if it decides to support Serbia's EU aspirations and renounces its past ultra-nationalistic policies. (Beta, ANA-MPA, RTS - 23/05/08)

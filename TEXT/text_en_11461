ANKARA, Turkey -- Relations with the United States are one of the two pillars of Turkish foreign policy, Chief of Staff General Hilmi Ozkok said Wednesday (20 April), denying reports of tensions with Washington. He said the two countries are working together to build peace and stability in several areas of the world. The other pillar is relations with the EU, he added. 
Also Wednesday, Ankara announced that it would extend for another year an agreement allowing the United States to use its Incirlik airbase for planes supplying US and allied forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. During a visit to Kabul the same day, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed continued support for the post-conflict reconstruction of Afghanistan.

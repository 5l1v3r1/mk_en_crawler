PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Municipal elections in two Serb-dominated areas in northern Kosovo risk another postponement, Local Government and Administration Minister Sadri Ferati said on Sunday (January 17th). He explained that a change of dates may result from challenges posed by Serb parallel structures. 
Ferati said the plan is to hold elections in the two municipalities - Partesh/Partes and North Mitrovica - six months after the local elections in Kosovo, but he is not sure if that will happen. The first elections held in November established three new Serb-dominated municipalities -- Gracanica, Kllokot-Verbovc and Ranilug. (Zeri, Telegrafi, Epoka e Re - 18/01/10)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Minister for Integrations Besim Beqaj said on Saturday (May 1st) that despite its efforts, Serbia will not hinder Kosovo's EU integration. "Belgrade wants to show that Kosovo is a non-functional and illegitimate state [despite being] recognised by 65 states, including 22 EU member states," Beqaj said. "I call on Belgrade authorities to behave in a European way in order to accelerate the EU integration process," he added. As for visa-free travel, he said "I can not specify any date, but I can say that Kosovo is ready to receive the visa liberalisation roadmap." Non-recognition by five EU member states has complicated the process. (Express, Telegrafi, Kohavision - 02/05/10)

TRIPOLI, Libya -- German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told his Libyan counterpart Abdelrahman Mohammed Shalgam on Tuesday (November 14th) that the EU will pay close attention to the outcome of the trial of five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor. Libya accuses them of infecting more than 400 children with HIV in a Benghazi hospital. The defendants were sentenced to death in 2004, but Libya's Supreme Court ordered a retrial. A new verdict is expected on December 19th. 
"I tried to again make clear to those responsible here that this problem has to be solved. I hope very much that a decision will be made that leads to the freedom of the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor," Steinmeier said. A special fund has been created to treat the children, many of whom have been moved to European hospitals. (AFP - 14/11/06)

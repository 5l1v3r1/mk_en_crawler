TIRANA, Albania -- An OSCE-sponsored roundtable on reforming how Albania's voter lists are compiled took place in Tirana on Wednesday (1 February). The OSCE Presence in Albania said participants included representatives of the central election commission, local political parties, the ODIHR and the International Foundation for Electoral Systems. It was part of an effort to strengthen the election system, particularly clearing duplicate entries and other inaccuracies from voters' rolls, in line with recommendations made by the OSCE/ODIHR following the July 2005 parliamentary vote.

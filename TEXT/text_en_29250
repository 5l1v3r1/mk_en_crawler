NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Police said on Friday (July 2nd) that a suspected Russian spy wanted by the United States has likely left the island. Robert Christopher Metsos, the suspected paymaster of a spy ring, was detained last week at the airport in Larnaca as he was about to leave for Budapest. He was released on $20,000 bail, pending extradition, but failed to appear at the police station Wednesday as ordered and was declared missing. "There is a strong possibility that he has fled on a vessel from any of the many marinas in Cyprus," a source said, on condition of anonymity. "A long shot is that he has crossed over to the Turkish occupied part of the island," he added. On Saturday, President Demetris Christofias said Cypriot authorities are not to blame for the disappearance. (AP - 03/07/10; Xinhua - 02/07/10)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Former Prime Minister and Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) leader Vojislav Kostunica on Saturday (March 12th) criticised plans to question him about the political situation at the time one of his predecessors, Zoran Djindjic, was assassinated. Local media reports suggest he will be questioned to determine whether Djindjic's 2003 assassination amounted to political persecution. "I have nothing to do with the political background to Zoran Djindjic's killing and neither does the DSS," said Kostunica, who was prime minister from 2003 to 2008. He says the prosecution is being "misused" to launch a political campaign against the DSS. (Tanjug, Nezavisne Novine, Radio Free Europe, RTS - 12/03/11; B92 - 11/03/11)

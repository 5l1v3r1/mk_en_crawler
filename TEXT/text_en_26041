ATHENS, Greece -- The extremist group Conspiracy of Fire Nuclei claimed responsibility on Monday (November 16th) for a bomb outside the Athens home of a parliament member last week. In a statement published on the internet, the group called PASOK member Mimis Androulakis "a television-friendly lackey of those in power". It also stated that five suspected members of the organisation, who have been arrested and charged with terrorism, have no ties to the group whatsoever. The bombing caused minor damage but no injuries. (AP, AFP - 16/11/09)

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) celebrated Republic Day on Sunday (January 9th), marking 19 years of existence. Entity President Milorad Dodik remarked that RS was created as a result of the will of Serbs in BiH, but is open to all citizens, regardless of their religion, national or political affiliation. He stressed that the entity strives for EU membership but will not renounce its identity in order to achieve that goal. Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic was among those attending a reception in Banja Luka. RS was created on January 9th 1992 when the Assembly of the Serb People in BiH proclaimed the Republic of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina, now called RS. It was internationally recognised under the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement. (RTS, Tanjug, RTRS, BHRT, Nezavisne Novine - 09/01/11)

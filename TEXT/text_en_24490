PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government announced Thursday (May 7th) that it is launching the process of fulfilling criteria to achieve visa liberalisation with EU countries. Acknowledging that the non-recognition of Kosovo's independence by five EU member states will be an obstacle to completing the process, the government approved guidelines for implementing visa liberalisation criteria set by the European Commission. Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said that one of the most important tasks of his cabinet this year would be to take the first steps in visa liberalisation and to take concrete measures to secure the free movement of Kosovo citizens in EU countries next year.

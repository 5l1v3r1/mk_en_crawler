SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The OSCE mission head in BiH, Ambassador Robert Beecroft, urged the Federation of BiH on Tuesday (4 March) to adopt a law granting the right to conscientious objection to military service. He said that while the OSCE welcomes measures taken so far, it remains concerned that the failure to systematically inform conscripts about their rights led many applicants for conscientious objection status to miss the formal deadline. As a result, many now face criminal charges for failing to respond to draft notices. (OSCE web site - 04/03/03)

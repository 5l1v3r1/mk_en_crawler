ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said on Friday (February 23rd) that the government will proceed with EU-related reforms, in spite of some negative rhetoric recently regarding Turkey's EU membership bid and the partial freezing of Union talks. Gul, speaking to a group of reporters in Ankara, also suggested that he expects changes to the controversial Article 301 of the Turkish penal code in a few weeks. He said he and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan believe the provision dealing with insulting "Turkishness" must be changed, as it casts a shadow on the reform progress. It has been cited in charging several intellectuals who wrote about the murder of Armenians in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire. (Turks.US - 24/02/07; Zaman, EU Observer - 23/02/07)

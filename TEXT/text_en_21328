TIRANA, Albania -- The government's efforts to combat human trafficking remain unsatisfactory in the eyes of the international community, says Steven Zate of the US embassy in Tirana. "Albania remains a base for woman and child trafficking," he said on Tuesday (May 27th) at a conference with the interior ministry, unveiling a joint strategy to combat such trafficking. Deputy Interior Minister Iva Zajmi said border points are the weakest link in the fight against child trafficking.
In other news Tuesday, authorities met with representatives of international institutions working in Tirana and asked for help in rebuilding the Gerdec area, scene of deadly blasts at an ammunition depot in March. "No one should go close to the area until we get a signal that the area is safe," said Helmut Lohan, head of the European Commission delegation in Tirana.

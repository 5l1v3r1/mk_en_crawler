SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US President George W. Bush issued a statement Monday (11 July) marking the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre and calling for the arrest of its main architects, former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander, Ratko Mladic. In his message, delivered by US Ambassador for War Crimes Issues Pierre Richard Prosper during commemorations of the 10th anniversary of the massacre, Bush said the events at Srebrenica were a "grim reminder that there are evil people who will kill the innocent without conscience or mercy". In its own statement, the US State Department also said that the two top war crimes indictees must be brought to justice. It urged Belgrade and other governments in the region to speed up efforts to track them down and bring them to The Hague. 
Also Monday, a mass grave containing the bodies of at least 100 Bosniaks was opened. Previously uncovered in Budak, near Sarajevo, the opening was intentionally delayed to coincide with the anniversary commemoration.

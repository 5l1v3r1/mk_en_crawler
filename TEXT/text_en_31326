SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The state-owned electricity utility NEK, Russia's Rossatom, Finland's Fortum and France's Altran Technologies signed a memorandum of understanding Tuesday (November 30th) to finance the long-delayed Belene nuclear power plant (Belene NPP) project. According to the agreement, a joint venture to implement the project is to be established within four months. The ownership structure is shared between NEK with a 51% stake, Rossatom with 47% and Fortum and Altran with 1% each. However, this will likely change when the joint venture is set up, as the share of Fortum could rise to 25%. Serbia is also expected to join and Bulgaria reportedly is negotiating with several other investors. Construction is expected to start in September 2011 and the first unit is to become operational in 2016. (DPA, Standart, RIA Novosti, Reuters, Xinhua, Dnevnik - 30/11/10)

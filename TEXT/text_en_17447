BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The new French government is considering its approach to Turkey's bid for membership in the EU, the French secretary of state for European affairs said on Monday (May 21st). "We are working on it," Jean-Pierre Jouyet replied when asked by reporters whether Paris would allow the opening of new chapters in accession talks with Ankara. He was the first senior official to visit Brussels since the election of Nicolas Sarkozy as France's new president. Sarkozy has voiced opposition to Turkey's bid and has suggested other forms of partnership. (Dow Jones - 21/05/07)

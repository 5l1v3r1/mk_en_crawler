VIENNA, Austria -- Macedonian Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva, in Vienna for talks with Austrian counterpart Ursula Plassnik, told reporters Wednesday (4 May) that she hopes Skopje will start accession talks with the EU in the first half of 2006. That would be an acknowledgment of the reforms Skopje has implemented in recent years, Mitreva said. Plassnik, meanwhile, said the name dispute between Skopje and Athens was unrelated to Macedonia's EU integration agenda. She added, however, that it is in the interest of both countries to resolve the issue as soon as possible. (AP, A1 TV, Makfax - 04/05/05)

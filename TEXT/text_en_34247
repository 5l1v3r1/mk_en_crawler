PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Montenegrin Foreign Minister Dragisa Burzan said Thursday (3 July) that Serbia and Montenegro might decide on their own whether to sign a bilateral agreement with the United States on non-extradition of citizens to the International Criminal Court. He added that the union's decision to delay its final stance reflects differences between the governments of the two republics. Montenegrin officials recently denied reports that Podgorica has left the decision up to Serbia. (B92, Tanjug - 03/07/03)

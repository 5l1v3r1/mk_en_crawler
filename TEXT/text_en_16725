ZAGREB, Croatia -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer began a tour of Southeast Europe on Thursday (6 July), meeting with Croatian President Stipe Mesic and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader. He confirmed that no invitations for NATO membership would be extended at the Alliance's summit in Riga this autumn. But he also predicted that member states would try to issue an encouraging message to members of the Adriatic Charter countries -- Albania, Croatia and Macedonia -- concerning NATO aspirations. From Zagreb, de Hoop Scheffer flew to Tirana, where he delivered a similar message to Prime Minister Sali Berisha and President Alfred Moisiu, reiterating that membership depends on concrete results. 
Also Thursday, the Croatian Parliament opened debate on the long-term plan for the armed forces through 2015. The plan envisions a military capacity of 16,000 active military personnel, 2,000 civilian staff, 2,000 volunteers plus up to 6,000 reservists. Conscript service would be abolished, giving the country a fully professional army by 2009. (Albanian News, Vjesnik - 07/07/06; HINA - 06/07/06)

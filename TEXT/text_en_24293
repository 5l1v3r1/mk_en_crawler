BUCHAREST, Romania -- Drivers protested in several Romanian cities on Saturday (December 13th) against a government decision to triple the tax on imports of second-hand cars. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Oradea in the country's northwest and headed to the Bors border checkpoint, threatening to block it. The protesters urged the government to abolish the tax and called ministers "thieves". Rallies were also held in Bistrita and in front of the government building in Bucharest.
Romania announced the tax increase earlier this month as part of efforts to support the local car industry. Purchasers of imported used cars now have to pay thousands of euros in registration fees, often exceeding the actual price of the vehicle. Romania had been seeing a boom in imports of used cars, hurting the sales of local car manufacturer Dacia. (Mediafax, DPA - 13/11/08)

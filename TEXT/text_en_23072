WASHINGTON, United States -- Washington is ready to provide $400m in financial support to Kosovo at a donors' conference in Brussels late next week, US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried said on Wednesday (July 2nd). Allocation would continue over the next four years. He added the United States believes the international community will pledge over $1 billion in support to Europe's newest state. Fried also said Washington is satisfied with the post-independence progress of Kosovo, adding the peaceful transition and stable political situation have silenced those who predicted violence.
In other news Wednesday, UNMIK spokesman Alexander Ivanko said that UNMIK's reconfiguration is tentatively due for completion by the second half of October. He added that a significant number of UNMIK staffers would leave Kosovo by then. (Reuters, VOA, FoNet, Beta, B92 - 02/07/08)

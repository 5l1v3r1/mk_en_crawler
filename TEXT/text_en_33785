WASHINGTON, United States -- Secretary of State Colin Powell told reporters on Tuesday (25 November) that the United States would help Macedonia in its efforts to join NATO. "We look forward to the day when Macedonia is fully integrated, as the Prime Minister said, into all of the Euro-Atlantic structures and we'll be working toward that end. How it comes about, and at what pace remains to be determined and of course there are standards that have to be met in order to have membership in these structures," Powell said after a meeting with Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski. He went on to express appreciation for Macedonia's support for US policy. "Macedonia was there for us when we needed help in Afghanistan and in Iraq. They have provided troops to both of those theatres -- small numbers, of course, but nevertheless the symbolism is huge," he said. (AP, AFP, VOA - 25/11/03)

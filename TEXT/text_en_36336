NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The cabinet of the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" has adopted a decree that would ease travel regulations for nationals of EU countries, an official said Sunday (23 May). EU citizens will be asked to show their identity cards rather than passports when they cross from the south of the island. It is among a series of measures aimed at attracting tourists and increasing revenues. (AFP - 23/05/04)

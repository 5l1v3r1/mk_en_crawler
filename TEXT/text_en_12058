SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Wrapping up a four-day session in Sarajevo on Wednesday (15 December), the BiH Police Restructuring Commission achieved a draft consensus on the establishment of a single police structure in the country. The panel's chairman, Wilfred Martens, said the proposal was fully in line with the recommendations from the Office of the High Representative and the EU. The commission is calling for placing the state border service, the new law enforcement agency and two regional and ten federation cantonal police forces under the control of the central security ministry. However, the Bosnian Serb members of the committee have objected to the consolidation of the security services of the country's two entities. 
In other news, High Representative Paddy Ashdown is expected to hold a press conference Thursday to announce measures in response to Republika Srpska's repeated violations of the Dayton Peace Accord and its lack of co-operation with The Hague tribunal. Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte criticised the Bosnian Serb government Wednesday for offering rewards to those who surrender voluntarily to the tribunal. She said war criminals should not be treated like VIPs. (Nezavisne novine, Dnevni avaz - 16/12/04; AP, Reuters, PBS BiH, Fena, RTRS, NTV Hayat - 15/12/04)

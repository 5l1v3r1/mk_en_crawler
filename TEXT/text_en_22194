TIRANA, Albania -- The death of businessman Kosta Trebicka, a key witness in an investigation of illegal trading of ammunition, sparked a heated debate in parliament Monday (September 15th). Opposition Socialist lawmakers blame Prime Minister Sali Berisha's government for failing to protect Trebicka during the probe. Berisha in turn accused the opposition of politically exploiting the issue. Trebicka was found dead on Friday following a car accident. Last year, he testified before Albanian and US investigators that the US company AEY Inc. bought old Chinese ammunition from Albania for use by the Afghan army and police. The firm allegedly repackaged the ammunition in Albania to hide its origin.In other news, Gianfranco Fini, president of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, visited Tirana on Monday and said the Italian parliament will soon ratify a NATO membership protocol for Albania. Fini confirmed Italy's support for Albania's EU and NATO integration processes. (BBC, VOA, BalkanWeb, Top Channel, Koha ditore, Koha jone, Shekulli - 16/09/08; Top Channel, Klan, Alsat - 15/09/08)

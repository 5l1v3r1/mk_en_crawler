ZAGREB, Croatia -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz plans to kick off a three-day visit to Croatia on Monday (May 25th), Hague spokeswoman Olga Kavran announced on Wednesday. This will be the last of his planned visits to the Western Balkans before submitting his bi-annual report on war crimes co-operation to the UN Security Council in June. In Croatia, Brammertz will discuss progress made and will attend a regional conference on war crimes, held in Brioni.
Meanwhile, the head of Serbia's national council for co-operation with The Hague tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, said on Thursday that Brammertz's latest report regarding Belgrade's co-operation is no different from the previous one. Ljajic tells the daily Blic the report acknowledges improved efforts to search for remaining fugitives Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic, but still maintains they are hiding on Serb territory, which, Ljajic said, has not been confirmed.

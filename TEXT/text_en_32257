SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Negotiations resume Monday (7 October) between the For Macedonia Together coalition and the major Albanian party in the new parliament, the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI). Talks on forming a new government began Friday. A1 TV reports that DUI has been offered four seats in the new cabinet - justice, social affairs, economy and self-government. In addition, DUI will be entitled to a Deputy Prime Minister seat. Thus, DUI will have exactly the same representation as the Union for Democratic Prosperity had in the outgoing cabinet of Lubco Georgievski. This amounts to a compromise; originally, For Macedonia Together was reluctant to give the justice minister post to DUI. Negotiations are due to resume Monday.

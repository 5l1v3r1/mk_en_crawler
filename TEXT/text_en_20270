SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Opposition parliamentary parties Tuesday (February 12th) reached final agreement on the exact wording of a no-confidence motion against the government, to be submitted Thursday (February 14th). It will cite corruption in various infrastructure sectors -- energy, transport and regional development -- as well as in healthcare and law enforcement. 
The motion is the fourth since Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev's government took power in 2005. There is no chance it will pass, because Stanishev's ruling coalition controls 151 out of 240 seats in parliament. (Klasa - 13/02/08; Dnevnik, bTV, Netinfo, BGNES - 12/02/08)

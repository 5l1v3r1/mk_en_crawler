ZAGREB, Croatia -- OSCE Mission head Peter Semneby said Thursday (12 June) he appreciated Prime Minister Ivica Racan's public call for the return of all refugees to Croatia. The announcement followed the government's decision to help provide housing for returnees and refugees who held tenancy rights in the areas that remained under Croatian control during the 1991-1995 armed conflict. According to Semneby, a firm commitment from the political leadership is essential for encouraging refugees willing to come back home. (OSCE Web site - 12/06/03)

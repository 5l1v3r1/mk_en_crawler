BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Tuesday (February 2nd) that the EU will use all legal means to guarantee the free movement of goods within its borders. In a special statement regarding the ongoing blockade at the Greek-Bulgarian border by protesting Greek farmers, Barroso expressed hope the issue would be settled soon. He spoke by phone with Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov on Tuesday to discuss difficulties Bulgarian businesses are experiencing because of the blockades. Greek farmers are demanding secure subsidies, guaranteed buy-out prices for their produce, and lower production costs. Their protests began in mid-January. (BNR, BGNES - 02/02/10)

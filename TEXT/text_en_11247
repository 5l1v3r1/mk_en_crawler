TIRANA, Albania -- The OSCE Presence in Albania and the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights called on Albanian political parties Friday (24 December) to solve outstanding electoral issues -- specifically, the establishment of electoral constituencies. In a statement, the organisations warned that failure to implement decisions of a parliamentary committee on electoral reform might undermine the 2005 general elections.

ATHENS, Greece -- The leader of the major opposition party PASOK, George Papandreou, criticised on Sunday (29 May) the deal reached last week between the cabinet and unions of the state telecom, OTE. The agreement is designed to end the civil servant status of future employees of the telco, while offering current workers incentives for early retirement. According to Papandreou, the agreement was an attempt to boost OTE's shares on the stock market ahead of the company's privatisation. (Kathimerini - 30/05/05; ANA - 29/05/05)

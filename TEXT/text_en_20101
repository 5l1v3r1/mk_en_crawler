SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Principal Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian said on Friday (September 14th) that both Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik and Bosniak presidency member Haris Silajdzic have agreed that police districts should not cross ethnic lines. This would signal a change in the position of Silajdzic and the Bosniaks, who had earlier insisted new police districts should mirror the country's regions, rather than the current two-entity system. 
Separately, in an interview in Saturday's Dnevni avaz, Silajdzic reiterated the current two-entity structure of BiH is not functional and called instead for a multiethnic BiH based on regions.
In other news Saturday, Rosemary Di Carlo, US deputy assistant secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs, warned of serious consequences if progress is not achieved in key fields of reform, especially police reform. (RTRS, SRNA, Nezavisne novine, Dnevni avaz - 15/09/07; NTV Hayat - 14/09/07)

ATHENS, Greece -- Russia is pressing Bulgaria and Greece to sell their stakes in the future Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline, Bulgarian and international media reported on Tuesday (August 28th). Experts from the three countries were meeting in the Greek capital to discuss details of the joint company that would build and operate the facility when Russia unexpectedly issued a new demand. 
Moscow now wants each of the three parties to provide a share of the oil that would flow through the pipeline in proportion to its stake in the future company. Bulgaria and Greece own 24.5% of the project each, which translates into 8.5 million tonnes of oil each. Earlier, it was agreed that Russian companies would secure all the oil for transportation.

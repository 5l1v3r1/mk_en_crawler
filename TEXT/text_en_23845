ATHENS, Greece -- Thousands of farmers again blocked traffic along main highways on Thursday (January 22nd), demanding the government increase the price of their products, raise pensions and subsidies and reduce fuel taxes. The fourth day of protests resulted in traffic jams on the Athens-Thessaloniki Highway and prompted the closure of border checkpoints with neighbouring Bulgaria. Agriculture Minister Sotiris Hatzigakis has already met with representatives and has offered them 500m euros in funding to support the farm sector. But farmers say that is not enough and vow to continue their protests. (ANA-MPA, Ta Nea, Ethnos - 23/01/09; AP - 22/01/09)

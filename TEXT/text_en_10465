NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Health Minister Dina Akkelidou was reportedly indicted Monday (18 October) for trying to influence the sentencing of a convicted drug dealer. Media reports quote Attorney General Solon Nikitas as saying Akkelidou sent a letter to a Cypriot court judge last week, seeking to ensure the dealer gets no prison time. Akkalidou has denied the allegation. (Kathimerini - 19/10/04)

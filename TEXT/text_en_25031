BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Republika Srpska (RS) parliament rejected on Monday (December 28th) as unconstitutional and anti-Dayton a decision by High Representative Valentin Inzko to extend the mandates of foreign judges and prosecutors working in BiH's courts. Lawmakers decided that a referendum on the issue will be called after a new law on referendums is adopted. Following a heated debate, they agreed that RS citizens would be urged to give their opinion only on Inzko's latest decision regarding foreign magistrates, rather than on all his recent decisions as the opposition had sought. RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said the referendum could be held in March. 
In other news Monday, the RS government approved a draft law on conducting a public census in the entity and forwarded it to parliament for debate. If approved, the population count could be conducted in April 2011. (RTRS, Srna, Fena, Onasa, Dnevni Avaz - 28/12/09)

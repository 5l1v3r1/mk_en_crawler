ANKARA, Turkey -- The Election Board ruled on Monday (April 18th) that 12 pro-Kurdish politicians who registered as independent candidates in the June 12th general elections are ineligible to run because of their past involvement in terror-related activities. Pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) leader Selahattin Demirtas criticised the ruling as politically motivated. He implicated the ruling Justice and Development Party and threatened a boycott of the elections. "This is a fascist implementation. We cannot take part in an anti-democratic, unfair election," Demirtas told NTV. (Sabah, Vatan - 19/04/11; NTV, Anadolu news agency, CNN Turk - 18/04/11)

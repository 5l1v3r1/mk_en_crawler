ATHENS, Greece -- After suffering a series of setbacks in the first trials of Olympic venues two weeks ago, Athens was applauded Sunday (17 August) following tests of the cycling, show jumping, archery and canoeing facilities. The three-day tests went well and no significant problems surfaced. Organisers also received a thumbs-up from US Ambassador Thomas Miller. "During the last two years I have been in Greece, I have seen significant progress being made in all issues regarding the 2004 Olympic Games," he told reporters. Miller also said that the United States is committed to helping Greece boost security for the games. Organisers are now looking ahead to the archery, beach volleyball and sailing trials at the end of the month. According to Greek media, Prime Minister Costas Simitis has committed to personally overseeing Olympic preparations in the remaining 12 months. (Reuters, AFP - 17/08/03)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prosecutors in Sofia have charged four Romas with hooliganism after a series of ethnic clashes in a quarter of the capital last week. Simmering ethnic tensions in Sofia's Krasna Polyana neighbourhood escalated into fighting, with a bar being attacked one night after a group of Romas was beaten by skinheads. Clashes erupted again the next night. (BGNES, Darik - 18/08/07)

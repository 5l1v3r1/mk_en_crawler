ZAGREB, Croatia -- Ingrid Anticevic-Marinovic, deputy leader of the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP), announced her resignation from the post on Wednesday (November 8th). The former justice minister says she resigned to prevent a scandal involving her husband, Zadar lawyer Marko Marinovic, from damaging SDP's image. Earlier this week, the Zagreb press reported that Marinovic had been investigated for attempting in 2002 to use his wife's position in the government to influence cases involving his clients. She denies the allegations. 
Also Wednesday, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader assured a visiting IMF mission that his government intends to keep its fiscal policy tight even after the current 141.3m stand-by arrangement expires next week. To preserve fiscal discipline, next year's budget deficit is to be 2.8% of GDP, lower than this year's deficit target of 3%. (Vjesnik, Vecernji list, Poslovni dnevnik - 09/11/06; HRT - 08/11/06)

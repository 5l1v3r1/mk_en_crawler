THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- A former Republika Srpska Army and police officer convicted by The Hague war crimes tribunal of torturing and raping Muslim women and girls was transferred on Wednesday (February 27th) to serve a 15-year prison sentence in Belgium. Dragan Zelenovic, 47, pleaded guilty slightly more than a year ago to seven counts against him and expressed deep remorse. His appeal for a reduced sentence was later rejected. The offenses took place in Foca, BiH during the 1992-1995 conflict. (SRNA, RTRS, Reuters, UN website - 27/02/08)

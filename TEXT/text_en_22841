SOFIA, Bulgaria -- During a visit to Sofia on Tuesday (October 7th), Cypriot President Demetris Christofias ruled out a future confederation of two separate states on his divided island. He stressed that Greek Cypriots would not accept a confederation, which Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat proposed as a basis for reunification. Christofias warned that if the two communities within the federation gain more authority, as Talat insists, this would "effectively undermine the [future] central government". The president said Talat's call for two separate, politically equal states poses a major obstacle to the reunification process. Talks between Christofias and Talat will resume on Friday.

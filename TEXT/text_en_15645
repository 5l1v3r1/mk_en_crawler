BELGRADE, Serbia -- Belgrade renewed on Tuesday (October 24th) an offer to deliver electricity to Kosovo as humanitarian assistance, in response to chronic shortages in some Serb municipalities. Sanda Raskovic-Ivic, the head of Serbia's Co-ordination Centre for Kosovo, and representatives of the Serbian power utility EPS are again seeking talks with UNMIK on a solution. After complaints earlier this week and allegations of discrimination, it appears full power has been restored to the largest Serbian-populated area in Kosovo, Strpce, for the first time in ten days.

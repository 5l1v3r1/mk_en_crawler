WASHINGTON, United States -- Pierre-Richard Prosper, the US ambassador-at-large for war crimes, said Tuesday (31 December) his government is losing patience with Yugoslavia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina over their failure to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal. Noting that Ratko Mladic, Radovan Karadzic and Janko Bobetko remain at large, Prosper announced plans to visit Belgrade, Sarajevo, Banja Luka and Zagreb later this month to push for their arrests.
In other news, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic said that all moves to extradite outgoing Serbian President Milan Milutinovic to The Hague would be delayed by the celebration of the Orthodox Christmas on 7 January. Milutinovic's term in office ended Sunday. Prosecutors at The Hague wanted him to report there immediately, to face charges stemming from the 1998-1999 war in Kosovo. (AP, Reuters, AFP - 31/12/02)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbian Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic says Kosovo Serbs will be able to vote in Serbia's May 11th parliamentary and local elections. During a visit Monday (March 31st) to Mitrovica and other Serb enclaves in Kosovo, Samardzic said the government will adopt a decree outlining how the vote will be organised. He added that -- as in previous elections -- the government would file a request with UNMIK to hold the polls. 
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu, however, has rejected the idea. "Kosovo will not serve as an electoral base for anyone," he said.
Meanwhile, the situation remained tense in Mitrovica after a group of ethnic Albanians shot at Serbs near the divided city's Brsani neighbourhood on Monday. A large crowd of Serbs gathered at the scene but no clashes were reported. Local Serbs then met with KFOR representatives, who guaranteed their safety.

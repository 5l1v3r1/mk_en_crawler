TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli said on Wednesday (June 4th) that parliament will lift the immunity of former Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu, who is charged with abuse of power in regard to a series of deadly explosions at the munitions depot in the village of Gerdec on March 15th. Mediu resigned over the incident two days later, citing "moral reasons", but insisted he would "not allow anyone to turn my decision into a legal responsibility". On Tuesday, US Ambassador to Tirana John Withers urged the government and parliament against delaying the prosecutor's investigation of the case. (Shekulli, Shqip - 05/06/08; VOA, BBC - 04/06/08)

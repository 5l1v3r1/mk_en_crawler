SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Hari Kostov met on Wednesday (21 July) with US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Kathleen Stephens, who assured him that Washington fully supports the power decentralisation package recently approved by government. Stephens added that the public has rightly chosen democracy, tolerance and a multiethnic community. She noted that since decentralisation is the last stage in implementing the Ohrid Framework Agreement, it would provide a strong impetus to the country's NATO and EU integration efforts.

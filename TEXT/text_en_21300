PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Interior Minister Jusuf Kalamperovic said on Wednesday (August 27th) that Montenegro has prepared a draft agreement on dual citizenship with countries of the former Yugoslavia. According to the proposal, dual citizenship will be an exception: only those who had it before June 3rd 2006, when Montenegro declared independence, can retain it. Dual citizenship will be available to those with one parent who was a citizen of another country, Kalamperovic added.
Belgrade will also offer an agreement on dual citizenship in the coming months, according to Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic. He said Serbia is ready to hold talks with Montenegro on the issue, although he noted Serbia has a completely different view of the situation. (RTCG, Tanjug, B92 - 27/08/08)

WASHINGTON, United States -- The chief of the European Commission Directorate for the Western Balkans, Reinhard Priebe, said on Friday (October 6th) that Brussels believes Croatia would be ready for EU membership by the end of the decade. Addressing a conference organised by the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies, Priebe said that following Bulgaria and Romania's accession in January, there must be some institutional restructuring in the EU. He urged aspiring members to use that time to address any shortcomings related to EU criteria and specific regional problems related to refugee returns and war crimes co-operation.

WASHINGTON, United States -- Parliament will have the final say on a request to send Turkish peacekeeping forces to Iraq, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Wednesday (23 July) during a visit to Washington. In meetings with US officials, he reportedly suggested that Turkey looked favourably on the request. Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer said Wednesday he believes a UN resolution and approval by parliament would be required to dispatch troops to the region.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Abdullah Gul, the reform-minded foreign minister, deputy prime minister and former prime minister, has been tapped as presidential candidate of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the nomination Tuesday (April 24th) after an AKP caucus. Gul, 57, has a PhD in economics and was a founding member of the party. He is perceived as preferable to Erdogan by the opposition and would likely be elected president in the first round of voting by Parliament on Friday. The new president is to be sworn in by May 16th, when incumbent Ahmet Necdet Sezer's term expires. (Sabah, Zaman, ANKA, Anadolu Agency, Focus, Reuters - 24/04/07)

VIENNA, Austria -- Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica met with their Kosovo Albanian counterparts, Fatmir Sejdiu and Agim Ceku, in Vienna on Monday (24 July) for talks on the province's future status. UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari chaired the session.
The two sides reiterated their established stances on the future of Kosovo. Sejdiu said that the Kosovo Albanians expect the province to become independent by the end of this year, and that they want the status resolution process to be open, transparent and peaceful. Tadic said the Kosovo Albanian side is not budging from its demand for full independence and has been unwilling to negotiate, while Kostunica said Serbia would not accept the loss of 15 per cent of its territory to make a new state. 
Ahtisaari's deputy, Albert Rohan, said the international community wants the status to be resolved through dialogue and agreement. However, that depends on the efforts of the two sides involved, he said. (AP, AFP, Beta, B92, Reuters, Tanjug, BBC, Danas, Pobjeda, RTS - 24/07/06; Tanjug - 23/07/06)

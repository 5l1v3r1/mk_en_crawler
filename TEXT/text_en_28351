ANKARA, Turkey -- The Supreme Election Board announced on Thursday (May 13th) that a public referendum on constitutional reform will take place on September 12th. The decision followed President Abdullah Gul's approval of a package of amendments Wednesday. The amount of time between approval and the referendum has been a point of contention between the opposition and ruling parties. The government had passed a law reducing the period from 120 days to 60 days, but the Supreme Election Board decided that the law cannot be implemented yet. The government wanted the public referendum held in July. Meanwhile, the main opposition Republican People's Party reportedly plans to file a petition against the amendments before the Constitutional Court on Friday, insisting they should be annulled on procedural grounds.

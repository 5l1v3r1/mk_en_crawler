STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament (EP) criticised Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on Thursday (June 17th) for its weak central government and continuing nationalistic rhetoric between Bosnian Serbs on one hand and Croats and Bosniaks on the other. "The nationalistic and secessionist rhetoric polarising society is detrimental to the country's bid for EU integration," EP members said in a resolution adopted during a session in Strasbourg. But the resolution also welcomed the "significant progress" made in meeting the roadmap criteria for visa-free regime with the EU and urged lawmakers to adopt remaining legislation necessary to make such travel a reality.

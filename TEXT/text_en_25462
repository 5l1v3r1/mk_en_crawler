ANKARA, Turkey -- The country's Journalists Association on Monday (December 21st) condemned last week's murder of a newspaper editor, saying it demonstrates the risks Turkish journalists still face. Cihan Hayirsevener, 53, editor of a local newspaper in the northwest city of Bandirma, was shot dead in broad daylight Friday afternoon by an unknown gunman. According to media reports, the journalist had been investigating a corruption scandal involving a rival newspaper and had received death threats. "Journalists are neither safe nor free," said Zafer Atay, secretary-general of Turkey's Journalists Association. (Reuters, AFP - 21/12/09)

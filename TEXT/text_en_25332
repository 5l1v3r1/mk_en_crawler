BUCHAREST, Romania -- Freezing temperatures in Eastern and Southeast Europe have killed more than 40 people and led to chaos in many parts of the region, where some areas reached minus 30 degrees Celsius. At least three people died in Sofia. Snow has covered western Turkey, eastern Bulgaria and eastern Romania. In Bulgaria, schools in many eastern towns remained closed on Monday (January 25th), as rescue teams tried to reach several villages buried under 4m of snow. The teams are trying to deliver food and other necessities. Temperatures in central Romania reached minus 34 degrees Celsius. Many roads were blocked and hundreds of trains were delayed. The health ministry blames 23 deaths on the frigid temperatures over the past several days. In Turkey, five people died after a blizzard caused power outages in Istanbul over the weekend. Further west, near the borders with Greece and Bulgaria, villages and roads remain blocked by the snow. (AFP, Reuters, Deutsche Welle - 25/01/10)

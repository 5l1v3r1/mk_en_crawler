BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Interior Ministry confirmed on Sunday (August 5th) that one man was killed after a group of masked gunmen clashed with police in the southern village of Konculj, near the Kosovo border. Officials say the group had been robbing travellers on a key route in the area. "They opened fire on police ... it turned into a real battlefield," Interior Minister Dragan Jocic was quoted as saying. He estimated the exchange lasted for around 20 minutes and said the gunmen had automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades.

MOSCOW, Russian Federation -- Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called on Saturday (March 17th) for more talks regarding Kosovo's final status, suggesting that UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari be replaced with another UN mediator. Lavrov's call came a few days after Ahtisaari announced the end of fruitless negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina and forwarded his proposal for resolving Kosovo's status to the UN, despite Serbia's objections. "If Martti Ahtisaari thinks he has done all he can, then almost certainly one can find another person who will do it," Lavrov said, suggesting Ahtisaari should have done more to gain Serbian support for the plan. Outgoing Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica described it as a logical move by Russia. But Lavrov also implied that his country, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, would not automatically veto the roadmap. 
A spokeswoman for EU security chief Javier reiterated the Union's support for Ahtisaari's proposal and its presentation to the UN Security Council. Kosovo is to be a main topic of discussion during a high-level meeting Monday between EU and US officials in Washington.

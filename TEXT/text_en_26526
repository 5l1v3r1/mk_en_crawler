TIRANA, Albania -- Again on Wednesday (September 9th), the Tirana District Court delayed a hearing into the so-called Gerdec case, in which an ammunitions depot exploded in March 2008, killing 26 people and wounding about 300 people. Property damage caused by the blast is estimated at around 20m euros. This time, lawyers representing the defendants failed to appear in court, the third time hearings had to be postponed over the failure of defendants or their lawyers to show up. Among the accused is former Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu, who was appointed on Wednesday as environment minister in the new cabinet. A group of media representatives protested in Tirana, calling it "a serious moral and political problem". (Shekulli, Top Channel, Balkan Web, Ora News - 09/09/09)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Ali Ahmeti, leader of the main ethnic Albanian party in Macedonia, the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), said on Thursday (February 22nd) that two conditions must be met before his party returns to parliament and resumes dialogue with the ruling coalition. He wants the dissolution of the Committee for Cross-Community Relations and a new law on government. He added that he would meet with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski only in the presence of international community representatives. 
DUI withdrew from Parliament to protest Gruevski's decision to exclude DUI from the ruling coalition, as well as what DUI views as spotty use of the Badinter principle during votes taken by Parliament on issues that affect minorities. (Vecer - 23/02/07; MIA, Makfax - 22/02/07)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH's future is in its hands and no more gifts from the EU should be expected unless reforms are implemented, High Representative Paddy Ashdown said in an open letter released Sunday (25 May). The letter marked the first anniversary of Ashdown's appointment to the post. While much has been achieved, wrote Ashdown, much remains to be done.
In other news, the influential association of independent intellectuals in BiH, Krug 99, said its members are often subject to nationalist attacks, particularly from local nationalist-oriented press publications. In a recent document, members said they were determined to build a civic, democratic and sovereign state. (OHR Sources - 26/05/03; PBS BiH, RTRS, BH Radio 1, BBC - 25/05/03)

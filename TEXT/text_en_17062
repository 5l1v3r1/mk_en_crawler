BUCHAREST, Romania -- The senate rejected a no-confidence motion Thursday (1 June) submitted by the main opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) against Agriculture Minister Gheorghe Flutur, over the bird flu crisis. PSD demanded Flutur's sacking, accusing him of mishandling the matter and allowing a second wave of outbreaks. Parties in the ruling coalition managed to secure the votes needed to defeat the motion.

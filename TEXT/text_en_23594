ANKARA, Turkey -- The bodies of five suspected would-be illegal immigrants to Europe turned up on two beaches Wednesday (January 28th) along Turkey's south-eastern coast, not far from the Bodrum resort. Police believe there may be more immigrants in the water and have launched a rescue operation to locate them. The five, who ranged in age from 25 to 30, remain unidentified. Tens of thousands of people from Asia and Africa try to cross Turkey illegally every year in an effort to reach EU countries. (Reuters, CNN Turk - 28/01/09)

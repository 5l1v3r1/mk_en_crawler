TIRANA, Albania -- Members of the ruling Coalition for Integration have reached an agreement on electoral reform, local media reported Friday (8 October). Prime Minister Fatos Nano, chairman of the Socialist Party, and leaders of the smaller parties in the coalition signed a joint declaration reaffirming their commitment to participating together in the 2005 elections. The partners agreed that preparing voters' lists is a priority and should be completed within a month. They also acknowledged the importance of reforming the election commission but again rejected a proposal by the opposition to balance the commission's composition.

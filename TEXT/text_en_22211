BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign ministers are meeting Monday (September 15th) in Brussels to discuss, among other things, a proposal to unblock Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU, in the field of commerce. The SAA underwent immediate suspension after its signing in April pending Serbia's full co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal. During the meeting, tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz will brief diplomats on the latest developments concerning Serbia's co-operation. In Belgrade last week, Brammertz expressed "moderate optimism" about prospects for the arrests of two remaining war crimes fugitives, Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic.

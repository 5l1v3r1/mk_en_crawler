LAUSANNE, Switzerland -- International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge announced Thursday (22 June) that Sofia's bid to host the 2014 Winter Olympics has been rejected. The other unsuccessful candidates were Jaca, Spain; Almaty, Kazakhstan; and Borjomi, Georgia. The three cities surviving the first round of cuts were Sochi, Russia; Salzburg, Austria; and PyeongChang, South Korea. Rogge thanked the ousted candidates for their hard work and enthusiasm. 
Bulgarian Olympic Committee President Stafka Kostadinova said they were not surprised by the decision. Explanations of the rejection varied from insufficient time for preparation to poorly co-ordinated national efforts and low government support.

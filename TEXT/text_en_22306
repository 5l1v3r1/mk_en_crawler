BUCHAREST, Romania -- Around 4,000 police officers joined a protest in Bucharest on Saturday (April 12th) demanding amendments to legislation that would allow them legal aid in work-related cases, as well as life insurance. Representatives of police trade unions from Bulgaria, Belgium, Scotland, Spain and Slovakia joined the rally, addressing the crowd outside the government building. The cabinet said the rally was unjustified, as negotiations are underway that are addressing protesters' demands. (Mediafax, DPA, Realitatia - 12/04/08)

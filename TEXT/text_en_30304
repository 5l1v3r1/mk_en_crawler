PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Kosovo police are undergoing a restructuring phase in the north in order to strengthen the rule of law in the Serb-dominated area. The first step is to reshuffle the heads of police stations, the daily Express reported on Monday (May 16th). Police commanders in the northern municipalities, Zvecan, Zubin Potok and Leposavic got their positions changed, police General-Director Reshat Maliqi has confirmed. He says there will also be changes at gates 1 and 31 at the border with Serbia. The other part of the plan involves boosting patrols and checkpoints. (Express, RTK, Telegrafi - 16/05/11)

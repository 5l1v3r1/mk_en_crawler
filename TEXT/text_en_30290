BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia will not take legal action against incumbent Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, who was recently accused in a Council of Europe report of involvement in human organ trafficking at the end of the 1990s. "If someone is not available to our police and judicial authorities, it is not suitable to launch such processes as they seem too much like political trials," Serbian deputy war crimes prosecutor Bruno Vekaric told the Belgrade-based daily Blic on Friday (December 17th). 
At the same time, however, he said Belgrade is ready to help EULEX and Albanian prosecutors as they conduct an investigation into the allegations. Serbian prosecutors, he indicated, have strong evidence pointing to organ trafficking by members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). Thaci was one of the KLA's leaders in 1998-1999, when the alleged crimes are suspected to have been committed.
The United States, meanwhile, said it would continue to co-operate with Kosovo's leadership despite the CoE report. US State Department Philip Crowley said on Saturday that Marty's claims will not bring about any fundamental change in relations with Pristina. These, he said, are based on mutual interest and not on any particular individual. AFP, Blic, Nacional, B92, Tanjug - 17/12/10)

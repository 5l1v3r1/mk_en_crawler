TIRANA, Albania --The main opposition Socialist Party (SP) is organising a protest Friday (December 21st) in Tirana against power blackouts and corruption. At a news conference Thursday, SP leader Edi Rama urged the public to join the rally against what he called the "outdated" politics of Prime Minister Sali Berisha. Rama stressed that after 17 years of democracy, Albania still endures long power outages and problems with its water supply.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The extradition of seven war crimes indictees, including Ratko Mladic, remains a major condition for progress in Serbia-Montenegro's bid for EU integration, said federal Human and Minority Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic, who also is chairman of the national council for co-operation with the UN tribunal. Ljajic spoke at a roundtable Tuesday (5 July) titled "War Crime-Trial-Justice-Reconciliation". He reiterated that Serbia-Montenegro could be the "champion of economic, political and social reforms" in the region, but unless it fulfilled this crucial condition, it would lag behind all other countries as regards EU accession.

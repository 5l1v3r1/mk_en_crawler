PRISTINA, Kosovo -- International Civilian Representative in Kosovo Pieter Feith says Kosovo Serbs can use their Serbian passports as identification to vote in the November 15th municipal elections. "All voters who possess valid documents, passports or IDs can vote ... while the Serb community can vote with Serbian passports," Feith said on Wednesday (November 4th), after meeting with the head of the Central Election Commission, Nesrin Lushta. He urged Serbs to vote, despite messages from Belgrade to boycott the elections. Lushta said that final preparations for the elections are under way. 
Elsewhere, Serbian State Secretary for Kosovo Oliver Ivanovic warned that any Kosovo Serbs elected this month will have to choose between their current jobs and those that the Kosovo government will offer them. Ivanovic also urged them to carefully consider whether to participate in the election. 
Meanwhile, three Serb political entities have decided to run as a coalition. Their candidate for mayor of Gracanica is Mihajlo Scepanovic. The Serb Democratic Party, the Serb People's Party, and the Independent Social-Democratic Party held a joint news conference Wednesday to announce their coalition.

ATHENS, Greece -- Economy and Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis presented on Tuesday (29 March) the country's revised Stability and Growth Programme for 2004-2007, saying that the Greek economy would overcome the "serious but temporary difficulties" it faces. The document envisions an average annual growth of 4 per cent of GDP until 2007, while reducing the public deficit below the eurozone ceiling of 3 per cent of GDP after the end of this year. The EU has threatened to impose sanction unless Greece works to curb its budget deficit by 2006. (Kathimerini - 30/03/05; ANA, AFX - 29/03/05)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The tax evasion and money laundering trial of media tycoon Velija Ramkovski and 22 of his relatives and closest associates opened on Monday (May 23rd) in Skopje but was quickly adjourned until June 13th. The judge accepted defence attorneys' arguments that their clients had not had the opportunity to review all the evidence presented by prosecutors. Ramkovski, owner of A1 TV, and CEOs of other legal entities were arrested in December. (MIA, Dnevnik, A1, Makfax - 23/05/11)

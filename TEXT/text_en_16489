SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- An anti-tank rocket was fired at a mosque in the Bosnian city of Mostar early Tuesday (October 10th) causing significant damage but no casualties. Police say the attack, involving a 60mm Zolja projectile, occurred at about 4 am, shortly before worshippers were to gather for prayers. Mostar's Croat Mayor, Ljubo Beslic, urged the public to remain calm and help police in their investigation. The city's imam, Salem Dedovic, said the attack has disturbed Muslims during the holy month of Ramadan. Local media reports suggest the incident may have been in retaliation for the desecration of a Roman Catholic cemetery Monday.

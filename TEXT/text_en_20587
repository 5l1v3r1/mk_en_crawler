PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed US diplomat Larry Rossin as principal deputy UNMIK special representative, according to a statement issued on Tuesday (January 8th). He succeeds Steven Schook, who left Kosovo a few weeks ago after his contract was not extended. In September, Schook announced that the UN had launched an investigation into his alleged close contacts with Kosovo officials, including former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, and for questionable behaviour involving UNMIK employees.

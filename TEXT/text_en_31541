PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK head Michael Steiner approved a resolution Thursday (17 April) declaring the Albanian National Army (ANA) a terrorist organisation. As a result, any ANA member could be prosecuted as a criminal. The move follows last weekend's explosion, which damaged a railway bridge linking areas populated mostly by Serbs to mainland Serbia. ANA assumed responsibility for the blast, which killed two of its members.
In other news, the Serbian government issued a statement Thursday saying Steiner's proposed plan to transfer some UNMIK powers to Kosovo institutions would not contribute to stability in the province. Belgrade reiterated its call to resolve pressing issues first, including refugee return and providing security to Serbs. The UN plan, likely to be adopted by the end of the year, would hand over administrative functions to the province's institutions. The UN would retain control over vital areas such as security, justice and foreign affairs. (Radio 21, B92, Tanjug, FoNet, BBC, AFP - 17/04/03)

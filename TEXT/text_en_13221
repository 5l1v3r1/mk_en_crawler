KUSADASI, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan again called on the EU Wednesday (22 February) to fulfil its pledges towards Turkish Cypriots, suggesting that Turkey would then tackle the opening of its ports and airspace to Greek Cypriot ships and planes. Speaking at a business forum in Kusadasi, Erdogan criticised the Union for admitting Cyprus into the EU even though the Greek Cypriots rejected the UN plan for reunification of the divided island. Erdogan's statement came after Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos reiterated that his country would not hesitate to veto Turkey's EU accession talks if Ankara fails to implement its obligations towards Cyprus.

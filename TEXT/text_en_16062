PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Visiting Kosovo on Monday (14 August), NATO's South Wing Commander, US Admiral Harry Ulrich, said KFOR is prepared to put down any violence in the province. He warned extremists against testing NATO's readiness to protect security in Kosovo in the months ahead, as status talks edge forward. 
In other news, UN special envoy for the status talks Martti Ahtisaari is expected to visit Kosovo next week, according to an announcement from his office Monday. No exact date was mentioned. 
Also Monday, UNMIK spokesman Aleksandar Ivanko said that any remarks in support of the partition of Kosovo are not welcome and that the international community repeatedly has ruled out the option. At the weekend, regional media quoted the Serbian government co-ordinator for Kosovo, Sanda Raskovic-Ivic, as voicing support for Kosovo's division, if no other long-term solution is reached. Belgrade says the comment to the BBC was misinterpreted. (Blic - 15/08/06; Tanjug, Beta - 14/08/06)

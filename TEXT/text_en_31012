BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton has reiterated calls for Albania's politicians to resolve the current stalemate. The absence of the dialogue between government and the opposition is worrisome, Ashton said Thursday (March 31st). "The EU calls upon the governing majority and the opposition to continue and further intensify their dialogue, in as well as outside Parliament, with a view to securing the best possible preparations of this municipal elections and the progress of Albania that its citizens deserve," she said.
Ashton praised an initiative that has brought the Democratic Party and the Socialist Party to the table to discuss upcoming local elections. This meeting is a result of the work that EU envoy Miroslav Lajcak has had in the last months with political leaders, according to Ashton. (Top Channel, Balkan Web, News 24, Top News - 31/03/11)

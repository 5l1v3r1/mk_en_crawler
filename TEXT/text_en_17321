ZAGREB, Croatia -- European Parliament Rapporteur for Croatia Hannes Swoboda said the country's EU accession is unlikely before 2010 or 2011, despite a recent EP resolution that said Croatia might wrap up membership negotiations by 2009. In an interview for the Vienna-based daily Der Standard on Thursday (April 26th), Swoboda indicated 2009 would be unrealistic, as new EP elections would be held that year, and the incumbent parliament would avoid any decisions regarding possible further EU enlargement.

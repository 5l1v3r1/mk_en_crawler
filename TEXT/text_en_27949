PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has voiced concern about possible tensions in northern Kosovo if Pristina authorities fail to implement their strategy in a transparent manner, in dialogue with local communities and other relevant stakeholders. In a report published Thursday (April 22nd), Ban noted that UNMIK authorities were not consulted in either the drafting or implementation of the strategy. Pristina is trying to solidify its control over all of Kosovo, in the face of Belgrade-backed parallel structures in the Serb-dominated north.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The head of the National Security Agency (NSA), Dusko Markovic, denied on Monday (March 19th) any links between the state and organised crime. He was speaking after a closed-door session of Parliament's security commission. It was convened at the request of the opposition Movement for Changes (PzP) to discuss the NSA's work and what the PzP views as an alarming rise in the country's crime rate. 
Markovic conceded there may be isolated criminal groups that have attempted to influence the public sector. However, he insisted they do not jeopardise national security. Opposition deputies say they are not satisfied and plan to seek more answers. (Vijesti - 20/03/07; RTCG, Mina - 19/03/07)

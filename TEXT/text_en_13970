BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A former member of a Serb paramilitary unit admitted on Tuesday (15 November) that he took part in the execution of 200 Croat prisoners of war in Vukovar in November 1991. Ivan Atanasijevic, one of 16 defendants in a trial held in Belgrade's special court, told the judges that he was forced by his superiors to execute one of the prisoners. Since the trial started in December 2003, only a single protected Serb witness has admitted to taking part in the atrocity. (AP, B92, RTS, Tanjug - 15/11/05)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Outgoing chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte "disrupted The Hague prosecution with her unprofessional legal moves and politicising", Judge Geoffrey Nice told Bosnian media on Wednesday (December 12th). "Del Ponte did not prove to be a good law professional, a good manager or a good leader," said Nice, who handled proceedings against former Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic. Earlier this year, Nice accused del Ponte of suppressing key evidence involving Serbia and its role in the 1992-1995 conflicts. Her mandate ends on December 31st.
Meanwhile, Serbia's Minister in charge of Co-operation with The Hague Rasim Ljajic on Wednesday rejected del Ponte's latest claims that Serbia is not doing enough to catch fugitives Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic. He acknowledged, however, that authorities have made some mistakes. (Makfax, AP, B92, Dnevni Avaz, The Guardian, DW, Ria Novosti - 12/12/07)

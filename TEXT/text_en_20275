MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country's six main Croat parties affirmed support Friday (January 11th) for a proposed constitutional amendment that would lead to the federalisation of BiH. Dragan Covic, leader of the largest Croat party, the Croatian Democratic Union, said all Croat parties agree this would be the most appropriate constitutional arrangement to guarantee stability and facilitate progress. They insisted BiH state leaders should hammer out an agreement on the dynamics of constitutional reform talks. 
Separately, the main Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA) said on Sunday that the new BiH constitutional order should be organised at three levels of power -- central, municipal and regional, as in every modern state in Europe. The SDA said the BiH administrative division should be based on multi-ethnic regions established on an economic or geographic principle, rather than on ethnic criteria.

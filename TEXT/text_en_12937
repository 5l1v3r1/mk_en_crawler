BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH institutions must undergo thorough reforms, making authorities more effective and efficient, said Bruce Hitchner, chairman of the Dayton Peace Accords Project, on Saturday (30 April). He explained that the main reason for his visit to BiH was to find a way to enhance both the structure of the state and the civil sector, since both are necessary to facilitate European integration. According to Hitchner, the reform process should begin now and end in December at the latest. He added that involvement by the international community is necessary in the short run.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- More than 4,000 industrial workers staged a second rally in a week in front of the government's headquarters in Sarajevo on Wednesday (June 25th). They demanded higher salaries, back wages and better social insurance. The average monthly wage of an industrial worker is around 250 euros. Last Tuesday, thousands of veterans and disabled people joined a protest in the capital hoping to receive their delayed benefits. This time, protesters dispersed after FBiH Prime Minister Nedzad Brankovic promised to meet their demands by mid-September. (RTRS, SRNA, AFP, Dnevni Avaz - 25/06/08)

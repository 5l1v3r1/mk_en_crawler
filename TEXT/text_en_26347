THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The trial against the leader of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS), Vojislav Seselj, resumed on Tuesday (January 12th) at the UN war crimes tribunal after nearly a year of delay. The proceedings were suspended in February after a witness claimed he received threats from Seselj. The trial resumed with the interrogation of a protected witness behind closed doors. Seselj is charged with war crimes against non-Serbs in Croatia, Vojvodina and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 1993. On Tuesday, he asked the court to allow him to address the Serbian public ahead of early local elections in the Odzaci municipality, set for January 24th. He also wants to hold a press conference with reporters in Belgrade via telephone. The court will respond by Friday. (Tanjug, Politika, B92, BBC - 12/01/10)

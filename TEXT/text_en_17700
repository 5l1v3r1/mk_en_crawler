SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev urged a just, fair and swift resolution to the case of the five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor, sentenced to death in Libya following a controversial HIV infection trial, during a meeting with ambassadors from Arab countries on Wednesday (January 24th). Noting that the medics have already spent eight years behind bars, he said it is in Bulgaria and Libya's common interest to wrap up the case as soon as possible. He reiterated that the Libyan judiciary must take into account all evidence -- scientific and legal -- that would appear to exonerate the medics. (Bulgarian government website, BNR - 24/01/07)

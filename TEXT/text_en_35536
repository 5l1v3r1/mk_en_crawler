TIRANA, Albania -- Anti-government protests in Tirana on Saturday (7 February) turned violent when demonstrators clashed with police. About 100 protesters broke away from the crowd of 2,000 rallying in front of the government building, demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Fatos Nano. The smaller group attempted to enter the premises, throwing stones and breaking windows. That resulted in 64 arrests. The opposition Democratic Party has promised more protests on 20 February. According to local media, European Commission Ambassador Lutz Salzman and US Ambassador to Tirana James Jeffrey condemned the violence, urging Albania to concentrate on reforms if it wants to join NATO and the EU.

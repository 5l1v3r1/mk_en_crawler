TIRANA, Albania -- Deputy Prime Minster and Foreign Minister Ilir Meta called on the Albanian diaspora in the United States to work together with Albanian authorities in defending the country's image in the world. Meta made the statement at a meeting with Chairman of the Albanian-American National Council Richard Lukaj and Executive Director Martin Vulaj on Sunday (2 February) in Tirana. The foreign minister underlined the need for co-operation with the council for creating incentives for Albanians living in the United States to invest in their home country.

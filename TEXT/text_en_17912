PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The Unity Group, Kosovo's negotiating team for the status process, met on Wednesday (July 18th) to discuss the next elections in the province. President Fatmir Sejdiu, who leads the negotiators, said members want both parliamentary and local elections held this autumn, though organising elections must not serve as a reason to delay status. UNMIK says chief Joachim Ruecker will set a date soon.
In other news Wednesday, the Kosovo government approved a proposal by the Serb Ticket for Kosovo and Metohija to appoint Serb Suzana Andjelkovic as new minister of agriculture, forestry and rural development. The nomination will be forwarded to parliament for adoption. By law, ethnic minorities must hold three seats in the 13-member government. (Blic - 19/07/07; RTK, RFE, Balkanweb - 18/07/07)

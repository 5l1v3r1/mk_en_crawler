SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party reiterated its support Tuesday (March 4th) for embattled Transport Minister Petar Mutafchiev. He is under pressure to resign following last week's deadly fire aboard a train. Nine people were killed in the blaze, and several more were injured. The opposition says Mutafchiev must assume responsibility for the tragedy, which may have been caused by poor maintenance. Police are investigating other scenarios, however. Mutafchiev said on Tuesday he is prepared to resign out of a sense of morality. (BTA - 04/03/08)

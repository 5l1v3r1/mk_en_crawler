BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen visited Belgrade on Tuesday (14 March) to discuss issues related to the next round of Kosovo status talks, Friday in Vienna. During talks with Serbian President Boris Tadic, Jessen-Petersen said the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo is obligated to improve the living conditions of Serbs and other minorities in the province, or run the risk of losing administrative credibility. He also stressed that Kosovo Serbs must be convinced to participate in Kosovo institutions. 
In Pristina, it was announced that opposition leader Hashim Thaci will lead the Kosovo delegation in the next round of status talks. Newly elected Prime Minister Agim Ceku and Parliament Speaker Kole Berisha would also attend the meeting. (Danas - 15/03/06; Tanjug, B92 KosovaLive, AP - 14/03/06)

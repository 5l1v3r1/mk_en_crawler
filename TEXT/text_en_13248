ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament Speaker Vladimir Seks and the chairpersons of the parliamentary parties are to meet Monday (28 November) about ethnicity-related behaviour in the legislature. The main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) initiated the talks last week after a heated debate during which "improper manners" and verbal "intolerance" occurred, according to the SDP.
In other news, a new poll suggests that Croats feel mixed emotions about the country's future EU entry. According to the survey, conducted by the GfK agency, only 30 per cent of the respondents expect EU membership to bring them economic prosperity, while 20 per cent fear economic dependence on the EU.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- After a long debate, lawmakers adopted amendments to elections-related legislation Wednesday (July 25th), imposing substantial restrictions on expatriate voting in the October local vote. Under the new rules, voters will be eligible only if they have lived in Bulgaria for at least the past ten months. This effectively denies voting to a significant number of people who live and/or work abroad. Hardest hit will be the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, which relies heavily on the votes of emigrants living in Turkey. 
Parliament also decided to introduce a preferential vote for the local elections. In part, that means voters will be able to change the order in which candidates for municipal councils are listed. (Sega, Dnevnik, Monitor - 26/07/07; Darik, Mediapool - 25/07/07)

TIRANA, Albania -- At a Demo-Christian Party (DCP) conference Sunday (April 13th), leader Leonard Ndoka said that, on most issues, the ruling Democratic Party (DP) has become a twin of the opposition Socialist Party (SP). Nevertheless, Ndoka stressed that the DCP's coalition with the DP will continue. "We have a meeting with the leader of the majority [Sali] Berisha, in which we will discuss the best ways to choose an electoral system that will satisfy everybody," said Ndoka. He added that, if the DP does not include small parties in the decision-making process, they will reconsider their positions within the coalition. (BalkanWeb, Koha Jone, Top-Channel - 13/04/08)

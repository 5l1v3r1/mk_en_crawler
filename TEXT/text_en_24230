PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Ten members of the Kosovo parliament have formally requested discussion of a proposal to move the capital from Pristina to Prizren. They argue that Prizren has great significance to Albanians and thus is a more suitable site.
In other news, more than half of Kosovo's high school pupils have failed their final exam, local media reported on Saturday. Over 14,000 pupils, or 54.1% of all students who took the exam, were unable to pass. The education ministry commission in charge of the examination said that the results are similar to last year's. It insisted, however, that the criteria should not be lowered despite the negative results. (Kosova Sot, Express, RTV 21, Kohavision - 13/06/09)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Foreign Minister Solomon Passy said Friday (9 July) that the government will not change its policies towards the coalition in Iraq, despite demands from militants holding two Bulgarian civilian workers there. The insurgents, calling themselves the Unification and Holy War group, have threatened to behead the two -- identified as truck drivers Ivailo Kepov and Georgi Lazov -- unless US-led forces free all Iraqi prisoners. Bulgaria, which has contributed 470 troops to the US-led multinational force in Iraq, says it will not respond to terrorist blackmail.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In a speech to a committee of the European Parliament on Tuesday (November 27th), High Representative Miroslav Lajcak warned that the crisis in BiH could deepen and "spiral out of control". Lajcak expressed scepticism about the ability of the country's two entities to agree on key reforms and said each of them is trying to impose its own vision on the country. "The legacy of war and the logic of nationally based and zero-sum politics make any significant compromise profoundly difficult, if not entirely impossible," he concluded.
Later, Lajcak met with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who stressed the need to normalise the political situation quickly and resume the EU agenda, including police reform. (Nezavisne Novine, Dnevni Avaz - 28/11/07; OHR website, RTRS, Fena, PBS, AP - 27/11/07)

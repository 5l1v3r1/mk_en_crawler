ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic on Monday (November 12th) warned the army's Catholic chaplain to stay out of politics. Bishop Juraj Jezerinac stirred controversy last week when he referred to the Social Democrats as "Satanic", ahead of the November 25th elections. The bishop is directly appointed by the Vatican to head a group of army chaplains. Mesic said that while he had no authority to fire Jezerinac, he could ban him from access to army facilities. Polls suggest the Social Democrats are in a tight race with the ruling Christian Democrats. (AFP - 12/11/07)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Security Minister Sadik Ahmetovic said on Wednesday (May 11th) that his country has nothing to worry about concerning its EU visa liberalisation regime, as BiH respects the rules. He was speaking to journalists after the first meeting of EU and BiH teams charged with monitoring the visa-free regime. The experts say the number of Bosnian illegal immigrants to EU countries has dropped. (Srna, RTRS, Fena - 11/05/11)

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- A court in Nicosia found three people guilty Monday (May 16th) of illegally exhuming the remains of late Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos. The three -- two Cypriot brothers and an Indian -- were sentenced to between 18 and 20 months in prison each for illegally trespassing in the cemetery and hauling out the remains, a crime that shocked the island in December 2009, a year after the death. Papadopoulos was re-buried three months later after police arrested the trio and found his remains. (Cyprus Mail, Express, Zougla - 16/05/11)

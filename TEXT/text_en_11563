BUCHAREST, Romania -- Sorin Vicol, a minister-delegate for public oversight, stepped down from Romania's newly-formed government on Friday (21 January), after the customs and fiscal oversight bureaus -- which had been under his control -- were transferred to the Finance Ministry. Noting that his "job responsibilities have been seriously reduced", he acknowledged that the change had been already decided on by the previous government, following negotiations with the IMF. Vicol, a member of the Humanist Party, said the move would not weaken the cabinet, as his party will remain a member of the ruling coalition. (AFP - 21/01/05)

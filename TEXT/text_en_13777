SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Members of Macedonia's Anti-corruption Commission and Public Prosecutor Aleksandar Prcevski will meet next week in a new bid to improve bilateral co-operation, the head of the anti-corruption panel, Dragan Malinovski, said on Sunday (18 December). Speaking to Radio Free Europe, Malinovski conceded that communication between the two institutions has been problematic and that Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski got involved recently in an attempt to promote a settlement. He noted that problems fighting corruption would in turn affect foreign investment. (Makfax - 18/12/05)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The EBRD says the pace of reforms in Serbia-Montenegro generally is satisfactory. But EBRD leading economist Peter Sanfey noted Thursday (20 November) that progress is slow. Still, he predicted economic expansion would remain solid this year while inflation risks would be held in check. EBRD Director for Southeast Europe and the Caucasus Olivier Descamps said the country needs to resolve several key issues, including corruption, media freedom and ownership rights. Descamps added, however, that he is confident about a fresh capital inflow in the country, particularly in the agriculture, tourism and infrastructure sectors. So far the EBRD has extended 416.5m euros to Serbia-Montenegro. (Beta - 20/11/03)

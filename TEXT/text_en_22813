BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU gave its full support to Albania Monday (May 5th) to complete reforms aimed towards integrating the country into the Union. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso told Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha in Brussels that he needs to do more if his country wants to start negotiations to join the EU. "I assured [Berisha] of the European Commission's help financially and in other fields," Barroso said, adding that it is too early to set a date for Albania's accession negotiations.

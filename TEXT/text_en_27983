ANKARA, Turkey -- US Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Stuart Levey met with officials Thursday (October 21st) in an effort to boost momentum in implementing a UN Security Council resolution imposing sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme. "By sharpening the choices for Iran, they can see the advantage of choosing to go through the open door that ... leaders around the world have laid out for them," Levey said, after meeting with representatives of banks and financial institutions in Istanbul and senior government officials in Ankara. He added his visit to Turkey is part of the overall effort in this direction, noting Ankara's "important role, given its proximity to Iran". 
Visiting Washington on Thursday, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said that the sanctions would affect trade volume with its eastern neighbour. "We don't believe in sanctions," he said. (Hurriyet, Reuters, Press TV - 21/10/10)

LONDON, United Kingdom -- Athens will be among the safest places on Earth during the Olympics, British Sports Minister Richard Caborn said in an interview published Tuesday (10 August). Greek authorities have taken "every conceivable step" to make the Games safe, Caborn said. He added that hot weather, not terrorism, was the athletes' greatest concern.
Two Greek villages have ended an ongoing quarrel over which one has the oldest olive tree and is thus eligible to provide the wreath for the winner of the Olympic marathon. Athens Organising Committee chief Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki said organisers had settled the dispute by agreeing to use one branch from each village for, respectively, the winners of the men's and women's marathons.
In a television message broadcast Monday evening, Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said his country is ready for the Olympics. He thanked those who participated in organising the event, adding that all of Greece's political parties had contributed. He also expressed his gratitude to Greece's allies, who he said had done "everything humanly possible for all the athletes, missions and visitors to be safe".

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said on Saturday (October 3rd) that the positive outcome of the EU referendum in Ireland marks the beginning of "a new episode in the EU's development" and opens the door to all countries in Europe, including those in the Western Balkans. Referendum results on Saturday showed that more than two-thirds of Irish voters backed the Lisbon Treaty, which streamlines the running of the 27-nation bloc. Reiterating that EU membership is Serbia's strategic goal, Jeremic said that "soon the agreement will come into force that will enable this." (B92, Tanjug - 03/10/09)

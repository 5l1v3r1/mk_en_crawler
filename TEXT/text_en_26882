BERLIN, Germany -- The country's Federal Constitutional Court overturned on Friday (September 4th) an earlier ruling by a lower court to extradite the former head of the Greek affiliate of German concern Siemens, Michalis Christoforakos, to Greece where he is wanted for corruption. The High Court decided that the earlier decision violated Christoforakos' constitutional rights. Christoforakos, who holds dual Greek and German citizenship, was arrested in Germany on June 25th based on an arrest warrant issued by Greece. He allegedly offered bribes to employees of the Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation, while employed by Siemens. (Kathimerini - 05/09/09; Bloomberg - 04/09/09)

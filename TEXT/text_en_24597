TIRANA, Albania -- The process of issuing new electronic ID cards remains the most contentious issue ahead of the June 28th parliamentary elections, the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) said in a report published Monday (June 8th). It criticises the government for failing to provide enough information to citizens regarding the procedure. It also says the ODIHR had received inaccurate information from the interior ministry regarding the number of citizens who don't hold a valid passport and have not yet applied for an electronic ID card. One or the other is needed to cast a vote. The ministry says it was a technical mistake, while the main opposition Socialist Party says the ministry is trying to manipulate the election process.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Albanian Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu and Foreign Besnik Mustafaj were at NATO Headquarters in Brussels on Thursday (25 May), briefing Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer on the progress of defence reforms. The Albanian officials described initiatives the government has taken in restructuring the armed forces, aimed at transforming it into a small, well-trained force, capable of facing new challenges. The reforms, part of the Membership Action Plan for 2005-2006, are crucial to an invitation for NATO membership.
In Tirana, meanwhile, Albanian Chief of Staff Pellumb Qazimi met with Austrian counterpart General Roland Ertl on Thursday.

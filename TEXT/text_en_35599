KONYA, Turkey -- A 16-year-old boy was pulled alive from the ruins of an 11-story building in Konya on Sunday (8 February). Muhammet Kalem was taken to hospital where his condition was described as good. He spent five days in an air pocket before he was located. The death toll rose to 66 as workers pulled out another four bodies late Saturday. Police have arrested the building's architect and a contractor on charges of negligence and building code violations. The structure was built just five years ago. (AFP - 08/02/04; AP - 06/02/04)

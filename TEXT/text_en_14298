BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission proposed on Friday (10 March) a compensation plan under which Austria, Bulgaria and Romania would receive 106m euros in aid to repair damage from last summer's floods. Bulgaria would receive 20.4m euros and Romania 71.2m euros. The proposal, submitted to the European Parliament, must also get approval from the EU member states' governments. 
In other news, heavy rain at the weekend caused flooding in Bulgaria. Several dam lakes from the Arda hydro cascade in southern Bulgaria have topped their banks, causing landslides. Authorities have imposed emergency measures, including deliberate power supply cuts for safety reasons. (BNR, Dnevnik - 13/03/06; EU Web site - 10/03/06)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey's main political powers -- the ruling Justice and Development Party and the Republican People's Party (CHP) -- have reached agreement on key constitutional changes related to the planning of the state budget. The deal was announced jointly by Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul and CHP leader Deniz Baykal on Friday (28 October). It paves the way for the government to introduce a new three-year budget programme without facing CHP opposition. (NTV - 28/10/05)

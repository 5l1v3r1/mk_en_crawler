SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Central Election Commission Chairman Stjepan Mikic warned the main political parties on Friday (November 24th) that they had the weekend to meet the legal deadline for forming ruling blocs at both the state and entity levels. The deadline is Monday, 30 days after the release of the final official election results. Without action, the issue would move to the BiH and the Federation of BiH (FBiH) Constitutional Courts.
Also on Friday, the legal deadline for submitting candidates for the post of BiH prime minister designate passed. At least three names were submitted, including incumbent Adnan Terzic. (PBS BiH, RTRS, Dnevni avaz, Nezavisne novine, Oslobodjenje, Pincom.info - 25/11/06)

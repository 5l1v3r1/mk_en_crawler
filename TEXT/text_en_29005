BUCHAREST, Romania -- The cabinet officially submitted two bills to parliament on Monday (June 7th) that would implement controversial austerity measures, hammered out with the IMF. Two of the most drastic measures would reduce salaries in the public sector by 25%, and pensions and unemployment benefits by 15%. According to a procedure requested by the cabinet itself, a vote of confidence follows, likely early next week. 
Hundreds of labour union members protested outside parliament as the government submitted its plan. They demanded that the cabinet resign or that lawmakers vote no-confidence in the government. Protests resumed again on Tuesday. (AFP, BusinessWeek, AP, Mediafax - 07/06/10)

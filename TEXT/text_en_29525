TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha has confirmed the government's determination to adopt an intelligence law that respects NATO standards. Berisha met on Thursday (September 30th) with NATO Supreme Allied Commander for Europe James Stavridis, in Tirana. NATO countries had criticised the draft law on the State Information Service for stripping the institution of its independence and giving the executive branch more control over it. Stavridis meanwhile praised the role of Albanian troops deployed in Afghanistan, who are training Afghan forces. He also discussed NATO's continuing engagement in Kosovo, noting that the improving situation has allowed the Alliance to reduce its number of troops there.

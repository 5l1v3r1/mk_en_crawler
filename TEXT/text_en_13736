ANKARA, Turkey -- The screening process under the EU accession negotiations with Turkey begins in Brussels Thursday (20 October) with discussions about the science and technology chapter. Ankara has voiced plans to close at least one chapter in the talks by the end of this year.
Meanwhile, Angela Merkel, the next German chancellor, criticised Gerhard Schroeder for telling Ankara recently that the privileged partnership proposal is no longer an option. According to international media reports, Merkel accused the outgoing chancellor of "going too far" and signaled that she might support some form of partnership with Turkey that falls short of full EU membership
In other news, Turkey sealed a loan agreement with the World Bank on Wednesday that provides 310m euros to implement the Istanbul Seismic Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness Project. The goal is to make the city more resistant to a major earthquake. (FT - 20/10/05; NTV, World Bank Web site - 19/10/05)

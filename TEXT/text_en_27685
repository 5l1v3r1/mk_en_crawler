ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday (June 28th) that Turkey has closed its airspace to Israeli military flights. According to Anadolu news agency, Erdogan told reporters in Toronto -- where he is attending the G-20 summit -- that the ban was imposed after the May 31st Israeli raid on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla that left nine Turkish activists dead. At least one flight has been affected so far: a plane carrying Israeli officers to Poland for a tour of Auschwitz was forced to find an alternate route. Turkey says civilian air travel is not affected, and that military flights will be decided on a case-by-case basis.
On the sidelines of the summit Saturday, Erdogan met with US President Barack Obama to discuss co-operation in fighting terrorism, as well as Iran's nuclear programme and relations between Turkey and Israel. The leaders stressed the importance of co-operation among Washington, Ankara and Baghdad in combating the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and agreed that this must continue. When Obama expressed concern about the latest developments in Turkish-Israeli ties, Erdogan reiterated that Israel should apologise, offer compensation and lift its blockade on Gaza.

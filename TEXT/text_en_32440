ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament may vote Thursday (20 March) on a government proposal permitting US and allied troops to use Turkish air space in strikes against Iraq. But Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan stressed that the motion does not allow deployment of US troops on Turkish territory. Nor would participating aircraft would be allowed to land or refuel at Turkish bases. On Wednesday, US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said opening up airspace would not make Turkey eligible for billions in special economic assistance. "We have said that the package that was developed was based on full participation and involvement of Turkey," he explained. Economy Minster Ali Babacan concedes the offer for $6 billion in aid is off the table.
The United States meanwhile is reducing its diplomatic staff in Turkey, in light of the military operations next door. (Anadolu Agency, Turkish Daily News, AFP - 20/03/03; AP, AFP, Reuters, CNN, Anadolu Agency, TRT 2, Turkish Daily News, Milliyet - 19/03/03; AFP, Reuters - 18/03/03)

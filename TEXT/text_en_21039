SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Experts from the ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) have drafted a set of measures aimed at tightening strike-related legislation, local media reported on Wednesday (January 2nd). In effect, the measures are going to extend the period for preliminary negotiations between trade unions and employers. Currently, a strike can be launched within a week of its announcement. Under the new legislation, however, the start of a strike can be delayed up to three months, at the discretion of the employer. Employers and unions would have up to two months to reach a settlement, unlike current procedures. Then, labour disputes will be transferred to arbitrators, for another month-long effort at resolution. Media reports suggest the government is attempting to avoid a new mass strike, such as last year's lengthy teachers' protest. (Sega, Dir.bg - 03/01/08)

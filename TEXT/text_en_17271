BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic said on Sunday (April 29th) that Belgrade had not yet received official responses to the diplomatic note it sent to Sarajevo and Zagreb -- regarding the recent International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling in the BiH vs. Serbia genocide case. Late last week, Serbia said it requested BiH and Croatia cease what Belgrade describes as an "ill-minded" campaign against the ICJ decision, which acquitted Serbia of direct responsibility for the July 1995 genocide in Srebrenica. 
On Sunday, the Bosniak member of the BiH Presidency, Haris Silajdzic, strongly criticised Serbia's move, describing it as an intolerable attempt to interfere in the sovereign rights of another state. (Tanjug, Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 30/04/07; RTRS - 29/04/07)

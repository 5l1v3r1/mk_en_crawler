TUZLA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EUFOR handed over control of the Orao military base in Tuzla to the BiH Defence Ministry on Wednesday (June 27th), at a ceremony attended by EUFOR Rear Admiral Hans-Jochen Witthauer. He noted the event also marked the end of the mandate of Multinational Task Force North and the transformation of EUFOR into new structures of regional co-ordination centres and observation teams, deployed across BiH, in light of considerable progress achieved in recent years. 
Also Wednesday, the governing bodies of the BiH Missing Persons Institute held their first session. The institute is assuming the lead role in addressing the issue of missing persons from the BiH conflict. (PBS BiH, RTRS, ICMP website - 27/06/07)

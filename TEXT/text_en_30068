PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The head of International Civilian Office, Pieter Feith, is encouraging Kosovo institutions to continue decentralisation and start implementing the process in the Serb-dominated north as well. After a meeting Wednesday (March 23rd) of the Inter-ministerial Group on Decentralisation, Feith insisted decentralisation should remain a priority for the government across Kosovo, in order to convince citizens in the north that it is a positive process. The government plans to establish a municipality in northern Mitrovica by the end of this year. Minister of Local Government Administration Slobodan Petrovic said that decentralisation in the north needs concrete plans. (Koha Ditore, Kosova Sot, Zeri - 23/03/11)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A new poll finds the public in each of BiH's entities agrees on the need to join the EU. The survey by the Strategic Marketing agency appeared in Nezavisne Novine Sunday (July 22nd) and found that 65% of people in Republika Srpska (RS) would support the country's EU entry if a membership referendum were held now. Support is even higher in the Federation of BiH (FBiH) -- 82%. Only 12% of RS voters and 7% of those in FBiH oppose EU membership. The majority of the people in both entities said the main benefits of EU integration would be economic development, strengthening of democracy, improved public security and more efficient laws and media.

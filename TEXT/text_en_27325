BELGRADE, Serbia -- An interim trade agreement between Serbia and the EU becomes effective Monday (February 1st), according to Vincent Degert, head of the European Commission (EC) delegation to Serbia. The agreement was delayed because of Serbia's unresolved issues with The Hague regarding war crimes. The EC pushed through a compromise late last year, convincing EU members to launch at least the trade agreement. In December, EU foreign ministers agreed to unblock the accord after Hague chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz gave a positive assessment of Belgrade's co-operation. The Serbian government began unilaterally applying the agreement a year ago. (Beta, Tanjug, B92 - 31/01/10)

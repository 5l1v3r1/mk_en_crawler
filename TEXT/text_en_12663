PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Following talks in Pristina on Friday (4 February), UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen and Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj announced that dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade could begin within two weeks. Talks would be held in Belgrade and focus on issues related to the problem of missing persons. Haradinaj said he expects Kosovo will make considerable progress in fulfilling internationally set standards by the end of May, which he says would enable the start of status discussions in September.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliament adopted a measure Saturday (November 24th) enabling the appointment of judges to the constitutional court. Lawmakers selected five people for judgeships from a list of ten candidates proposed by President Boris Tadic. Parliament also prepared a list of ten candidates from which Tadic will pick five names. The remaining five constitutional court judges will be appointed by the Supreme Court of Cassation, once the institution is formed. Work by the constitutional court has been blocked for more than a year. The court will be able to convene once ten out of the 15 judges are appointed.

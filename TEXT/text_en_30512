SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament approved a proposal Friday (April 8th) urging the government to speed up talks with Turkey on compensation for hundreds of thousands of Bulgarians who were displaced in the early 20th century. The compensations, amounting to about $10 billion, are intended for an estimated 800,000 heirs of Bulgarians who were forced to flee their homes in Turkey's northeast region of Thrace in 1913. Last year, the issue raised by former Bulgarian Minister without Portfolio in charge of Bulgarians abroad Bozhidar Dimitrov spurred a sharp reaction from Ankara, which warned that it may harm bilateral relations. Dimitrov maintains that resolving this issue involving Thracian refugees should be a condition of Turkey's EU membership. (Frog News, Trud, Novinar, 24 Chasa, Dnevnik - 08/04/11)

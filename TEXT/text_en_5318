At the onset of Serbia's economic crisis in December 2008, the bonus for Serbian government employees in Kosovo was cut in half. Earlier this month, Serbia's Constitutional Court moved to abolish the bonuses altogether. 
The decision has angered Kosovo Serbs, who say their difficult living conditions justify the extra pay. 
Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic says it is in the country's interest to keep Serbs living and working in Kosovo. And that such an effort warrants a solution in line with the constitution.

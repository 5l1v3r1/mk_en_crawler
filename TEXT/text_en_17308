BRUSSELS, Belgium -- US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried told the Reuters news agency Saturday (April 28th) that the UN Security Council would start drafting a new resolution on Kosovo -- based on the Ahtisaari plan -- after the return of the UN fact-finding mission to New York. He added that the United States expects Russia to approach the issue constructively. 
"We hope that Russia understands that Kosovo is going to be independent one way or another," said Fried, who was attending a forum in Brussels. "It will either be done in a controlled, supervised way that provides for the well-being of the Serbian people, or it will take place in an uncontrolled way and the Kosovo Serbs will suffer the most, which would be terrible." 
He also said the EU would be divided over recognising an independent Kosovo if the ethnic Albanian majority declared independence without a Security Council resolution. "A divided Europe is a bad thing in general and a terrible thing in this particular case," the US diplomat said.

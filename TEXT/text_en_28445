BELGRADE, Serbia -- As expected, a lawyer representing Ratko Mladic's family filed a motion Wednesday (June 16th) to have the former Bosnian Serb military commander declared dead. But Rasim Ljajic, head of Serbia's national council for co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal, says that won't affect the search for him. Mladic's relatives argue he had been in poor health and there has been no sighting of him for seven years, attorney Milos Saljic said. If he is declared dead, the family can proceed with pension and inheritance issues. (RTS, Beta, Blic, FoNet, AP - 16/06/10)

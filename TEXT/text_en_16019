BELGRADE, Serbia -- The country's special war crimes court on Monday (18 September) sentenced a former KLA fighter to 13 years in prison for his part in the murder of one man and torture of ten Roma. Anton Lekaj, 26, was a teenage member of a unit that abducted the Roma from a wedding party in the Djakovica area. The captives were tortured and one of them, a young underage girl, was raped. According to the indictment, Lekaj's unit was under the command of Ramush Haradinaj, the former prime minister of Kosovo. He is due to stand trial for war crimes in The Hague.

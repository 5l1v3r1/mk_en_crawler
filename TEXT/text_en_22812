BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania's ruling National Liberal Party (PNL) called on European Parliament members to demand the resignation of EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini over his statements regarding immigration. "[Frattini's] statements contradict the European Convention on Human Rights," PNL Deputy Chairman and Defence Minister Teodor Melescanu said on Monday (May 5th). 
Last month, Frattini supported a review of the European directive on free movement within EU member states, saying that the free movement of citizens cannot turn into a free movement of criminals. He also suggested that foreigners without the minimum income necessary to live in Italy should be expelled from the country and that those who committed crimes in Italy should be sent to court, sentenced and deported.

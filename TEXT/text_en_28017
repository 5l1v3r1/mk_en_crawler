TIRANA, Albania -- The government decided on Thursday (August 19th) to increase incomes for the unemployed by 3.5%, to about 60 euros a month. Opposition parties criticise the decision, saying it is insufficient. Officially, the jobless rate in Albania is 14%, but independent organisations estimate it is actually far higher.

TIRANA, Albania -- Visiting Tirana on Wednesday (19 October), UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen said the upcoming decision on starting Kosovo status talks would be in the interest of the province and all countries in the region. During a joint news conference with Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha, Jessen-Petersen said he plans to attend Monday's UN Security Council session, which would decide whether to launch the negotiations. "We have all come to the conclusion that after six years, (Kosovo's) status quo is no longer tenable," he said. 
In Paris Wednesday, Nicholas Burns, US undersecretary of state for political affairs, echoed that sentiment, saying the current status quo in Kosovo is unsustainable and must change through negotiations.
In Pristina, police arrested dozens of unruly protestors rallying outside the UN mission on Wednesday. They were demanding the departure of the international administration and immediate independence for Kosovo. 
Separately, UNMIK Police Commissioner Kai Vittrup confirmed on Wednesday that gunmen wearing black uniforms have been spotted in western and southwest Kosovo, stopping cars and searching them. Vittrup says UN police are ready to arrest them. (Albanian News, Politika - 20/10/05; Albanian President's Web site, Tanjug, Pravda, AP, Reuters, AFP, Beta, KosovaLive, RTS - 19/10/05)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government decided on Tuesday (27 December) to nominate Burgas regional police department head General Krassimir Popov as chief of the border police, replacing General Valeri Grigorov, who is taking early retirement. An official decree from President Georgi Parvanov is required for the appointment to go into effect. Local media reports tie the personnel change to a shortfall amounting to millions of euros in state revenues that resulted from unpaid transit taxes.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- BiH leaders assured EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn on Thursday (February 28th) that they will soon adopt key police reform laws that would clear the way for the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU. After talks with the leaders of the six ruling parties, the BiH presidency members and Prime Minister Nikola Spiric, Rehn told reporters, "I'm confident in April we should be able to sign the agreement." The SAA is the first step towards candidate status.
For his part, Spiric insisted BiH has made a substantial progress and stressed the Council of Ministers is fully committed to the EU reform agenda. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 29/02/08; RTRS, Fena, AFP, Reuters - 28/02/08)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova said Tuesday (26 October) he expects the new institutions in the province to be established soon. His comments followed a meeting between UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen and chairmen of the leading ethnic Albanian parties. Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) won Saturday's parliamentary elections with 45 per cent of the vote, falling short of an absolute majority. He said the LDK is considering coalition scenarios. Hashim Thaci, whose Democratic Party of Kosovo was second with 28 per cent of the vote, said after the talks that he stood for a broad coalition and a multiethnic government. The new parliament must be constituted within 30 days of the final results. (KosovaLive, Beta, Tanjug - 26/10/04)

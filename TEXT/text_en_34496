ATHENS, Greece -- Police officers, firefighters and coast guard personnel staged protests late Wednesday (8 October), demanding better pay and benefits. At one point the demonstrators, attempting to enter the finance ministry to deliver their petitions, scuffled with fellow officers. Other public sector employees were also on strike demanding better pay. The protests began after publication of the 2004 budget. The government insists no more money is available, given the cost of the 2004 Summer Olympics.
In other news, Greek hoteliers are accusing the government of failing to promote the country as a travel location ahead of the Olympics. The head of the Attica Hoteliers Association says one gauge shows bookings off by 12.5 per cent compared to the same period last year. The government blames the slump on international factors.
Also Wednesday, Press and Media Minister Christos Protopappas said Greece has succeeded in creating an image of a modern European country in the foreign press. He added that the Olympics should provide another image boost. (AP, ANA - 08/10/03)

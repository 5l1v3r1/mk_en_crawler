BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Christina Gallach, EU security chief Javier Solana's spokeswoman, urged Albania's political parties Wednesday (13 September) to adhere to the recently sealed accord on political dialogue, and to work together to resolve various disputes that surfaced this summer. Gallach said the Union is concerned about the stalemate that halted work by the parliament earlier this year and wants to make sure the situation does not recur. (Albanian News - 14/09/06)

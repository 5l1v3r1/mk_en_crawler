TIRANA, Albania -- Troops continued their search for survivors Monday (March 17th) as the death toll from a series of huge munitions depot blasts Saturday near Tirana rose to nine. At least ten people are still missing. More than 240 people were injured in the string of blasts at a base used to stockpile outdated munitions awaiting controlled detonation. The base is near the village of Gerdec, about 15km from Tirana. 
The government says 110 people were disposing of shells, assisted by employees of a US company hired by NATO. Albanian President Bamir Topi said on Sunday that an inquiry by two prosecution teams is under way, covering different periods. Chief Prosecutor Ina Rama said that investigators are also looking into the activities of the subcontractor and a possible criminal act. Destroying old munitions is one condition Albania must fulfil to become a member of NATO. (TVSH, Top Channel, Vizion+, KLAN, AFP, Reuters, Financial Times - 16/03/08)

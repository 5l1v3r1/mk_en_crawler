SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria's Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin said Friday (25 August) that the government is considering several options to contribute troops to the UN-mandated mission in southern Lebanon. He said the first option is a 50-member contingent tasked with patrolling, security and convoy activities; and the second option is to send a frigate. The country could provide 40-member engineering and construction contingents as well. 
On a related note, newly-appointed UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker in an interview with German Die Welt on Friday refused to discuss independence as UN solution for Kosovo. Ruecker reiterated that the international community had determined the three no-goes in the process of finding a solution for the final status -- the province cannot return to its pre-1999 status, it cannot be annexed to another state and it cannot be divided. He also stressed that it is important that Kosovo Serbs take part in the political and economic life of the province and its institutions. (B92, Tanjug, RTRS, A1 TV, AFP - 25/08/06)

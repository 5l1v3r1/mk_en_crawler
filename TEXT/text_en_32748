BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Serbia's election commission on Thursday (12 December) rejected another appeal by presidential candidate Vojislav Kostunica, who insists the latest vote was rigged by inflating the voter registration list. Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia is claiming that the actual number of voters was illegally inflated by 835,553 in order to bring the turnout under the required 50 per cent.
Meanwhile, Slobodan Vucetic, chairman of the Serbian Constitutional Court, said that Parliament Speaker Natasa Micic has until 8 February to call new elections. Three rounds have failed since October. (Tanjug, B92, FoNet, BBC - 12/12/02)

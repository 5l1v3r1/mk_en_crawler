BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government is asking the public to attend a mass rally Thursday (February 21st) to protest Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence. Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to join the protest outside parliament. Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica of the Democratic Party is expected to address the crowd, as is opposition Serbian Radical Party deputy leader Tomislav Nikolic. 
President Boris Tadic will not attend, due to a trip to Romania. Additionally, he disapproves of such protests, arguing that Kosovo is not a political issue, but rather "a national and a state" issue. (ITAR-TASS, Danas, Reuters, RTS, AFP - 21/02/08; Tanjug, Beta, RIA Novosti - 20/02/08)

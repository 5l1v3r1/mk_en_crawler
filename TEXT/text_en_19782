AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands -- NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said on Wednesday (October 24th) there is no reason to reduce the number of KFOR soldiers in the province. There are currently 16,000 soldiers there. De Hoop Scheffer made the comment after an informal meeting of defence ministers from NATO member states. Earlier this week, US Defence Secretary Robert Gates Gates said the US may shift some of its forces from Kosovo to Afghanistan next year if NATO does not provide reinforcement in Afghanistan. 
In other news Wednesday, the OSCE Presence in Kosovo announced that preparations for the November 17th local and parliamentary elections are complete.

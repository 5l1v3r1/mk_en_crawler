BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica said Saturday (14 December) that his Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) would support the Serbian government provided that talks on a new Serbian constitution start at once. He stressed that DSS would not support any party or institution that believes reforms could be conducted under the current, Milosevic-era constitution. Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's Democratic Party retorted that it does not need DSS's support and described Kostunica's statement as "inappropriate". (B92, FoNet, BBC - 16/12/02)

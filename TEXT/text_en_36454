TIRANA, Albania -- US judicial experts Paul Magnuson and Roger Sherrard said Wednesday (12 May) that Albania's judicial system has made significant progress. Magnuson is the head of the International Judicial Relations Committee of the US Judicial Conference and Minnesota District Court, and Sherrard is an Advocates International's Board member. They visited Albania at the invitation of the Supreme Court. Despite the progress, they found that problems remain: corruption and a lack of judicial independence. They also advocated improved communication with the public. (ATA - 12/05/04)

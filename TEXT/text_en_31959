BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic said Thursday (24 October) that the republic's economy would continue to recover in 2003. Economic growth, he said, would be slightly better than the four per cent anticipated for this year. He noted that Serbia is in a stronger position than other eastern European states and is the only one that has avoided recession during the global economic downturn. Inflation was expected to fall to nine per cent from the anticipated level of 15 per cent in 2002. GDP is expected to rise to $15 billion from the current $12.2 billion. Djindjic's comments came as he unveiled a $4.3 billion draft budget for 2003. The new budget will be 22.7 per cent higher, with much of the increase coming from the sale of state-owned companies.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly on Friday (7 May) to adopt amendments to the constitution that would reduce the powers of the military and promote democracy in the country. By a vote of 457-8, parliament removed the military's representatives in boards that oversee broadcasting and education and scrapped the special courts that examine political cases. Justice Minister Cemil Cicek told lawmakers that the amendments "will institutionalise democracy in Turkey and render rights and freedoms permanent". He added that the government is drafting a set of changes that would enhance personal rights and freedoms further. All the changes are in line with EU standards. Turkey hopes to receive a date in December for the start of Union accession talks. (Bloomberg, Anadolu Agency, Reuters - 07/05/04)

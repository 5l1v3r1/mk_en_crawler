BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU snubbed Albania on Monday (May 23rd), excluding it from signing an agreement on crisis management operations. Diplomatic sources told Top Channel that there was no sense inviting Albania to participate in crisis-solving operations for other countries given its domestic situation since the May 8th local elections. The opposition has been holding daily protests in Tirana against the government and the election commission, accusing it of serving the ruling party. 
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Edmond Haxhinasto participated in the 13th session of the Adriatic-Ionian Council in Brussels. He says that Albania has met required election standards and that the process is in its closing stages. (Top Channel, Shekulli, Ora News - 23/05/11)

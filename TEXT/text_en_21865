SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government decided on Wednesday (June 18th) to stop funding ten projects financed by the pre-accession PHARE programme and worth a total of 88.4m euros. The decision is pre-emptive, as the European Commission likely will recommend the same measure. Deputy Prime Minister Meglena Plugchieva noted that an audit by international consultants from KPMG turned up a series of violations. The ministry of regional development and the state infrastructure fund, both of which have poor reputations, manage the projects. Plugchieva added that the scope of violations requires the case to go to the prosecutor's office. (Sega, Pari, Trud - 19/06/08; bTV, BTA - 18/06/08)

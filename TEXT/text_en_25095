BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Supreme Court on Friday (December 25th) upheld the maximum 40-year sentence handed down to former state security service chief Radomir Markovic, for organising an assassination attempt against an opposition leader in 1999. In its decision, the court said that Markovic, who served under Slobodan Milosevic, was guilty of first-degree murder. The target of the plot, Serbian Renewal Movement leader Vuk Draskovic, survived. But four others were killed in the October 1999 car accident involving Draskovic's motorcade. The Supreme Court also upheld the 30 to 40-year prison sentences handed down to Markovic's six accomplices (AP, B92, FoNet, Deutsche Welle - 25/12/09)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Around 1,500 supporters of the largest ethnic Albanian party in Macedonia -- the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) -- gathered in Skopje Friday (September 28th) to protest the police reaction during clashes at the parliament building earlier in the week. "We organised a demonstration against the state terror," Xhevad Ademi, a DUI parliament member, told AFP. 
On Tuesday, at least nine people were injured after violence broke out at parliament. The brawl erupted during an argument among the ethnic Albanian parties over election reforms. (Makfax, A1, UPI, Sofia news agency, Kanal 5 - 29/09/07; AFP - 28/09/07; Reuters - 26/09/07)

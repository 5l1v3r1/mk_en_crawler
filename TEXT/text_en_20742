ZAGREB, Croatia -- The trial against politician Branimir Glavas, charged along with six other people with committing war crimes in 1991 against Serb civilians in Osjek, resumed on Monday (January 7th) despite Glavas' health. He has been on a hunger strike for the past two months and his lawyer says his condition is grave. But at the beginning of Monday's session, experts said the former general is fit enough to follow the proceedings. (HRT - 08/01/08; Vecernji List, Tanjug, B92 - 07/01/08)

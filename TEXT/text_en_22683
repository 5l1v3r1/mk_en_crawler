ZAGREB, Croatia -- Radimir Cacic was elected chairman of the opposition Croatian People's Party (HNS) on Sunday (April 6th), winning almost 73% of support at the party's congress. Cacic succeeds Vesna Pusic, who decided to retire partially due to health issues. After his election, Cacic said his priority would be to ensure the HNS provides quality opposition to the ruling Croatian Democratic Union, something he said the other main opposition party -- the Social Democratic Party -- cannot.

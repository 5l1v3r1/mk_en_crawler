BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu wore a plaster cast at Wednesday's (26 July) cabinet session, after injuring his left knee in a motorcycle accident Tuesday evening near Bucharest. According to local media reports, the prime minister, a keen motorcyclist, lost control of his Harley-Davidson and collided with a car. The other driver was not hurt. During the cabinet meeting, Tariceanu proposed a 30 per cent reduction in the number of ministry state secretaries, in an effort to make public administration more efficient.

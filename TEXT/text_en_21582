TIRANA, Albania -- Prosecutors announced on Thursday (November 27th) they are filing corruption charges against former Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha. At issue is a contract signed in 2006, when Basha served as transport minister, involving the construction of the Durres-Kukes highway, connecting Albania and Kosovo. The deal was the biggest Albanian investment in decades. 
In other news, thousands of protestors led by the opposition Socialist Movement for Integration rallied on Thursday against the new election code, arguing it violates their right to a free vote. Parliament passed the new electoral code, a rare example of consensus between the ruling Democratic Party and the main opposition Socialist Party, on November 18th. Smaller parties object to their exclusion from election committees under the new code. They also say the new regional system of proportional representation will greatly reduce their numbers in parliament. (Makfax, AP, Shekulli, BBC, Top Channel - 27/11/08)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Justice Minister Ivan Simonovic said on Wednesday (September 2nd) that Croatia will appeal an Australian court decision not to extradite former Serb paramilitary leader Dragan Vasiljkovic. Known as "Captain Dragan", Vasiljkovic, 54, was arrested in January 2006 on the basis of an Interpol warrant issued by Zagreb. Croatia accuses him of involvement in the 1991 torture and killing of Croatian civilians and prisoners of war in the rebel Serb stronghold of Knin, and in the southern village of Bruska in 1993. An Australian court, however, concluded that if Vasiljkovic were extradited to Croatia for trial on war crimes charges, he would face "a substantial or real chance of prejudice".

TIRANA, Albania -- Four Albanian commandos have been infected with the H1N1 virus in Afghanistan, local media reported on Thursday (September 3rd). One soldier is under medical care at the Spanish contingent, while three others are in quarantine. All their conditions are stable. Media reported that several weeks ago about ten Spanish soldiers were infected with the virus and were sent back to Spain for treatment.
Elsewhere, an immigrant living in Greece was described on Thursday as the first Albanian to die of swine flu. Jani Metushi, 25, had been undergoing treatment since August 19th at an Athens hospital. He is believed to have been infected while on holiday on the Greek island of Paros. Doctors said he was battling other illnesses that enabled the virus to spread more rapidly.

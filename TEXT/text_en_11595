SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski, the chairman of the ruling Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia, urged the opposition Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) on Wednesday (23 March) to reconsider its planned boycott of Sunday's second round of local elections. Buckovski stressed that DPA's withdrawal from the election process would affect the ethnic Albanian political bloc in Macedonia as well as democratisation in general. His appeal followed a meeting intended to draw together leaders of the main parties. But no DPA representative attended the talks, nor did any from the main opposition Macedonian party, VMRO-DPMNE.
In other news, Buckovski visited Sofia on Wednesday, where he called for greater Bulgarian investment in Macedonia. Buckovski and Bulgarian counterpart Simeon Saxe-Coburg described bilateral relations as better than ever.

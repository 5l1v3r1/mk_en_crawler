ZAGREB, Croatia -- Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte has sent a letter to Croatian President Stipe Mesic, advising him that prosecutors at The Hague are unwilling to drop charges against retired Gen Ante Gotovina. The letter, written in response to a request by Mesic, was published by the president's office on Tuesday (17 June). Del Ponte added that Croatia's top war crimes suspect must surrender or face arrest and extradition. Gotovina went into hiding in 2001 as soon as he was formally indicted for the killing of 150 Serbs during a 1995 military operation in southern Croatia. In an interview for a local newspaper last week, Gotovina said he was prepared to talk to UN investigators. (AFP, HINA - 17/06/03)

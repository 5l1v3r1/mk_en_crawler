SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Participants in the social and economic council working on the cabinet's anti-crisis plan announced on Monday (March 29th) that the standard VAT will rate not be raised by 2%, as initially proposed, but will remain at 20%. They did not rule out a future hike, however, particularly if budget revenues continue to underperform. The main sources of revenue will be privatisation deals and cutting expenses by 10%.

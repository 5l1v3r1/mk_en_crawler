STRASBOURG, France -- European Parliament (EP) members held a debate Wednesday (July 7th) on two resolutions regarding the progress of Albania and Kosovo on their roads to EU integration. Addressing the session, Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele welcomed Tirana's progress in meeting conditions for visa liberalisation, but pointed out that problems remain, stemming from the political stalemate. The opposition has resumed a parliamentary boycott because the government refuses to investigate alleged manipulation of the June 2009 elections. Fuele also noted that corruption and organised crime remain major concerns. As for Kosovo, Fuele said the country is an EU priority and stressed the importance of an upcoming ruling by the International Court of Justice on the legality of Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia. The EP passed both resolutions Thursday. (Shekulli, Koha.net, Gazeta 55, BalkanWeb - 07/07/10)

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic called on former Bosnian Serb Army commander Ratko Mladic to surrender to the war crimes tribunal. In an interview with <I>Vecernje Novosti</I> on Monday (13 January), Djindjic urged those close to Mladic to persuade him to surrender in order to relieve Serbia of international pressure. The international community claims that Mladic is hiding in Serbia and that Belgrade authorities are protecting him.
In related news, Djindjic asserted that the federal government has provided bail guarantees to former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic. Authorities insist that he will face the tribunal now that technicalities are being resolved. (FoNet, Tanjug, BBC, B92, Vecernje Novosti - 13/01/03)

TIRANA, Albania -- The OSCE on Tuesday (June 9th) urged political parties in Albania to boost mutual trust to enable free and fair elections later this month, in line with international standards. Wolfgang Grossruck, OSCE special co-ordinator for the June 28th parliamentary elections, met with Interior Minister Bujar Nishani on Tuesday, telling him he is optimistic that officials will complete preparations in time. Nishani in turn noted that his ministry has published an electronic registry of voters, in accordance with OSCE and European Commission recommendations.
Meanwhile, in a report Tuesday, Transparency International Albania criticised the authorities for how the electoral lists were compiled and -- separately -- political parties, for failing to spell out spending, which raises questions about funding.

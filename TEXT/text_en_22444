PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci has confirmed Pristina's opposition to the six-point plan put forward by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that reconfigures the international presence in Kosovo, handing most UNMIK duties to EULEX, the EU's police mission to Kosovo. One key exception would be in the Serb-dominated north, where UNMIK would continue to oversee police. 
"Substantial elements of the proposal are and will remain unacceptable," Thaci said on Thursday (November 13th) after meeting with President Fatmir Sejdiu. Both still support the plan proposed by the former UN envoy for Kosovo, Martti Ahtisaari. Thaci asked EULEX to respect Kosovo's independence and its constitution and to guarantee full territorial integrity. 
In other news Thursday, the head of the European Commission Delegation in Pristina, Renzo Daviddi, urged Kosovo to strengthen the rule of law and reform its public administration. "Reform depends on the capacity of Kosovo authorities to face challenges, and they must move the process forward," Daviddi said at a conference on adjusting Kosovo's laws to match those of the EU. Thaci says every bill is in accordance with EU legislation. (Koha Ditore, Zeri, Express - 14/11/08; Kohavision, TV 21, RTK, Telegrafi - 13/11/08)

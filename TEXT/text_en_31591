BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic will surrender to The Hague tribunal on Monday (20 January), according to the Reuters news agency, which quoted an unidentified source from the government in Belgrade. It was unclear whether Milutinovic, who has heart problems, will be granted provisional release. He is to face the tribunal for alleged war crimes committed in Kosovo in 1999.
In other news, the head of a group calling for the release of Slobodan Milosevic says a team of Yugoslav doctors will be allowed to examine the ailing former Yugoslav President, probably late this week. This, as the Socialist Party finally re-elected Milosevic as leader at a stormy session on Saturday. (AP, AFP - 18/01/03; Reuters, B92, Tanjug, FoNet - 17/01/03)

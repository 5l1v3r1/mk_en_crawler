PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni said on Monday (August 23rd) that Kosovo will not offer a counter resolution to the document Serbia has submitted to the UN General Assembly for discussion next month. Kosovo institutions do not consider it necessary to present a counter resolution, Hyseni said during a lecture at the 29th International Seminar for Albanian language, literature and culture in Pristina. He added that the main goal of Kosovo and its international supporters is for Serbia's resolution to fail. (Zeri, Koha Ditore, Top News, Telegrafi - 24/08/10)

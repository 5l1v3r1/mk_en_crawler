BRDO PRI KRANJU, Slovenia -- Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel opened a two-day international conference on stability in the Western Balkans Friday (September 21st) by saying Slovenia hopes its path to EU membership would be quickly followed by Croatia, and the other countries in the region. He also touched on the Kosovo status issue, reiterating that the three principles of the Contact Group -- that Kosovo cannot be divided, that there is no return to the situation before 1999, and that the province cannot be adjoined to any neighbouring territory -- should be respected in ongoing negotiations.

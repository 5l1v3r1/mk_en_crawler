BUCHAREST, Romania -- The country's European integration ministry, together with the institutions involved in preparing Romania's EU accession, will draw up an action plan for the period 2002-2003 to address problems cited in the European Commission progress report. Minister Hildegard Puwak said Monday (14 October) that the action plan will focus on 11 priorities identified in the report, in order to accelerate reforms in public administration, judicial system and economy.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament begins discussing several draft laws Friday (4 July) aimed at preventing violence at sporting events. Drafts that impose stiff penalties for violators would be passed under an emergency procedure.
Meanwhile, an incident last weekend in Vukovar has raised international concern. Organisers of the Vukovar War Veterans' soccer tournament banned a 14-year-old Croatian Serb boy from participating, reportedly because of his ethnicity. The OSCE denounced the decision as discriminatory. (HINA, MIA - 03/07/03)

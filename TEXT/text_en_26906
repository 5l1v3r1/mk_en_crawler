SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina -- Forensic experts announced Wednesday (August 5th) that they have identified the remains of Colonel Avdo Palic, former commander of Bosniak forces in the Zepa "safe" area. Palic went missing in July 1995, at the end of the Bosnian conflict, after Bosnian Serb forces over-ran the enclave. He was there to negotiate the evacuation of remaining residents. Bosnian Serb forces took him away, never to be seen again. Palic's remains were exhumed from a mass grave near the eastern Bosnian town of Rogatica in 2001 along with eight other victims. Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian says the OHR will insist on finding those responsible for the murder. (RTRS, BHRT, Oslobodjenje, Novosti, Dnevni Avaz, Pincom, OHR - 05/08/09)

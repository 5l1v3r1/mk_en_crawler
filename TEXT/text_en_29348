PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Bishop Amfilohije, performed a holiday liturgy on Monday (August 2nd) in Vushtrri/Vucitrn. For the first time in 11 years, around 200 Serbs gathered at the Saint Ilija church to mark its namesake's holy day.
The co-ordinator for implementing Pristina's strategy for the north of Kosovo, Ylber Hysa, said Kosovo and its government should be the host of all those ceremonies, because it is the one that guarantees those rights. "You are welcome in your houses, Kosovo institutions guarantee your rights to freedom of movement and to performing your religious rituals," Hysa said. Serbian State Secretary for Kosovo Oliver Ivanovic also attended the liturgy. (Koha Ditore, Lajm - 03/08/10; RTK, KLAN Kosova - 02/08/10)

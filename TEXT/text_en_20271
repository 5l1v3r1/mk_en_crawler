ZAGREB, Croatia -- The editor of one of Croatia's most influential newspapers has resigned following a scandal over a fake interview with Prime Minister Ivo Sanader. Davor Butkovic, editor of the Zagreb-based Jutarnji List, says he talked by phone with a man he thought was Sanader, arranging to send interview questions by e-mail. In reality, he had accidentally dialled a 23-year-old journalism student, Victor Zahtila, who gave the editor his own e-mail address. The resulting interview was printed in Jutarnji List, provoking a complaint from Sanader's government. 
Zahtila says that he received a text message asking him for the interview and that he sent back his e-mail address, thinking it was some kind of joke. Jutarni List, however, claims the fake "interview" was a deliberate provocation by one of its competitors, Nacional, where Zahtila worked for a short period.

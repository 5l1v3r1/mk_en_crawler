TIRANA, Albania -- The European Commission has determined conditions Albania must meet for an agreement on visa liberalisation with the EU. Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha will receive the document guiding the process on Tuesday (June 3rd) in Brussels. Albania must work on biometric passports for all citizens, legislation regulating the movements of citizens outside the country, and the equipping and training of border police and all other border officials. Albania must also establish mechanisms to control and analyse legal and illegal migration as well as organised trafficking. Other standards the government must meet involve the fight against organised crime, corruption and money laundering. Furthermore, Albania must co-operate fully with international organisations and respect international conventions, which would determine the speed of the visa liberalisation process.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Lawyers representing General Ante Gotovina will appeal a decision by the UN war crimes tribunal to merge his case with those of two other Croatian generals -- Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac. Gotovina's lawyer Luka Misetic said on Thursday (24 August) that the joint indictment and joint trial would be detrimental to Gotovina's rights. All three generals are charged with crimes again humanity, allegedly committed in the Serb region of Krajina in the summer and fall of 1995. (HINA, Index, Vecernji List - 24/08/06)

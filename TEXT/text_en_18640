ZAGREB, Croatia -- After a several-hour hearing on Friday (February 9th), the UN war crimes tribunal (ICTY) failed to decide whether three attorneys in the case of three Croatian generals -- Ante Gotovina, Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac -- have a conflict of interest. The issue was raised last autumn. One of the attorneys was justice minister at the time when the indictment was brought against Gotovina, a fact which prompted objections from the latter's defense team. The trial against the three generals is scheduled to start on May 7th. 
In a related story, Hina reported on Saturday that the government has asked its legal experts to resubmit Croatia's appeal for "friend of court" statute in the case against the generals. ICTY rejected the request last October. (Vecernji List - 11/02/07; Hina - 10/02/07)

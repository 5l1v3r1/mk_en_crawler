TIRANA, Albania -- The NATO mission in Albania will continue to perform ongoing duties, says NATO General Staff Commander in Tirana Brig Gen Franco Giannini. Those activities include securing logistical support for the KFOR troops, guaranteeing communications between Kosovo, Macedonia and Albania and providing humanitarian support, as during severe flooding that struck several weeks ago.

ATHENS, Greece -- Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis has sent a letter to the European Commission (EC), asking it to postpone until March a debate on Greece's performance under the stability and growth plan. According to a government statement Wednesday (2 February), the government needs more time to calculate public deficit figures for 2004. The document submitted previously by Greece to the EC envisioned this year's government deficit would be around 5.3 per cent of GDP, above the Eurozone limit of 3 per cent.
Also Wednesday, Greece extradited to Belgrade a suspect in the March 2003 assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. Dejan Milenkovic, 35, is one of 35 people indicted for the murder. Arrested in Thessaloniki in July, his extradition was subject to repeated delays. (ANA - 03/02/05; AFX, ANA, AFP, Beta, Tanjug, B92 - 02/02/05)

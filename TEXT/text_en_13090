PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said Monday (30 January) that the independence referendum would take place even if negotiations under way with the opposition -- aimed at reaching a consensus on the poll's terms -- fail. Djukanovic noted that the ruling coalition is willing to hammer out details through political negotiations, involving EU special envoy to Podgorica Miroslav Lajcak. However, he stressed that regardless of the outcome of the talks, there would be no deviation from plans to hold the referendum by the end of April. (Mina, Tanjug, EU Web site - 30/01/06)

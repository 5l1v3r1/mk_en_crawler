ANKARA, Turkey -- Murat Karayilan, a commander of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), warned in an interview with Reuters on Sunday (March 21st) that his organisation may terminate a peace deal with Turkey and renew its armed fight against Turkish forces because of a court ban on the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP). He criticised the December decision by the Turkish Constitutional Court. The DTP supports government efforts to settle the Kurdish issue and give the minority more rights. Karayilan also predicted that the army will be launching operations against Kurdish rebels based in northern Iraq, insisting "We will not retreat from these attacks, so this spring could be complicated and volatile." 
Meanwhile, thousands of Kurds gathered in cities across Turkey on Sunday to celebrate the traditional spring holiday known as Nowruz -- an ancient Persian celebration known as the Iranian and Zoroastrian new year. There was heavy police presence; as such celebrations have been marred by violence in the past. There were no incidents this year.

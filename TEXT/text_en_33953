BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The justice ministry announced on Wednesday (5 November) that Serbia has opened war crimes investigations against four Kosovo Albanians. Vladimir Vukcevic, Serbia's newly appointed war crimes prosecutor, identified the four as former Kosovo Liberation Army officers Hashim Thaqi and Agim Ceku and the Haradinaj brothers, Ramush and Daut.
In other news, Radio B92 quoted unofficial sources as saying that the UN war crimes tribunal wants to merge the cases of four recently indicted generals and police officials with the trials of four Serbian leaders, including Slobodan Milosevic, since all involve crimes allegedly committed in Kosovo.

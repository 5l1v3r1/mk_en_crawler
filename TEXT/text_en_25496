BELGRADE, Serbia -- A military base named South (Cepotina) near Bujanovac is being inaugurated on Monday (November 23rd). The facility, near Kosovo, is believed to be the largest and the most modern base in the region and will be home to nearly 1,000 personnel. Construction began in 2003 but dragged on for six years due to insufficient funding. (Tanjug, Medjunarodni Radio Srbija, Press - 23/11/09)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Tens of thousands of people lined the streets of Belgrade on Saturday (15 March) to pay their last respects to Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. His counterparts from Albania, Austria, Croatia, Hungary, Macedonia, Romania and Slovakia attended the funeral service, along with dignitaries from the international community. Local media is reporting that Zoran Zivkovic of the Democratic Party would be nominated to succeed Djindjic. He has pledged to continue on the path of reform and bring his country closer to EU membership.
Serbian police, meanwhile, continued to hunt for the assassins. Officials say more than 180 people have been detained since Wednesday's shooting, including one of the leaders of the Zemun mafia clan. A list of more than 20 suspects has been sent to authorities in neighbouring countries. Police in Bosnia and Herzegovina conducted raids Friday and Saturday. Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic told reporters that police searched the international airport in Sarajevo, while Republika Srpska police raided the offices of a private construction firm in Pale and checked vehicles. No arrests were reported. (CNN - 16/03/03; AP, CNN, AFP, Reuters, BBC, B92, FoNet, Tanjug, Blic - 15/03/03)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- US Ambassador to Serbia Cameron Munter warned on Sunday (February 24th) against new attacks on the US Embassy in Belgrade and asked Serbian authorities to ensure there is no re-occurrence. "I'm very angry at what happened," Munter told the Associated Press. "It had better not happen again." 
Hundreds of hooligans, angered by some Western nations' recognition of Kosovo's independence, attacked several diplomatic missions in Belgrade and set them on fire Thursday. Both the US and German Embassies in Belgrade will remain closed until further notice. (Blic, Danas - 25/02/08; AP, Beta, B92, RTS, AFP - 24/02/08)

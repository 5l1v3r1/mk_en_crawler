BELGRADE, Serbia -- Members of parliament elected in the May 11th snap elections gathered for the first time Wednesday (June 11th) in a session that began by verifying the mandates of all 250 members. Acting Parliament Speaker Jovan Krkobabic stopped the session immediately upon completion of the process. Election of a new speaker and of the members of the various parliamentary committees will happen only after conclusion of an agreement on a ruling coalition. The deadline for forming the new government is 90 days after the constituent session, which means coalition talks can continue until mid-September.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) submitted a request Wednesday (May 7th) for a no confidence vote against Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan for allegedly encouraging police to use excessive force against May Day demonstrators in Istanbul last week. According to the CHP, Erdogan, leader of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), inflamed the situation by banning participants in the rally from entering Istanbul's main square, Taksim, to mark the day. More than 500 people were arrested after police intervened. The no-confidence motion has virtually no chance since Erdogan's AKP holds 340 of the 550 seats in parliament. 
In other news, President Abdullah Gul signed into law late Wednesday reforms to a controversial article of the Criminal Code widely criticised for hampering free speech. Under the amended Article 301, insulting the Turkish nation, state, parliament, legislative authorities, government, military or police will be punished by two years in prison, down from three years, and a sentence can be suspended automatically or converted to a fine. Criticism no longer qualifies as a crime. The changes also stipulate that the justice minister must approve the launching of any case brought under the article.

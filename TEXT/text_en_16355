SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov on Wednesday (12 April) appointed Lieutenant General Zlatan Stoykov as the new chief of the Bulgarian Army's general staff. Stoykov, presently commander of Bulgaria's land forces, will succeed General Nikola Kolev, whose mandate expires on 31 May. Kolev has been asked to join the team of presidential advisers upon completion of his term. 
Also Wednesday, parliament adopted a declaration denouncing the "brutal" and "hooligan-like" behaviour of Volen Siderov, leader of the ultranationalist opposition coalition Attack, and fellow Attack member Pavel Chernev. Both were involved in a weekend traffic accident which led to an altercation. (Sega - 13/04/06; Mediapool - 12/04/06)

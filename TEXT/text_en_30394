ZAGREB, Croatia -- Some 1,500 people joined a rally at Zagreb's main square on Saturday (January 15th) protesting legal proceedings against veterans suspected of war crimes committed during the 1991-1995 conflict. The protestors accused authorities of failing to protect the veterans. Their action came after Tihomir Purda, a Croat war veteran who fought in the eastern town of Vukovar, was detained earlier this month at the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, based on a Serbian arrest warrant. Authorities in Belgrade suspect him of involvement in war crimes against Serbs in Vukovar in the beginning of the war. (AFP, Radio Free Europe, RTS, HRT, Index.hr - 15/01/11)

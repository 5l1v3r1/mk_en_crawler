LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Interior Minister Katarina Kresal said on Wednesday (September 9th) that the EU will most likely abolish visas for Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro by the end of this year. She was speaking at a regional ministerial conference on illegal immigration, organised crime, corruption and terrorism in Brdo pri Kranju, near Ljubljana. Austrian Interior Minister Maria Fekter, who was the conference's co-organiser, added that Macedonia has already met all EU criteria, while Serbia and Montenegro are working to meet the benchmarks by the end of the year. In July, the European Commission formally recommended granting visa-free travel to citizens of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro. The proposal, if approved by all 27 EU members and the European Parliament, will take effect in January. Kresal noted that Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina still have work to do.

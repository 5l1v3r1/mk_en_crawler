ANKARA, Turkey -- The government is denying press reports Saturday (22 March) that some 1,000 Turkish troops have been deployed in northern Iraq. According to Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Gul, Parliament has only allowed them to mass in an area 15 kilometres north of the border. The aim, Gul indicated, is to prevent refugee inflows of the kind witnessed in 1991, when some 500,000 Iraqis crossed the border.
Parliament is also concerned about possible attacks by Kurdish rebels. Military officials say they are prepared to intervene in case of such security risks. A team from Bulgaria's bTV, reporting from the Turkish-Iraqi border, says it saw military manoeuvres but no border crossings. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer warned that his country would pull out its crews manning AWACS surveillance aircraft in Turkey if Ankara moves troops into Iraq.

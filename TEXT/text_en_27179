ATHENS, Greece -- EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn on Wednesday (March 3rd) welcomed a third set of measures to deal with Greece's financial crisis. The plan aims to cut spending by an extra 2.4 billion euros while raising the same amount in revenue. "This can be ... a real turning point in the fiscal history and economic development of Greece," Rehn said. The IMF described the new steps as "very stable". 
IMF External Relations Department chief Caroline Atkinson said implementation of the package will be a key stage in Greece's overall recovery, which is expected to take years. At the same time, she added that the IMF is ready to offer technical help in implementing the projects. By the middle of this month, Athens must present an interim progress report to the European Commission. 
While international institutions and markets reacted positively to the new set of measures, labour unions fumed. ADEDY, the civil servants union, plans a demonstration in downtown Athens on Thursday. Another union, PAME, called for mass protests beginning Thursday evening. About 300 PAME members occupied the finance ministry building Wednesday.

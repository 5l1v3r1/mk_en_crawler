PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Dragisa Milovic, mayor of the Zvecan municipality in Mitrovica district, on Wednesday (September 9th) gave permission to Albanians willing to rebuild their houses in the northern part of Mitrovica to continue their work. Milovic's decision is expected to end a lengthy dispute over whether Albanians should be allowed to return to the northern part of Mitrovica, which is dominated by Serbs. Milovic said that four of 16 houses that needed construction permits have met the criteria and that Albanians can continue clearing their war-damaged homes of debris.

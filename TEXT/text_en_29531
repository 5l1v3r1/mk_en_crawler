PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The ruling coalition partners -- the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) and the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) -- have agreed in principle that early elections are the only solution to the situation created after President Fatmir Sejdiu's resignation this week, local newspapers reported on Friday (October 1st). Sejdiu and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci agreed on Thursday to continue the coalition but not elect a new president before general elections. A source close to the meeting told the newspaper Koha Ditore that no date for early elections was set, but both parties agreed that the process must be in accordance with the constitution. The same source indicated that the Central Election Commission cannot organise them any earlier than January. Sejdiu resigned after the Constitutional Court ruled that he should not have been serving as LDK leader and president at the same time.

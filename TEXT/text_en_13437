BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU health commissioner Markos Kyprianou arrived on a three-day visit to Turkey Wednesday (25 January), with the goal of reaffirming the bloc's support for the fight against bird flu. Kyprianou will present a high-level EU expert team that is to assist authorities with activities for control and elimination of the disease. According to the latest government reports, 12 out of the 17 patients treated for the avian influenza have recovered. The disease has claimed four lives in Turkey.
In other news, Turkish media reported on Tuesday that the first suspected case of bird flu has emerged in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Earlier Tuesday, TRNC authorities said samples of dead poultry were sent for laboratory tests to establish whether the virus is the deadly H5N1 strain. Culling of domestic fowl is under way in the area of Incirli, where the dead birds were found. (EU Web site, NTV - 24/01/06)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Croatia's new president, Ivo Josipovic, said in an interview with the Jutarnji List on Friday (February 19th) that any possible referendum on the independence of Bosnian Serbs would not affect the current structure of neighbouring BiH. Republika Srprka (RS) cannot change the current situation unilaterally, Josipovic said, adding that even if Bosnian Serbs hold a referendum, it would have absolutely no legal consequences. Earlier this month, the RS parliament adopted a law that allows citizens to hold referenda on national issues. 
Separately Friday, RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said that a referendum would be held in July at the latest. He has repeatedly threatened to call one on RS's independence. (AFP, Jutarnji List - 20/02/10; Tanjug, B92 - 19/02/10)

TIRANA, Albania -- Albania is to build its first nuclear power plant after the government approved a project of the US company Westinghouse, Albanian media reported on Friday (November 9th). Prime Minister Sali Berisha said a series of laws will be quickly adopted regarding security regulations related to nuclear energy generation. According to The Guardian, the power generated in the nuclear facility will be used mainly for exports and to make the Albanian government a regional energy super-state. Italy, as well as the rest of the countries in the Balkans, has been mentioned as the potential clients of the future station. Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi is expected to visit Tirana on December 3rd to discuss Albania's nuclear power plant plans. (BGNES, The Guardian - 10/11/07; MIA - 09/11/07)

ANKARA, Turkey -- The government last week actively worked to mediate a pair of important meetings in an effort to help boost regional security. Turkey has arranged a meeting Wednesday (April 25th) between Iranian nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani and EU security chief Javier Solana, to discuss Tehran's nuclear programme. 
Separately, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul has convinced Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf to meet in Ankara soon. They will be discussing rival claims that militants frequently cross their common border. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan also plans to attend the talks.
In other news, German Chancellor Angela Merkel described as "savagery" last week's murder of three Christians, including a German, in the Turkish town of Malatya. In a newspaper interview Sunday, she urged Turkey to tackle "unacceptable intolerance" in the country. Germany currently holds the rotating EU presidency.

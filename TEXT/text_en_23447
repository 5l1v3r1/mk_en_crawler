BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said on Tuesday (December 23rd) he expects the mandate of the Office of the High Representative (OHR) in BiH to expire on June 1st. Dodik told representatives of local communities from RS that the entity does not need "an OHR that imposes solutions". He stressed that the country's governance should be a consensual matter among BiH's politicians, adding the international community is increasingly accepting RS "as a factor and partner for talks on all important issues in BiH".

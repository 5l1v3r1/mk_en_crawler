TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha announced on Monday (March 24th) that the government will compensate those whose homes or businesses were damaged by the recent series of explosions at an ammunition depot. The March 15th blasts in the village of Gerdec have killed 22 people so far and injured hundreds. The government will spend over 12m euros to help rebuild 2,615 buildings. Berisha told his cabinet that the area in question has been cleared of more than 5,000 pieces of old ammunition scattered by the blasts, but there is another 1,000 square meters to go.
Opposition leaders continue to call on Berisha to resign, blaming the government for the blasts. They also accuse Berisha of downplaying the number of casualties. "We want the prime minister to resign and to give up his parliamentary immunity, to allow prosecutors to investigate," Socialist Party leader Edi Rama said.

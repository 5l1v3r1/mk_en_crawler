THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal said on Friday (3 December) that retired Republika Srpska Army General Dragomir Milosevic was extradited to The Hague tribunal after surrendering in Belgrade earlier in the day. Milosevic was indicted in 1998 for crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war in relation to the siege of Sarajevo and the sniping and shelling against its civilian population. The OSCE Mission to Serbia-Montenegro welcomed news of the extradition Saturday and urged Serbian authorities to co-operate fully with the UN tribunal. 
In other news, war crimes chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte visited Sarajevo on Friday and said that new five or six indictments would be issued by the end of December. She also confirmed that early next year, her tribunal would transfer eight war crimes cases to domestic courts.

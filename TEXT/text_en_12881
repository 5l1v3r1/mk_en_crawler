ZAGREB, Croatia -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte met with Croatian leaders on Thursday (2 June). She said that in her upcoming report to the UN Security Council, she will say that Croatia is "fully committed" to tracking down fugitive indictee Ante Gotovina, but that does not mean she will confirm full co-operation from Zagreb. That, she said, would be premature. Del Ponte commended the action plan to arrest Gotovina, proposed by Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, and said she is certain it would lead to smashing Gotovina's support network. The lack of full co-operation has delayed the start of Croatia's EU accession talks. 
Also Thursday, the cabinet asked parliament to approve the deployment of 100 additional troops to the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan. Currently Zagreb has a 50-member contingent of military police there. (Vecernji List, Vjesnik - 03/06/05; HINA - 02/06/05)

TIRANA, Albania -- Experts from Bulgaria, Macedonia and Albania met in Tirana on Tuesday (19 April) to discuss the construction of a major pipeline, AMBO, linking the Black Sea and the Adriatic. They presented environmental impact studies and discussed financial aspects of the project. The 913km pipeline would ship 750,000 barrels of oil per day from the Bulgarian port of Burgas to Albania's Vlora. The oil would come from Russia and the Caspian region and would bypass the Bosphorus Straits. Protestors demonstrated outside the meeting site in Tirana, arguing the pipeline would adversely affect Albania's environment and tourism. 
In Bucharest, meanwhile, officials from more than ten countries and international organisations are attending a conference Wednesday. The subject is boosting security in the Black Sea region. (Makfax, Rompres - 20/04/05; AP, Nine o'clock - 19/04/05)

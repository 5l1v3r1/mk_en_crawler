BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) endorsed on Friday (October 27th) the disbursement of 38.1m euros to the northern, Turkish-occupied part of Cyprus, as the first part of a 259m-euro aid package. EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn described it as another step in ending the community's economic isolation and facilitating the reunification of Cyprus. He also suggested that EU member states engage in a process to open international trade with northern Cyprus, a condition set by Turkey before it opens its air and naval space to Greek Cypriot traffic.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte said Monday (11 October) that she hopes Croatian authorities would detain fugitive General Ante Gotovina by 23 November. That is the day she is to present her report on co-operation to the UN Security Council. 
Del Ponte also said Bosnian Serb Colonel Ljubisa Beara, who was extradited from Belgrade to The Hague at the weekend, had not surrendered but had been arrested. She says Serbian police detained Beara on the basis of information she supplied to the government. (Vjesnik, Vecernji List - 12/10/04; HINA, HRT, B92, Tanjug - 11/10/04)

ANKARA, Turkey -- During an official visit Thursday (April 10th), European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said that by July, two more policy chapters will be opened in accession negotiations between the EU and Turkey. At a joint press conference with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Barroso said he came to Ankara to encourage the government to reform. He also criticised a bid by prosecutors to shut down Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), warning that such a move could harm Turkey's EU bid. A new poll conducted for Kanal D TV station and published on Thursday suggests public support for EU membership among AKP supporters has grown since the lawsuit was filed against the party.

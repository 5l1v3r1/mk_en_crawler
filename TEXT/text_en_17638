BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission spokeswoman Krisztina Nagy confirmed Wednesday (March 28th) that the EU will resume accession negotiations with Turkey. The talks on the enterprise and industrial policy chapter will reportedly commence on Thursday (March 29th), and the negotiating teams will be led by German Permanent Representative to the EU Wilhelm Schonfelder and Turkey's chief negotiator, Ali Babacan. The country hopes to soon start talks on three other chapters, including economic and monetary union, statistics and financial control. 
As a result of Ankara's refusal to open its ports and airspace to Greek Cypriot ships and planes, member states in December agreed that the candidate country can open all but eight chapters out of 35 in the package but cannot provisionally close any of them. Talks on the prohibited eight chapters will remain frozen, Nagy confirmed. (Anadolu Agency, Turkish Daily News, Bloomberg, EU Observer - 28/03/07)

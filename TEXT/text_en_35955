PARIS, France -- Defence Minister Michele Alliot-Marie told the National Assembly on Tuesday (13 January) that NATO would cut its military presence in the Balkans by nearly half this year. She said considerable progress in the area would make it possible to reduce the number of soldiers from 30,500 to 17,500 by November. However, the minister also characterised the situation as "delicate and unstable", particularly in Kosovo, and said that reductions should be gradual. Alliot-Marie added that France would be assuming command of KFOR in the second half of the year.

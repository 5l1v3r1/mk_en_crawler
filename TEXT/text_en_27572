PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX police raided offices of the Transport and Telecommunication Ministry on Wednesday (April 28th). Several civilian EULEX officers, supported by armed Italian personnel, spent hours in the offices at "several locations in and around Pristina", as part of an ongoing investigation led by the Special Prosecutor's Office in Kosovo. At a press conference shortly before midnight, Transport Minister Fatmir Limaj did not explain the reasons for the raids, though media reports suggest they may stem from work now underway on a 700m euro highway project and possible corruption in awarding the contracts.

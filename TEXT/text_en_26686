TIRANA, Albania -- The Association of Former Victims of Political Prosecution announced on Tuesday (February 9th) that 4,000 Albanian victims of the communist regime are still missing. The statement came a day after forensic teams started investigating and collecting the remains of 19 people found in a mass grave near the village of Linza, just outside Tirana. The bodies were buried up to 3m deep. Ammunition casings found in the area suggest the dead were executed. Police assisting in the investigation have asked families of the suspected victims to provide DNA in order to confirm their identities. (Lajmifundit, Balkanweb, Top Channel, Ora News - 09/02/10)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev is leaving on Thursday (December 18th) on an official visit to the European Commission (EC) to ask for political concessions over the upcoming decision whether to activate a safeguard clause in the justice sector. The EC's deadline is January 9th for reaching some progress in the fight against corruption and organised crime, particularly on getting convictions in certain high-profile cases. Since some of these trials have not even begun yet, activation of the safeguard clause is likely. Sources say Stanishev will hold a private meeting with EC President Jose Manuel Barroso in an attempt to reach a compromise. (Sega, Darik, BNT, Netinfo, Dnevnik - 18/12/08)

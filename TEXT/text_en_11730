SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament Speaker Ljupco Jordanovski announced on Monday (20 December) that he plans to schedule the next local elections for 6 March or 13 March, adding that a firm date would be selected in January. The elections were originally scheduled for mid-October, but had to be postponed due to prolonged parliamentary debate and subsequent referendum on the country's new decentralisation laws.
In other news, the EU, NATO, OSCE and US ambassadors have issued a joint declaration congratulating the inauguration of the new cabinet led by Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski. They also voiced support for Buckovski's programme, which was endorsed by parliament last week. 
Also Monday, a court in Skopje sentenced an ethnic Albanian to ten years in prison for kidnapping two police officers in 2003. Avdil Jakupi abducted the two men in August 2003 and demanded the release of a fellow Albanian in exchange for their freedom. He later fled to Kosovo, where he surrendered.

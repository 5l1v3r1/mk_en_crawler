SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Noting a "dramatic drop" of 50 per cent compared to the previous year, the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported Wednesday (11 February) that 54,000 people returned to their homes in BiH during 2003. Udo Janz, UNHCR's chief in Sarajevo, attributed the decline to the fact that as many as 80 per cent of Bosnians living abroad have obtained foreign citizenship and are unlikely to return.
In other news, the entire leadership of the nationalist Serb Democratic Party (SDS) resigned Wednesday to protest allegations that its deputy chief, Mirko Sarovic, is a key member of Radovan Karadzic's support network. Sarovic was one of 10 Bosnian Serbs whose bank accounts were frozen last week as part of an international crackdown on those trying to help the Bosnian wartime leader evade justice. Now that international community High Representative Paddy Ashdown has removed Sarovic from his party post, the SDS is threatening to pull out of the Republika Srpska government.

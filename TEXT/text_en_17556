SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- At a meeting last week, the five Croatian parties in BiH reportedly agreed on a common position to take in the new round of talks on constitutional reforms, Vecernji List newspaper reported in its Sunday (June 24th) edition. The paper said the parties agreed on 90% of the issues concerning the Croat community, and will seal a document this week to that effect.
On Saturday, meanwhile, the BiH Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed a sizeable oil spill had occurred in the Sava River. It apparently came from the Bosanski Brod oil refinery. (Vecernji List, RTRS, Fena - 24/06/07)

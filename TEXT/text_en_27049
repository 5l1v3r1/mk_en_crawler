PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) will soon join the Schengen zone, former EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said in an interview with Podgorica-based daily Pobjeda on Sunday (January 3rd). Solana stressed that regional co-operation and peace in the Balkans are critical to the region, and added that its prospects lie not in division but in European integration. He also welcomed the EU's decision to scrap the visa regime for citizens of Montenegro, Serbia and Macedonia last month, adding that Kosovo is on the path to visa liberalisation as well.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The proposed US missile defence system will guarantee the security of all Romanian territory without significant cost to the country, Foreign Minister Teodor Baconschi told parliament on Wednesday (February 10th). Baconschi said negotiations on deploying the system could take 18 months, adding that any agreement first requires ratification by parliament. Defence Minister Gabriel Oprea, who also attended the hearing, along with Intelligence Service Director George Cristian Maior, said the system would strengthen Bucharest's strategic partnership with the United States and would boost its positions within NATO and the EU. Romania's Supreme Defence Council approved deployment of elements of the shield in Romania earlier this month. President Basescu insists the defence system is not directed against Russia.

ATHENS, Greece -- The "principle of mutuality" is the basis for Greece's relations with other countries, Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said on Tuesday (July 31st) at the end of a two-day seminar in Athens, attended by Greece's diplomatic corps. In her speech, Bakoyannis focused mainly on Turkey, particularly on the country's EU prospects. She urged all EU members to stick to the existing policy â namely, that "full adaptation will equal full accession". It is now Turkey's turn to respond to the "olive branch" offered by EU countries, she said.
Regarding the Cyprus issue, Bakoyannis said Greece continues to fight for a "just, viable and functional" solution. She said that her government would encourage and contribute actively to any effort by Nicosia to make headway towards a solution. 
As for the name dispute with Macedonia, Bakoyannis reiterated Greece's desire to find a mutually acceptable solution. She urged Macedonia to demonstrate it is following a "good neighbour policy". (Kathimerini, CNA - 01/08/07; ANA-MPA - 31/07/07)

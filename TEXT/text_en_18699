BELGRADE, Serbia -- Dragan Vukmirovic, head of the country's Statistics Bureau, announced on Thursday (February 8th) that the results of repeat elections at six polling stations did not change the final results. Vukmirovic added that the turnout was 27.51%, meaning that 1,135 people voted, out of more than 4,000 registered voters. Pending any challenges, final results could be announced on Friday evening. That would clear the way for Parliament's constitutive session to be held as early as Sunday. (Blic - 09/02/07; Beta, Tanjug, AFP, Makfax - 08/02/07)

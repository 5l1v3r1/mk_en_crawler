BUCHAREST, Romania -- Members of all parties in the chamber of deputies agreed on a five-year presidential mandate, during discussions Thursday (26 June). The government would have a four-year mandate, in a bid to protect political stability. Still under discussion in parliament are constitutional amendments on power sharing between the presidency and the government; election regulations; and the statutes of the senate, the chamber of deputies and local administrations. The planned constitutional amendments are a part of the administrative reforms under way to bring the country closer to the EU. (Rompres - 26/06/03)

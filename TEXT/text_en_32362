SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament adopted a declaration on Friday (28 March) expressing the country's readiness to undertake reforms required for NATO membership. It also states Bulgaria's readiness to co-operate with the 19 NATO member states in speeding up ratification of the accession protocols, noting the country's active role in the 1990 Gulf crisis in 1990, the 1999 Kosovo crisis and more recently, the war on terror following the 11 September attacks.
In other news Friday, the Supreme Administrative Court ruled that the government did not have the legal authority last year to decommission the third and fourth reactors at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant. Still unclear is how the court's decision would affect Bulgaria's accession talks with the EU, which has made the decommissioning a condition for accession to full membership in 2007.

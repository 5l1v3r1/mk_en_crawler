VIENNA, Austria -- Greek President Karolos Papoulias and his Austrian counterpart Heinz Fischer discussed issues related to the new EU Constitution and the EU enlargement process during a meeting in Vienna on Monday (13 June). The presidents agreed that the process of ratifying the new constitution treaty should not end due to the recent French and Dutch referenda results. Greek media however reports that Papoulias and Fischer suggested that their countries differ on Turkey's EU accession bid. The Greek president firmly backed Ankara's eventual entry in the Union, while his Austrian counterpart reportedly hinted that the issues related to the French and Dutch referenda should be considered more closely.

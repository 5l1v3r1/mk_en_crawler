BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Republika Srpska (RS) parliament approved the appointment Monday (October 1st) of Parliament Speaker Igor Radojcic as interim president following the sudden death of President Milan Jelic. Radojcic is a member of the ruling Party of Independent Social Democrats. The government also decided that new elections for entity president will be organised in three months. 
Jelic died of a heart attack on Sunday at the age of 51. He was elected RS president in October 2006. By law, the presidency is largely ceremonial, with real power in the hands of the government and the prime minister. (Nezavisne Novine, Dnevni Avaz - 02/10/07; RTRS, NTV Hayat, Fena - 01/10/07)

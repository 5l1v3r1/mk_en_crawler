BELGRADE, Serbia -- Deputy Prime Minister Ivana Dulic-Markovic said on Sunday (16 July) that Ratko Mladic must be extradited to the UN war crimes tribunal for the sake of the country, not because of the EU. As for the government's new action plan to locate and arrest Mladic -- due to be presented to EU headquarters in Brussels Monday -- Dulic-Markovic told the state news agency Tanjug that it would be easier to simply arrest Mladic than to write papers on what was being done to apprehend him. 
Meanwhile, in an interview published Monday by the Sarajevo daily Dnevni avaz, UN tribunal spokesman Anton Nikiforov said the EU was firmly adhering to its stance on Stablisation and Association Agreement talks with Serbia. Media reports of other scenarios were only speculation, he said. Brussels called off the talks in May because of Serbia's failure to extradite Mladic, and has made full co-operation with the tribunal a condition for restarting them.

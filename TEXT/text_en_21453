SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev announced on Friday (November 28th) that the first measures he will take in light of the recent EU funding loss would be to extend the authority of Meglena Plugchieva, deputy prime minister for EU funding. She was appointed earlier this year to improve co-ordination among the several state agencies that are involved with absorption of EU funding. Stanishev praised her efforts to improve the management of EU funding, and once again expressed regret and disappointment with the decision by the European Commission (EC) to take away the accreditation of the two agencies that managed PHARE money -- a move that entailed a loss of more than 550m euros in EU funds. Stanishev also insists the EC's decision was unjust, given the ongoing global financial crisis. (Mediapool, BNR, Focus - 28/11/08)

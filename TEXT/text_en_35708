SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The ruling coalition parties, the Social Democratic Alliance for Macedonia, the Liberal Democratic Party and the Democratic Union for Integration, plan to launch consultations soon on the disputed new administrative division bill, A1 TV reported Monday (2 February). The law, which envisions reducing the number of municipalities from 123 to 71, would put some mainly Macedonian-populated municipalities under the control of larger ones governed by ethnic Albanian parties. It has triggered waves of protests.
In other news, new EU Special Representative for Macedonia Soeren Jessen Petersen held separate meetings Monday with President Boris Trajkovski and Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski. They discussed work that remains to be done under the Ohrid Peace Accord. (A1 TV, MIA, Makfax - 02/02/04)

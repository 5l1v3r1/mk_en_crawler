BELGRADE, Serbia -- An IMF mission arrives in Belgrade on Monday (February 8th) ahead of another review of the country's stand-by programme, local media reported on Sunday. The mission will spend a couple weeks meeting with senior government officials as well as officials at the finance ministry and the central bank. So far, Serbia has received 1.12 billion euros out of the 2.9 billion-euro programme. The next tranche should total 350m euros, which the central bank hopes to get in May. Key issues involve fiscal consolidation, particularly freezing wages in the public sector and pensions. (Beta, B92, Tanjug - 07/02/10)

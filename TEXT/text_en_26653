PRISTINA, Kosovo -- KFOR Commander Markus Bentler described the security situation in Kosovo as stable Monday (November 9th), but noted three factors pose potential threats: various groups active in Mitrovica, the pending ruling on independence by the International Court of Justice, and the economic situation in Kosovo. He added that KFOR has no indication that local elections on November 15th will pose any security issues. KFOR will be scaling back its troop presence to 10,000 in coming weeks.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- European defence giants Saab AB and Eurofighter on Wednesday (April 7th) said they are pulling out of a defence exhibition in Romania. The move is in protest of the country's decision, announced last month, to procure second-hand US manufactured F-16 fighter jets. The Black Sea Defence and Aerospace 2010 exhibition is being held in Bucharest from April 13th to 16th. (AP, Gandul, Cotidianul, Hotnews.ro, Adevarul, Ziare - 07/04/10)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Ahmet Turk was re-elected on Sunday (October 4th) as leader of the only legal pro-Kurdish party in the country, the Democratic Society Party (DTP). Turk's nomination was supported overwhelmingly by delegates attending a party congress in Ankara. 
Outside, a group of about 20 masked DTP supporters gathered. Reuters quotes a witness who says they chanted slogans in support of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and carried portraits of imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan. At one point, they reportedly raised a PKK flag until DTP officials asked them to put it away. Authorities accuse the DTP of maintaining ties with the PKK, something the party has denied.

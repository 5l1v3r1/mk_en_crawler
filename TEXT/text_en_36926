TIRANA, Albania -- The elections in 2005 are the most important priority for the country, says European Commission Ambassador in Tirana Lutz Salzmann. Speaking Thursday (1 July) at a two-day conference on regional aspirations to launch Stabilisation and Association Agreements with the EU, he said Albania has made progress in that direction but noted challenges remain in terms of the economy and in "politics and the level of democracy". Albanian Minister of Economy and Integration Ermelinda Meksi vowed that the country would do better. "Albania does not lack political will to be integrated into the EU," she said.
In other news Thursday, the ruling Socialist Party and the opposition Democratic Party showed a rare example of unity by agreeing on changes to the election code. The changes incorporate recommendations made by the OSCE/ODIHR and Venice Commission, a move praised by the OSCE delegation in Tirana. (ATA - 02/07/04)

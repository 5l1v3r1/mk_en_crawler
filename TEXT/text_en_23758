SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana voiced concern Wednesday (May 20th) over the level of nationalist rhetoric in BiH. In a TV interview aired a day after he accompanied US Vice President Joe Biden to BiH, Solana described the message they delivered to the country's leaders as an "electric shock". He confirmed BiH will probably fall outside the Western Balkan group of countries whose citizens will be able to travel without visas to the EU in 2010, adding the lack of consensus to pass the necessary pro-EU bills is among BiH's main obstacles.

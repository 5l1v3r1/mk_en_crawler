BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian President Traian Basescu appointed Lieutenant General Sergiu Tudor Medar, the head of the defence ministry's intelligence department, as a presidential adviser for defence and national security, according to a statement from Basescu's cabinet Friday (25 November). According to the local press, Medar is also the most likely candidate for head of the newly-established National Intelligence Community (CNI). The CNI was launched earlier this month as part of the National Defence Council, and will be in charge of centralising information supplied by the country's secret services.

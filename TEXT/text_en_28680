BELGRADE, Serbia -- Leaders of three opposition parties delivered a petition Monday (April 12th) to Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic, signed by one million citizens in support of early elections. But Cvetkovic told the three -- Serbian Progressive Party's Tomislav Nikolic, New Serbia's Velimir Ilic and Democratic Party of Serbia's Nenad Popovic -- that the country must focus on the difficult economic situation. He also insisted his cabinet is performing its tasks well, and has made significant progress in terms of the EU integration process. After the talks, Nikolic said the opposition will not drop its demand. (RTS, Tanjug, Beta, B92 - 12/04/10)

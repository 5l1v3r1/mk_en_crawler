PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Justice Minister Nekibe Kelmendi on Saturday (January 9th) called on all staff from the court in northern Mitrovica to return to their jobs. Staff positions held by Serbs should be retained even if they refuse to work with Albanians, Kelmendi told a government meeting. She also insisted that all Albanian prosecutors and judges should be provided special bus transportation from the southern to the northern part of the divided city. The court in the Serb-dominated north stopped functioning a month after Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in February 2008. (Express - 11/01/10; Klan Kosova - 09/01/10)

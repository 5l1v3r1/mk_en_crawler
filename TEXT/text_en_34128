BUCHAREST, Romania -- On Wednesday (16 July), the first 77 troops from Dej Infantry Battalion 811 departed for Basra to join the US-led coalition force in Iraq. Five flights will be made every two days so that all 400 troops from Romania are deployed in Iraq by the end of July. At a news conference Wednesday, Romanian Army Chief of General Staff Gen Mihail Popescu said his troops were being deployed at the request of the coalition because they are professionals. Bucharest will also send military police and mine clearing units to Iraq. (Mediafax - 17/07/03; Nine o'Clock, AP - 16/07/03)

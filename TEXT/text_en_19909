ATHENS, Greece -- A new strike against the government's plans for social security reform has brought several Greek sectors to a standstill. As promised, journalists, doctors, veterinarians, pharmacists, lawyers, and other professionals stopped work for 24 hours on Wednesday (December 19th). Hospitals were only admitting emergency patients, courts were closed and there were no newspapers published. Rallies were held in Athens and other major cities. This is the third such strike since November. (AFP - 19/12/07)

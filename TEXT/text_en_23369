BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian President Boris Tadic on Friday (June 26th) demanded an explanation from Bulgaria over the release of former Kosovar Prime Minister Agim Ceku who is wanted for war crimes in Serbia. Tadic said the way Bulgarian authorities handled the case "does not contribute to good relations". Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic described Ceku's release as a "great disappointment" and "a devastating blow" to international law.
In Sofia, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivalio Kalfin defended the authorities' decision, saying the ruling was based on existing judicial arguments. "This is a court matter and I would not like it to be turned into a political one," he told reporters. Ceku was arrested while entering Bulgaria from Macedonia.

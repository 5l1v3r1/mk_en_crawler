ANKARA, Turkey -- The mandate of outgoing Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer -- initially set to expire on Wednesday (May 16th) -- has been extended until his successor is elected. Local media noted that this is the first time that the presidential mandate had to be prolonged, in accordance with Article 102 of the constitution, given that no new president has been elected. During the extension, Sezer is expected to take a decision on the parliamentary package of constitutional amendments, one of which provides for the introduction of a direct popular vote for the president. The next presidential poll is expected to take place after the early parliamentary vote, scheduled for July 22nd.
In other news, Turkish Interior Minister Osman Gunes said on Wednesday that the authorities were investigating allegations that a private plane, which crashed May 13th in Turkey on its way to Iran, was carrying nuclear material. (Sabah, Zaman, Milliyet - 17/05/07; NTV, ANKA - 16/05/07)

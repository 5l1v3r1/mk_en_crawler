SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Mohamed ElBaradei is urging BiH to prevent the illegal transport of radioactive substances and is offering IAEA assistance in this regard. Visiting Sarajevo on Wednesday (April 23rd), ElBaradei said he discussed specific projects with members of the tripartite presidency. Among those projects is one aimed at early detection at BiH's borders. To that end, officials will distribute 12 scanners to checkpoints. BiH Presidency Chairman Haris Silajdzic briefed ElBaradei on the recently adopted law on radioactive safety but conceded that the government has formed no regulatory agency yet.
In other news Wednesday, BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric met with a Canadian parliamentary delegation led by House of Commons Speaker Peter Milliken. They discussed economic co-operation and the need for stepped-up preparation of two agreements: one on bilateral investment protection and the other on avoidance of double taxation.

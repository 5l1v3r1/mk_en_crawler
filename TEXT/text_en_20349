TIRANA, Albania -- Lawmakers discussed a proposal Monday (October 15th) to strip Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha of his immunity. The discussion was initiated by Socialist Party lawmakers, who accuse Basha of corruption in connection with the deal to build the Durres-Kukes highway. Basha, who was transport minister at the time, says he will give up his immunity and let prosecutors investigate him. (Koha Jone, Shekulli - 16/10/07; Top-Channel - 15/10/07)

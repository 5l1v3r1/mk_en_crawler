TIRANA, Albania -- Six members of the National Guard were questioned on Wednesday (February 9th) by the general prosecutor regarding last month's violent opposition rally against the government. A fourth person died last week of wounds and dozens were injured during the January 21st melee. Arrest warrants for the guards were issued shortly after the unrest, but state police did not execute the detentions amid strong government pressure. (Shekulli, Top Channel - 09/02/11)

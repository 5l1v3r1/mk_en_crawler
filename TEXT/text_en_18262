BRCKO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The remains of 277 people were found in a mass grave in the northern district of Brcko, according to an announcement Tuesday (December 12th) by the Federation of BiH Commission for Missing Persons. The victims appear to have been Bosniaks and Croat prisoners of war from Brcko, killed at the very beginning of the BiH conflict. Forensic experts found parts of documents belonging to Bosniaks, who disappeared in the spring of 1992. 
In other news, the Bosnian press reported on Wednesday that authorities arrested 19 Bosnian Serbs in several US towns earlier this week. According to the US magazine Newsday, the detainees allegedly were members of the Republika Srpska Army, and might have been involved in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.

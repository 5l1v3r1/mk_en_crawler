SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The country's National Security Council met again on Thursday (November 1st) and downplayed security concerns expressed on Wednesday, describing the situation in the country as stable and calm, despite some "minor challenges in the context of the latest regional developments". The council stressed that there was no evidence of political motives behind recent attacks by masked gunmen on police in villages near the Kosovo border. Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski stressed that groups active in the region are part of organised crime rings. 
In other news, Macedonian Interior Ministry spokesman Ivo Kotevski confirmed that police are investigating footage aired by Croatian TV. It showed uniformed men patrolling the northern part of the country near the border with Kosovo. They claimed to be members of the National Liberation Army, which was active during the 2001 interethnic conflict in Macedonia. 
Kotevski also confirmed that police have found the body of 44-year-old Xhavid Morina, one of seven inmates who escaped in August from the maximum security Dubrava prison in Kosovo. Morina was found on a road outside Tetovo on Thursday. He reportedly was killed in a shootout between rival crime gangs operating in the area. (Makfax, MIA, A1TV, B92, AFP, AP, B92R - 01/11/07)

WASHINGTON, United States -- Croatia and the United States are still discussing the signing of a bilateral immunity agreement, according to US State Department representative Jonathan Benton. Talking to the press after the annual session of the National Federation of Croat Americans on Sunday (1 June), Benton said negotiations were expected to continue over the next two weeks. Given EU disapproval, Croatia is hesitant to sign the accords, which would exempt citizens of both countries from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in The Hague. (HINA - 01/06/03)

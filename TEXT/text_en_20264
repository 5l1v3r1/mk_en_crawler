BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu met with President Traian Basescu on Sunday (January 13th) to discuss the nomination of Senator Norica Nicolai as justice minister. Sources familiar with the situation said they failed to change their positions much. Tariceanu defends his nominee, Nicolai, while Basescu has questioned her suitability for the post, citing negative public opinion and her previous conduct. 
On Saturday, Basescu had told reporters he would never appoint Nicolai as justice minister. The prosecutor general's office then published her file, at Basescu's request. The file cited two instances when Nicolai reportedly broke the law as a prosecutor -- an erroneous arrest caused by name confusion and her involvement in an adoption case in violation of her status. In response, Nicolai insisted she has nothing to feel guilty about. (Romania Libera, Cotidianul, Evenimentul Zilei, Adevarpul, Ziua - 14/01/08; Rompres, Mediafax, Hotnews.ro - 13/01/08)

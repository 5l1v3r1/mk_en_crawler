WASHINGTON, United States -- Finnish Foreign Minister Ilkka Kanerva said on Monday (February 11th) that if Kosovo declares independence, the OSCE mission should remain in place. Speaking to reporters before meeting with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Kanerva added that the OSCE could stay in Kosovo under a narrower mandate and focus on human rights and the development of civil society. If the OSCE tried to terminate its mission and start a new one, Russia and Serbia could realistically use their vetoes in the 56-nation organisation. 
In other news Monday, Croatian President Stipe Mesic said his country will monitor the EU's reactions to a declaration of independence and act accordingly. But Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik took a harder line, reiterating that Bosnia and Herzegovina would never recognise unilaterally-declared independence.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen on Friday (10 September) urged all Kosovo Serbs to take part in the 23 October parliamentary elections. He said that boycotting the vote would undermine their chance to have a say in status talks, as the Serbs' interests might not be taken into consideration when deciding Kosovo's future unless they participate in the political process. He added that he is ready to discuss Belgrade's concept for Kosovo. (FENA, HINA - 10/09/04)

TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha described the Holocaust as a "moment of reflection for all" during a conference Tuesday (May 20th) in Tirana organised by Yad Vashem, the International Institute for Holocaust studies. "This human sacrifice is an appeal against all forms of xenophobia and intolerance," Berisha said in his speech. Albania is one of the few countries in Europe where Jews found a safe haven from Nazi persecution during WWII. After the war, 3,000 Jews remained in Albania for years. Attending the conference were historians and scholars who praised the role of Albanians in this "black period of human history". (News24, Telegrafi, BalkanInsight - 20/05/08)

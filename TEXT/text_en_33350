BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU ministers of culture decided Tuesday (6 May) to proclaim the Greek town of Patras the European Capital of Culture in 2006. One or two cities have been selected for this honour every year since 1985. The EU provides funding for the staging of various events to highlight Europe's cultural diversity. These include live performances, architectural shows and street arts. Graz, Austria will host the events this year. Lille, France and Genoa, Italy will take the honour in 2004, and the Irish city of Cork will serve as culture capital in 2005. (AFP - 07/05/03)

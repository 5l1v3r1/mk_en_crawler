ZAGREB, Croatia -- The investigative judge of the Zagreb County Court, Zdenko Posavec, has again suspended the probe against parliament member Branimir Glavas, who is suspected of committing war crimes against ethnic Serb civilians in Osijek in 1991. According to a court statement, Posavec decided on Monday (January 1st) that, based on medical exams, Glavas is physically and psychologically unfit to follow proceedings against him. He was released from custody last month after staging a debilitating 37-day hunger strike. (Vjesnik, Vecernji list, Poslovni dnevnik - 03/01/07; HRT - 02/01/07)

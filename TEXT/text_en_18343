SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj said on Tuesday (June 12th) that technical negotiations on police reform are complete and the process is 95% done. Wrapping up a trip to Lisbon, Alkalaj reportedly told his Portuguese counterpart, Luis Amado, that the remaining obstacles would be overcome during Portugal's term as EU president, which begins in July. The deadlock over police reforms has stalled the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. 
High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling, US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney and German Ambassador to BiH Michael Schmunk met again on Tuesday with Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik in an attempt to find a compromise on police and constitutional reforms. Separately, the main Croat parties will meet on Thursday to discuss a united Croat position on constitutional reform. (Nezavisne Novine - 13/06/07; Fena, RTRS, Forbes - 12/06/07)

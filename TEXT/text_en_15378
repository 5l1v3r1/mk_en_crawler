SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Defence Minister Vesselin Bliznakov warned on Friday (October 27th) that a 50m-euro shortfall in the army's draft budget for 2007 might hamper the implementation of planned projects. The draft calls for 2.28% of GDP to be allocated for defence next year. But according to Bulgaria's obligations as a NATO member state, the percentage must be 2.6% of GDP. Bliznakov added that he would lobby for more money during upcoming budget talks. (Mediapool, Darik - 27/10/06)

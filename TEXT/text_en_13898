TIRANA, Albania -- The country's main opposition Socialist Party (SP) asked Prime Minister Sali Berisha Friday (17 March) to sack Foreign Minister Besnik Mustafaj because of controversial comments he made regarding borders in the Western Balkans. Last week, Mustafaj said in an interview that dividing Kosovo -- as Serbia has proposed -- could affect Albania's and Macedonia's borders with the province. The remark drew a strong reaction from Skopje and Belgrade. Berisha says Mustafaj's statement was taken out of context.

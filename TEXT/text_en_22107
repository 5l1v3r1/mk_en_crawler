TIRANA, Albania -- Small right-wing parties in parliament denied Wednesday (August 13th) that they will cease independent operations and join the biggest right-wing party, the ruling Democratic Party (DP), for next year's elections. Arben Demeti of the Democratic Alliance Party said his party will continue to exist despite negotiations or coalitions it may join in the future. The National Development Movement also said it has no intention of disbanding. Earlier this week, the DP said it is negotiating to merge with smaller parties before the adoption of the election code in September.
In other news Wednesday, the government decided to end compulsory military service. Prime Minister Sali Berisha described the move as part of the ongoing reform process to make the army fully professional by 2010. (Shqip, Panorama - 14/08/08; Top Channel, Klan, BalkanWeb, Alsat - 13/08/08)

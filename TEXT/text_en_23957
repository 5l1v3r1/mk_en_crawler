BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Turkey is expected to open two new chapters Friday (December 19th) in its EU membership talks, the EU's 27 members decided on Thursday. Foreign Minister Ali Babacan is representing Turkey at the ministerial-level meeting in Brussels. The two chapters bring to ten the number of the 35 required chapters Turkey has opened since it began its accession talks in October 2005. Its pace has suffered from long-standing disputes with EU member Cyprus. (AFP, CNN Turk - 18/12/08)

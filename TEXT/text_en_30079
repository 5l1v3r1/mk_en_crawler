LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- The situation is back to normal at the Krsko nuclear plant after it automatically switched off Wednesday (March 23rd) due to an unexpected shutdown of a transmission line running to Zagreb. Authorities and the plant's management say it was insignificant, with no risk of radiation at the plant, which is owned jointly by Slovenia and Croatia.
But afterwards, Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the opposition Freedom Party of Austria, called for shutting down the Krsko plant and vetoing Croatia's EU membership bid. (STA, HRT, Hina, tportal.hr - 23/03/11)

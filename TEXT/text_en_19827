BELGRADE, Serbia -- Former Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic tried, years ago, to strike a deal that would guarantee his safety, a senior Serbian official told AFP on Wednesday (September 19th). Rasim Ljajic, who heads Serbia's national council for relations with the UN war crimes tribunal, added that while he was not sure an agreement was actually signed, negotiations were held. Some information suggests that in 1995, after the Srebrenica massacre, Karadzic signed a document guaranteeing his safety in return for leaving Republika Srpska politics.

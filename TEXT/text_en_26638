SOFIA, Bulgaria -- UNESCO Director General Irina Bokova on Friday (January 8th) urged Bulgarian authorities to find the killers of a controversial radio host murdered on Tuesday. Bobi Tsankov, who had recently written books about the mafia and was the subject of several embezzlement lawsuits, was gunned down around noon Tuesday in broad daylight in busy downtown Sofia. "It seems clear that he was targeted because he was revealing information about criminal activities. Such a brazen attack jeopardises freedom of expression and freedom of the press, rights that are basic and essential to ensure a democratic society," Bokova said. (Darik, BNR, UPI - 08/01/10)

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- A summit of Western Balkan leaders near Ljubljana ended on Saturday (March 20th) by adopting a joint statement on their countries' commitment to the European perspective. The forum was marred by the absence of Serbian President Boris Tadic who boycotted because Kosovo was not represented according to the UN Security Council resolution 1244. EU President Herman van Rompuy was also absent. Participants voiced willingness to continue implementing reformed needed for EU integration as well as strengthening regional co-operation. They urged the EU to keep the enlargement process as its top priority and continue supporting mechanisms of regional co-operation. The forum was attended by the prime ministers of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Slovenia, as well as by EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele. 
Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said on the forum's sidelines that Pristina remains committed to good neighbourly relations and is ready to co-operate with Serbia. He stressed that Kosovo intends to continue taking part in all international and regional meetings as an independent state. (Beta, Tanjug, B92, RTS, Blic - 20/03/10)

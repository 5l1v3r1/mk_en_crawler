BUCHAREST, Romania -- Police clashed with protestors Wednesday (September 22nd) during a rally against the government's austerity measures. A group of demonstrators chanting "Thieves, thieves!" started hurling empty bottles and eggs at the police and tried to enter the government building. Police used tear gas to disperse them. About 10,000 people joined the protest, demanding the resignations of both President Traian Basescu and Prime Minister Emil Boc's cabinet. They are also demanding higher salaries in the public sector and an end to job cuts. The government has reduced salaries in the sector by 25% in an effort to slash the budget deficit as part of the effort to get loans from the IMF, the World Bank and the European financial institutions. Labour unions say the protests will continue on Thursday, Friday and Monday.
Basescu said on Wednesday that despite such protests, Romania will continue to implement its austerity plan and could delay entering the eurozone to avoid a crisis similar to that in Greece. "The biggest issue facing Romania is restoring the macroeconomic balance," Basescu told foreign journalists in Bucharest. "Greece was a good lesson," he stressed.

DIYARBAKIR, Turkey -- Two police officers were killed by Kurdish rebels in an ambush on Monday (26 July). Six other paramilitary troops were wounded in the incident in the province of Bingol.
A bomb, meanwhile, exploded at a police station in Hakkari, eastern Turkey, causing considerable damage but no injuries. Police discovered a second explosive device at the site; it was detonated by a bomb disposal unit. The Kurdistan Workers Party, now renamed Kongra-Gel, has been blamed for both attacks. The organisation ended its unilateral truce with Ankara on 1 July. (Reuters, AFP - 26/07/04)

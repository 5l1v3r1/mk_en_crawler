ATHENS, Greece -- Authorities were working to contain forest fires in the Halkidiki peninsula for a third day Wednesday (23 August). Firefighters now are focusing on the southwest part of Cassandra, which is more difficult to access. The government meanwhile explicitly denied on Tuesday that officials reacted too slowly, stressing that everything "humanly possible" has been done to put out the flames. The fires, which erupted on Monday, have claimed two lives, destroyed over 80 houses and thousands of hectares of forest and olive plants, and caused mass evacuations. Experts say it may take 50 years to recover from the ecological disaster. (To Vima, ANA-MPA, Kathimerini - 23/08/06)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Serbian Socialist Party (SPS) marked the anniversary of the death of its former leader, Slobodan Milosevic, at the weekend. He died of a heart attack in the detention centre of the UN tribunal in The Hague on March 11th, 2006, during the course of his trial for war crimes committed in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. None of his family members attended ceremonies, held in his hometown of Pozarevac and in Belgrade. His widow and son who are thought to be hiding in Russia, face criminal charges in Serbia, while his daughter lives in Montenegro. 
On Sunday (March 11th), members of the Resistance movement, which opposed the Milosevic regime in 2000, unveiled a plaque in Pozarevac dedicated to "the victims of Sobodan Milosevic". (Tanjug - 11/03/07; B92, Danas - 10/03/07)

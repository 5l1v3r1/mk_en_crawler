SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney says Washington will not interfere in the process of forming state-level authorities in BiH but would back coalitions seeking consensus and dialogue. In an interview in Monday's (October 30th) edition of Nezavisne novine, he said now is the time to discuss substantial issues, such as constitutional reforms. 
In other news, the US embassy in Sarajevo donated more than $90,000 Friday for the restoration of the Ferhadija mosque in Banja Luka, which was destroyed during the BiH conflict, and the St. Nikola Serb Orthodox church in Trebinje. The money came from the US Ambassador's Fund for Cultural Protection. (Nezavisne novine - 30/10/06; Nezavisne novine, Dnevni avaz - 28/10/06; PBS BiH 27/10/06)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Local media reports Sunday (26 February) suggested the EU is setting a 5 April deadline for Belgrade to resolve the case of fugitive Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic. That is the date when the next, political round of Stabilisation and Association talks with Serbia-Montenegro is scheduled to begin. According to the reports, Monday's meeting of EU foreign ministers will likely result in a demand for action by that time. On Friday, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica again said his government is doing all it can to bring Mladic to justice.
In other news, the International Court of Justice is due to start hearings Monday in a case brought by Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) against Serbia in 1993. BiH is accusing Belgrade of recruiting, equipping and helping Bosnian Serb forces that committed war crimes and genocide during the 1992-1995 conflict.
Meanwhile, the first case to be transferred from the UN war crimes tribunal to a Balkan country is under way in Sarajevo. Radovan Stankovic is standing trial for the detention and repeated rape of a number of Muslim women in Foca in 1992. (Beta, B92, AFP - 26/02/06; Politika - 25/02/06; AP - 24/02/06)

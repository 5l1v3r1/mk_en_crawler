BUCHAREST, Romania -- Hundreds of police officers staged a large-scale operation against corruption at border control points Tuesday (February 8th), less than a week after 59 customs officers were arrested in a similar sweep in the north. A total of 30 customs and border officers were arrested on Tuesday, according to local media. They are suspected of abetting cigarette smuggling from Serbia in exchange for bribes. Authorities reportedly raided dozens of apartments in nine counties and Bucharest. (Evenimentul Zilei, AFP, Mediafax - 08/02/11)

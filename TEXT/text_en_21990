SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A court on Monday (October 20th) convicted nine ethnic Albanians for their role in violent incidents that marred the June parliamentary elections. The defendants received sentences ranging from five to six-and-a-half years. The court convicted them of "illegal possession of arms, criminal association and interruption of the electoral process". Among them is Agim Krasniqi, commander of ethnic Albanian rebels during a brief anti-government insurgency in 2001. He and his group are the first to receive sentences for the June election violence that left one dead and eight wounded. Foreign observers announced that the polls failed to meet international standards due to incidents involving the two main Albanian parties, the Democratic Union for Integration and the Democratic Party of Albanians.

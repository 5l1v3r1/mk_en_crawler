THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The long-delayed trial against two former senior Serb security chiefs resumed at the UN war crimes tribunal Tuesday (June 9th), a year after one defendant's health forced an interruption of the trial. The trial of Jovica Stanisic, former Serb security chief, and his deputy, Franko Simatovic, began in April 2007. They are charged with training, arming and directing paramilitary units that persecuted and killed non-Serbs during the 1992-1995 Balkan conflicts. The legal proceedings were halted in May 2008 due to Stanisic's poor health, including depression and kidney stones. Specialists feared these would prevent him from participating effectively in his defence. On Tuesday, his lawyers asked for two more days to re-evaluate his well-being. Judge Alphonse Orie said there are no medical reasons to prevent Stanisic from observing the trial either in court or on a video monitor. (Dnveni Avaz, Reuters, AP, B92 - 09/06/09)

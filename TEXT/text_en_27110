PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The Appeals Court on Friday (July 31st) sentenced 12 people to a total prison sentence of 49 years for plotting terrorist attacks and attempting to create an Albanian-dominated region in Montenegro. Four of the convicted established the group between mid-2004 and September 2006. Two of them are US citizens belonging to the Albanian community in Detroit and had provided financial assistance to the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). The members of the terror group collected weapons, attracted new supporters and maintained ties with the KLA. They plotted attacks against police stations, bridges and commercial sites.

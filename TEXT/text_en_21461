BELGRADE, Serbia -- An estimated 6,000 Albanians rallied in the streets of Presevo, southern Serbia, on Friday (November 28th). Waving flags, they demanded more rights for Albanians living in Serbia. Albanian flags were also seen at the town's city hall. Protestors said they want Serbian authorities to let them use the Albanian national flag in local government. They also insist that an Albanian-language university should open in Presevo and they called for the demilitarisation of the Presevo valley, which borders Kosovo. The demonstration, organised by NGOs on the occasion of Albanian Flag Day, ended peacefully. (AFP, FoNet, Radio Beograd - 29/11/08)

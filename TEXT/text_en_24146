SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The State Court decided on Thursday (May 14th) that Croatian lawmaker Branimir Glavas should remain in custody pending extradition to Croatia. Local media commented that the decision sets a legal precedent in bilateral relations, because there is no agreement regulating the extradition of those with dual citizenship. Prosecutors now have 40 days to submit all necessary documents for the deportation. Judge Branko Peric attributed his ruling to suspicions that Glavas applied for BiH citizenship only to avoid prosecution in Croatia. He fled to BiH rather than begin serving a ten-year sentence for war crimes committed against Serb civilians during Croatia's war of independence in the early 1990s. Glavas was detained Wednesday based on an international arrest warrant issued by Croatia. (HRT, BTA, Tanjug, B92, BHRT, SRNA, RTCG, Reuters - 14/05/09)

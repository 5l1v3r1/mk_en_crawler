BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian Radical Party (SRS) announced Sunday (11 January) that it has not given up the notion of forming a cabinet with Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS). SRS official Aleksandar Vucic said his party is still awaiting an answer from DSS. SRS won last month's elections, and DSS came in second. SRS insists the people have in fact voted for a coalition of the most popular parties to form a government.
Also Saturday, Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist Party conceded that he would not be taking a seat in the newly elected Serbian Parliament, given his detention at The Hague. The Radical Party reached a similar decision regarding its leader Vojislav Seselj, who is awaiting trial in The Hague. (B92, Beta, BBC, AP, AFP - 11/01/04; AFP - 09/01/04)

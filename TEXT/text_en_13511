BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The prime ministers of Greece and Macedonia, Costas Karamanlis and Vlado Buckovski, met in Brussels on Friday (24 March). They agreed that UN-mediated negotiations on resolving the name dispute between the two countries should intensify after the Macedonian Parliamentary elections later this year. Greece does not recognise its neighbour's constitutional name, "Republic of Macedonia" for historical reasons, and the countries have not yet been able to agree on a mutually acceptable solution. Friday's meeting, described as "friendly", signaled an unfreezing of bilateral ties after a nearly 18-month break caused by disagreements on the name issue.

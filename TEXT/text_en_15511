BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Finnish EU presidency has cancelled a meeting between the EU Troika and Serbia, which had been scheduled for 29 September in Helsinki. Spokesman Marko Ruonala says there are "no conditions for such a meeting". He did not elaborate, but media reports say the cancellation is likely related to lack of concrete action by Serbia towards meeting its obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal. The EU Troika consists of the foreign ministers of the current and future EU presidency holders -- Finland and Germany, respectively -- and Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn.

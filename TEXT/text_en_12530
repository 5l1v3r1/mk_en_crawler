BUCHAREST, Romania -- The US government has offered monetary aid to victims of Romania's devastating floods, the US Embassy in Bucharest announced Friday (6 May). The funds will be used to rebuild damaged homes and help farmers and small businesses in the affected areas. A man was killed in the south of the country at the weekend when raging waters destroyed his home. Authorities say more than 400 homes were destroyed in the last two days.
In other news, following a weekend party congress, the Romanian Humanist Party (PUR), a junior partner in the coalition government, changed its political orientation from social liberalism to conservatism. It also changed its name to the "Romanian Conservative Party", effective immediately. The change is in part attributed to PUR's eagerness to obtain membership in the European People's Party.

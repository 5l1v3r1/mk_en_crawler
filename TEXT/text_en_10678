SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria's right-wing and centrist parties have reached a framework agreement that could pave the way for consolidation of the rightist bloc in the country, according to Nadezhda Mihailova, leader of the main opposition Union of Democratic Forces. The parties held a conference Wednesday (10 November). No coalition talks were held, however, and any specific agreements ahead of the 2005 parliamentary elections would be subject to future consideration, Mihailova said. 
In other news Wednesday, Bulgaria celebrated the 15th anniversary of the fall of communism. However, nearly 20,000 people rallied in Sofia to protest the social situation and the government's labour policy. 
Also Wednesday, the government's Inter-department Council for NATO Integration adopted a draft national security strategy covering the period through 2015. Security over the next ten years will be determined by Bulgaria's membership in NATO and the EU, according to Deputy Prime Minister Plamen Panayotov.

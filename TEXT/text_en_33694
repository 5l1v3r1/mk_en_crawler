BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic told reporters on Saturday (6 September) that direct talks between his government and the leaders of Kosovo may start this fall. He added that Belgrade wants to focus the negotiations on security issues, the return of Serbs, and "everyday problems" such as traffic, car license plates, freedom to travel and power supply.
Meanwhile, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said Saturday that the EU would tackle the "difficult security situation" in Kosovo by the end of the month. The statement followed a meeting of the EU foreign ministers in the Italian town of Riva del Garda.

The fire was caused by rioters who set mattresses ablaze to prevent guards from entering their cellblock. Another 16 inmates and an officer were hospitalised for burns and smoke inhalation.

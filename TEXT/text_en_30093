ANKARA, Turkey -- The main ethnic Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) and civil society organisations called on Wednesday (March 23rd) for Kurds to stage protests and mass disobedience in an effort to secure more rights. In a televised news conference, BDP leader Selahattin Demirtas said people are out of patience over the stalled initiatives for a political solution to the issue, and urged them to follow the Egyptian model, where thousands joined mass protests that eventually led to the resignation of long-time President Hosni Mubarak. 
The protests are set to begin in the southeast province of Batman on Wednesday, where about 20,000 people are expected to stage a sit-in. Demands include Kurdish language education in schools, the release of political prisoners, an end to military operations against Kurds, and elimination of a 10% election threshold for parties to enter parliament.

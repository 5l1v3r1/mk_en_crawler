BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Turkish President Abdullah Gul on Tuesday (March 24th) urged Kurdish regional Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani to take action against the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in northern Iraq. The administration must "take a clear position against" the PKK, Gul told journalists after meeting with Barzani as part of his two-day official visit to Iraq. He added the PKK issue is the only one hampering relations with the northern Iraqi administration. Turkey has repeatedly accused local authorities of failing to take enough measures against PKK rebels who use northern Iraq as a base to launch cross-border attacks on southeastern Turkey. Barzani said "it would be a positive step" if Ankara granted a general amnesty to PKK members.

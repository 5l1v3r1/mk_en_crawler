BUCHAREST, Romania -- The major opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) decided on Monday (December 13th) to suspend the membership of Senate Speaker Mircea Geoana for a period of six months. However, the party will continue to support him as president of the Senate. The decision came after Geoana accused the current president of the PSD, Victor Ponta, of advising him to lie in the final debate of the presidential elections. Geoana, a former leader of the PSD, was a presidential candidate last year and lost a close race to Traian Basescu. Afterwards, he was defeated by Ponta in the race for the PSD leadership.

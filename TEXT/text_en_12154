BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic addressed the nation Sunday (10 July) before leaving for ceremonies marking the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre. Tadic said he has three reasons for the trip. The first is purely humanistic, the second is to show that Serbia's citizens oppose war crimes, and the third is to establish trust and co-operation among countries of the region. In an interview with SkyNews on Sunday, he said he hoped indictee Ratko Mladic would be arrested over the next several days, as it is key to potential EU membership.

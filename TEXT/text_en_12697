BERLIN, Germany -- A spokesman for Germany's opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has said the party will slow the EU enlargement process if it comes to power in the upcoming early election. "It is absolutely necessary that the EU consolidates and defines its identity and borders," Friedbert Pflueger said in an interview published Monday (6 June). He added that a CDU-led government would support the accession of Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia if they meet the relevant requirements, but would work to put further enlargement on hold.

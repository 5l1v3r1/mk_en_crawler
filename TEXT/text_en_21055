LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- President Danilo Turk and his Croatian counterpart Stipe Mesic urged the governments of their two countries to settle all bilateral issues via dialogue and compromise, during a meeting Friday (February 1st). The two presidents met at Otocec Palace, not far from the countries' common border, for an informal meeting to mark the 15th anniversary of the Slovenian-Croatian Friendship Society. They also called on politicians to soften their rhetoric regarding neighbourly relations. Croatia and Slovenia have been at odds in recent weeks over Croatia's decision to introduce a protected fishing and ecological zone in the Adriatic. (HINA, Javno.com, AFP, B92 - 01/02/08)

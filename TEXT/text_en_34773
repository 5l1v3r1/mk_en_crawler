ATHENS, Greece -- Jacques Rogge, the president of the International Olympic Committee, defended the organisers of the 2004 Summer Games on Monday (11 August) expressing confidence in their ability to stage events successfully. He told Reuters that the early delays have been overcome and preparations are back on track. Rogge warned, however, that much work remains and organisers must "not relax for a minute". He downplayed the importance of several mishaps at recently tested sites, saying that the tests had been conducted to identify possible problems. (Reuters - 11/08/03)

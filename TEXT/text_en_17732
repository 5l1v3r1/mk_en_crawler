NICOSIA, Cyprus -- In ceremonies on Friday (July 20th), Turkish Cypriots marked the 33rd anniversary of the military invasion by Turkey that divided the island along ethnic lines. The 1974 move was trigged by a coup sponsored by the then military junta in Athens, aiming to unite Cyprus with Greece. Since then, UN efforts to reunify the island's north and south have foundered. The internationally recognised, Greek-run part of the island joined the EU in May 2004; the Turkish republic in the north is recognized only by Ankara.

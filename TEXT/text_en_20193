BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Republic Election Commission announced late on Wednesday (February 13th) the final results of the presidential run-off held ten days earlier. Incumbent Boris Tadic of the Democratic Party won 50.31% of the vote, compared to 47.97% for Tomislav Nikolic, deputy leader of the Serbian Radical Party. All remaining ballots were declared invalid. The commission was supposed to announce the final elections results a week ago, but that was delayed due to a repeat vote at one polling station. Tadic's inauguration is expected Thursday or Friday.

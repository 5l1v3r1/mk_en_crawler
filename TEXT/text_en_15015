ATHENS, Greece -- Significant staff shuffles reportedly are under way in the management of the Greek Police (ELAS), following the resignation of ELAS chief Lieutenant General George Angelakos last week. On Wednesday (1 March), Public Order Minister Vyron Polydoras named Lieutenant General Anastassis Dimoschakis as Angelakos' successor. Polydoras also announced that 14 out of 21 ELAS generals are being replaced, in a bid to bring new thinking to the upper ranks of the police force. (Kathimerini - 02/03/06)

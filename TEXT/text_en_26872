BUCHAREST, Romania -- Voters went back to the polls on Sunday (December 6th) for the presidential run-off pitting incumbent Traian Basescu of the Liberal Democratic Party against Mircea Geoana of the Social Democratic Party. According to the latest surveys, Geoana is the frontrunner with 54% of support, compared to 46% for Basescu. The first round was far tighter, but involved a third strong candidate. This time around, Geoana and Basescu traded a series of accusations in the days leading up to the run-off. The most serious involved a video that seemed to show Basescu hitting a child during his 2004 campaign. It turned out to be electronically altered footage.

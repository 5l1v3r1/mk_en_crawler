ZAGREB, Croatia -- A Bosnian Croat war crimes indictee has surrendered to international officials, the Croatian government said Wednesday (10 November). Miroslav Bralo, 37, gave himself up to SFOR in Sarajevo. He is indicted on 21 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte criticised Zagreb last week for failing to arrest the fugitive, who reportedly was hiding in the town of Knin. Del Ponte is also demanding the arrest of fugitive Croatian General Ante Gotovina. (Reuters, AFP, HINA, SRNA - 10/11/04)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The National Council for the Securitate Archive Investigation's (CNSAS) board decided on Tuesday (19 September) that former National Liberal Party (PNL) deputy Mona Musca had collaborated with the Communist-era security services, according to a CNSAS member, Mircea Dinescu. He did not elaborate. Later Tuesday, Musca, who was recently expelled from the PNL over the issue, insisted she had never acted as a political police agent for Securitate. CNSAS is examining a total of 29 deputies' files for possible collaboration. (Nine o'clock - 20/09/06; Mediafax, NewsIn - 19/09/06)

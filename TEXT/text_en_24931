ATHENS, Greece -- Assuming the yearlong rotating OSCE presidency on Thursday (January 1st) from Finland, the Greek Foreign Ministry cited "the global financial crisis, recent developments in the Caucasus and the discussion on the new European security structure" as current factors. Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis will officially present the Greek presidency's priorities at OSCE headquarters in Vienna on January 15th. In recent interviews, she said her country's efforts will emphasise the Caucasus region and Central Asia. Greece will also work to strengthen the organisation's peace-building efforts in Afghanistan and to combat human trafficking, Bakoyannis said.
In other news, the Greek government decided to lift labour restrictions for Bulgarian and Romanian workers effective on Thursday, as the two-year transitional period since the two countries' EU accession in 2007 has expired. Thus, Bulgarian and Romanian citizens will be free to hold jobs in Greece without a work permit. The government hopes this will reduce the number of illegal workers.

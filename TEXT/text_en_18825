ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said on Friday (March 2nd) that his government is not negotiating with Serbia about the lawsuit Croatia filed before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). He rejected recent media reports about such talks, following last week's ICJ ruling that cleared Serbia of genocide charges in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Sanader said that Croatian legal experts are studying the ICJ decision and would present their recommendations to the government. Croatia is accusing the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, then Serbia-Montenegro, of genocide, committed on Croatian territory during the 1991 conflict and of the organised killings of 10,000 Croats.

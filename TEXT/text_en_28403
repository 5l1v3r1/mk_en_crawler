BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele acknowledged on Thursday (September 16th) Serbia's progress towards EU integration by stressing the important steps taken, including the adoption of a common resolution on Kosovo. After talks with Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic in Brussels, he added that the Commission is ready to start an assessment of Serbia's application as soon as it receives authorisation from the Council of the EU. Fuele urged the government to boost the pace of judicial reforms and fighting corruption, as well as to continue co-operating with The Hague war crimes tribunal. Serbia's membership application will likely be discussed by the EU foreign ministers at their meeting in October. Djelic briefed Fuele about reforms Serbia is undertaking and said he hopes the EU member states will reach consensus regarding Belgrade's EU bid. Fuele travels to Belgrade on Friday for talks with senior officials. (Beta, Politika, B92, RTS - 16/09/10)

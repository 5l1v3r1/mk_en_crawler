BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Security Chief Javier Solana met with representatives of the BiH Police Restructuring Commission (PRC), led by its chairman, Wilfred Martens, on Thursday (28 October). Solana encouraged police restructuring efforts and stressed that the PRC has an historic opportunity to show the EU that BiH is serious about its European reform agenda, particularly the establishment of an effective police force capable of enforcing laws and tackling crime. The PRC has been asked to design a single state-level structure for BiH's police. (FENA, PBS - 28/10/04)

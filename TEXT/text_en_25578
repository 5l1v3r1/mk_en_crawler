BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU officials on Tuesday (February 23rd) praised Montenegro for progress in EU-related reforms but noted much more must be done for membership. Following a Montenegro-EU political dialogue in Brussels, Spanish Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Angel Lossada said Podgorica has made "significant progress" in adopting the acquis, adding he expects ratification of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement to be completed soon. European Commission Director General for Enlargement, Michael Leigh, said the commission is drafting its opinion of Podgorica's EU membership application. (RTCG, Portalanalitika - 23/02/10)

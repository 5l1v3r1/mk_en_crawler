TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha presented a new draft for the 2008 budget at a plenary session Monday (November 19th), saying it will highlight economic development and macroeconomic stability. Berisha said the budget forecasts a reduction in foreign debt and an increase in total investments. It will also emphasise Albania's bid for integration with NATO structures. Although he urged all lawmakers to support the draft, the opposition said it is too risky for the economy. (Koha Jone, Shekulli - 20/11/07; Balkanweb, Top-Channel, 24-ore - 19/11/07)

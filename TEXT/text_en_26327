ANKARA, Turkey -- The government sent a diplomatic note to Brussels on Thursday (August 13th) following the death of a Turkish citizen in a Belgian prison. Inmate Mikail Tekin, 31, died at the Jamioulx prison near Charleroi in southern Belgium under circumstances suggesting he may have been tortured and beaten by guards. His death spurred a wave of protest among Turkish media. The Anadolu news agency reported on Thursday that Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has phoned his Belgian counterpart Yves Leterme, asking local authorities to investigate Tekin's case.

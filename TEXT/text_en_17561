THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal confirmed its decision to transfer the case against former Yugoslav army commander Vladimir Kovacevic to Serbia, rejecting an appeal Wednesday (March 28th) by Kovacevic to stand trial at The Hague. The defendant, who surrendered to The Hague in 2003, faces six charges, including murder, for his alleged role in the 1991 attacks against the Croatian city of Dubrovnik. He was provisionally released to Serbia in June 2004. 
Last year, the tribunal ruled that given his poor mental health, Kovacevic was unfit to enter a plea or stand trial. The tribunal says Serbia can better monitor his health and resume proceedings against him if warranted. (RTRS, Tanjug, Focus, OHR website - 29/03/07; UN press release - 28/03/07)

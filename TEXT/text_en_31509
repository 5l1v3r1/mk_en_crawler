BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Adrian Nastase announced he would insist on separate elections for president and parliament, to be held at the end of 2004 and in early 2005, respectively. Speaking on Tuesday (21 January), Nastase argued that simultaneous campaigns for the two most important institutions might create undue pressure and block ongoing reforms. Opposition parties have voiced reservations and are holding a series of meetings to discuss a timetable for the elections.
Also Tuesday, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said his country supports Romania's EU aspirations and vowed to try to accelerate accession negotiations. Greece assumed the EU's rotating presidency earlier this month. (Nine o'Clock - 22/01/03; Mediafax, BBC, Athens News Agency, Macedonian Press Agency, Rompres - 21/01/03)

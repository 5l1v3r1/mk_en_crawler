THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Serge Brammertz, the chief prosecutor of The Hague war crimes tribunal, wraps up a two-day visit to Zagreb on Tuesday (November 11th). The visit is part of "traditional" working visits by the prosecutor, who is meeting with local authorities responsible for their countries' co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in preparing his report to the UN Security Council next month. During their meeting Monday, Croatian Deputy Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor and new Justice Minister Ivan Simonovic reiterated their country's commitment to fully co-operate with the tribunal. Brammertz, in turn, noted that the tribunal is still awaiting documents requested in June and related to the trial of three former Croatian generals, namely, Ante Gotovina, Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac. Brammertz travels next to Sarajevo and Belgrade.
In other news, security forces spent five hours Monday searching a plastics plant in western Serbia for fugitive Ratko Mladic and his suspected supporters. The raids near the town of Valjevo, about 70km southwest of Belgrade, yielded no arrests. (Blic, Kurir, Politika, 24 Sata, B92 - 11/11/08; AFP, Javno, Vecernji List, Tanjug - 10/11/08)

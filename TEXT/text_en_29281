WASHINGTON, United States/NICOSIA, Cyprus -- US State Department spokesperson Philip Crowley on Friday (April 2nd) hailed progress made in the Cypriot reunification talks and promised Washington's support for a "just and lasting" settlement. Crowley said the US was "encouraged" by a statement of progress following the latest meeting of Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat. The meeting was the last before a break for the April 18th presidential vote in the northern, Turkish-run part of the island. 
In an interview with the AP on Friday, Talat warned that reunification talks may collapse if he loses the forthcoming vote to hardline rival Dervis Eroglu. According to Talat, who is behind in the polls, such an outcome would also harm Turkey's EU bid and relations between Athens and Ankara, as well as hamper Cyprus's economic growth. Eroglu said on Thursday that if he wins the vote, he will continue reunification talks to achieve an accord that would protect the rights of Turkish Cypriots. (AFP, AP - 02/04/10)

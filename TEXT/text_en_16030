WASHINGTON, United States -- The world has an interest in seeing Croatia join NATO and the EU, US President George Bush said on Tuesday (17 October). Speaking after a meeting with Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, Bush promised to push for Zagreb's accession to NATO at the upcoming summit in Riga. "I will make the case that Croatia should be admitted. It seems like a reasonable date would be 2008," he said. The president also thanked Croatia for its participation in the international force in Afghanistan. 
For his part, Sanader stressed the importance of transatlantic co-operation. In earlier comments, he said he hoped other pressing international issues would not distract the international community from problems in Southeast Europe.

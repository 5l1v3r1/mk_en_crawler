BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro's government has officially called on Serbian authorities to remove all obstacles to full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. A statement issued after the federal cabinet's session on Wednesday (26 January) said the EU has repeatedly cited full and unconditional co-operation as the major prerequisite for a positive Feasibility Study on Serbia-Montenegro's integration. Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus, leader of the junior government partner G17 Plus, says his party will decide within three days whether to remain in the Serbian cabinet. He suggested the decision hinges on whether the government takes concrete steps regarding war crimes co-operation. (Beta, Danas - 26/01/05; B92 - 25/01/05)

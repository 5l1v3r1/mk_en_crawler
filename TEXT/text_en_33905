BUCHAREST, Romania -- One Romanian soldier was killed and another was wounded in Afghanistan on Tuesday (11 November) when their convoy came under small arms fire. The Romanians were travelling in five armoured vehicles when they were stopped at a roadblock near Kandahar. At least one gunman opened fire on the convoy and was killed in the exchange of fire. Romanian Secretary of State for Defence Cristian Maior says this was the country's first casualty in a peacekeeping mission. Bucharest has contributed 430 troops to the US-led operation in Afghanistan. (AFP, BTA - 12/11/03; RFE/RL, AFP, Rompres - 11/11/03)

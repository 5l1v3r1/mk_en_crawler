BUCHAREST, Romania -- The defence ministry said in a statement Wednesday (March 24th) that the armed forces intend to procure 24 used fighter jets in a deal that would cost 974m euros. The plan, approved by the National Defence Council (CSAT), moves next to parliament, whose approval is required for deals of this magnitude. The purchase includes auxiliary services, such as pilot training, flight simulators, logistical support, and related equipment.
The ministry provided no details about the price or supplier. However, a report by the Romanian news agency NewsiIn quoted military officials who said the procurement would take place via an intergovernmental contract with the United States.

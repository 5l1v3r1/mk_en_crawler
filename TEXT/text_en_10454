ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Thursday (18 November) that his country would not recognise the government of Cyprus under President Tassos Papadopoulos. Gul said Turkey had worked courageously for a UN-sponsored plan to reunify the island, which failed when Greek Cypriots voted against it during twin referenda in April. Gul also reiterated an earlier warning that Ankara would not accept any other arrangement short of full membership in the EU. He was referring to suggestions that Turkey could be granted the status of a special partner. (AFP, TurkishPress.com - 18/11/04)

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Former US President Bill Clinton said on Sunday (May 22nd) that Balkan countries should continue efforts to join the EU and NATO. Clinton was speaking at the inaugural conference "Balkan Networking for Social Empowerment of South-Eastern Europe" in Budva. At the same conference, former presidents of Slovenia and Croatia Milan Kucan and Stipe Mesic and former Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic urged the EU to consider the Balkans as an opportunity, not as a problem. They also believe that each country should be assessed based on its own merits during the EU integration process. The leaders agreed that the bloc should demonstrate more commitment to Bosnia and Herzegovina, which they describe as key to regional stabilisation. (RTCG, RTS, Pcnen, Portal Analitika - 22/05/11)

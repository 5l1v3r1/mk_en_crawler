SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown has called on the BiH government to guarantee the successful conduct of the October local elections. Ashdown sent a letter to BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic on Wednesday (11 August), urging authorities to provide the necessary financing for the elections, as most municipalities were unable to ensure their portion of the funds. In all, 73 of the country's 142 municipalities failed to submit the amounts they owe to the BiH Election Commission. (Dnevni avaz - 12/08/04)

ANKARA, Turkey -- The EU told Turkey on Thursday (17 March) that the decision to delay the launch of accession talks with Zagreb would have no implications for Ankara. "The decision on Croatia was taken on merit. There is no connection with the Turkish situation," said Hansjoerg Kretschmer, the European Commission's envoy to Ankara. He added that the negotiations with Turkey are set to start on 3 October as planned. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan also said parallels should not be drawn between the two countries. He emphasised his government's determination to push forward with reforms necessary for EU membership. 
Turkey's bid was also the focus of talks in Brussels between Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis and the prime minister of Luxembourg, Jean-Claude Juncker, whose country currently holds the EU presidency. They agreed that now is the time for Turkey to prove that it intends to fully implement its commitments to the Union. Karamanlis meets with Erdogan on Monday. (Reuters, NTV, ANA, MPA - 17/03/05)

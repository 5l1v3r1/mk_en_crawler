TIRANA, Albania -- Prosecutors in the town of Korca announced on Wednesday (October 15th) they have ended their investigation of the death of Kosta Trebicka, a key witness in a separate investigation of the illegal ammunition trade. Local experts and US investigator Kevin Teter concluded that Trebicka died in a car accident. He was found dead on September 12th on a mountainous road in eastern Albania. Last year, he told Albanian and US investigators that the US company AEY Inc. had bought old Chinese ammunition from Albania for resale to the Afghan army and police. He said the firm was repackaging the ammunition in Albania to hide its origin. 
In other news, police in the town of Kapshtica arrested eight Afghan nationals trying to illegally cross the border from Greece to Albania early Wednesday. The immigrants were hiding in a Turkish truck transporting steel. Police also arrested the driver. (Top Channel, Telegrafi, Vizion +, Alsat, BalkanWeb, Start, News 24 - 15/10/08)

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- As expected, the ruling coalition and three opposition parties -- the Movement for Change (PzP), the Bosniak Party (BP) and the Albanian Alternative (AA) -- formally sealed an agreement Thursday (October 11th) on the country's new constitution. The accord contains 21 proposals for amendments to the draft constitution, covering issues such as the official language, electoral law, and army command. The ruling coalition and the PzP, BP and AA had reached preliminary agreement during talks Tuesday. Support from the three opposition parties guarantees the adoption of the new constitution by a two-thirds majority in parliament. (Vijesti - 12/10/07; Antena M, MINA - 11/10/07)

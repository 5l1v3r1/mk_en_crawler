BUCHAREST, Romania -- Democratic Party leader Traian Basescu says he will seek a second term as mayor of Bucharest, in local elections later this year. His decision followed talks last week with the National Liberal Party, a strategic ally of the Democratic Party. The two parties had considered nominating Basescu for prime minister at one point, but he said he was too young for the post. (Rompres, Nine o'Clock - 26/01/04)

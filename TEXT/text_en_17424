SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling has called a meeting this week of all relevant state-level and entity agencies, aimed at improving the quality of life in Srebrenica and the surrounding area. Speaking on Friday (April 20th), Schwarz-Schilling insisted that his rejection of an initiative by Muslims -- who are demanding special status for Srebrenica, outside of Republika Srpska's jurisdiction -- does not mean he opposes justice. He stressed that those affected by the July 1995 genocide have the right to demand that state and entity authorities meet their obligations. 
In other news Friday, BiH Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj formally opened the reconstructed BiH Cultural Centre in Zagreb. It is aimed at fostering cultural partnership between the two countries. (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine, Fena - 21/04/07; OHR press release - 20/04/07)

ANKARA, Turkey -- In an article published in the International Herald Tribune on Sunday (December 10th), Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul insisted his country is committed to moving towards membership in the EU. He sought to reassure the public in EU member states, saying that Turkey would be a very different country by the time of its accession. "What we expect from the EU is not to discourage Turkey on its path," the minister said. "I cannot help wonder whether Europe is really aware of the consequences of not sustaining the accession process at a time when a modern and prosperous Turkey is becoming increasingly relevant to the well-being of the EU and beyond," he said. 
On Monday, the EU foreign ministers were scheduled to discuss whether to suspend accession talks with Ankara. At issue is Turkey's refusal to open its ports and airfields to traffic from Cyprus. (International Herald Tribune, AFP - 10/12/06)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Michael Steiner said Tuesday (27 May) that dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade could begin during next month's EU summit in Thessaloniki. But he stressed that participants must accept rules governing the talks and should be ready to meet with all representatives. He added that UNMIK's delegation to the summit would include "a well-balanced number of representatives of the interim self-government institutions". (Beta, B92, BBC - 27/05/03)

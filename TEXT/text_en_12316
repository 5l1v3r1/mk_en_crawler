SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A three-day campaign aimed at identifying corrupt traffic police was conducted this week, the interior ministry announced Wednesday (11 May). Undercover officers deliberately violated road regulations and, after being stopped by traffic police, offered to pay bribes. As a result, a total of 14 corrupt teams will face disciplinary and legal measures. The ministry says such efforts would be conducted regularly to root out this common form of bribery.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The European Commission (EC) urged Prime Minister Ivo Sanader on Monday (January 14th) to resolve the dispute over the introduction of a protected environmental fishing zone (ZERP) in the Adriatic. Croatia has long been at odds with Italy, Slovenia and the EU over the introduction of the zone, which was enacted on January 1st. Congratulating Sanader on his re-election, EC President Jose Manuel Barroso reiterated that the ZERP issue is a key precondition to Croatia's EU accession. Sanader said the government couldn't and wouldn't give up the introduction of the ZERP. (Vjesnik - 15/01/08; HRT, Makfax, Index.hr, Javno.com, Reuters - 14/01/08)

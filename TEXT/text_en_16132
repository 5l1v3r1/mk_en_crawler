SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A survey assessing efforts by the Bulgarian prosecutor's office was presented on Wednesday (November 15th) by US Ambassador to Bulgaria John Beyrle and the country's Chief Prosecutor, Boris Velchev. The report found that of a total 28 factors, only two received positive marks -- the immunity of prosecutors and international co-operation. The other assessments in the Index of Reform of Prosecution were either negative or neutral. Beyrle said efforts should be directed at obtaining more verdicts, incarcerating more criminals, and confiscating the assets of those involved in organised crime.

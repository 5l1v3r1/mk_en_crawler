One of the continuing obstacles to Albania's economic growth has been the existence of a large informal economy. According to the IMF, this accounts for as much as 50 per cent of economic activity in the country. Officials at the Bank of Albania (BoA), meanwhile, estimate that up to 26 per cent of money in Albania circulates outside the banking system -- a figure which represents a decrease from past years, but remains high in comparison to international standards. 
"This situation is the result of lack of information among the public regarding the banking system, and is also connected with economic and financial crime," explains BoA First Deputy Governor Fatos Ibrahimi. 
As part of the effort to build a modern financial system, the government is working to curb informal economic activity. One measure is to halt the practice of paying public employees in cash. In June 2004, the BoA conducted a pilot project for distributing wages through bank accounts. Authorities now plan to distribute the salaries of nearly ten thousand officials working in state administration through second-level banks. 
These banks are participating in an intensive marketing process -- which includes opening new branches, lowering commissions, launching ATM machines and other services -- aimed at bringing people into the system. Most of the banks already offer the payment of public services through customer accounts. Under the government's new initiative, customers will soon also be able to pay their telephone, power and water bills this way. 
Paying salaries through the banking system is expected to have a considerable impact. Several studies by the BoA show that the percentage of Albanians who maintain bank accounts and use them for transactions remains modest. That is likely to change, however, since many who were accustomed to receiving their wages in cash will now have to open an account to get paid.

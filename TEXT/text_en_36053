PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Two French KFOR soldiers were injured when a man threw a grenade at them in a Serb-populated area of Kosovo Wednesday (24 March). Local Serbs caught the attacker and handed him over to UN police. The investigation meanwhile continues into Tuesday's killing of two police officers, which UN Secretary General Kofi Annan says left him "shocked and outraged".
EU security chief Javier Solana visited Kosovo on Wednesday. He told Serbs that he was "appalled by the brutality of the actions" against them and vowed the international community would not tolerate it. After meeting with Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi, Solana also warned ethnic Albanians against resorting to violence. He added that western intelligence services had a good idea of who organised the riots and that arrests would follow.
In other news, about 2,000 people gathered in Pristina on Wednesday to mark the fifth anniversary of the NATO campaign to stop Slobodan Milosevic's ethnic cleansing campaign in the province. They called for an end to violence in Kosovo. (BBC, AP, Reuters, AFP, Bloomberg, B92, Tanjug - 24/03/04)

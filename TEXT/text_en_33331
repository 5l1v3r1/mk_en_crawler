BUCHAREST, Romania -- A change in NATO is needed to correspond better to international conditions, said Chris Donnelly, the Alliance's secretary general on Central and East European affairs. Donnelly spoke at a conference on NATO enlargement set up by Bucharest University Thursday (5 June). He said Romania's role would be to participate in international missions as well as to protect its national security. Entry into NATO, he concluded, is just the beginning of the EU-NATO integration process. (Rompres - 05/06/03)

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic did not rule out the possibility of holding early parliamentary elections this spring. "Some developments are signaling that we should perhaps consider early elections," he told IN TV on Saturday (December 27th). This would allow "the government to dedicate itself to its obligations in Montenegro's EU integration process and to overcoming the consequences of the global economic crisis", Djukanovic explained. The current government's mandate expires in 2010, but a 2007 agreement set late 2009 as the date for the next elections. (Beta, B92 - 28/12/08; IN TV, Makfax - 27/12/08)

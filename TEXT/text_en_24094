SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Between 2,000 and 5,000 people gathered in Sofia on Thursday (January 15th) for a second day, calling for the government's resignation. The demonstrators cite corruption and the country's economic problems. Thursday's protests, which several NGOs organised, ended peacefully, without the riots that marked Wednesday's demonstration. About 1,500 riot policemen guarded the area outside the parliament in downtown Sofia. Right-wing members of parliament joined the rally as a sign of solidarity with the demonstrators. Earlier, the leader of the opposition Democrats for Strong Bulgaria, Ivan Kostov, called for Interior Minister Mihail Mikov's resignation, saying he bears full responsibility for Wednesday's alleged police brutality against demonstrators.

BERLIN, Germany -- High Representative and EU Special Representative to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Valentin Inzko said on Friday (December 11th) that the political situation in BiH could aggravate, and asked for support. At a meeting with German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, Inzko warned "the situation will likely get worse during 2010 due to the upcoming general elections. For this reason BiH will remain a demanding challenge. Therefore the EU and the International Community must be equipped to meet the challenges." (OHR, Tanjug, MIA - 12/12/09)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica reiterated on Wednesday (September 26th) that Serbia would not grant independence to Kosovo and would view any unilateral declaration by Kosovo as a "political crime". He commented as he headed to New York, where he and other top Serbian officials are scheduled to hold direct talks with an ethnic Albanian delegation from the province Friday. Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic voiced a similar message Wednesday. "We cannot negotiate away our sovereignty over Kosovo," he said, adding that Belgrade is prepared to offer to Kosovo the option of unimpeded governance of the province. He also hinted that Serbia might be willing for the first time to relinquish control of the province's borders, if it retains sovereignty over it.
Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku told the AP on Wednesday that progress in the talks "depends on Serbia's attitude". Hours before heading to New York, Ceku said the Kosovo Albanians are hoping Serbia "will look into the future and not to the past". The foreign ministers of the Contact Group on Kosovo -- Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States -- will meet on Thursday, ahead of Friday's talks.

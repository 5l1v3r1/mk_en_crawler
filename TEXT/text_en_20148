NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The UN Security Council decided Friday (December 14th) to extend the mission of the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) by another six months, until June 15th 2008. In a unanimously adopted resolution, the Security Council members said the status quo on the divided island is unacceptable. They called for an end to delays in implementing measures to regulate the situation based on a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation and political equality. 
Currently, the UNFICYP has 869 military officers, 92 civil police staff and 39 international civil administrators in Cyprus. They are charged with the maintenance of a buffer zone between the Cypriot national guard and Turkish forces. (RBK, UN Website, AP, Cyprus Mail - 15/12/07; Xinhua, DPA, CNA - 14/12/07)

MADRID, Spain -- The left-wing IU-ICV alliance in Parliament called on Saturday (March 3rd) for the removal of a two-year moratorium on workers from the two newest EU members, Bulgaria and Romania. The alliance says the policy is discriminatory, and is making Bulgarians and Romanians feel "less European".

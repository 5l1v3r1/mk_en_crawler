BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Prosecutors with the UN war crimes tribunal have again criticised Serbia-Montenegro, according to federal Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic, who also is chairman of the national council for war crimes co-operation. Speaking Tuesday (13 December), Ljajic said the prosecutors are frustrated because eight missing pages of fugitive Ratko Mladic's military file recently forwarded from Belgrade to The Hague did not include the requested information. Ljajic reiterated that Serbia-Montenegro is obligated to provide the data from the federal army's archives. Tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte is expected to submit her next report on Belgrade's level of co-operation to the UN Security Council on Thursday. (Beta, RTS - 13/12/05)

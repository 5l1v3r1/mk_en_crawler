TIRANA, Albania -- Voters turned out Sunday (November 15th) in five municipalities to choose new mayors, replacing those who left for higher office following the June parliamentary elections. The Central Election Commission announced on Monday that the ruling Democratic Party swept majorities in all five municipalities. Turnout was around 30%. The opposition Socialist Party boycotted these elections and refuses to participate in politics in general unless the government investigates alleged manipulations in the June elections. Observers say Sunday's vote was peaceful and fair. (Top News, Klan, Ora News, Shekulli, Top Channel - 15/11/09)

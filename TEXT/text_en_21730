THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Kosovo journalist Baton Haxhiu pleaded not guilty on Wednesday (May 21st) to charges of contempt of The Hague war crimes tribunal. He was arrested on Tuesday. The charges stem from an article he wrote in December, in which he identified a protected witness testifying in the trial of former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, who was later acquitted. Charges against Haxhiu, editor of Kosovo daily newspaper Express, were filed in April, but were only made public on Tuesday. He is the third Kosovo citizen charged with contempt of court by The Hague tribunal. Haradinaj was acquitted in April of all charges of torture, rape, murder and persecution of Serbs and suspected ethnic Albanian collaborators during the 1998-99 conflict. Prosecutors have requested a retrial due to "prevailing circumstances of witness intimidation and fear". (Express, Koha Ditore, Zeri - 22/05/08; Telegrafi, Reuters, AFP, AP - 21/05/08)

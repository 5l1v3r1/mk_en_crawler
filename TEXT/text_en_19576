ANKARA, Turkey -- Troops killed 20 Kurdish militants on Sunday (October 28th) in a wide-scale military operation against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in eastern Turkey. An estimated 8,000 troops took part in an operation with air support, in the central-eastern province of Tunceli. One soldier was reported killed in a mine explosion. According to CNN Turk, the army has deployed 150,000 troops on the border with Iraq, in response to cross-border raids by the PKK. 
Meanwhile, the president of the semi-autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan, Massoud Barzani, urged the Turkish government to hold direct negotiations with authorities in the region. "Let us sit on the table and resolve the Kurdish issue together," Barzani told AFP on Sunday. In an interview for Al Jazeera television, however, he denied that the PKK has a headquarters in northern Iraq. He also said his government would not hand over a single Kurd to any neighbouring country and warned Turkey not to turn the PKK problem into a regional crisis.

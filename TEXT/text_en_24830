THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Wednesday (June 3rd) expressed disappointment over the unwillingness of Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt to testify in proceedings against former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. Rather than attending a status conference on Karadzic's case Wednesday, Bildt sent a letter -- via his foreign ministry -- explaining he has no information regarding an immunity deal Karadzic said he struck years ago with former US envoy Richard Holbrooke. Karadzic had asked the tribunal to press both Sweden and the United States for evidence regarding the alleged deal, though Holbrooke denies it ever happened. (Beta, B92, AP, ITAR-TASS - 03/06/09)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU on Friday (17 December) agreed to launch accession talks with Turkey on 3 October 2005, on the condition that Ankara pledges to extend its customs union with the EU to Cyprus and the other new members of the group. Turkey accepted the condition only after the EU said this would not amount to formal recognition of Cyprus. Turkey will also be required to make progress in upholding minority rights, guaranteeing religious freedom, curtailing the military's influence on politics and reforming the economy. 
Also on Friday, the EU decided to sign accession treaties with Bulgaria and Romania in April 2005, clearing the way for the two countries to join the Union in 2007. Brussels could delay their admission by one year, however, if Sofia and Bucharest fail to implement a number of reforms. In addition, the European leaders decided to set 17 March as the starting date for accession negotiations with Croatia, provided Zagreb co-operates fully with the UN war crimes tribunal.

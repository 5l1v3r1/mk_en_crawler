SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Supreme Court upheld a verdict Thursday (March 17th) against controversial former bishop of the Macedonian Orthodox Church Jovan Vraniskovski. The court rejected his appeal as unfounded, thus confirming his prison sentence of two and a half years for misusing donations at the diocese he previously headed. Vranoskovski's lawyer, Vasko Georgiev, says his client would take the issue to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. (MIA, A1 - 17/03/11)

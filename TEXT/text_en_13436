ATHENS, Greece -- The government endorsed a draft law on combating money laundering Monday (24 October). The measure introduces tighter penalties for those involved in money laundering and those who have information about suspicious transactions but fail to report it to authorities. A week ago, the European Commission warned it might bring Greece to court for failing to address the problem. (Kathimerini - 25/10/05; ANA, MPA - 24/10/05)

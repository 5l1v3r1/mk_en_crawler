TIRANA, Albania -- The judiciary came under fire once again Tuesday (October 26th) from President Bamir Topi and General Prosecutor Ina Rama, for failing to adequately investigate allegations made by politicians. Both officials were attending a graduation ceremony for new prosecutors in Tirana. Topi said the current political system is a chaos of mutual accusations, which he says should serve as a starting point for investigations. Rama urged the new prosecutors to be professional and steer clear of corruption. The judiciary has initiated procedures in only a handful of cases brought by politicians, despite ongoing the constant exchange of corruption allegations between the government and the opposition.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prosecutors announced on Monday (October 13th) they have withdrawn murder charges against former President Ion Iliescu related to the 1990 miners' riots. The general prosecutor's office said there was no evidence Iliescu played a role in the killing of four people during the protests. "The activity of the former president does not meet the legal conditions to be deemed a criminal deed," a statement read. Prosecutors said the killings were a "personal initiative" by soldiers brought in by the government to control the street violence. About 20,000 miners had come to Bucharest from Jiu Valley to help contain anti-Iliescu protests. (Evenimentul Zilei, Ziua - 14/10/08; Hotnews, NewsIn, Realitatea TV, Ziare, Reuters - 13/10/08)

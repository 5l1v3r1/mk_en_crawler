ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said on Saturday (July 14th) that US Ambassador Ross Wilson was called to the Foreign Ministry to discuss how US weapons could have ended up in the hands of the terrorist organisation Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in northern Iraq. Reports first surfaced earlier this month, based on testimony by two PKK members who surrendered to Turkish authorities. Gul says the military showed Wilson evidence that supports the claims. 
On Friday, Reuters reported that Turkey has deployed over 200,000 troops and heavy armament in the southeast, mostly in the border region with Iraq. Turkey has been signalling that it might mount a cross-border operation against PKK bases in northern Iraq. (NTV, AFP, Anadolu Agency - 14/07/07)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Britain is not planning to change its visa policy towards Macedonian citizens anytime soon, the country's embassy in Skopje said in a statement Tuesday (August 10th). "The new government of Great Britain continues to develop its policies, including in immigration. Until these issues are closed we cannot, and will not, speculate on any plans to change [the] visa regime with Macedonia," the statement said. It came amid local media reports suggesting that the UK plans to lift visas for Macedonians and that Britain's new ambassador to Skopje, Christopher Yvon, will start talking about it with the Macedonian foreign ministry next year.

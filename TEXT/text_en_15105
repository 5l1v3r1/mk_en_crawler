The IMF has also urged the government to reduce its traditional Christmas bonuses to civil servants and pensioners.
Also Wednesday, the so-called Club 10 faction of the rightist opposition Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) announced that its plans to nominate former President Petar Stoyanov as a UDF leader in October.

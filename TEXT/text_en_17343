BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Council of Europe again urged Serbia on Thursday (May 24th) to arrest several war crimes suspects who remain at large. Rene Van den Linden, the president of the Council's Parliamentary Assembly, said during a trip to Belgrade that extraditing Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic to The Hague is "the best way for Serbia to show its commitment to meeting its international obligations". Serbia's new Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said Belgrade is committed to meeting those obligations. (AP - 24/05/07)

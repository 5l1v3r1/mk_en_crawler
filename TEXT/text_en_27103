BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Former Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen took over the position of NATO secretary general on Saturday (August 1st). Turkey initially vetoed his nomination because of his poor image among Muslims, dating back to worldwide Muslim protests prompted by a 2005 Danish newspaper cartoons of the prophet Muhammad. However, Ankara withdraw its veto as US President Barack Obama addressed the concerns, promising that one of Rasmussen's deputies will be Turkish and that the country's military commanders will be included in the Alliance's command. Rasmussen will hold the post for four years. (DPA, Netpress - 01/08/09)

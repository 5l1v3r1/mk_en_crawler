PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi has joined opposition parties in a demand to draft a resolution regarding upcoming talks with Serbia. Krasniqi said on Monday (February 28th) that parliament should hold a debate and decide on Kosovo's engagement in the dialogue. Opposition representatives want the talks to include political, rather than purely technical issues. The biggest opposition party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, does not view the talks as a priority, while other opposition parties, Vetevendosje and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo, believe they are aimed at making Serbia's integration into the EU easier. 
Separately Monday, the head of the International Civilian Office, Pieter Feith, confirmed that Kosovo's status and northern Mitrovica will not be discussed during the talks. (Koha Ditore, Lajm, Express, Zeri - 01/03/11; Kohavision, RTK - 28/02/11)

ATHENS, Greece â Efforts to restore fuel supplies continued in Greece over the weekend after striking truck drivers failed to reach an agreement with the government Friday (July 30th). The army was called into service to supply hospitals, airports and other critical facilities, while oil companies provided vehicles for delivering fuel to petrol stations. 
The truckers have been on strike for a week, protesting the government's plans to open their sector to competition by issuing new operating licenses. No new licenses have been issued in Greece since 1971, and those holding the existing licenses often profit from selling them at prices amounting to hundreds of euros. The EU and IMF have been demanding a change in the system.
Long lines of cars at petrol stations dispersed by Saturday afternoon, and media reports said the situation was returning to normal in major cities such as Athens and Thessaloniki. But other parts of Greece -- including the islands, where the strike has delivered another blow to an already sagging tourism industry -- remain affected.

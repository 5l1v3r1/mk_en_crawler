SKOPJE, Macedonia -- As of Monday (January 1st), Macedonia introduced a flat tax rate of 12% for both corporate and personal income taxes. The tax reform laws were approved by parliament together with the 2007 budget bill on Friday. Up to now, the profit tax rate stood at 15%, while the personal income tax scale had brackets -- 15%, 18% and 24%. The new 12% rate is the lowest in Europe, and the cabinet says it may even try to reduce it to 10%.
In other news, Deputy Prime Minister Zoran Stavrevski said Friday that the priority in 2007 would be slashing bureaucracy and improving the work of public administration. The centrepiece of the effort is what he called the "Regulatory Guillotine" project, which envisions cutting the number of unnecessary regulations related to state administration and the corporate sector.

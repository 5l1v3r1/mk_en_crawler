TIRANA, Albania -- Monitoring the June 28th parliamentary elections will cost Albania's Central Election Commission (CEC) 1.5m euros, media reported on Tuesday (April 14th). The CEC has selected the company R&T to oversee installation of monitoring cameras in all 385 vote-counting stations across the country. On Tuesday, the CEC demonstrated how to register each ballot in front of the cameras at each centre. The new election code, adopted in December, provides for installing cameras for the first time to guarantee a fair election process.

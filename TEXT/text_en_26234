TIRANA, Albania -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele urged Albanian politicians Wednesday (March 17th) to resolve the ongoing stalemate as soon as possible. The call came in a statement issued by the EU delegation in Tirana, ahead of Fuele's planned visit Friday. "I will call on all political leaders to work together so that Albania can fully embark in the reforms necessary for ... its European aspiration," Fuele said. He was referring to a parliamentary boycott that the opposition Socialist Party (SP) partially ended recently.
European Parliament Raporteur on Visa Liberalisation Tanja Fajon also appealed to the SP on Wednesday to participate fully in parliament. Speaking from Strasbourg, she urged lawmakers to demonstrate political maturity as the country's EU visa liberalisation process enters a crucial phase. Though the SP officially ended its six-month boycott over what it views as manipulated elections in June 2009, members have only attended sessions selectively.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic said on Wednesday (26 March) that authorities have succeeded in disbanding a notorious commando unit, some of whose members were allegedly involved in the assassination of Zoran Djindjic. The officers of the Special Operations Unit were ordered to surrender their weapons, badges, and uniforms and to leave their base in Kula. Regular police then secured the premises.

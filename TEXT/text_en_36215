BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Three members of Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's cabinet have come under fire only days after receiving their portfolios. According to media reports, Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic is a former communist judge who sentenced dissidents on orders of former Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito's regime; while Interior Minister Dragan Jocic was convicted for robbing a tobacco kiosk in 1981. The new secretary of the government's legislative committee, Zoran Balinovac, was among those who drafted former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's 2000 anti-terrorism law, which was directed against the dictator's political opponents. All three men are currently members of Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DPS).
Meanwhile, officials from the Serbian and Montenegrin governments started negotiations on the make-up of a new federal cabinet. "Serbia's getting a new government has created the conditions for starting talks on appointments in the institutions of the union," said senior DPS official Miodrag Vukovic on Saturday.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The institutional crisis Kosovo finds itself in might cause a series of problems, including some related to the 2011 state budget, Deputy Economy and Finance Minister Bedri Hamza warned on Wednesday (October 27th). The departure of members of the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) from the government is generating risks, Hamza said. LDK leader Fatmir Sejdiu indicated that if the budget reaches parliament, party representatives will review it but will not block the adoption process.

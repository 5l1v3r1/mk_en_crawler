SOFIA, Bulgaria -- As promised, opposition parties filed another no-confidence motion Thursday (February 14th) against Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev's cabinet, alleging pervasive corruption at all levels of government. The motion has no chance of passing however, as the ruling coalition controls 151 of the 240 seat in parliaments. The opposition says the point of the motion is to inform the public about government corruption. Parliament has a week to debate the motion before voting on it.
The most popular party in the country, Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), supports the motion, though it has no seats in parliament. GERB plans a big protest in Sofia next week. (24 Chasa, Trud, Sega - 15/02/08; BTA, BTV, BNR, Mediapool - 14/02/08)

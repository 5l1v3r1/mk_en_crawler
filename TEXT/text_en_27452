PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The interior ministry confirmed on Saturday (August 28th) that no investigations are under way regarding the publication of the so-called Statement for Independence of the Association of Municipalities of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo. Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi said that as long as there are no concrete actions, there is no reason to investigate. The author of the document has yet to be identified despite extensive media coverage spanning almost two weeks, and the "alarm" it caused in Pristina, where authorities met with Western representatives to discuss possible responses.

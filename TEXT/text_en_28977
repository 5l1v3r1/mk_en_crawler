ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor announced on Monday(November 8th) that Croatia will not participate in a project to build a second nuclear power plant in Bulgaria. Kosor said Zagreb would instead focus on its own energy projects and that the decision will not affect bilateral relations with Bulgaria. The statement was made on the sidelines of a summit to discuss the EU's Danube Strategy. 
In other news Monday, Belgrade media reported that Serbia will aim to acquire a 5% stake in Belene. The government has already confirmed it is interested in participating in the project, but considers the deadline given by the Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov on Monday as too short to make such a strategic decision. Borisov offered Serbia a stake of between 1% - 2% and requested a reply from the Serbian government before November 13th, when Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin visits Bulgaria.

BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Turkish Energy Minister Taner Yildiz signed an agreement with Iraqi counterpart Husayn al-Shahristani on Sunday (September 19th) to extend operation of the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline by 15 years. It has been in use for 30 years but the agreement on its operation expired six months ago. The pipeline has been carrying 500,000 barrels of oil a day. Shahristani stressed during the meeting in Baghdad that the volume could double in a couple of years, as Iraq plans to improve its oil wells. Transportation fees were also raised from $0.75 cents to $1 per barrel. The extension of the pipeline deal reflects Turkey's efforts to become a regional energy hub, by maintaining current energy sources and seeking new ones.

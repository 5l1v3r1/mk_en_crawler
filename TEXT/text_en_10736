NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Mehmet Ali Talat, prime minister of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, said Monday (8 November) that he has been given a mandate to form a new government by President Rauf Denktash. Talat tendered his resignation in October after a parliamentary crisis. The new mandate follows the failure of main opposition leader Dervis Eroglu to set up a cabinet. Talat seemed pessimistic about prospects for a political consensus. He hinted that the most likely scenario would be early elections. (NTV - 08/11/04)

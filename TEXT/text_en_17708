BRUSSELS, Belgium -- New UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is urging the leaders of the two ethnic communities in Cyprus -- Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat -- to implement the agreement they sealed on July 8th, 2006. Ki-Moon's call came on Wednesday (January 24th), following talks with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso in Brussels. He said he would encourage Papadopoulos and Talat to work to implement the July framework accord, which envisions resolving technical issues affecting basic quality of life, while discussion of more complicated issues would be postponed.
In Brussels, Ki-moon also met with NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, regarding the Kosovo status settlement process. Afterwards, they announced that NATO and the UN would adopt a declaration for co-operation regarding both Kosovo and Afghanistan.

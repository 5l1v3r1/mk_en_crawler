SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Kidnappers released a Bulgarian national Wednesday (August 8th) after holding him for a month. Oil worker Kiril Elevterov was abducted along with a British national near Port Harcourt in the Niger Delta. He appeared tired but otherwise unharmed when journalists caught a glimpse of both hostages as they were being taken to a local government office. It was not immediately clear whether their British company, Exprogroup, had paid any ransom. This was the second incident in which a Bulgarian national was captured by rebels in Nigeria. It also ended with the hostage coming home unharmed. (AP, Reuters, Darik, BNR, Focus - 08/08/07)

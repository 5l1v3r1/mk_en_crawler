SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Supreme Court President Dane Iliev declared Tuesday (28 September) that judicial reform would fail unless political interference ends. During a justice ministry meeting on the new draft strategy for restructuring the sector, Iliev said every political party in government over the past ten years has attempted to influence the judiciary. He added that while the constitution provides for judicial independence, those provisions were not applied. 
In other news, a poll released Tuesday suggests broad public dissatisfaction with Macedonia's government and political parties. The survey by the Institute for Democracy, Solidarity and Civil Society found that 53 per cent of respondents completely disapproved of the government's work, 17.2 per cent were partially satisfied, and only 12.4 per cent voiced approval.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister designate Nikola Gruevski, leader of the VMRO-DPMNE, submitted his proposed cabinet to parliament Tuesday (15 August) after its endorsement by his party's executive committee Monday. VMRO-DPMNE would hold ten seats plus the premiership, the Democratic Party of Albanians would get five, the New Social Democratic Party would hold three, while the Socialist Party and the Liberal Party would get one each. Two foreigners of Macedonian origin, Gligor Taskovic and Vele Samac, were tapped as ministers without portfolio in charge of foreign investments. Parliament has ten days to approve the cabinet choices. 
Meanwhile, the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration, which is not represented in the cabinet, says it will continue staging protests and roadblocks through Wednesday before deciding on its next move. (MIA, Vecer - 15/08/06; Makfax, A1 TV, Telma TV - 14/08/06)

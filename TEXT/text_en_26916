THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic says he was kidnapped by Serb authorities and held without any communication for several days after he was detained in July 2008, according to a document released Wednesday (August 5th) by the UN war crimes tribunal. Karadzic, 64, insists on receiving financial compensation if the tribunal acquits him or a reduced sentence if convicted, given the conditions of his arrest. He goes on trial next month for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity for his actions during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. (Fena, Pincom.info, RTRS, Oslobodjenje, AFP - 05/08/09)

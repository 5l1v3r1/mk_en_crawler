ANKARA, Turkey -- Justice and Development Party (AKP) leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan signalled again on Monday (11 November) that a solution must be found to allow him to serve as prime minister. AKP, which won Turkey's elections, is likely to announce a candidate after parliament meets for the first time Thursday, and would then consider ways to overcome legal obstacles to Erdogan's election as prime minister. He is currently banned from holding public office due to a conviction. To get him elected, the party must amend two articles of the Turkish constitution, a notion opposed by President Ahmet Necdet Sezer.
Erdogan meanwhile will meet Thursday in Ankara with EU security chief Javier Solana. This will be the first in a series of meetings with foreign officials, which Erdogan hopes will boost his party's image within international circles. (AFP, Anadolu Agency - 11/11/02)

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The Hague District Court gave a green light Tuesday (November 27th) to the lawsuit filed by the "Mothers of Srebrenica" group against the UN and the Netherlands for allowing thousands of Bosnian Muslims to be killed by Bosnian Serb forces in 1995. Semir Guzin, a member of the international team of lawyers representing more than 6,000 relatives of Srebrenica victims, said they would aim to prove that the UN and the Netherlands were responsible for the massacre because they failed to meet their commitment to protect the town. About 450 Dutch soldiers, serving under a UN mandate, were instructed to fire only in self-defence. (Nezavisne Novine - 28/11/07; Fena, B92, RTRS - 27/11/07)

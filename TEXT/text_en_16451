MOSCOW, Russia -- President Vladimir Putin has not excluded the possibility of Russia using its right to veto a proposed solution on the Kosovo status problem at the UN Security Council, if the proposal is "unacceptable" to Moscow. Speaking to the Financial Times on Sunday (10 September), Putin said that the solution should be determined by taking into account "all interests" and other situations in other regions. Russia is concerned that Kosovo's potential independence might have consequences for the Abkhazia or the South Ossetia regions, he added.
The Russian leader's comments came as representatives of the six-nation Contact Group for Kosovo and Southeast European governments kicked off a meeting in Sofia on the status issue. (Danas, Blic - 12/09/06; RTS, BNR, BTA - 11/09/06; Financial Times - 10/09/06)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian government partner G17 Plus is launching a campaign to ban the ultranationalist Serb Radical Party (SRS). Speaking on Friday (9 June), G17 Plus leader Mladjan Dinkic announced that collecting signatures in support of the initiative would begin immediately. He said his party decided to launch the campaign after an SRS deputy verbally attacked a senior G17 Plus because of her Croat background. SRS general secretary Aleksandar Vucic criticised the ban attempt, saying it was an attempt to forestall SRS success during the next parliamentary elections. (Blic, B92 - 10/06/06)

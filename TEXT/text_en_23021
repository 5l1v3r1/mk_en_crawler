ZAGREB, Croatia -- Deputy Prime Minister Damir Polancec said on Thursday (July 3rd) that in addition to security benefits, Croatia will enjoy significant economic benefits from next year's NATO membership. Speaking at an international conference on NATO entry in Zagreb, Polancec said he expects membership to boost foreign investment and foster economic growth. "Potential investors will feel more secure now when they decide to invest in Croatia. It is of particular importance, as we want to attract more greenfield investors than was the case in the past, when we had very few," Polancec said.
Also Thursday, Croatian Foreign Minister Goran Jandrokovic met with Czech counterpart Tomas Pojar. They praised the current level of bilateral ties, with Jandrokovic indicating his country's support will come in handy during the Czech presidency of the EU, which begins in January.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliamentary Speaker Zlatko Tomcic said Tuesday (16 September) that the assembly would be dissolved some time in October. Lawmakers will work at least four more weeks before that, including on Saturdays. A total of 86 items remain on the legislative agenda. The next parliamentary elections are expected in late November.
In other news, Tomcic, President Stipe Mesic, and Prime Minister Ivica Racan are to meet Wednesday with Polish Prime Minister Leszek Miller. This marks the first time a Polish premier has paid an official visit since Croatia declared its independence in 1991.
In Vukovar, meanwhile, the trial of 17 men suspected of committing crimes against Croatians during the 1991-1995 war started Tuesday. All the defendants are being tried in absentia. They are accused of launching an attack against the village of Lovac in October 1991, killing 30 people. (HINA, PAP, AFP - 16/09/03)

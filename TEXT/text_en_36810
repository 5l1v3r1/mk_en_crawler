SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The cabinet on Thursday (15 July) approved the bill on the new territorial division of the country. It reduces the number of municipalities from 123 to 80, then to 76 in 2008. Saraj and Kondovo would be folded into the Skopje municipality and Albanian would become the second official language used in the capital. Prime Minister Hari Kostov says the new territorial division would boost economic development, ensure efficient public services and foster citizen participation in the decision-making process. Parliament will debate the decentralisation legislation by the end of July. (MIA, Macedonian Radio - 15/07/04)

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The country should recognise Kosovo's independence in May, the leader of the Democratic Union of Albanians (DUA), Ferhat Dinosha, said on Monday (April 28th). In an interview with the Podgorica-based newspaper Vijesti, Dinosha explained "Montenegro doesn't owe the Albanians in Montenegro anything; rather it owes [recognition] to its own European and Euro-Atlantic integration."

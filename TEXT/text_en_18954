ZAGREB, Croatia -- A joint declaration, adopted at the end of the two-day meeting of Southeast Europe Co-operation Process (SEECP) countries' foreign ministers in Zagreb on Friday (March 2nd), calls for a compromise to the Kosovo status issue and reaffirmed support for UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's work. The document said any solution should be based on Ahtisaari's plan, UN Resolution 1244, the Contact Group's guidelines and the SEECP charter, while ensuring full respect for minorities' rights.
On Saturday, US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Daniel Fried predicted that Kosovo's status would be settled soon and peacefully. He was being interviewed by Serbian state TV RTS, ahead of his trip to Belgrade, Pristina and Skopje this week. (Albanian News, Vijesti, RTS, Tanjug - 03/03/07; HINA, HRT - 02/03/07)

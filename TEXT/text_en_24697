ANKARA, Turkey -- Gunmen killed at least 44 people and injured three others at a wedding in the southeastern province of Mardin late on Monday (May 4th). Six children and 16 women are among the dead, including the bride. The groom was also killed. Witnesses say the masked gunmen, armed with assault rifles and grenades, fired for 15 minutes. Police detained eight suspects overnight, Interior Minister Besir Atalay said. He added the preliminary investigation suggests the attack was not a terrorist act, but rather the result of a blood feud between families.
In other news, one Turkish soldier was killed and another was injured in an armed attack in the southeastern province of Siirt, media reported on Tuesday. The attack came a week after ten Turkish soldiers were killed in clashes with members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in two other southeastern provinces, Diyarbakir and Hakkari.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government has raised the security alert level to "vigilance" in the aftermath of terrorist attacks in Istanbul, Deputy Transport Minister Krasimira Martinova said Monday (24 November). The second level means that there are suspicions of illegal cross-border activities at airports or other sites. The response includes increased patrols in the surveillance areas and detailed checks of passengers, transport crews and hand baggage at border checkpoints. Martinova said the transport ministry has already implemented a plan for ensuring civil aviation safety.

ATHENS, Greece -- Eight houses in a village near Corinth, west of Athens, were destroyed Thursday (July 19th) as fire ravaged a nearby forest. Children in a summer camp were evacuated while firefighters -- backed by aircraft -- battled the blaze. Since early June, a record 2,050 fires have broken out in Greece, double the amount last year, due to extremely hot weather. 
The heat wave across southeast Europe continues, with the Macedonian government declaring a two-week state of emergency due to the record high temperatures. The cabinet reduced the work day from eight to six hours and gave pregnant women paid leave. (Kathimerini - 20/07/07; Reuters, AP - 19//07/07)

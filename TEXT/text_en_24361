NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Parliament adopted on Thursday (July 9th) a new law banning smoking in all closed public places beginning in 2010, local media reported. The bill was prepared and submitted by the main opposition Democratic Rally (DISY) party to comply with EU regulations against second-hand smoke. Under the new provisions, smoking will be prohibited in all restaurants, bars and offices, and in public transport facilities and vehicles. The law also imposes fines of up to 2,000 euros.

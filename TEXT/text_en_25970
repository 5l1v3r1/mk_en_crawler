SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Serbia would oppose any referendum that could lead to the fragmentation of BiH, Serbian President Boris Tadic said in an interview with Bosnian TV OBN on Sunday (January 17th), adding that Belgrade's international credibility was at stake. Prime Minister Milorad Dodik has been threatening to hold just such a referendum for months. But Tadic said his country respects the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement, which states that BiH is composed of two entities, RS and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
He also said that war crimes cannot be forgotten and voiced hope that the Serbian parliament will soon adopt a resolution condemning crimes committed in Srebrenica. (Beta, B92, RTS, Tanjug - 17/01/10)

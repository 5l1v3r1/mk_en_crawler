PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Human rights watchdog Amnesty International (AI) urged Kosovo authorities on Friday (June 18th) to look into claims of "excessive use of force" at the arrest of leader of the Vetevendosje (Self-Determination) movement Albin Kurti. Kurti was detained on June 12th but was released two days later. On Friday, AI said Pristina should "open an investigation into the allegations of excessive use of force and ill-treatment by the Kosovo Special Police Unit" during Kurti's arrest. According to reports, the police used tear gas and force to disperse a group of supporters who had gathered to prevent their leader's detention. (AFP, Amnesty International website - 18/06/10)

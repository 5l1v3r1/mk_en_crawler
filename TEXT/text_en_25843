BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said on Wednesday (February 17th) that Macedonia has a "window of opportunity" to resolve its name dispute with Greece. Talking to journalists in Brussels, Fuele stressed that the two countries should demonstrate the political will needed to overcome the problem. He said that the EU expects the row to be resolved during the ongoing Spanish presidency of the Union, which ends in June. Fuele will visit Skopje on Friday for the first time since assuming his post weeks ago. (MIA, A1, Sitel, EurActiv - 17/02/10)

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Last-minute changes to the controversial new election law are a disappointment, US Ambassador to Bulgaria Nancy McEldowney said on Wednesday (April 29th) during a lecture at Sofia University. The changes introduced the election of 31 majority candidates and doubled the threshold for coalitions to enter parliament from 4% to 8%. McEldowney expressed Washington's disappointment that the legislation did not include measures proposed by NGOs and aimed at boosting transparency. She was referring to an initiative by nine associations to prevent vote buying while introducing regional vote-counting centres and transparent campaign financing. Although all parties in parliament backed the agreement, little of the text made it into the legislation passed recently. (Sega - 30/04/09; Mediapool, BNT - 29/04/09)

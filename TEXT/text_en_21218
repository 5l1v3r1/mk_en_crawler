ZAGREB, Croatia -- The country plans to submit all remaining documents required in the EU accession process by Monday (June 30th), Vladimir Drobnjak, Croatia's chief negotiator with the EU, told the Vjesnik newspaper. The documents represent Croatia's positions on negotiating chapters not yet opened, including sensitive areas such as judicial reforms and the fight against corruption. The European Commission is poised to publish a detailed road map for the final stage of accession talks. Under the most optimistic scenario, Croatia would complete talks next summer, making it an EU member in 2011. (Vjesnik, Vecernji List - 30/06/08)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- In a statement marking the 7th anniversary of the ouster of Slobodan Milosevic's regime, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said Friday (October 5th) that Serbia has gained its freedom and become a democratic, lawful state with steady economic development. However, he added, the country is now "faced with its biggest challenge since October 5th, 2000", in the form of the Kosovo issue. He insisted that Kosovo cannot declare unilateral independence from Serbia, and that every Serb in Kosovo will remain a citizen of Serbia. He also charged that NATO is trying to impose its military interests in the region. 
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer issued a statement of his own Friday, saying the Alliance's actions in Kosovo are in no way linked to a desire to govern the province. NATO is in Kosovo to guarantee stability and security to the entire population and to protect both the majority and the minority, he said. (B92 - 06/10/07; FoNet, AP, BIRN, Tanjug - 05/10/07)

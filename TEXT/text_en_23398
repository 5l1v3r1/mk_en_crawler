LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Slovenian President Danilo Turk and Parliament Speaker Pavel Gantar signed on Friday (March 27th) the protocol for Croatia's NATO accession, thus allowing the country to join the Alliance at its April summit. Slovenia was the last of the 26 NATO members to ratify the protocol. The move became possible as the non-parliamentary Slovenian People's Party (SPS) failed to collect enough signatures needed to call a referendum on Croatia's NATO membership.

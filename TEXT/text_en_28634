SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Several thousand Albanians rallied in downtown Skopje on Monday (May 10th) to protest what they describe as discriminatory policies against them. They called for halting legal proceedings against ethnic Albanians involved in the 2001 conflict and insisted Albanian should be recognised as an official language. The peaceful march ended without incident amid heavy police presence. Government spokesperson Sefik Duraku said the relatively small turnout suggests that Albanians in Macedonia are willing to resolve problems via institutions rather than in the streets.

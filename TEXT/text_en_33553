SREBRENICA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- On Saturday (20 September), former US President Bill Clinton called for ethnic and religious tolerance as he joined survivors of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre in opening a memorial centre for the victims. More than 7,000 Muslim men and boys died in the massacre, Europe's worst since World War II. Victims' relatives invited Clinton to inaugurate the memorial cemetery, citing his efforts to end the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The ceremony attracted a crowd of 20,000 people.

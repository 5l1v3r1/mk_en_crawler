ZAGREB, Croatia -- The latest round of negotiations between the Croatian Doctors' Union and the health ministry failed Sunday (26 January) and a large number of hospitals continued the strike, which began 15 January. Many in Zagreb were treating only emergency cases. Originally the doctors demanded a wage increase of 40 per cent. The union announced last week it might compromise on a smaller adjustment but rejected the government's offer of 10 per cent. Opposition parties in Croatia support the protestors.

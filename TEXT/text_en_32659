SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Regular co-operation with Romanian border police is a major reason for the success of the Ruse Region Border Services (RBS) this year, according to an annual report on the performance of Bulgarian border police presented Sunday (22 December). Officials say cross-border co-operation significantly increases efficiency in protecting the common border and reduces the number of attempted illegal crossings, as well as human trafficking and smuggling. An information exchange and co-ordination bureau was inaugurated on 12 December to facilitate joint efforts. (Dnevnik - 22/12/02)

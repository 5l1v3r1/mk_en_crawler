TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister and Democratic Party (DP) leader Sali Berisha said on Thursday (March 10th) his party's main campaign motto for the May 8th local elections will be "Green Albania". Solving the problem of air pollution in Tirana will be a main objective, Berisha told a meeting with environmentalists, describing the city as "one of the most polluted capitals in Europe".
The main opposition Socialist Party replied by accusing Berisha of making Albania a "trash bin" for Europe's waste, a reference to plans to allow the import of waste from other countries. Critics say that will harm the environment. (Shekulli, NOA, Balkan Web, Klan - 10/03/11)

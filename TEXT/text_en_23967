ATHENS, Greece -- More than 7,000 people protested in Athens on Thursday (December 18th), the 13th day of street riots spurred by the death of a 15-year-old boy shot by a police officer. Demonstrators waving red flags clashed with police who cordoned off the parliament's building. Clashes began after the protesters threw stones and Molotov cocktails at the police, who used tear gas to disperse them. There were also protests in Thessaloniki, Ioannina and on the island of Crete. In the town of Tripoli on the Peloponnese peninsula, a group of young boys occupied a local radio station, monopolising the airwaves for two hours. (Reuters, Sky, City, RIA Novosti - 18/12/08)

LONDON, United Kingdom -- Croatian Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul said Wednesday (11 February) that Britain would ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and Croatia once co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal is proved. Zuzul's comment followed a meeting with UK counterpart Jack Straw in London. British Minister for Europe Dennis MacShane said the Croatian government took a big step forward when it called on war crimes fugitive General Ante Gotovina to surrender to The Hague, a sentiment echoed by chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte.
In other news, the OSCE mission in Croatia is stepping up efforts to introduce the concept of community policing in the country. The aim is to promote increased contacts between police and the public, including parents, teachers, local community groups and churches.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A few hundred disabled war veterans clashed with Banja Luka police on Wednesday (March 26th) in a fresh protest to demand higher pensions and better protection of their rights. The veterans, many in wheelchairs or on crutches, tried to enter Republika Srpska's (RS) government building. When police moved in, one protester was slightly injured. The head of the local association of war veterans, Goran Kostic, says his group is ready to launch a hunger strike unless RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik agrees to meet with them.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government nominated Stefan Konstantinov, deputy chairman of the doctors' union board, as the new health minister on Thursday (September 30th). Predecessor Anna-Maria Borissova resigned on Wednesday amid heavy criticism of planned reforms in the sector. Konstantinov, if approved by parliament, would have to push through reforms amid strong protests from the doctors' union over insufficient funding for the sector, as well as strong public sentiment over the state of health care in Bulgaria.

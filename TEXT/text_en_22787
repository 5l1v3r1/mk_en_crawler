PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Both Montenegro and Macedonia reportedly are poised to recognise Kosovo's independence. The Montenegrin daily Vijesti says the government in Podgorica likely will decide to do so at its Thursday (October 9th) meeting, though for procedural reasons, the announcement may be delayed for a few days. Last week, Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, Foreign Minister Milan Rocen and President Filip Vujanovic said Montenegro's recognition of Kosovo is now all but a formality. However, Montenegro voted Wednesday in favour of Serbia's UN resolution asking the International Court of Justice to determine the legality of Kosovo's declaration of independence.
Meanwhile in Skopje, parliament is scheduled to debate a resolution on recognising Kosovo's independence at its session Thursday. During a meeting late Wednesday, parliamentary parties' representatives and Parliament Speaker Trajko Veljanovski decided to add the Kosovo resolution to the agenda as an urgent matter.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Rival leaders of bitterly-divided Cyprus resumed peace talks Wednesday in a bid to settle the decades-old conflict before the island is admitted to the EU in May 2004. The Union will accept the Greek Cypriot side if the island is not reunited. Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas met in the UN controlled no-man's-land in the divided capital Nicosia, where some 60,000 Turkish Cypriots took to the streets calling for peace Tuesday. It marked the first time the two leaders discussed a reunification blueprint, submitted by the UN in mid-November. The UN wants an agreement by 28 February, a deadline Denktas says is unrealistic.

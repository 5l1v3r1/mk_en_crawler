WASHINGTON, United States -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Kosovo and Serbia remain among the priorities of the 2005 US-European agenda, according to a US State Department statement released Wednesday (1 June). The statement quotes remarks made by Undersecretary for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns at a recent conference in Brussels. Washington, Burns said, will renew its "diplomatic offensive" this year seeking to promote final unity in BiH, enhance the process for determining Kosovo's final status, and push Belgrade to co-operate fully with the UN war crimes tribunal. These three issues are "the heart of completing the democratisation project in Europe", he added. 
In other news, US Ambassador to Serbia-Montenegro Michael Polt has denied that the international community pledged to give Kosovo conditional independence within a year. In an interview with Belgrade's Politika published Wednesday, Polt said no one has made such a promise. (US State Department, Tanjug, Xinhua - 01/06/05)

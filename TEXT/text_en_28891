BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government said on Wednesday (November 10th) that conditions have not been set to call on Kosovo Serbs to take part in the December 12th snap elections organised by Pristina. The cabinet believes that a sustainable and lasting solution to the Kosovo issue could be found through dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina. The solution would need to be acceptable to both sides to lead to a historic reconciliation and secure lasting peace and a European perspective for the entire region, the government said. Commenting on the government's stance, the head of the European Commission delegation to Serbia, Vincent Degert, said that the EU's general position is that people should go to the polls as their democratic right.

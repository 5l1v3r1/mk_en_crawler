SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EU security chief Javier Solana expects that political talks under way on BiH police reform will result in progress towards eventual EU accession, according to a statement Sunday (24 April) by Solana's spokesperson Cristina Gallach. She noted that an agreement on police restructuring is a major condition for opening negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between BiH and the EU. Talks among the 11 leading BiH parties began Sunday in Vlasic.
In other news, the BiH Council of Ministers failed to agree Friday on a nomination for the new head of the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA). The cabinet therefore decided to ask High Representative Paddy Ashdown to extend the mandate of current SIPA Director Sredoje Novic until a successor is appointed.

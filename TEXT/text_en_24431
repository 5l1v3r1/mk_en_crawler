SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Federation of BiH (FBiH) Prime Minister Nedzad Brankovic threatened to resign Sunday (January 11th), a day after a group of unknown men attacked his house. In an open letter to FBiH President Borjana Kristo, Brankovic criticised the slow response by police, adding he now wonders whether he should remain in his post. Given the threat to his family, "I think that any limit of my patience has been crossed regarding the work of the security authorities," Brankovic said in his letter. He added, however, that in light of his responsibility to the public and to the parliamentary majority, he would not act unilaterally. (Nezavisne Novine, Tanjug, RTS, B92 - 11/01/09)

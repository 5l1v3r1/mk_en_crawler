SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The commission investigating the former Communist-era State Security service announced on Wednesday (April 25th) that six of the 218 candidates running for seats in the European Parliament (EP) contributed to the former security services. The commission says two are nominees of the ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party, one is from the junior government partner, the ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms, and three were nominated by small formations that are not represented in parliament. 
None of the parties plans to withdraw their nominees, as there are no restrictions on proven Communist-era collaborators. (Dnevnik, Sega - 26/04/07; bTV, Mediapool - 25/04/07)

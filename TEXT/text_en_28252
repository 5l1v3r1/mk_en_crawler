PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Cabinet members representing the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) resigned from their posts Monday (October 18th) as expected, following a decision by party leaders to leave the ruling coalition. Among those resigning is Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni, who handed the post over to his deputy, Vlora Citaku. The LDK chairmanship decided at the weekend to withdraw from the coalition, which will likely trigger snap elections in December. The move came only a day after Acting President Jakup Krasniqi called for early general elections on February 13th.
In other news Monday, representatives of the so-called Quint states and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci met with an adviser of EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton to discuss the developing political situation. EU envoy Robert Cooper is trying to help find a constitutional solution to hold elections in Kosovo as soon as possible, according to diplomatic sources in Brussels. The Quint states are the US, the UK, Germany, Italy and France. (Epoka e Re, Express, Kosova Sot -19/10/10; RTK, Kohavision, Klan Kosova - 18/10/10)

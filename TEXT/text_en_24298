BUCHAREST, Romania -- Social Democratic Party (PSD) leader Mircea Geoana said on Monday (May 11th) the EU may cut funds for Romania following the European Commission's (EC) report on justice due this summer. Geoana directly blamed President Traian Basescu, saying he appointed corrupt people to key positions in the judicial system. 
Meanwhile, EC spokesman Mark Gray denied reports the EC has already decided to chop Romania's EU funds, saying it is premature to speculate on the decision before the publication of the July report. Last week, the German parliament urged the EU to block funds for Romania because of its poor performance in reforming the judiciary and fighting corruption.

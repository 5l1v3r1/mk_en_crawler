BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic, leader of the Democratic Party, says he is certain that Serbia will enter the EU by the end of the new five-year mandate he is seeking. The presidential election is scheduled for January 20th. "We have to create better living conditions, and that is possible only if Serbia is opening itself and moves towards the EU and not towards isolation," Tadic said during a campaign stop Thursday (January 10th). Tadic also vowed he will never stop defending Serbia's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
In other news, a poll by the MediaAdria agency conducted in December at the request of the Serbian cabinet finds that 60.8% of Kosovo Serbs would not leave the province if Kosovo Albanians declare independence. Another 30.5% of Kosovo Serbs say they plan to move away. (Blic, danas - 11/01/08; Beta, Tanjug, RTS, B92, Focus - 10/01/08)

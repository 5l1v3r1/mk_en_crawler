BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Hearings in the trial for the assassination of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic and the murder attempt on then-opposition leader Vuk Draskovic in 2000 were expected to resume at the Belgrade Regional Court on Monday (25 October). According to a court spokesperson, the first witness subpoenaed for the hearing is Draskovic, who is now Serbia-Montenegro's foreign minister, but it is uncertain whether he will testify. Former special police unit head Milorad "Legija" Ulemek and six former security and military officials were charged in the case. Stambolic's family also accuses former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of being involved in the murder. (B92 - 24/10/04)

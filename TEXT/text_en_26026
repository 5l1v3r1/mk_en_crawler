PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A report published by the Foreign Policy Club on Wednesday (December 16th) concludes that corruption is the main reason for declining foreign investments in Kosovo. Attractiveness has stagnated compared to other countries in the region, according to the report. So far, direct foreign investments have been small, totalling about 750m euros between 2005 and 2007. The level fell in 2008 by 14.6%, a trend that continues this year. World Bank Representative in Kosovo Ranjit Nayak says foreign investors are very sensitive to corruption, especially in public administration. He added that about 80% of investors are not satisfied with the efficiency of public administration in Kosovo. (Koha Ditore, Zeri, Lajm, Express - 17/12/09)

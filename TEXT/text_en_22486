ATHENS, Greece -- A total of 1,500 foreign prisoners will obtain their release following a proposal by the Greek prison administration, media reported on Wednesday (November 12th) in quoting sources from the justice ministry. Of the total, 1,000 are Albanian nationals. Media reports say most of them dealt drugs, but some committed murder or theft. 
Meanwhile, more than 5,300 prisoners in 21 detention facilities throughout Greece have been staging a hunger strike for the past ten days, protesting overcrowding and poor living conditions. The prisoners sent an open letter to the justice minister demanding respect for their rights. (Makfax, MIA, Ta Nea - 12/11/08)

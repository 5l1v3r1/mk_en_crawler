ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Namik Tan announced on Wednesday (14 June) that Ankara might seek compensation from Athens, if an investigation into the 23 May collision between Turkish and Greek jet fighters over the Aegean Sea proves the Greek pilot was responsible. In the collision, the result of a mock dogfight, both aircraft were lost and the Greek pilot was killed; the Turkish pilot was rescued. Both governments have worked to preserve ties in the aftermath of the incident, announcing last week a series of "confidence-building measures" and increased communication between their armed forces.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic insisted Monday (12 May) that Zemun clan leader Milorad "Legija" Lukovic would be arrested before the investigation into Zoran Djindjic's assassination is closed. Legija is the only senior Zemun leader who remains at large; the other two key figures were shot dead while resisting arrest.
Meanwhile, the federal government issued an order for the extradition to The Hague of former Yugoslav Army officer Miroslav Radic. He surrendered 21 April to face charges stemming from war crimes committed in Vukovar in 1991. (B92, Tanjug, BBC, FoNet - 12/05/03)

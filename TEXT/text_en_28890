BELGRADE, Serbia -- Investigators started work Thursday (July 8th) at a possible mass grave in Raska, southern Serbia. An investigative judge and EULEX representatives visited the site and started analysing the ground. Serbia's war crimes prosecution office ordered an investigation into the possible mass grave in mid-May. It is believed to contain the remains of Kosovo Albanians killed during the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict. Authorities believe the bodies were initially buried near Drenica, Kosovo, and moved later to Serbia. (B92, Tanjug, RTS, AP - 08/07/10)

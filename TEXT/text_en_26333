PRISTINA, Kosovo -- One person was arrested in Pristina on Tuesday (January 12th), suspected of participating in two attempted murders in 1999 and 2000, EULEX announced. The man, identified only as Driton H, was detained by EULEX police based on a warrant issued by a prosecutor handling the case. It stems from the arrest last month of a former Kosovo Intelligence Service agent, Nazim Bllaca, who claims he participated in several murders and blackmails against "enemies of the state". Bllaca went public at the end of November with detailed information on events following the 1999 conflict in Kosovo, insisting several senior state, party and police officials are involved.

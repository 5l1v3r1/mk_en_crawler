SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Netherlands will not open its labour market to workers from Bulgaria and Romania after the two countries join the EU on January 1st, according to a statement from the Dutch embassy in Sofia on Friday (November 24th). The Dutch government has decided to introduce a two-year interim period, during which Bulgarians and Romanians would obtain work permits only if the domestic labour market could not meet the demand for qualified personnel. After the first year, however, the government will assess the situation and could expand labour access. The Netherlands has been applying the same approach towards citizens of the ten newest EU member states, which joined in 2004. (Nine o'clock - 27/11/06; BNR, Mediapool, BTA - 24/11/06)

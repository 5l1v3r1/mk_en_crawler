BUCHAREST, Romania -- Cristian Diaconescu, the losing candidate for chairman of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), announced on Wednesday (February 24th) that he is resigning from all positions in the party, as well as from the party's caucus in the Senate. He cited differences with the policies of the new leadership, headed by Victor Ponta. It is rumoured however that it may have more to do with recent revelations that he had been under surveillance by his rivals in the PSD. He plans to remain in parliament as an independent. 
Diaconescu's withdrawal from the PSD has increased speculation that a new left-wing party is going to be established. Reportedly, fellow former PSD official Gabriel Oprea will lead it. He left the PSD last year. (Evenimentul Zilei, Cotidianul, Gandul - 25/02/10; Mediafax, Realitatea - 24/02/10)

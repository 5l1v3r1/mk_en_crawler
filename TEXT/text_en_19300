BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn confirmed that he would be ready to seal a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with BiH in April if the country finalises its police reforms shortly. "It's a great opportunity ... and I trust the leaders will not miss it," Rehn said before a meeting of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) Steering Board that began in Brussels on Tuesday (February 26th). 
Rehn also invited BiH political leaders to meet him Wednesday and Thursday to clear up remaining differences over the police reform package. He also plans to highlight what needs to be done regarding three other requirements for the SAA: full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, reform of the national public broadcaster, and public administration reform.
The future of the Office of the High Representative, whose mandate expires in July, is also a main topic of the PIC meeting. Envoys will also discuss implementation of the Dayton Peace Accords and submit an assessment of the political situation in BiH after talks with members of the tripartite presidency and the ruling coalition.

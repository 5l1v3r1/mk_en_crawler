PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbs in Kosovo plan to form their own parliament after Sunday's (May 11th) elections in Serbia, Marko Jaksic, leader of the Serb National Council of Northern Kosovo, said on Wednesday. Serbs need their own representational authority to protect their legal rights, he added, especially in light of plans by Serbia's Ministry for Kosovo regarding the functional division of Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo. "This is the only way for Serbs to remain in Kosovo," Jaksic added.
Separately Wednesday, Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha told BBC Radio that any division of Kosovo is a dangerous idea and he urged the international community and the UN to fulfil their mission in Serb-dominated northern Mitrovica. The international community should place clear conditions on Serbia and should stop allowing the government in Belgrade to manipulate Serbs in northern Kosovo, Berisha added.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor will meet with her Slovenian counterpart Borut Pahor on Friday (July 31st) in Trakoscan, about 70km north of Zagreb, the government announced on Wednesday. They will discuss the long-standing border dispute between their countries that has blocked Croatia's EU integration process since December. "With this meeting, the bilateral dialogue on a prime-minister level which started in February will continue," the government said in a statement. It will be their first meeting since Kosor took office earlier this month. 
In other news, leaders of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) decided on Wednesday to nominate Andrija Hebrang as their presidential candidate in the election later this year. Hebrang, a high-ranking HDZ official, has served as health minister in several cabinets and for a short period as defence minister. Currently a member of parliament, his name first surfaced as a presidential contender earlier this month. He resisted the idea initially, citing prior health issues.

TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Socialist Party (SP) decided on Monday (November 12th) to ask for a parliamentary question-and-answer session with Prime Minister Sali Berisha regarding the European Commission's Progress Report on Albania, published a week ago. Berisha discussed the progress report during a closed-door meeting with lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Party on Monday. He reportedly acknowledged that corruption remains an issue in Albania's judicial sector and urged President Bamir Topi to reform the system.

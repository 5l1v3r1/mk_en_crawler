NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon criticising Cypriot President Demetris Christofias. Talat says Christofias refuses to set a timetable for the ongoing reunification talks between the two communities, media reported on Tuesday (December 9th). Talat also took a stand against Christofias' proposal to establish a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation on the island, saying such provisions had not been added to the agenda. He also took issue with some remarks regarding the 1974 Turkish military intervention in Cyprus made by Christofias and Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis at the UN General Assembly session in September. 
"Talat insists on two peoples, two states, two different religions, on the unacceptable demands for maintaining [Turkey's] guarantor status, but at the same time he avoids the huge issue of [Turkish] settlers in Cyprus," Cypriot Parliament Speaker Marios Karoyan said in response.

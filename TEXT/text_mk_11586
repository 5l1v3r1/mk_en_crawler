BUCHAREST, Romania -- Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi reaffirmed his country's support for Romania's efforts to sign the EU Accession Treaty next month together with Bulgaria. The two would then become part of the EU in 2007. During talks with Romanian counterpart Traian Basescu in Rome on Wednesday (23 March), Ciampi stressed that Italy is one of the staunchest supporters of Romania's bid. 
In other news, Romanian Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu returned from a visit to Brussels Wednesday and said there is a comfortable majority in the European Commission and the European Parliament (EP) in favour of signing of the EU Accession Treaty with Romania. He was responding to recent criticism voiced by some EP members over the pace of Romania's reforms. (Rompres, Nine o'clock - 24/03/05)

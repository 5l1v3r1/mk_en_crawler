ANKARA, Turkey -- Deniz Baykal, leader of the major opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), called Tuesday (4 January) for an extraordinary CHP congress by the end of January to elect a new chairman and to discuss corruption within the party. Baykal's call came after the party's Higher Discipline Board refused to expel Mustafa Sarigul, who governs one of Istanbul's wealthiest districts -- Sisli -- and is considered one of Baykal's main rivals in the race for CHP president. 
In other news, Ankara announced on Tuesday that it plans to deploy 1,421 troops in Afghanistan starting next week. Turkey reiterated its commitment to peacekeeping and stabilisation operations conducted by the NATO-led coalition there. (NTV - 05/01/05)

ATHENS, Greece -- A strike by preschool and primary teachers continued on Monday (October 2nd) for a third week, with the government still rejecting demands for a 40% wage hike. Local media reports say teachers in secondary schools decided at the weekend to join their colleagues and announced a 48-hour strike. The government says it lacks the funds to raise salaries.

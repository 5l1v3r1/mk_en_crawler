WASHINGTON, United States -- The State Department on Monday (6 October) urged the governments of Serbia and Kosovo to engage in serious talks next week on issues concerning the everyday lives of people. "The United States considers this dialogue extremely important and hopes that both the government of Serbia-Montenegro and leaders (from Kosovo) will approach them with serious intent and send appropriate high-level political representation to the Vienna launching of the talks," State Department Spokesman Richard Boucher said. His remarks followed last week's decision by the Kosovo Assembly to delay a vote that would have authorised local leaders to attend the 14 October negotiations in Vienna. (AP - 06/10/03)

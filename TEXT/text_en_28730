BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of the European Commission (EC) delegation to Serbia, Vincent Degert, said on Monday (October 11th) that the country has failed to meet the goals of an anti-corruption strategy that parliament adopted five years ago. Speaking at the opening of a conference, Degert stressed that political determination is essential to combat this phenomenon. Noting that the fight against corruption is among the criteria in the EU integration process, he advised the government to take steps to ensure that judges and prosecutors are independent of political influence. Justice Ministry official Gordana Pavlovic reaffirmed Serbia's commitment to fighting corruption, citing the recently adopted set of laws that should make efforts to combat graft more efficient.

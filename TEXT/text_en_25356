STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- Former Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic was released on Tuesday (October27th), after serving two-thirds of her 11-year sentence in a Swedish prison. She was convicted in 2003 after pleading guilty to a single count of persecution, a crime against humanity, in connection with her role in an ethnic cleansing campaign aimed at driving Croats and Muslims out of Serb-controlled areas of Bosnia. 
The Hague war crimes tribunal (ICTY) approved in mid-September her early release from prison for good behaviour. Plavsic was expected to arrive in Belgrade later on Tuesday. (BBC, DPA, AFP, Beta, Tanjug, RTS â 27/10/09)

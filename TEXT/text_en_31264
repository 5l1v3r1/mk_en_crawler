BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Greece has agreed to freeze the production of civilian ships at its Hellenic Shipyards for 15 years, the European Commission (EC) announced on Wednesday (December 1st). The move came in an effort to end a lawsuit the EU initiated in April over illegal state aid for the company. Such aid is strictly regulated, and Greece is accused of violating those policies by providing millions of euros in aid and guarantees to Hellenic Shipyards. Greece argued that it assisted the shipyard because it is crucial to national security as a producer of naval ships. The EU and Greece have agreed that the "non-naval" assets of Hellenic should be sold and civilian vessel production should be discontinued. The proceeds from the sell-off of assets will go to the state to partially repay the state aid. (Nafthemporiki, Ta Nea - 02/12/10; Eleftherotypia, DPA, Reuters - 01/12/10)

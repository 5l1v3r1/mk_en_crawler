NEW YORK, United States -- Romania is not planning to pull its 800 soldiers out of Iraq despite the kidnapping of three journalists a month ago, Foreign Minister Razvan Ungureanu said Wednesday (4 May). "Our agenda will not be shaped by the agenda of any kidnappers," he said during a trip to New York. He repeated a statement made by President Traian Basescu earlier in the day, affirming that the three reporters are alive. Ungureanu would not divulge whether his government was in touch with the kidnappers. (Reuters - 04/05/05)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin predicted on Sunday (3 August) that President Ahmet Necdet Sezer would approve the 7th EU harmonisation package. He added that if Sezer were to veto it, parliament would pass it again unchanged. The key issue is the proposed curtailment of the military's influence on politics. Sezer opposes efforts to reduce the role of the National Security Council by making it an advisory body, rather than a decision-making one. The military has reportedly asked Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan not to insist on the articles that limit the powers of the Council, should Sezer veto the harmonisation package.

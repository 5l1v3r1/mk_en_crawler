SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski says a UN guarantee of Macedonia's identity and language would help Skopje reach a compromise with Greece in their long-running name dispute, media reported on Thursday (October 30th). "If the UN guarantees that our people are called Macedonians and our language is referred to as Macedonian -- the key points of everyone's national identity -- then we will be able to make a deal," Crvenkovski said at a public discussion in the southeast town of Strumica. On Wednesday, Macedonian representatives presented UN special envoy Matthew Nimetz with Skopje's response to his latest proposal for resolving the name dispute. Macedonian diplomats quoted by the daily Dnevnik said Skopje had a whole package of remarks for Nimetz. (BIRN, MIA, A1, Dnevnik - 30/10/08)

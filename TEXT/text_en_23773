BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has confirmed that Slovenia is currently blocking Croatia's EU accession. The two countries have been involved in a bitter border dispute. Speaking Friday (December 19th) after an intergovernmental conference in Brussels -- where only one of the planned ten chapters was opened -- Rehn said Slovenia has vetoed the completion of talks on nine of the 35 chapters. At the same time, he expressed hope that despite Slovenia's veto, Croatia will be able to complete its EU accession procedures as early as next year.

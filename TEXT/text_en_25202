PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The Appeals Court on Wednesday (December 23rd) reduced the sentence of Damir Mandic, who was convicted in April of complicity in the killing of Montenegrin journalist Dusko Jovanovic. The sentence was cut from 30 to 19 years, though no reasons were given for the decision. Jovanovic, editor and publisher of the daily Dan, was shot to death in May 2004. Mandic was the only person accused in the murder and has insisted he is innocent. (RTCG, Radio Antena M, RTS, Beta, AP, AFP - 23/12/09)

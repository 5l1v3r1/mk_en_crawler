ZAGREB, Croatia -- Investigators from the UN war crimes tribunal are questioning former Macedonian Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski, his lawyer reported Monday (22 November). They want to clarify his role in the killing of ten ethnic Albanian civilians in the village of Ljuboten in August 2001. Boskovski denied involvement in the murders, claiming he was head of the government's information service, not minister, when the incident occurred. He is also under investigation for the killings of six Pakistanis and an Indian in March 2002. The government claimed at the time that the seven men were terrorists. It was later discovered, however, that they were illegal immigrants trying to reach Western Europe. (AFP - 22/11/04)

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UN police said that an elderly Serb couple and their son were killed in Obilic near Pristina on Tuesday (3 June). UN police spokesman Derek Chappell told reporters that the three victims were attacked while they were in bed and their home was then set on fire. UNMIK chief Michael Steiner called the murders a "heinous act and perfidious crime which was directed against multiethnicity in Kosovo". He promised to set up a special police task force to investigate the incident. Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi, who visited the scene of the crime with Steiner, condemned the murders as "a base and barbaric act". (Reuters, AFP, B92, Tanjug, BBC, FoNet - 04/06/03)

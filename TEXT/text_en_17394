ANKARA, Turkey -- As a result of Turkey's intermediary role, Iran and the EU will hold talks on Iran's nuclear programme in Turkey on Wednesday (April 25th). EU security chief Javier Solana confirmed the news on Monday, though it is still not clear whether negotiators will meet in Ankara or Istanbul. The talks will bring together Solana and Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, for the first time since the UN â followed by the EU -- passed fresh sanctions against Iran for refusing to halt uranium enrichment work.

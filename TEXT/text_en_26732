BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister-designate Liviu Negoita is expected to announce his cabinet Monday (November 9th), after the last round of negotiations with the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians. Both the Social Democratic Party and the National Liberal Party refused to participate in discussions. Negoita mentioned on Sunday that some of the ministers proposed by former prime minister-designate, Lucian Croitoru, would be on his list as well. Negoita has asked the public to encourage lawmakers to support his cabinet. As of now, most opposition parties still back Klaus Johannis for prime minister, but President Traian Basascu refuses to nominate him. (Evenimentul Zilei, Romania Libera, Mediafax - 09/11/09)

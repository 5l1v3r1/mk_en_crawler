ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou unveiled a three-year plan Thursday (January 14th) to restore financial stability to his economically embattled country. Greece will present the plan to the EU for approval on Friday. The blueprint aims to slash the public deficit to 2.8% of GDP by 2012, below the 3% ceiling permitted to countries in the eurozone. The country's deficit ballooned to 12.7% of GDP last year. The programme forecasts an economic contraction of 0.3% this year, but growth in 2011 and 2012. The government plans spending cuts, including pay freezes and salary caps for senior public sector workers. Also on Thursday, the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, dismissed as "absurd" speculation that Greece might have to leave the eurozone.

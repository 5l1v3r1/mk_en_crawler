TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi urged the justice system Wednesday (September 15th) to act as more than a spectator in the heated debate between the two main political parties, the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and the opposition Socialist Party (SP). Topi asked the judiciary to pay attention to corruption accusations levelled by both parties, which have dominated public debate for the past four months. This marks the first time Topi has injected himself into the debate, apart from urging the two sides to start a dialogue to address their differences. Topi's statement came during a meeting of the High Council for Justice in Tirana, where he said he was speaking on behalf of Albanians who want the judiciary to react to accusations at the highest level. He also insisted the justice system should remove every "corrupted and immoral official" from its ranks. (NOA, Balkan Web, Top Channel, Klan - 15/09/10)

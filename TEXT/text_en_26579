BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Tensions between the Albanian government and the opposition Socialist Party (SP) reached Brussels on Tuesday (November 10th), where a delegation from Tirana was reporting on issues related to Albania's visa liberalisation process and EU integration. Foreign Minister Ilir Meta presented reforms undertaken by the government and preparations for the completion of a questionnaire regarding the country's EU accession processes. "Albania will fulfil all of its duties regarding the visa liberalisation with the EU and will strengthen co-operation with the European Parliament," said Meta after meeting with Nikolaos Chountis, rapporteur for Albania. 
Meta added that the government will meet all of the opposition's demands, as long as this does not interfere with court decisions or judicial independence. In effect, this means rejecting the SP's request to open disputed ballot boxes from the June general elections. SP Secretary for Foreign Affairs Arta Dade, who was also in Brussels, insisted there is no law against investigating election results. SP lawmakers have been boycotting parliament sessions for weeks, demanding a thorough investigation of the elections.
Separately Tuesday, Interior Minister Lulzim Basha asked police to step up their efforts in order to meet visa liberalisation criteria set by the EU. During a meeting with senior state police officials, he announced the continuation of reforms aimed at better results in fighting organised crime, corruption and financial crimes.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The EU feasibility study concerning Serbia-Montenegro is not yet ready, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus said Thursday (31 March), adding that a positive evaluation is not forthcoming due to Belgrade's poor record of war-crimes co-operation. Officials acknowledge that extraditing indicted generals Sreten Lukic and Nebojsa Pavkovic would advance the feasibility study.
Meanwhile, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica discussed the future status of Kosovo on Thursday, saying the province should remain part of Serbia. "We propose and count on a compromise for the final status of the region. A compromise means that no one can get everything and no one can lose everything," he said. (B92 - 01/04/05)

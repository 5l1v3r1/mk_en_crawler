ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ali Babacan says Turkey will soon decide whether to send more troops to the international security force in Afghanistan. The chief of the General Staff, General Yasar Buyukanit, opposes more foreign deployments, saying the army has its hands full fighting the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party. The issue came up on Wednesday (March 19th) due to a visit to Ankara by Afghani Foreign Minister Rangin Dadfar Spanta. He and Babacan discussed other ways to boost co-operation aimed at guaranteeing stability and security in Afghanistan. (Zaman - 20/03/08; AFP, Milliyet, Turkish Press, Hurriyet, AP - 19/03/08)

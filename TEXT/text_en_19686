ATHENS, Greece -- Bank workers joined teachers and journalists on Wednesday (November 21st) to protest plans by the ruling New Democracy party to merge pension funds. The Greek Federation of Bank Employees Unions announced members will stop work for three hours Thursday, while journalists and teachers plan a 24-hour strike next Tuesday. Medical workers from the Social Security Foundation started a 48-hour strike on Wednesday. Earlier this week, Employment and Social Protection Minister Vassilios Magginas said the government will reduce the number of pension funds from 155 to five to streamline the system. Unions fear their members will lose out if their funds are merged. (Kathimerini - 22/11/07; News In, ERT - 21/11/07)

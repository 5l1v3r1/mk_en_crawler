PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Behgjet Pacolli announced on Monday (March 14th) that he will initiate procedures to amend the constitutional provisions dealing with elections, including how the president is elected. He wants it directly by the citizens instead of the current method of parliament electing the president. According to him, the changes are needed given the problems that occurred during the December general elections. He made the comment during a meeting with Central Election Commission Chairperson Valdete Daka. (RTK, Kohavision, Klan Kosova - 14/03/11)

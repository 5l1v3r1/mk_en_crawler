ATHENS, Greece -- Police have dismantled a major crime gang involved in contract killings, bombings, extortion and kidnappings, local media reported on Sunday (July 5th). Two days earlier, police arrested ten of the 16 members of the gang, in connection with the January kidnapping of shipping magnate Pericles Panagopoulos. He was freed after his family paid a record 30.2m-euro ransom. Those arrested include two convicts serving life sentences, who authorities say organised the kidnapping from their prison cells, and their wives, who are suspected of holding Panagopoulos captive. Police chief Yiannis Dikopoulos said members of gang also carried out contract killings ordered by their jailed leaders.

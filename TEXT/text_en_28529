NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Police in Nicosia announced on Tuesday (June 15th) that a key suspect in the alleged contract murder of local media mogul Andis Hadjicostis has been arrested in Moldova. Extradition procedures have been launched to bring Gregoris Xenofontos, 29, to Cyprus. Investigators say he pulled the trigger in the January 11th killing of Hadjicostis. TV host Elena Skordelli, her brother Anastasios Krasopoullis and Andreas Grigoriou are already on trial for plotting the killing, allegedly prompted by Skordelli's dismissal from a TV station Hadjicostis owned.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal decided Wednesday (16 April) to allow courts in Bosnia and Herzegovina to prosecute Gojko Klickovic, a former prime minister of Republika Srpska (RS). He is charged with the forcible deportations of non-Serbs from Bosanska Krupa while serving as a local official there in 1992. An RS court is also looking to prosecute Klickovic for embezzlement. He disappeared several years ago and is thought to be hiding in Serbia or Montenegro.
In other news, four Serbs will go on trial in The Hague next month for their alleged roles in the Srebrenica massacre. Vidoje Blagojevic, Dragan Obrenovic, Momir Nikolic and Dragan Jokic say they will plead not guilty. (AFP - 16/04/03)

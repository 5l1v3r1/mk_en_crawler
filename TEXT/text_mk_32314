SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The initial stage of the general census began Tuesday (1 October), with soldiers and prisoners interviewed ahead of the general population. Long delayed for security reasons, the census includes for the first time the option to respond in either Macedonian or Albanian. According to the newspaper Dnevnik however, problems have cropped up in polling soldiers, due to poor co-ordination between the army and the State Statistical Bureau.

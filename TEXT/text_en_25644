ZAGREB, Croatia -- Leaders of the three main opposition parties -- the Social Democratic Party, the Croatian People's Party and the Istrian Democratic Assembly -- met on Thursday (August 20th) to discuss their various economic programmes. All three oppose the recently introduced solidarity tax and would work to repeal it. They would instead introduce tax incentives to encourage economic development. One of the specific moves mentioned after the meeting was stricter control over public procurement procedures. The opposition leaders also called for better utilisation of state properties.

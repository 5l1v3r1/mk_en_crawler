PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Senior representatives of the Croatian, Montenegrin and Serbian judiciaries met in Podgorica on Monday (December 4th) to discuss issues related to the processing of war crimes cases in the region. The roundtable was organised jointly by the Montenegrin Chief Prosecutor's Office and the UNDP. Participants agreed that full co-operation among judicial bodies and a quality exchange of data about the movement and whereabouts of suspects are crucial to bringing criminals to justice. 
Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic, meanwhile, announced that the country's judiciary is conducting a probe into the "biggest mass grave after Srebrenica". It allegedly contains between 670 and 750 bodies. He was unwilling to elaborate, saying only that it was related to an investigation into a group of Serbian paramilitary members -- suspected of killing 700 civilians in eastern BiH in 1992. 
Separately, Croatian deputy chief prosecutor Antun Kvakan said that Zagreb might transfer three cases to Montenegro, one of which is linked to a war camp in Morinj in late 1991. Croatia is trying to determine whether the suspects are on Montenegrin territory. (Glas javnosti, Nezavisne novine, Pobjeda, Vijesti - 05/12/06; Mina - 04/12/06)

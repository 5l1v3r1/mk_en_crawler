SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The city of Sarajevo has filed criminal charges against Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik for abuse of power, and inciting ethnic, racial and religious hatred, the city press office announced on Tuesday (October 6th). The charges stem from Dodik's denial that war crimes were committed against civilians in Tuzla and Sarajevo during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. He has said that the 1995 Serb mortar attack that killed 71 people in the northern town of Tuzla was staged. He has also questioned the massacres at Sarajevo's main market in 1994 and 1995, when a total of 105 people were killed and 234 were wounded by Serb shells. The Tuzla municipality has already filed charges against Dodik over these statements. (Dnevni Avaz, RTRS, Fena, RTS, Tanjug - 06/10/09)

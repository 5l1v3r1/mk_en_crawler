ATHENS, Greece -- On Tuesday (12 November), Public Order Minister Michalis Chrysochoidis presented the cabinet with new regulations for the use of weapons by police officers. The rules were initiated by human rights groups that demand current rules, which date back to 1943, be updated. The new rules would determine when exactly officers could use their weapons and provide training in the responsible use of arms, in accordance with EU regulations.

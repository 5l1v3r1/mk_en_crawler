MOSCOW, Russia -- Greece and Russia signed an agreement Tuesday (April 29th) envisioning Athens' participation in the South Stream natural gas pipeline project, as part of Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis' daylong visit to Moscow. "I am sure that the pragmatic approach of Greek leaders will bring in the very near future significant dividends for Greece, the Balkans and Europe," outgoing Russian President Vladimir Putin said. "Greece's options in the energy sector have as their exclusive criterion the energy security of our country and of our European partners," Karamanlis said.
After meeting with Karamanlis, Putin said Moscow and Athens share similar positions on the situation in the Balkans and on the Kosovo issue. He reiterated that Russia supports the strict observation of the principle and rules of international law and the respect of mutual interests in resolving all disputes based on negotiations. Before leaving, Karamanlis met with Putin's handpicked successor, Dmitry Medvedev, who assumes the presidency next week. (AFP, Tanjug, Kanal 5, Xinhua, ANA-MPA, ITAR-TASS, Reuters, ERT - 29/04/08)

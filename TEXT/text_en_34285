ATHENS, Greece -- Addressing parliament on Monday (30 June), Prime Minister Costas Simitis summarised the country's accomplishments during its just-completed term as president of the EU. He noted that the crisis in Iraq consumed the greatest attention during the six-month rotating term, but said completion of the Constitutional Convention proceedings for the European Constitution approved at the Thessaloniki summit was the major achievement. He added that Greece's term in the presidency had bolstered its political prestige among EU members. (MPA, ANA - 30/06/03)

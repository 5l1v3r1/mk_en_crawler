ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic said in an interview Tuesday (December 11th) that Croatia would probably modify plans for enforcing an Adriatic fishing protected zone (ZERP) to avoid a standoff with EU members Italy and Slovenia. Parliament decided to establish the 56,000 square km zone as of January 1st 2008, despite an earlier agreement with Italy and Slovenia. The European Commission warned Zagreb last week that going ahead with plans for the zone would hurt its bid to join the EU. 
Also Tuesday, Mesic said he expects final results from the ongoing negotiations aimed at forming a new coalition government by Thursday. After that, parliament could be convened, Mesic added. (Vjesnik - 12/12/07; AFP, HRT, Vecernji List, HINA, Poslovni Dnevnik, Javno.com, Reuters - 11/12/07)

TIRANA, Albania -- The main opposition Socialist Party (SP) threatened on Monday (July 6th) to ignore the final results of the June 28th general elections if it is not declared winner in the Fieri region. The Central Election Commission has yet to release the official results there as a result of political pressure on the vote counting process. Preliminary results suggest the SP got nine seats, followed by the ruling Democratic Party with six. SP leader Edi Rama promised to make sure the election process is transparent and to "defend people's will". (Shekulli, BBC, VoA, Alsat - 06/07/09)

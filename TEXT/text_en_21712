THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The leader of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS), Vojislav Seselj, told The Hague war crimes tribunal on Tuesday (September 23rd) that former SRS deputy Tomislav Nikolic, who recently left the party's ranks, "has been recruited by some western intelligence services to break up the SRS". During a procedural debate in his war crimes trial, Seselj, who is charged with war crimes against non-Serbs in Croatia, Vojvodina and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 1993, said "Nikolic has lost any moral criteria and he cannot be trusted about anything anymore" to help defend him, Seselj said. He also announced that he has sacked his defence adviser, Aleksandar Vucic, because he doesn't trust him either. (Beta, Tanjug, B92, RTRS, SRNA - 23/09/08)

PARIS, France -- US Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns said during a trip to Paris on Tuesday (June 12th) that Western powers will press ahead with efforts to implement the Kosovo status plan drafted by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari. "It [the Ahtisaari plan] is the only way forward and there is no walking back from it, in our judgment," he said. The plan would grant supervised independence to the province.
In Belgrade, however, President Boris Tadic insisted that his country will seek to retain sovereignty while also pressing ahead with its EU bid. Serbia "will give up neither Kosovo nor its European future", he said. Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica made a similar comment. 
The international Contact Group for Kosovo held a scheduled meeting in Paris, and confirmed its support for the Ahtisaari plan. However, representatives of Russia -- which has sided with Belgrade -- did not attend. (Blic - 13/06/07; Reuters, AFP, RTS, Tanjug, Beta, B92, RTK, RFE, Telerafi, Balkanweb - 12/06/07)

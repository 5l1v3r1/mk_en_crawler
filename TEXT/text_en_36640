BUCHAREST, Romania -- The ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) will not form pre-election coalitions with any other political party, including the opposition Greater Romania Party, the National Liberal Party or the Democratic Party, PSD chairman and Prime Minister Adrian Nastase said Friday (30 July). Nastase said the PSD is certain of its victory in the autumn parliamentary elections and that it will be able to form a government on its own, which will continue the current cabinet's reform programme.

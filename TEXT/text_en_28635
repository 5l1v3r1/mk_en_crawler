TIRANA, Albania -- The government is expected to undergo changes in at least three ministerial posts, given a request Prime Minister Sali Berisha sent to the president's office Monday (September 13th). Triggering it was a request filed six months ago by junior government coalition partner, the Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI). Berisha had refused to act any earlier, citing the government's busy schedule. President Bamir Topi will now have to sign a decree giving Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ilir Meta the post of economy ministry, taking over for Dritan Prifti, described by the opposition as the most corrupt member of government. Edmond Haxhinasto, also a member of SMI, will replace Meta as foreign minister. The presidential decree will be sent on to parliament for approval. (Shekulli, Ora News, BBC, Top Channel - 13/09/10)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EUFOR raided three houses early Friday (November 23rd) in the wartime Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale, near Sarajevo. A spokesman says that well before dawn, troops searched the homes of Radovan Karadzic's wife Liljana, daughter Sonja and son Alexander, in a bid to cut the fugitive's support network. He has been on the run for 12 years. (RTRS, Fena, NTV Hayat - 23/11/07)

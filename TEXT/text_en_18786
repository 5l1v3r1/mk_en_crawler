SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In an interview with the newspaper Dnevni Avaz published on Monday (May 7th), Dirk Lange, head of department for BiH and Albania in the EC's General Directorate for Enlargement, said that in the past months the country has made virtually no progress in reforms. Lange says authorities have done nothing to fulfil obligations related to EU integration, especially regarding police reforms and co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. That in turn means there is no chance of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement being signed with the EU in the near future. (Dnevni Avaz, Fena, RTRS, Reuters - 07/05/07)

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- The Serbian government fired the chief of the country's intelligence service on Thursday (23 January), in what was interpreted by local media as an attempt to improve co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. Yugoslav Interior Minister Zoran Zivkovic said, however, that Andrija Savic, head of the Agency for Security and Information, had been relieved of his duties because he had completed his term. He was appointed in the autumn of 2001, becoming the first secret service chief not appointed by the Socialist Party. Savic was fired only days after US envoy for war crimes Pierre-Richard Prosper warned Yugoslavia that it must arrest Ratko Mladic and two other suspects or risk losing US aid and assistance.

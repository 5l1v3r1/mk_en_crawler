BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) has issued a positive opinion on Serbia's draft law on elections and the law on financing of political parties, State Secretary of the Justice Ministry Slobodan Homen said on Thursday (April 21st). The bills include several amendments recommended by the EC and are expected to be the most problematic reforms Serbia must implement for its candidate status bid, along with amendments to the law on restitution. Earlier this month, the EC urged the government to speed up EU-related reforms and achieve full co-operation with The Hague tribunal to be able to receive candidate status by the end of the year.

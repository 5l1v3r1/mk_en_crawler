SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Speaking on Friday (24 March), High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling highlighted job creation as the single most urgent task facing BiH politicians. He was addressing a session of the BiH Economic Co-ordination Board -- a body including the state and entity prime ministers and finance ministers and other officials in charge of the economy. The top international envoy urged enforcement of the draft legislation on the state-level BiH Fiscal Council, as well as strengthening of fiscal discipline, particularly as regards the spending of extra revenues from VAT. Economic reforms are required under the EU Stabilisation and Association Process, Schwarz-Schilling noted. (OHR Sources, Fena - 24/03/06)

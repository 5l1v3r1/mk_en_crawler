ANKARA, Turkey -- The crew of a Turkish frigate detained five pirates in the Gulf of Aden on Tuesday (August 11th), suspecting the group may have been plotting to attack a vessel off the Somali coast, the Turkish army said. The frigate, part of NATO's anti-pirate forces in the region, detained the pirates aboard a motor boat, with the help of a helicopter and amphibian commandos. The operation was undertaken after it appeared the pirates approached two ships in a safe corridor guarded by multi-national naval forces. (Sabah - 12/08/09; AFP - 11/08/09)

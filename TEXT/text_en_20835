SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EUFOR and NATO troops searched the home of Mile Savcic, a former driver and bodyguard for ex-Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic early Thursday (December 6th). EUFOR later described the five-hour raid as part of efforts to smash the fugitive's support network. Troops confiscated documents and a small quantity of ammunition. EUFOR recently intensified activities aimed at helping The Hague tribunal locate four remaining high-profile indictees, including searching the homes of Karadzic's wife and children.

BERLIN, Germany -- US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called for flexibility in the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece during a meeting Tuesday (June 24th) with Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis. They conferred on the sidelines of the International Donors Conference for the Palestinian Territories in Berlin. Bakoyannis later told reporters that while the talks were "informative", she sees no grounds for resolving the dispute with Macedonia by July 9th. Media reports mention the date as a deadline for resolving the issue, as Albania and Croatia are expected to sign their NATO accession agreements then. They received invitations to join NATO in April, but the Alliance bypassed Macedonia, due to the long-standing name dispute.
In other news Tuesday, US President George W. Bush extended by a year sanctions against certain individuals and legal entities from the Western Balkans that pose a threat to US foreign policy. The sanctions stem from the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, adopted in June 2001. It introduced sanctions against those involved in extremist activities and acts of violence in Macedonia and other areas in the Western Balkans.

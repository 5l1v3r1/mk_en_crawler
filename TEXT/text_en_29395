BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU President Herman van Rompuy kicks off a visit Monday (July 5th) to the Western Balkans. His office says that the tour will start in Ljubljana, and continue to Zagreb, Belgrade and Pristina. This will be his first visit to Belgrade since he took the post in December. 
The announcement came as Belgium assumed the EU's rotating presidency from Spain. In an interview with EurActiv, EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said that during the next six months, the bloc will remain committed to supporting the integration of the Western Balkans and Turkey, despite the global economic crisis.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Decertified policemen launched new protests Monday (June 9th) in Sarajevo outside the Office of the High Representative, demanding permission to return to work. Protestors insist High Representative Miroslav Lajcak implement the decision made by the UN Security Council over a year ago that lifts the lifetime work ban affecting most of them. They threatened to begin hunger strikes Wednesday if authorities fail to resolve their situation. In 2002, a major security service purge by the UN International Police Task Force sacked approximately 500 police officers from all ethnic communities.

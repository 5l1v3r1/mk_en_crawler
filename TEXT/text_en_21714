SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Unknown assailants attacked the editor-in-chief of local internet site www.frognews.bg late Monday (September 22nd). Ognyan Stefanov was beaten by four masked men who waited for him outside the restaurant where he was having dinner with his wife. Stefanov was taken to hospital with serious head injuries, broken legs and spinal trauma. Stefanov is believed to be behind an anonymous website, www.opasnite.net63.net, that publishes corruption allegations involving senior government officials as well as critical reports about police officers and shadowy businessmen. Stefanov rejects the claims.
In other news, the Bulgarian police arrested the State Agency for Youth and Sports Deputy Chairman Ivan Lekov on Tuesday. The prosecution said the arrest was based on Lekov's suspected abuse of office on the heels of recent reports of fixing football matches through the mediation of referees.

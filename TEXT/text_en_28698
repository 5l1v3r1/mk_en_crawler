TIRANA, Albania -- Authorities reported on Wednesday (August 11th) that wildfires have destroyed dozens of hectares of forests in the northern region of Shkodra. Fuelled by high temperatures and strong winds, the flames spread fast. The mountainous terrain further impeded efforts by firefighters and the military to approach the fires, which they managed to contain later in the day. 
Another wildfire has erupted in the southern regions of Tepelena and Mallakastra. Residents and fire fighters intervened before flames that engulfed a vineyard reached inhabited areas. Authorities say that most fires this summer have been caused by farmers who burn the grass before seeding their land. (Balkan Web, Top Channel, Telegrafi - 11/08/10)

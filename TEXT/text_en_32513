LONDON, Great Britain -- Defence Secretary Geoffrey Hoon met with his Macedonian counterpart, Vlado Buckovski, on Tuesday (11 March), and offered to advise Skopje on preparations for NATO membership. London would co-ordinate the NATO advisory team and the military and technical co-operation for the Macedonian Army with the NATO member countries. It would also supply radio-telecommunication and surveillance equipment and organise special training for the Macedonian Army and special police forces, in a bid to increase their counter-terrorism preparedness.

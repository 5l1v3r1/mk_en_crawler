TIRANA, Albania -- Soon, Albanian citizens will need only an electronic ID card to travel to neighbouring Kosovo, according to an agreement effective on Tuesday (June 1st), for the tourist season and possibly beyond. A reciprocal summer agreement for Kosovo citizens has been in effect in Albania for years. 
In other news, the European Commission's (EC) recommendation to proceed with the process of visa liberalisation for Albania has prompted a wave of applications for biometric passports. The interior ministry said on Sunday that authorities received an unusually high number of applications late last week. The EC had just decided to recommend lifting visas requirements for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina if three conditions are met. (Shekulli, Lajmifundit, News 24 - 30/05/10)

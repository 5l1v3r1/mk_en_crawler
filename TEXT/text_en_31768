PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Simon Haselock, the chief UN spokesman in Kosovo, criticised a statement by a Serb hard-line politician who hinted at the possibility of forming a militia as "unacceptable" on Sunday (6 April). In an interview with the BETA news agency, Milan Ivanovic voiced opposition to UN plans to transfer more responsibilities to local authorities in Kosovo. "I am afraid that Kosovo Serbs would have to form their own army and defend themselves and their freedom," he said, claiming that the UN plan would destabilise the province. But another Kosovo Serb leader, Oliver Ivanovic, dismissed the statement as "ridiculous and dangerous". He said Serbs are committed to staying in the province's institutions. (AP - 06/04/03)

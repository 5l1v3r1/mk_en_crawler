ANKARA, Turkey -- The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is pessimistic over the outcome of the closure case against it, according to senior party officials quoted in Monday's (May 19th) edition of the Zaman newspaper. Reportedly, most in the party feel they will lose the case pending before the Constitutional Court. In March, the Court agreed to review a case filed by the chief prosecutor at the Supreme Court of Appeals. Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya requested the ban after accusing the AKP of breaching Turkey's secular constitution and preaching Islamic ideas. The prosecutor has also requested that 71 AKP members be banned from politics, including Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Abdullah Gul. As eight of the 11 judges on the Constitutional Court were appointed by former President Ahmed Necdet Sezer, an outspoken defender of secular values, the general mood of AKP members and cabinet ministers is described as "gloomy".

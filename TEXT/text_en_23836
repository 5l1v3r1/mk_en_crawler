TIRANA, Albania -- Transparency International criticised the Albanian government on Thursday (January 22nd) for failing to do enough to protect local media investigating corruption. The organisation voiced support for the staff of the local newspaper Tema, which suffered eviction from its office. The government cancelled a 20-year lease following reports in the paper that accused government ministers of graft. In a letter to Prime Minister Sali Berisha, Transparency International's director for Europe, Miklos Marschall, said the Tema case "is regarded by many as a sign of the growing political pressure against critical voices in the media".
In other news, parliament decided on Thursday to postpone a vote on a resolution regarding Albania's application for EU membership. The Foreign Affairs Committee in parliament said it would save the discussion for another session in the near future. The resolution would urge the government to submit Albania's application for EU candidate-country status to Brussels. (Reuters, Worldbulletin, Telegrafi, Start, Alsat, Klan - 22/01/09)

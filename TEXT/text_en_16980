SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Supreme Court Chairman Dane Iliev described as unsatisfactory Monday (3 April) the situation in the domestic judiciary last year. He presented data suggesting only 50.6 per cent of the cases submitted to the basic courts were resolved in 2005. He noted also that the courts' debts exceeded 150,000 euros and that polls show declining public trust in judicial institutions.
Also Monday, Macedonia's Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski spoke by phone with Nikola Gruevski, leader of the major opposition group VMRO-DPMNE. Buckovski urged the party to name as soon as possible a chairman of the State Election Commission (SEC). Under electoral legislation passed last week, the seven-member SEC must be formed by Saturday.

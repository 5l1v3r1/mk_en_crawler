BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Serbia-Montenegro must meet their obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn reiterated on Thursday (30 March), after his meeting with BiH Council of Ministers Chairman Adnan Terzic. He stressed that Serbia-Montenegro must hand over former Bosnian Serb general Ratko Mladic, one of the tribunal's most-wanted fugitives, or risk a suspension of its Stabilisation and Association Talks with Brussels. 
UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte, who visited Banja Luka and Belgrade earlier this week to assess levels of co-operation, was due to meet with Rehn Friday to discuss her findings. A statement issued by Serbian President Boris Tadic's office after his talks with Del Ponte said she had voiced concern that co-operation had halted.

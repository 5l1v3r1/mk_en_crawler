TIRANA, Albania -- A Turkish court reportedly has rejected a request by Tirana for the extradition of an Albanian criminal, Alfred Shkurti, also known as Aldo Bare, to his home country, according to Monday's (15 May) Albanian News. Citing sources in the Albanian Justice Ministry, the newspaper said the court's decision stemmed from a claim by Shkurti's lawyer, who said the defendant could not be guaranteed a fair trial in Albania. Shkurti also has apparently applied for a political asylum in Turkey. One of Albania's most-wanted criminals, he was arrested in Turkey on 25 March. He has been linked to more than 15 murders, several hijackings and drug trafficking in Albania and was sentenced to prison in absentia by two separate domestic courts in 2001.

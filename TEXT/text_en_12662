SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Council of Ministers decided on Friday (4 February) that all state-level ministries should accelerate work, so all 16 priority recommendations from the European Commission's Feasibility Study for BiH are met by 10 March. That is when a session of the EU-BiH Consultative Task Force is scheduled to take place. The BiH government stressed the need for intensified activities, particularly related to the harmonisation of entity and state legislation in the field of refugees and displaced persons, as well as the financing of BiH institutions.

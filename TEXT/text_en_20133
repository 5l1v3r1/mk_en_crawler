SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Leaders of the four parties in the Federation of BiH (FBiH) ruling coalition -- the Party for Democratic Action (SDA), Party for BiH (SBiH), the Croatian Democratic Union BiH (HDZ BiH) and HDZ 1990 -- will meet on Saturday (February 16th) in Sarajevo to discuss the latest political developments and specific issues in FBiH executive and legislative bodies. The meeting is being convened as conflict escalates between the two main Bosniak parties -- the SDA and the SBIH -- over economic interests in the energy sector. In addition, the two Bosniak parties and the two Croat parties remain at odds over the new constitutional structure. 
The Bosniak parties insist an integrated state should be established, while the Croat parties propose federalisation and the emergence of a Croat entity in BiH. (Dnevni Avaz - 15/02/08; Fena, NTV Hayat - 14/02/08)

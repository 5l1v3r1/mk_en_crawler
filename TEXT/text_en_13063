BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu urged the public Tuesday (27 September) to declare war on bribery. "I ask Romanians no longer to offer bribes, starting tomorrow -- to demand from the civil servant, the customs officer, the doctor, anybody, including private firms -- to observe the law," Basescu said during his address to the "Networking Europe" conference in Bucharest. He stressed that a collective effort is needed to change the perception that Romania is a corrupt country. (Rompres, Nine o'clock - 27/09/05)

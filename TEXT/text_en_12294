ATHENS, Greece -- Olympiakos's 80th anniversary celebration turned sour Thursday (10 March) when the team lost at home 1-3 to Newcastle United in the 1/8th finals of the UEFA Cup tournament. Two of the Greek players were benched for rough play in a game that will also be remembered for an unruly crowd and two penalties, one for each side. 
Elsewhere in the tournament, Villareal's opening game against Steaua was postponed until next Wednesday because of heavy snow.Partizan Belgrade barely escaped defeat at home at the hands of CSKA Moscow. The Russians scored in the 18th minute, but the home team answered with a late goal by Ivan Tomic on a penalty kick. (Reuters - 10/03/05)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Health authorities rejected an earlier report of swine flu in Croatia on Monday (June 15th). At a press conference, Health Minister Darko Milinovic first confirmed a recent illness as H1N1, but then retracted his statement hours later, stating that a laboratory in London sent the wrong results. "Due to a mistake in a laboratory in London, we received a wrong confirmation. Now I have a written apology saying that the test on the virus was negative," said Milinovic.

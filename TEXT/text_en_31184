STRASBOURG, France -- Kosovo should establish a clean government after the December 12th elections, according to Pieter Feith, EU special representative and head of the International Civilian Office in Kosovo. "We should not overdramatise this. This is a phenomenon that is not unique to Kosovo; we have it in the region as well," Feith said while reporting to the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee in Strasbourg on Thursday (December 2nd). 
He also criticised calls by parallel structures in the Serb-dominated north to boycott the snap elections and commented on a statement by Serbian President Boris Tadic. "[His] statement that any changes of reality on the ground would mean the end of dialogue with Pristina is a bit surprising to me. I think that realities on the ground are driven by the citizens, and not by the governments," Feith said.
Commenting on the situation in northern Mitrovica, Feith said it continues to be the main challenge facing Kosovo and international institutions. He also stressed that Kosovars are disappointed by the fact they remain the only nation in the region unable to enjoy visa-free travel to EU countries.

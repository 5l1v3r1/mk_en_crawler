THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal ordered the Dutch authorities to force-feed, by tube if necessary, indicted Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj, who has been on a hunger strike for 27 days. The judges issued the orders after a team of doctors examined him and said he likely would die within the next two weeks. "There is a prevailing interest in continuing with the trial of the accused in order to serve the ends of justiceâ¦ The trial ... should not be undermined by the accused's manipulative behavior," the tribunal said.

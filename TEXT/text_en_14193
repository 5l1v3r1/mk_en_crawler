ZAGREB, Croatia -- A swan and several seagulls have tested positive for the H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus, Croatian authorities reported on Tuesday (14 March). The potentially deadly disease has been detected in three Croatian regions since October. 
Romania, meanwhile, reported that it is investigating possible outbreaks of bird flu in farms in the towns of Dunarea and Valea Nucarilor. Authorities will have to cull more than 30,000 birds if samples test positive for the H5N1 strain. Veterinarians have killed more than 300,000 chickens since the virus was first discovered in Romania in October.
In Bulgaria, four wild swans have tested positive for the deadly H5N1 strain. Local media reports say a fifth swan, found near the northeast Black Sea town of Kavarna, is currently being tested. (Reuters, HINA, HRT, Darik - 14/03/05)

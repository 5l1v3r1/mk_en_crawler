ATHENS, Greece --Approximately 10 million Greek voters headed for the polls Sunday (7 March) to elect the country's next parliament and government. With the two main contenders -- the right-wing New Democracy Party, led by Costas Karamanlis, and the Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement of George Papandreou -- thought to be in a dead heat, analysts say small parties could affect the outcome. Polls will close at 7 pm, and the first official results are expected around 10:30 pm.

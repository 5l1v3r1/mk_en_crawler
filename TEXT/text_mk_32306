SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Poland's President Aleksander Kwasniewski on Wednesday (2 October) became the first Polish head of state to visit Macedonia. The trip is seen as a step towards intensification of bilateral co-operation, with an upgrade of diplomatic relations to the ambassadorial level expected soon. During a meeting with his Macedonian counterpart, Boris Trajkovski, Kwasniewski praised efforts to overcome the consequences of last year's military crisis and commended Trajkovski's role in the peace process. The two presidents also discussed Macedonia's bid to join NATO, and the presence of NATO forces in Macedonia. Afterwards, Trajkovski said he wants NATO's 800 personnel to remain for two months, after their mandate expires on 26 October, citing fragile security in the so-called crisis areas.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Agriculture Minister Mehdi Eker on Friday (20 January) accused some of the country's neighbours of concealing information about outbreaks of bird flu on their territory. Refusing to name any particular country, he said these states have "closed regimes". Syria immediately denied that it had detected any signs of the disease. Also Friday, Turkish authorities reported that they had discovered the H5N1 strain of the virus in Thrace, near the border with Bulgaria. 
The Turkish government, meanwhile, is preparing a plan to shore up the poultry industry, reeling from the bird flu outbreak. The package includes financial assistance worth some $40m. (TurkishPress.com, Turks.US - 21/01/06; AP, AFP, NTV - 20/01/06)

ANKARA, Turkey -- The Higher Election Board agreed on Thursday (April 21st) to partially revise a decision that barred 12 pro-Kurdish politicians from running as independents in the June 12th general elections. The decision to allow seven of the candidates to participate came amid a third day of violent protests against the original ruling. Thousands of Kurds gathered earlier in the day to attend the funeral of a protester who was killed on Wednesday in Bismil, near the southeast city of Diyarbakir, during clashes with police.

ATHENS, Greece -- The rating agency Moody's on Monday (March 7th) cut Greece's debt from Baa1 to Ba1 -- citing large-scale tax evasion, huge work still ahead for authorities in efforts to implement austerity measures, and a possible decision by the EU to restructure the country's debt after 2013. The agency maintained its negative outlook for the rating. The finance ministry in Athens reacted immediately, describing Moody's decision as "incomprehensible". "Moody's downgrading of Greece's debts reveals more about the misaligned incentives and the lack of accountability of credit rating agencies than the genuine state or prospects of the Greek economy," the ministry said in a statement.

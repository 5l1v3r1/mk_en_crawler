SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament formed an ad hoc commission Thursday (21 July) to deal with problems stemming from the recent heavy floods and to suggest concrete measures within 30 days. Commission chairman Yordan Tsonev said he would propose that victims and municipalities obtain 100 per cent compensation for damage to homes, farms and infrastructure. On Wednesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross, several UN agencies and the WHO announced financial, technical and material assistance to the hardest-hit areas in Bulgaria. 
In neighbouring Romania, which faces the same problem, the government decided Wednesday on a new budget revision, extending more money for flood relief. Cristian David, minister delegate for programmes related to international financing, says Romania expects to obtain at least 100m euros from the EU for reconstruction of flood-damaged infrastructure. The EU has pledged to help both Romania and Bulgaria, where 20 people died and tens of thousands are homeless as a result of torrential rains over the past two months.

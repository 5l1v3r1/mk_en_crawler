NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat made an impromptu visit to the Greek part of the divided island's capital, Nicosia on Friday (April 11th). He used the Ledra Street pedestrian connector, an area barricaded for decades before it was recently re-opened. Talat said he decided to visit on the "spur of the moment". According to local media reports, he strolled into a number of shops and bought some ice cream. No Turkish Cypriot leader has visited the Greek part of the capital since 1974. The visit was welcomed both by the Greek Cypriot government and the UN. (Reuters, AP, AFP, BBC, Famagusta Gazette, DPA, CNA - 11/04/08)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The international community's High Representative in BiH, Paddy Ashdown, said Thursday (20 March) that he did not expect the military conflict in Iraq to have any impact on BiH. SFOR Commander US Gen William Ward echoed that opinion, saying that the peacekeepers' mission would not be affected by events in Iraq and that they will continue to search for war crimes indictees.
At an emergency session Thursday, the tripartite BiH Presidency expressed its regret that Iraq had not been disarmed peacefully. The presidency also declared that the UN should seriously consider its role and be actively involved in resolving the crisis, given the new circumstances. The BiH Council of Ministers reiterated Thursday that border security is being stepped up in light of the Iraq war and last week's assassination of Serbia's Zoran Djindjic.

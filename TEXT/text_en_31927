DURRES, Albania -- On Tuesday (26 November), the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications signed an agreement with NATO forces in Albania on the use of port space in Durres. NATO will continue to participate in efforts to improve the infrastructure there, and will free up port space for implementation of World Bank projects.

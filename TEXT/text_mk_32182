SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In a tough speech to businessmen Wednesday (9 October), Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in BiH, called on the political parties that won the recent elections to carry out a comprehensive reform or remain the "stagnant pool of the Balkans." Ashdown warned that "aid is falling off, debts are mounting and foreign investment is not increasing to fill the gap ... I say to those parties who have recently adopted the language of reform - you have some convincing to do." Ashdown presented a set of six priority reforms that he views as a test for "the seriousness" of future governments in BiH. These included re-structuring of central institutions, the revenue system, the political system, the business environment, the criminal justice system and the public service sector.

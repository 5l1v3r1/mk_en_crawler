ATHENS, Greece -- Firefighters gained the upper hand on Wednesday (August 29th) against blazes that have ravaged large sections of the Peloponnese peninsula and the island of Evia. Thousands of soldiers and firefighters -- helped by aircraft provided by a dozen countries -- managed to contain many of the deadly blazes. They are blamed for at least 62 deaths since Friday. The government of Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis has come under heavy criticism from residents of the affected areas and the opposition over its response to the crisis.

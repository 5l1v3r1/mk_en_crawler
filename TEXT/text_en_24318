ATHENS, Greece -- Former Transport Minister Christos Verelis resigned on Friday (May 8th) as a parliament member representing the main opposition party PASOK, media reported. The catalyst was the launch of a corruption investigation into the purchase of 140 trolley buses in 2001, when he was transport minister. The Athens-Piraeus Electric Bus Company (ILPAP) bought the vehicles from the German truck manufacturer MAN AG, a firm that German authorities are investigating for graft. Verelis explained he resigned to aid the investigation. (ANA-MPA, Kathimerini, AP - 08/05/09)

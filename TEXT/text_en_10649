SKOPJE, Macedonia -- US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld reaffirmed Washington's support for the NATO integration bids of Macedonia and the other two signatories of the Adriatic Charter -- Albania and Croatia -- during his visit to Skopje on Monday (11 October). At a news conference following talks with President Branko Crvenkovski and Prime Minister Hari Kostov, Rumsfeld said his tour of the region was aimed at encouraging NATO membership-oriented reforms in these countries. Amid concerns regarding next month's referendum on decentralisation laws in Macedonia, Rumsfeld stressed the need for full implementation of the Ohrid Peace Agreement.

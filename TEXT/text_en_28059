TIRANA, Albania -- Five Turkish warships with 1,125 troops onboard will enter Albania on Wednesday (June 23rd). Three will anchor in Durres, while the others head to Vlora. Last month, parliament adopted a law allowing the entry "to carry out joint training manoeuvres with Albanian maritime troops". The decision prompted neighbouring Greece to put its security system on alert. So far, the warships have stopped in nine countries to signal Turkey's willingness to assist in fighting illegal trafficking and in emergency situations in NATO countries.

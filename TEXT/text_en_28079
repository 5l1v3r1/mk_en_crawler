PODGORICA, Montenegro -- A man who attacked the leader of the main opposition Movement for Changes (PzP), Nebojsa Medojevic, in February was fined 900 euros on Tuesday (April 20th). The defendant did not appear in court, calling the proceedings a "farce". Nenad Micunovic assaulted Medojevic because he had allegedly offended his family. He warned the politician "to stop mentioning the name of Branislav Micunovic", a wealthy businessman that the PzP leader has described as "the most powerful person" in Montenegro, who allegedly controlled the police.

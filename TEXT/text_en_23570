PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Many problems remain unaddressed in Kosovo 18 months after the country declared its independence, according to analysis by the German foundation Friedrich Ebert Stiftung. Local media reports Tuesday (July 28th) quoted the assessment, which described Kosovo as an "unfinished" state with limited sovereignty and a de facto split between a Serb north and predominantly Albanian south. Neither UNMIK nor EULEX are able to prevent this partition, the report added. The analysis criticised work by EULEX, arguing the mission has achieved only modest progress and is repeating mistakes made by UNMIK in the past.
In other news Monday, Kosovo has confirmed its first case of swine flu. The patient is a nine-year old British boy, who arrived in Pristina earlier this month. He is said to be in good condition. (Koha Ditore, Express, Telegrafi, Kosova Sot - 28/07/09; Telegrafi -27/07/09)

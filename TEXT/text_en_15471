ISTANBUL, Turkey -- The High Criminal Court in Istanbul rejected on Tuesday (25 July) a request by Abdullah Ocalan for a retrial, upholding the life sentence given the former leader of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party. Media reports Wednesday say Ocalan's lawyers had approached the High Criminal Court with the retrial request after the European Court of Human Rights ruled last year that Ocalan had not received a fair trial during the first proceedings against him. 
In other news, Alparslan Arslan, the main suspect in the 17 May shootings of judges at the Council of State, was hospitalised on Wednesday. Prison authorities say he complained of health issues and was refusing to eat, fearing that he might be poisoned. His trial is set to begin on 11 August. (Sabah, Zaman - 27/07/06; Zaman - 26/07/06)

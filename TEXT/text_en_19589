SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The government will expel a Syrian-born Islamic fighter with suspected ties to terrorist groups. Imad al-Husini, also known as Abu Hamza, fought on the Muslim side during the 1992-1995 conflict and was granted BiH citizenship. He is currently vice-president of the Bosnian Mujahidin veterans' organisation. Police officials say he will be deported within two weeks to neighbouring Croatia because he entered BiH from there. Al-Husini says his life would be in danger if he is sent back to Syria. The BiH government has established a special commission to re-examine citizenship granted to thousands of foreigners during and after the conflict. Several hundred cases have been revoked so far.

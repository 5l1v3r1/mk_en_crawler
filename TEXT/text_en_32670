PRIJEDOR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR personnel have cleared out an illegal arms depot Prijedor police found late last week, according to a report Sunday (22 December). Police found three mortars and dozens of shells in an abandoned bunker in the village of Gornja Dragotinja. The Prijedor civil protection department asked SFOR for help, since local authorities were not in a position to transport or destroy the weapons. (RTRS - 22/12/02; SRNA, BBC - 21/12/02)

MOSCOW, Russia -- Bulgarian and Greek delegations are in Moscow for trilateral negotiations on a major regional oil pipeline project. The talks opened Wednesday (26 January) and are aimed at drafting a political agreement on construction of the pipeline, which will connect Bulgaria's port of Bourgas and Greece's Alexandroupolis. Objections from Russia have delayed the project repeatedly. (Dnevnik - 26/01/05; Mediapool, Itar-Tass, MPA - 25/01/05)

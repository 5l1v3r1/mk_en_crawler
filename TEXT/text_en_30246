BELGRADE, Serbia -- European Parliament (EP) member Tanja Fajon has warned that the EU could restore visas for Serbia and other countries from the region due to the large number of bogus asylum seekers. In an interview with the Belgrade-based daily Vecernje Novisti on Monday (February 21st), she recalled that the European Commission had established a special mechanism to monitor implementation of visa liberalisation requirements by countries from the region. According to her, in case of abuses, the visa-free regime could be temporarily frozen. (B92, Nezavisne Novine, Beta - 21/02/11)

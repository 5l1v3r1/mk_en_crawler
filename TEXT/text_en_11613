NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos urged Turkey on Tuesday (22 March) to sign a protocol that would extend Ankara's customs union with the EU to the Union's ten new members, including Cyprus. This is one of the EU's conditions for launching accession talks with Ankara on 3 October. Turkey currently does not maintain diplomatic relations with Cyprus. Papadopoulos made his remarks before leaving for Brussels and meetings with EU officials. (AFP - 22/03/05)

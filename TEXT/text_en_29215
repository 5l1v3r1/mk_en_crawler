BUCHAREST, Romania -- The majority in the Deputies Chamber on Tuesday (October 5th) voted for the National Union for the Progress of Romania (UNPR) to become an official parliamentary group, according to sources quoted by local media. While the two ruling parties backed the idea, the opposition maintains it is illegal, since only parties or groups that win a minimum 5% of election votes have the right to parliamentary seats. Therefore, the Deputies Chamber had to modify its operating rules in order to include the UNPR. The UNPR will have the right to funding and positions within parliamentary committees, increasing its power. Some speculate that the move was driven by an upcoming no-confidence vote. The two main opposition parties -- the Social Democratic Party and the National Liberal Party -- recently announced they would initiate it together this month, over the government's austerity measures.

TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi on Tuesday (April 13th) ordered the construction of two cemeteries for Greek soldiers killed during World War II, despite strong parliamentary opposition. The provision includes research, exhumation and identification of the remains of soldiers killed on Albanian territory, and their re-burial in the two cemeteries. About 1,200 soldiers are believed to have been killed between 1940 and 1941, when Italy and Greece fought on Albanian territory. The measure faced sharp criticism from the opposition and associations defending the rights of Albanians expelled from Greece during the 20th century. They insisted the government should first address their claims. (Lajmifundit, Shekulli, Alsat, Top News - 13/04/10)

PARIS, France -- Turkey should not be accepted into the ranks of the EU, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said in a television interview Thursday (September 20th) in which he called for a "true partnership" with the predominantly Muslim-populated country. "I do not believe that Turkey belongs in Europe, and for a simple reason, which is that it is in Asia Minor," Sarkozy told the TFI and France 2 television stations. "What I wish to offer Turkey is a true partnership with Europe ... not integration with Europe," he added. Foreign Minister Bernard Couchner said in an interview with a French radio station Thursday that he is trying to persuade Sarkozy otherwise. "I believe that Mr. President needs to change his mind about Turkey and I have a part to play in this," Couchner said, adding he plans to visit Turkey early next month.

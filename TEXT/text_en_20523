BELGRADE, Serbia -- Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic said on Friday (February 8th) that there is growing information to suggest that Pristina will declare independence unilaterally on February 17th. At a meeting with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana' adviser Stefan Lene, Samardzic said that the signing of any agreement between Serbia and the EU would mean that Serbia accepts Kosovo's independence, something Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica would never do.
Meanwhile, Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said on Friday that while the date has been set, it will not be announced until the province secure EU support. Thaci estimated that 100 countries are ready to recognise independence the moment it is declared.
Pristina-based newspaper Koha Ditore reports on Sunday that the declaration will be co-ordinated with foreign diplomatic missions in Kosovo. Besides the independence declaration, the document will also express support for the EU's planned police mission in the province. 
In other news, the Pristina-based Zeri newspaper reported on Saturday that a parliament representing the Serbs in Kosovo will be established on Friday in the northern part of Mitrovica. Kosovo Albanian leaders in Pristina oppose the option. (Koha Ditore, B92, Beta - 10/02/08; Blic, Zeri, Makfax - 09/02/08; RTS, AFP, Reuters, Top-Channel, MIA - 08/02/08)

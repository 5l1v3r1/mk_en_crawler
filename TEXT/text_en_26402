SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The recently-appointed cabinet of Prime Minister Boyko Borissov decided on Wednesday (August 12th) to set up a council headed by the finance minister that will oversee EU funds. It will also include the ministers of interior, regional development, transport, agriculture, labour, economy, environment and foreign affairs. The council will be responsible for all EU-funded programmes, including pre-accession ones. In addition, a secretariat will be established within the finance ministry, which will handle operational responsibilities related to co-ordination and will advise government institutions about the absorption of EU funds. The Union froze funding for months after uncovering pervasive fraud and mismanagement in Bulgaria. (Dnevnik, BNT, Mediapool - 12/08/09)

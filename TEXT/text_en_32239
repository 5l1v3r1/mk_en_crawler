PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- On Thursday (7 November), UNMIK chief Michael Steiner abolished a parliament resolution related to Kosovo's status. The resolution, passed hours earlier by ethnic Albanian lawmakers, was intended to annul the preamble of the Constitutional Chapter of Serbia and Montenegro, which describes Kosovo as part of Serbia. Albanian Foreign Minister Ilir Meta weighed in as well, arguing that determining Kosovo's status is "not within the competence and duty of those who work out the Serbia-Montenegro Constitution." Steiner was not convinced. He reminded lawmakers that Kosovo is governed under UN Resolution 1244, and that neither Pristina nor Belgrade are entitled to make decisions on its status.
Meanwhile, UN Commission for Human Rights special representative Jose Cutileiro said Thursday that the situation of non-Albanians in Kosovo was still "far from good." He acknowledged progress was made following Serb participation in the general elections, but urged for more measures to help displaced persons return to their homes.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday (April 22nd) said he is committed to implementing two peace protocols aimed at normalising Ankara's ties with Armenia. "As we have earlier stated numerous times, we are loyal to the protocols, their essence and spirit, as well as their implementation," Erdogan said. Earlier in the day, Armenia's parliamentary majority announced it will freeze ratification of the accords until Ankara agrees to negotiate "without preconditions and in a reasonable timeframe". The two protocols on establishing diplomatic ties and reopening the border between the two countries were signed in October. However, ratification in the two parliaments has been dragging over the so-called Armenian "genocide" issue and Turkey's support for Azerbaijan in its dispute with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Attorneys for nine people charged with deporting Bosniak civilians from Montenegro in 1992 asked on Friday (November 5th) to call Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic and Deputy Prime Minister Svetozar Marovic as witnesses. At the time, Marovic was a secretary general of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists. Prosecutors did not object to the request, leaving the court to decide on the matter. Earlier in the week, the government relieved former President Momir Bulatovic of his obligation to keep a state secret while testifying at the trial. Nine former police officers are charged with crimes against civilians for handing over 79 Bosniaks to Bosnian Serbs. Most of the Muslims, who escaped to Montenegro during the 1992-1995 conflict, later died at the hands of the Serbs. (Blic, Tanjug, FoNet, TV Vijesti - 05/11/10)

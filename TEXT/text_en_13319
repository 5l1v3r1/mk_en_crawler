SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Police in the Federation of BiH have arrested another terrorism suspect, thought to be linked with four others -- one Turkish citizen, one Swedish citizen and two BiH citizens -- previously detained on suspicion of plotting attacks. According to an interior ministry statement Friday (25 November), police have discovered a large amount of explosives that allegedly belonged to the detained men. 
In other news, a Bosnian Serb convicted by the UN war crimes tribunal has been transferred to Sweden to serve his 10-year sentence. Miroslav Deronjic, the former head of the Serb crisis headquarters in the municipality of Bratunac, pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the attack and demolition of the eastern BiH village of Glogova and the murders of local Muslim civilians in May 1993. He was arrested by NATO peacekeepers in BiH and extradited to the UN tribunal in the summer of 2002.

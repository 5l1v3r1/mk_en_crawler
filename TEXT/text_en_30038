ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan objected to the idea of imposing sanctions on Libya late Wednesday (February 23rd), which was raised by the EU amid the violent suppression of protestors opposing Muammar Gaddafi's regime. According to Erdogan, the move would only hurt the Libyan people. The statement came during Turkey's ongoing evacuation of its citizens from Libya. The foreign ministry says that so far, over 7,000 Turkish citizens and over 50 foreign nationals have been evacuated by Turkish authorities. At least one Turkish citizen has been killed in the unrest. (Hurriyet, Press TV, Haber X - 24/02/11)

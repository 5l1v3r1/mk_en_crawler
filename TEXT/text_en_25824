SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government decided on Friday (September 18th) to remove the five-pointed star from its national coat of arms and will send its proposal to parliament soon. Any change requires approval by two- thirds of all 120 members, a majority the government has. Officials say the move aims to indicate that Macedonia is breaking all ties with its communist past. Macedonia's current coat of arms -- a sun, water and mountains, a band of traditional embroideries and a five-pointed star on top -- was created in 1946.

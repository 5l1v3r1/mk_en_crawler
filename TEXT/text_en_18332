BELGRADE, Serbia -- The country's special organised crime prosecutor announced on Tuesday (March 13th) that two associates of Slobodan Milosevic have been indicted for embezzlement and pocketing millions of dollars in government funds. Mihalj Kertes, Milosevic's customs chief, and Jovan Zebic, a senior government official, allegedly transferred large amounts of money to dozens of offshore accounts in Cyprus and elsewhere in the early 1990s, when Yugoslavia was subject to UN sanctions. Milosevic, who died last year, and his former deputy, Nikola Sainovic, who is standing trial for war crimes in The Hague, were named in the indictment as ringleaders of the conspiracy. There are no immediate plans to prosecute Sainovic. 
Elsewhere Tuesday, the retrial of 16 former Serb paramilitary members, charged in connection with the Ovcara war crimes case, began at the Belgrade regional court. They are charged with the 1991 massacre of some 200 Croat prisoners of war following the capture of Vukovar. All but two were convicted in their original trial last year, but the Serbian Supreme Court ordered a retrial. (Blic, Danas - 14/03/07; AP, Beta, B92, FoNet, RTS - 13/03/07)

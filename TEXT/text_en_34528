ANKARA, Turkey -- The High Election Board announced on Sunday (5 October) that it has decided to turn down a request to annul the general elections held in November 2002. The board also rejected requests to recalculate the number of votes in some provinces. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he expected the decision, calling it "common sense". Turkey will be holding local elections within six months.
Also Sunday, in a televised interview, Erdogan insisted there are no disputes between the government and the military, or between President Ahmet Necdet Sezer and himself. He said he missed last week's regular meeting with Sezer due to travel. (Hurriyet, Milliyet - 06/10/03; Anadolu Agency, NTV, TRT 2 - 05/10/03)

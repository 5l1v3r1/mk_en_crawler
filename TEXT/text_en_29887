PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Foreign Minister Enver Hoxhaj rejected on Sunday (May 22nd) the model of two Germanys as a possibility for Kosovo and Serbia. In an interview with the newspaper Koha Ditore, Hoxhaj described it as a Cold War model, which cannot be an example for improving relations in the Balkans. Serbian President Boris Tadic had mentioned the idea last week, amid growing talk of partition by Serbian government officials. Moreover, Serbia's Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic said that this idea should be discussed in the ongoing dialogue. Leader of the Democratic Party of Albanians in Presevo Valley, Ragmi Mustafa, is on board, but says it should happen through an exchange of territories.

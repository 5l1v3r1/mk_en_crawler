SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Early Friday (21 March), police arrested two Iraqi citizens who allegedly threatened the security of western diplomatic missions in the country. They were released after consultations with the federal prosecutor. But the interior ministry added that it would continue to investigate the suspects and would soon file criminal charges against them.
Meanwhile, Romania's Foreign Ministry announced Saturday that is increasing surveillance on Iraqi citizens living within its borders and has expelled several of them. But it denied reports that the government supports a US request to expel Iraqi diplomats. Bulgaria's Foreign Ministry has asked Washington to provide more information about that request before it decides what to do. (Hina, Fena, AFP, Rompres, bTV, Sega - 22/03/03)

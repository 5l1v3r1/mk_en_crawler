TIRANA, Albania -- The government plans to file a complaint with the European Civil Aviation over an incident involving 110 passengers whose flight to Italy was unexpectedly diverted to Slovakia on Sunday (January 17th). The Civil Aviation office confirmed on Monday that the passengers were eventually flown to their original destination, Bologna, after spending 16 hours in a hotel near the Bratislava airport. "It is a very difficult case in the history of Albania's and international civil aviation," said Ervin Mazniku, of the aviation office. The same office in Slovakia will ask Air Slovakia for an explanation. The airline, meanwhile, said it will seek the maximum punishment for the pilot involved. Though the reason for the diversion remains unclear, local media reported that the Slovak crew was most likely protesting unpaid wages. (Lajmifundit, Top Channel, BBC, Ora News - 18/01/10)

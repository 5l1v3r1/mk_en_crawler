VIENNA, Austria -- Miklos Haraszti, the OSCE representative on freedom of the media, has welcomed recent adjustments to the Turkish Penal Code but said more must be done. On 23 May, his office issued a review of the code, listing provisions that need to be revoked. "Despite some improvements, the amendments do not sufficiently eliminate threats to freedom of expression and to a free press," the office said in a statement Thursday (7 July).

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Prosecutors at the UN war crimes tribunal have appealed the sentences handed down against two former Serb officers involved in the 1991 Vukovar massacre. Former Yugoslav National Army Commander Mile Mrksic and Major Veselin Sljivancanin were convicted of failing to hand nearly 200 Croat prisoners to the Red Cross when the city was taken by Serbian forces. As soon as the army moved out, Serb militia members executed the prisoners. A third defendant, Miroslav Radic, was acquitted in the trial, which ended in September. All three verdicts caused widespread protests in Croatia. The decision by prosecutors to appeal only the sentences, rather than Radic's acquittal, prompted a statement from the Croatian government Tuesday, expressing deep disagreement. Hague prosecutors had initially sought life sentences for all three defendants. (Vecernji list, Vjesnik - 31/10/07; AP, HRT, Index.hr, Beta, B92, HINA - 30/10/07)

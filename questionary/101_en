in the Republic of Macedonia. The Committee, furthermore, gives opinions and proposals for

16/453

Chapter I

resolution of issues in this area, while the Assembly is obligated to review them and decide upon
them. The Committee decides in case of dispute concerning the implementation of the voting
procedure in the Assembly on laws that require majority vote by Representatives in the Assembly
belonging to the non-majority communities in the Republic of Macedonia.
Prerogatives and competences of the Parliament with respect to holding members of the
Executive to account
The Assembly conducts its political control and scrutiny over the Government by way of the
Parliamentary question, inquiry committees, interpellation motions and confidence vote.
Parliamentary question is set at a special sitting held every last Thursday in the month. Inquiry
committees may be established in any area or on any issue of public interest, and their findings
constitute grounds to initiate procedure to determine accountability of public-office holders.
Interpellation motion for the work of the Government and each of its members individually, may be
put forward by at least five Representatives, in writing and with an attached explanation. The
interpellation motion is debated at an Assembly’s sitting. The debate is followed by an adoption of
conclusion that expresses the Assembly’s position on the claims included in the interpellation motion.
A motion of confidence for the Government may be raised by at least 20 Representatives, in writing
and with an attached explanation. The President of the Assembly immediately forwards the
confidence motion to the Representatives, the Government and the President of the Republic. A
confidence motion may be withdrawn until the beginning of the sitting. A confidence motion is
debated at an Assembly’s sitting. The Assembly votes on the motion within three days from its
submission. A vote of non-confidence is adopted by a majority vote of the total number of
Representatives. If a vote of non-confidence in the Government is passed, the Government is obliged
to resign. The Government that was voted non-confidence continues to act until the election of a new
Government. The Assembly decides upon dismissal of a Government’s member, only upon a
proposal of the President of the Government. If the President of the Government proposes dismissal
of more than one-third of the Government’s member, the Assembly decides as if electing a new
Government.
The procedure of impeachment of the President of the Republic' is initiated by the Assembly with a
two-thirds majority vote of all Representatives. The President is accountable for any violation of the
Constitution and laws in exercising his/her rights and duties. (Article 87 of the Constitution of the
Republic of Macedonia) A proposal for initiating the procedure of impeachment may be raised by at
least 30 Representatives, in writing and with an attached explanation. Before deciding, the Assembly
sets up a Committee to assess the existence of reasonable grounds for the proposal. The Committee
shall report to the Assembly. A debate is held on the proposal and on the report, after which the
President of the Republic may give his statement, in writing or orally. If the Assembly votes for the
proposal to initiate procedure to determine the accountability of the President of the Republic, the
President of the Assembly shall immediately submit the proposal to the Constitutional Court which
decides upon the President’s accountability.
Reporting to the Assembly in accordance with legal obligations
Specific bodies, in accordance with the obligations under respective laws, submit reports to the
Assembly. In that sense, the Ombudsman, submits an annual report, that the Assembly examines at
a session attended by the Government members. (Article 36 of the Law on the Ombudsman, “Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 60/03)
The Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia drafts a single annual report on the
operation of all public prosecution offices and submits it for examination to the Assembly (Article 15
of the Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office, “Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
38/04). The Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia is appointed by the Assembly.

Procedure of adoption of laws
Every Representative in the Assembly, the Government and at least 10.000 voters have right to
propose adoption of a law. The procedure of adoption of laws has been stipulated by the Rules of
Procedure. As a rule, laws are adopted in a regular procedure of two readings, namely a proposal to
adopt the law and a draft-law. By exception, the Assembly may decide a law to be additionally
examined as a preliminary draft-law.
A proposal to adopt the law, as the first stage in the procedure (first reading), prior to the debate on it
in the plenary, is debated by the working body responsible for the issues governed by that particular
law, as well as by the Legislative Committee. Working bodies examine the law from the viewpoint of
the need for its adoption, the principles upon which it has been founded, basic relations being
regulated and the manner in which they have been regulated. The Legislative Committee examines
the law from the viewpoint of the need for its adoption and its compliance with the Constitution, as
well as its compliance with the EU legislation. The President of the Assembly forwards to the
Government a proposal to adopt the law that has not been submitted by the Government, requesting
an opinion on it. If the Assembly decides that there is a need to adopt a law, it passes a conclusion
approving of the proposal to adopt the law.
A draft-law, being the second stage in the procedure (second reading), shall be submitted within 60
days from the day of the conclusion of the first stage. The provisions governing the first stage in the
Rules of Procedure and its examination in the working bodies and in the Legislative Committee are
accordingly applied to the draft-laws. In the course of the debate on a draft-law, discussion and vote
is also held on the amendments that may be submitted by a Representative, a working body, the
Government and at least 10.000 voters, within timeframes prescribed by the Rules of Procedure. The
Government may also express its position on amendments it has not proposed.

18/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

The Rules of Procedure also provide for a shortened procedure for adoption of laws. Namely, if the
proposed law is not a complex or an extensive one, upon a proposal by its proposer, the Assembly
may decide that both stages of the law are debated at the same sitting (the proposal to adopt the law
and the draft-law).
If the law governs a complex or an extensive subject, the Assembly may decide that, prior to the
draft-law, the proposer prepares a preliminary draft-law that shall be examined in accordance with
the same procedure as the proposal to adopt the law. The Assembly may decide that a public debate
is carried out on a preliminary draft-law of broader significance.
By exception, a law may be adopted in an urgent procedure, only in cases specified by the Rules of
Procedure (when necessary in order to prevent or eliminate major disturbances in the economy,
when required by the security and defence of the country, or in cases of major natural disasters,
epidemic diseases or other emergency conditions). Attached to the proposal to adopt the law in an
urgent procedure, the proposer shall submit the draft-law. The Assembly, without a debate, shall
decide upon the justifiability of the proposal for an urgent procedure. If the proposal has not been
submitted by the Government, before deciding, the Assembly shall request an opinion of the
Government. Prior to or in the course of the debate, the Assembly may request an urgent opinion by
a working body or the Legislative Committee, each within its responsibilities.
Procedure of adoption of laws related to the аcquis
The procedures explained above apply to the adoption of laws related to the аcquis, as well. This
means that these laws, depending on the character and the extensiveness of the issues being
regulated, may be adopted in a regular (two stages), in a shortened (one stage) or in an urgent
procedure. In other words, procedures stipulated in the Rules of Procedure do not pose an obstacle
to their timely adoption.
The acquis-related laws, depending on the issues being regulated, are debated by the competent
working bodies. The Legislative Committee examines the law from the viewpoint of its compliance
with the Constitution and the legal system of the country, as well as from the viewpoint of its
compliance with the EU legislation. The European Affairs Committee examines issues pertaining to
the compliance of the proposals to adopt laws, i.e. draft-laws with the EU legislation. In addition, this
Committee monitors and provides incentive for the process of approximation of the domestic
legislation with that of the European Union. Furthermore, it proposes measures to enhance the
procedures aimed at the approximation of the legislation and provides opinions and proposals on the
activities of the Assembly’s working bodies.
3. What measures have been taken to allow the use of the Albanian language in the
Parliament? How are they being implemented in practice?
The Rules of Procedure of the Assembly, in accordance with the Constitutional Amendments of 2001
(Amendment V, item 1, paragraph 5), provide that in the work of the Assembly, along with the official
Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet, the Representatives in the Assembly - ethnic
Albanians may use their language at the plenary sessions of the Assembly and at the working
bodies’ sessions.
In order to enable the use of the Albanian language in the work of the Assembly and its working
bodies, the necessary technical pre-conditions have been provided as well as competent staff. The
plenary session hall and the working bodies’ halls have been equipped for simultaneous
interpretation. Five Albanian language translators/interpreters, two Albanian language editors and
two Albanian language proof-readers have been employed in the Assembly’s Staff. In addition, at
least two professional simultaneous interpreters are engaged part-time for the plenary and the
working bodies’ sessions. The Assembly provides continuous training for the translators and
language editors in cooperation with the Albanian Language Department at the Skopje Faculty of
Philology. The funding has been partly provided from domestic sources and partly with the
assistance of the Governments of Belgium and Canada. The Assembly sessions are broadcasted by

19/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

the Public Broadcaster, Macedonian Television (MTV). The third channel of the MTV offers the
audience a possibility to follow the broadcasts of the Assembly's sessions fully in Albanian language.
The complete Albanian translation and language editing of the laws adopted by the Assembly, before
their publication, is performed by separate translation and language editing units in the Assembly
Service. Pursuant to the Law on Publication of the Laws and Other Regulations and Acts in the
Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
56/99 and 43/02), besides in Macedonian, the laws are also published in the Albanian language. For
that purpose, TRADOS text translation software has been installed in the Assembly.
The undertaken technical and other measures have, in the practice, provided for an unobstructed use
of the Albanian language in the work of the Assembly and its working bodies.
4. How many political parties are registered in your country? How many of these are
represented in Parliament? What percentage of parliamentarians are (a) women and (b) from
ethnic minorities?
Article 20 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 1/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), guarantees freedom of association to
citizens, to exercise and protect their political, economic, social, cultural and other rights and
convictions. Citizens may freely establish associations of citizens and political parties join them or
withdraw from them.
The Law on Political Parties (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 76/04) regulates
the mode, terms and procedure for establishing, registering and terminating political parties. Citizens
freely establish political parties in order to exercise and protect their political, economic, social,
cultural and other rights and convictions, in order to participate in the political decision-making
process and to take part in the elections for Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of
Macedonia, the elections for council members and mayors in municipalities and in the City of Skopje.
Members of a political party may only be citizens of the Republic of Macedonia. The work of the
political parties is public and they are organised and operate on a territorial principle.
A political party may be established by at least 500 adults (with a voting right), who are citizens of the
Republic of Macedonia and who have signed a statement for founding of the political party. Fifteen
days before the end of each year, the political party is obliged to submit to the competent court
written evidence, proving that the number of its founders has not been reduced. Member of a political
party may be every citizen of legal age, who has legal capacity and who shall give a statement for
voluntary membership in the political party. Each member may freely withdraw from a political party.
A political party is founded by a Founding Assembly which adopts the party’s founding act, its
programme and statute, and which elects its bodies. The founding act includes the party’s name and
the abbreviated name, the party’s main office, the name of the person authorised for entry in the
court register and the names of its founders, including their personal identification numbers and the
addresses of their permanent residence in the Republic of Macedonia.
A political party programme includes provisions as to the goals and selection of forms and methods
of the political party’s activity. A political party’s statute includes provisions on: the name and the
abbreviated name of the political party; the party’s main office; its political objectives; transparency in
its operation; terms and mode of becoming a party member and termination of membership, as well
as the rights, obligations and responsibilities of its members; representation and termination of the
political party; the party’s bodies, mode of their election and recall, duration of their tenure and
decision making modalities; acquisition and managing of funds; termination of the political party;
property proceedings in case of termination of the political party; property proceedings after the
termination of the political party and the party’s symbols (flag, logo, emblem, etc). A political party
begins its work and acquires the status of a legal entity on the day of its registration in the Court
Register.

C. THE GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION

5. Please provide a description of the structure and functioning of the Government.
Government of the Republic of Macedonia
A fundamental value of the Constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia is the separation of the
state powers into legislative, executive and judicial.
Pursuant to Article 88 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (”Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 1/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), executive power is vested in the
Government, which exercises its rights and duties on the basis and within the framework of the
Constitution and law. The Law on the Government adopted in 2000 (”Official Gazette of the Republic
of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00 and 12/03), determines the organisation and work of the Government. In
accordance with this Law the Government adopted the Rules of Procedure of the Government of the
Republic of Macedonia (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 38/01, 98/02, 9/03,
47/03, 64/03 and 67/03), which specifically determine its internal organisation, manner of operation
and other issues relevant to the functioning of the Government.
The President of the Republic of Macedonia nominates the mandatary to constitute the Government
and is obliged, within 10 days of the constitution of the Assembly, to entrust the mandate for
constituting the Government to a candidate from the party or parties which has/have a majority in the
Assembly. Within 20 days from the day of being entrusted with the mandate, the mandatary submits
a programme to the Assembly and proposes the composition of the Government. The Government is
elected by the Assembly on the proposal of the mandatary and on the basis of the programme by a
majority vote of the total number of the Representatives of the Assembly.
The Government assumes its power on the day of being elected by the Assembly.
The Government is composed of a Prime Minister and Ministers. The present Government of the
Republic of Macedonia is a coalition government and comprises the Social Democratic Union of

responsibilities of civil servants and other public servants have been regulated by a law, by-laws and
by collective agreements.
The Law on Civil Servants first adopted in 2000 (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
Nos. 59/00, 112/00, 34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04 and 69/04), regulates
issues of the status, rights, duties and responsibilities of civil servants, as well as the system of
salaries and allowances for the civil servants. In accordance with the Law, a Civil Servants Agency
has been established as an independent state body carrying out technical, administrative and other
operations related to the status, rights, duties and responsibilities of civil servants. The Law does not
specifically regulate issues of certain rights that are uniformly regulated for both the state and public
sector in the general provisions on labour relations, such as: pension and disability insurance, health
insurance, unemployment insurance, vacations and leaves, protection at the workplace, and
termination of employment.
The status, rights, duties and responsibilities of specific categories of civil servants are regulated by
other laws. The particularities that differentiate these civil servants from other civil servants are
related to the performance of duties, which in turn require special rules on employment selection,
promotion and other elements. Hence, these are generally a characteristic of the career systems as
opposed to the system of jobs applicable for the civil servants in accordance with the Law on Civil
Servants. The provisions in the Law on Civil Servants do not refer to: military and civil personnel in
the Army of the Republic of Macedonia; uniformed employees in the Ministry of the Interior;
employees in penitentiary and correctional institutions; employees in the forest, judicial and financial
police and the Customs Administration; employees with special duties and authorities in the Ministry
of the Defence, the Ministry of the Interior, the Intelligence Agency, the Public Revenue Office, and
the Customs Administration; the authorised state auditors and persons performing state audit at the
State Audit Office; as well as employees in the Civil Aviation Authority who perform duties and tasks
of importance to the safety of aviation.
Law on Civil Servants
The definition of the term civil servant in the Republic of Macedonia has been formulated on the basis
of a functional and organisational criterion (the type and character of operations and duties
performed by the civil servant in the administrative body he/she works for).
According to the functional criterion, a civil servant is a person who performs professional, normative,
executive, and administrative-supervising activities, and decides upon administrative matters in
accordance with the Constitution and law. According to the organisational criterion, a civil servant is
a person who performs duties in the state administrative bodies (ministries, bodies within ministries,
autonomous administrative bodies and organisations within the executive branch); in local self-

32/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

government units and the City of Skopje; in administrative services of the Assembly, of the President,
of the Government, and of the Constitutional Court and Supreme Court; in basic and appellate
courts; in the Judicial Council of the Republic; in the Ombudsman’s Office; in the Public Prosecutor's
Office; in the Civil Servants Agency; and the State Audit Office.
Depending on the official tasks they perform, civil servants have been classified in three groups:
managerial civil servants, expert civil servants and expert-administrative civil servants. The
managerial and expert civil servants have a high education while expert-administrative ones have a
post-secondary or secondary education.
Within these three groups, civil servants are divided into 13 positions. Managerial civil servants may
acquire the following positions: secretary general i.e. state secretary; state advisor; head of sector;
assistant to the head of sector and head of unit. Expert civil servants have the following positions:
advisor, senior associate, associate and junior associate. The group of expert-administrative civil
servants includes the following positions: independent officer, senior officer, officer and junior officer.
Within the municipal administration there are no positions of a secretary general and a state
secretary.
This classification provides for a uniform structure of positions in the bodies of administrative,
executive and judicial branches, as well as in local self-government units. At the same time there is a
distinction between the political and professional positions in the state administration, as well as a
clear division of employees with a status of civil servants and employees without such status – and
these are persons performing administrative-technical or assistance duties (couriers, drivers, guards,
sanitary workers, etc.) to whom general provisions on labour relations apply.
Employment of civil servants
Civil servants are recruited in an open and transparent manner, through a public vacancy
announcement and a requirement to undergo a professional examination. There are two exceptions
to this rule pertaining to the position of secretary general and state secretary, as well as to what is
known as horizontal mobility of civil servants.
Selection procedures and employment of civil servants are based on two basic principles: the
constitutional principle of equal work opportunities and the merit principle – selection on the basis of
capabilities. In addition, the principle of equitable representation of citizens belonging to communities
is applied to all positions as determined by the Law, without contravening the criteria on expertise
and competence.
The public vacancy announcements for civil servants are publicised by the Civil Servants Agency
(hereinafter: the CSA) at least in two daily newspapers of which at least one published in an official
language spoken by at least 20% of the citizens. The public announcement contains general and
special conditions for the specific advertised position.
The Law on Civil Servants defines six mandatory general conditions that need to be met by every
applicant for a position in the state administration: to be a citizen of the Republic of Macedonia; to be
of legal age; to have adequate level of education as required for the position; to have the necessary
work experience, except for the positions of junior associate and junior officer; not to be sentenced to
a security measure of prohibition to perform a certain profession, activity or duty; and to be of good
general health capability.
In addition, internal acts on systematisation of posts in administrative bodies employing civil servants
determine special employment conditions related to the specific needs for the performance of a
concrete post. They generally relate to the type of required education, knowledge of a foreign
language, IT knowledge and other additional skills required for the post.
Applicants who meet the general and specific conditions also undergo a vocational exam. On the
basis of their results and educational background, the CSA prepares a list of at least five successful
candidates and submits it to the commission for the implementation of the employment procedure

33/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

which has been established by the administrative body offering employment. Within the five-member
commission of the administrative body, members of non-majority communities must be equitably
represented.
In the event that the CSA cannot compose a list of at least five candidates, the procedure is repeated
from the beginning (with a new public vacancy announcement). If after the repeated procedure the
Agency cannot make a list of at least five candidates, a list may be made with less than five
candidates.
The Commission, on the basis of the list, shortlists three candidates for each position and submits it
to both the secretary general and state secretary or to the official in charge of the administrative body
in which a secretary general or a state secretary is not appointed, who makes the final selection.
Dissatisfied candidates have a right to lodge a complaint against the decision for selection within
eight days from the day they have been informed in writing. The CSA must decide on the complaint
within 15 days from the day it has received the complaint. The complaint defers the execution of the
decision.
After the completion of the selection procedure, the secretary general, the state secretary or the
official in charge of the administrative body in which a secretary general or a state secretary is not
appointed, adopts a decision for employment of a civil servant.
The employment procedure of civil servants for the positions of junior associate and junior officer
differs in that they do not undergo a vocational exam. After the selection they are required to undergo
an internship of six and 12 months for expert-administrative and expert positions respectively. In the
course of interning they are monitored and evaluated in accordance with the Rulebook on the Mode,
Procedure and Criteria for the Execution of the Vocational and Intern Exam (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 59/01). One month prior to the expiry of this period, the intern takes an
intern exam before the Commission that has selected him or her for the position. If the intern passes
the exam he/she is employed in the position for which the announcement has been published. If not,
his or her employment is terminated.
The employment procedure is finalised by giving and signing an oath. The oath is binding and if the
civil servant refuses to give or sign an oath, it is deemed that the employment was not made. The
signed oath is kept in the civil servant’s file.
Secretaries general who are highest in rank in the Assembly, the President's Office, the Government,
the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, the Judicial Council of the Republic, the Ombudsman’s
Office, the State Audit Office, the Civil Servants Agency and the Public Prosecutor’s Office, are
appointed by these bodies from the ranks of managerial civil servants. State secretaries have been
envisioned for the ministries and they are appointed by the Government upon the minister’s proposal
from the ranks of managerial civil servants in the ministries and other state administrative bodies.
The term of office of the secretaries general and state secretaries is the same as the term of office of
the body appointing them, i.e. of the official in charge of the body.
In cases of horizontal mobility, the civil servant may be transferred from one to another body to a
position of an equal rank without a public announcement, if the Secretary General, State Secretary or
the heads of these bodies agree and when the needs of the service necessitate such transfer, upon
prior opinion of the Agency.
Rights and duties of civil servants
The rights and duties of civil servants are defined by the Law on Civil Servants. An important
segment of the Law is the legal guarantee for the protection of the civil servant's rights deriving from
his/her employment. The civil servant has a right to request protection before the competent court,
trade union or other state body in exercising these rights. The Law on Civil Servants regulates the
following rights: the right to political activity; the right to professional training and development; the
right to protection; the right to found or be a member of a trade union; the right to strike; the right to

34/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

salary and other allowances; the right to vacation and leave (this right in the Republic of Macedonia
is equal for civil servants and other employees in the public and private sectors).
With regard to the right to political activity the Law prescribes that the civil servant may be an active
member in a political party; however, by exercising this right he/she must not put in question his/her
status of a civil servant, or the performance of the official duties related to that status. In addition, the
civil servant may not wear or place party symbols in the office.
In order to exercise their economic and social rights, civil servants have the right to establish trade
unions and to be their members under the terms and in a manner defined by law, and they have the
right to strike. When exercising their right to strike, civil servants are obliged to ensure a minimum of
uninterrupted execution of functions of the body, the necessary level in exercising of citizens’ and
legal entities’ rights and interests and the execution of ratified international agreements. The minister,
or the head of the body, by way of regulation, defines the manner of exercise of the functions of the
body during a strike, as well as the number of civil servants who are obliged to work to execute those
functions so as to meet the conditions for ensuring the minimum of uninterrupted execution of
functions and the necessary level in exercising of citizens’ and legal persons’ rights and interests and
the execution of ratified international agreements. During a strike the civil servant is entitled to a
salary in the amount of 60% of the salary he/she had received the month before.
Civil servants are obliged to perform their duties conscientiously, professionally, efficiently, orderly
and timely, in accordance with the Constitution and law. Furthermore, the civil servant is obliged to
perform his/her activities impartially and without the influence of political parties; he/she may not be
guided by his/her own political beliefs or personal financial interests; he/she must refrain from misuse
of authorisations and the status of a civil servant and protect the reputation of the body.
The civil servant is obliged to execute the orders of the minister, of the head of the body, or of the
immediate superior civil servant and to act upon them in accordance with the Constitution, law or
other regulation. However, if the civil servant deems that the order he/she has received is not in
accordance with the Constitution, law or other regulation, he/she is obliged to point out that fact to the
person that issued the order. The civil servant shall act upon a repeated order unless he/she deems
that its execution would constitute a criminal offence. If the civil servant does not warn the immediate
superior civil servant, the civil servant and his/her immediate superior civil servant shall be liable for
execution.
The protection of data defined as a state or official secret is one of the responsibilities of the civil
servant, who is obliged to keep the secret in a mode and under conditions determined by law or other
regulation. The obligation for keeping an official secret is valid for a period of three years after the
termination of the service. On the other hand, the civil servant is, in accordance with law, obliged to
provide information upon request of the citizens required for exercise of their rights and interests,
except the information classified as state or official secret.
The Code of Ethics for Civil Servants (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 96/01and
16/04) determines the manner of civil servants’ behaviour and conduct in order to secure the respect
of principles of legality, professional integrity, efficiency, and loyalty during the execution of their
official duties.
Promotion of civil servants
The state administration system in the Republic of Macedonia, pursuant to the Law on Civil Servants,
has been defined as a system of jobs in which promotion is not automatic. In such a system, a
prerequisite for "promotion" of the civil servant is a vacant position of a higher rank than that of the
civil servant. However, the procedure for filling of vacancies is in fact a procedure for a new
employment (public announcement and a procedure of competition), as defined above.

System of Salaries and Allowances
The salary of a civil servant consists of a general and exceptional component. The general
component consists of: basic salary, position supplement and career supplement. The exceptional
component consists of: demanding job supplement and non-regular supplement (overtime work).
The basic salary paid to a civil servant provides for rewarding of the appropriate educational level of
the job he/she is assigned to, and rewarding of the work experience, regardless of where such
experience has been acquired. Hence, the education level is valued with an adequate number of
points: higher education – 200 points; post-secondary – 150 points and secondary – 100 points. The
work experience is valued in amount of 0.5% of the part of the basic salary that rewards the
educational level for each year of work experience entered upon, but not higher than of 20%. The
position supplement is valued as follows:

The value of a point for the salaries of civil servants employed in the state administration is
determined every year by a Governmental decision. The value of the point for 2004 was 40.10 MKD
and is the same for 2005. The value of a point for the salaries of civil servants employed in the
municipal administration is determined every year by a decision for the execution of the Budget in
every municipality, and in 2004 it was not higher than 40.10 MKD.
Civil servants in every position except for the secretary general and the state secretary, is entitled to
a career supplement. This approach in the salary system gives an opportunity for the so-called
horizontal career of civil servants. Namely, the civil servant under special terms determined by law
may be entitled to a higher salary for the same position. In other words, the civil servants may
advance with regard to the amount of his or her salary, but not in the hierarchical sense. The
horizontal career has four levels: level A, level B, level C and level D. Level A is acquired after three
years of work experience as a civil servant and is 5% of the position supplement. Level B is acquired
after three years of work experience at the level A, and is 10% of the career supplement. Level C is
acquired after three years of work experience at level B, and is 15% of the career supplement. Level
D is acquired after three years of work experience at level C, and is 20% of the career supplement.
By exception, when a civil servant is evaluated with the mark "outstanding" for two consecutive
years, he/she may be promoted in the career to a higher level one year earlier than defined. Hence,
this element in the salary of the civil servant depends on his or her length of experience in the civil
service and the results from his or her work recorded in the annual assessment.

36/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

Civil servants, apart from the right to salary supplements pursuant to the general labour relations
provisions, are also entitled to other allowances: travelling, daily and other expenses for business
trips; expenses made by usage of personal vehicles for office purposes; expenses for life separate
from the family; expenses for change of the place of residence; transport to and from work; food
expenses; expenses for field work; funeral expenses in case of death of a civil servant or of a
member of his/her family; damages suffered in natural disasters, and expenses for a long illness of a
civil servant.
The system of salaries and allowances for civil servants entered into force in April 2004, but only
partially (the basic salary component without the career supplement). Its full implementation shall
start on 1 April 2006. The implementation of the salary system and its basic component is done in a
period of two years in which the amount of current salaries is levelled with the amount as defined by
the Law.
Due to limited budgetary resources, the levelling of salaries through the partial implementation of the
salary system is implemented in stages, in a mode determined by the Guidelines for the Mode of
Definition and Payment of Salaries for Civil Servants (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
No. 31/04).
The nominal value of the basic salary that will be paid in March 2006 is calculated so that the total
points for the basic salary (the points for the respective level of education and the points for the
working experience) and the points for position supplement are multiplied by the value of the point as
determined by a Decision of the Government, pursuant to the Law on Civil Servants.
Budgetary beneficiaries are required to file an F-2 form to the Ministry of Finance, which contains:
personal identification number; name and last name; ethnicity; position; level of education required
for the position as established by the act on systematisation of posts; length of work experience;
salary amount not including the points for work experience; the points for work experience; as well
as other data. On the basis of submitted data in the F-2 form, the Ministry of Finance calculates the
monthly amount of increase or decrease of salary for each civil servant.
The starting salary of the civil servant employed in the period when salaries are levelled is
determined in accordance with the amount of the salary of a civil servant with the same position
(employed in the same body) paid in the preceding month, including the points for work experience.
The levelling of the salary of a civil servant who is transferred from another administrative body in the
period of levelling continues from the calculation already done in the body where the civil servant had
worked.
The levelling i.e. decompression of salaries is a correction of individual salaries of civil servants in a
period of 24 months until the final levelling of the salaries in the civil service has been achieved, with
the respect of the principle "equal pay for work of equal value” and the equitable remuneration in
accordance to specified criteria.
Assessment of civil servants
The assessment of civil servants aims to strengthen the responsibility of civil servants and improve
the quality of their work and the services they offer. The assessment system was first introduced in
2004 and hence the first assessments shall be given in the first quarter of 2005, as prescribed by the
Law.
Pursuant to the Law, the assessment of managerial civil servants is carried out by the official in
charge of the body, while the assessment of expert and expert-administrative servants is carried out
by the immediate superior of the civil servant, i.e. the head of the sector.
The system also envisages that the assessment should be carried out for all civil servants, except for
the secretary general and the state secretary. The assessment is carried out on the basis of
monitoring the work of the civil servant and on the basis of several other standardised criteria: expert

37/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

knowledge and capability, efforts, results, creativity and conscientiousness. The civil servant must be
assessed with one of the following grades: “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” and “unsatisfactory.”
The assessment is a basis for the civil servant’s exercise of certain rights. On the one hand,
consecutive positive grades provide for a speedier promotion of the civil servant in the horizontal
career levels, resulting in a higher salary. On the other, one negative grade is a basis for
reassignment to a lower position and a decrease in salary, while two consecutive or three negative
grades in a period of five years are a basis for termination of employment by force of law. The two
types of consequences should provide for a speedier development of a professional, competent and
efficient administration in which poor quality of work and services to the detriment of citizens’ rights
and interests would not be tolerated.
Professional development and training of civil servants
A specialised institution for training of the civil servants has not been established in the Republic of
Macedonia. This, however, does not mean that the question of training has been neglected in the
legislation or that training of civil servants is lacking. On the contrary, the Law on Civil Servants sets
forth a framework which defines the system of training and which rests upon the basic principles it
determines - that every civil servant has a right and duty to be trained on the basis of annual
programmes adopted by respective bodies and financed from the Budget of the Republic of
Macedonia.
The CSA, pursuant to the Law, is competent to coordinate activities pertaining to the expert training
of civil servants as well as to promote the efficient and effective operations of civil servants. In that
respect, the CSA has prepared a document titled “The System of Training of Civil Servants in the
Republic of Macedonia,” which defines the basic principles of the training policy, the division of roles
between the CSA and every administrative body employing civil servants, the structures for
coordination, the funding model and how to provide training.
In the last three years since its establishment the CSA has continuously been carrying out generic
training and other forms of professional development for all civil servants in the Republic of
Macedonia. According to the records of the Sector for International Cooperation and Professional
Development within the CSA, in the period of 2002-2004 a total of 13 training programmes and other
forms of professional development of civil servants were carried out. They have encompassed a total
of 2044 civil servants.

The Government of the Republic of Macedonia in May 2000 adopted the “Strategy for Civil Servants
Training in the Process of Macedonia's Approximation to the European Union". The strategy defines
the aims, target groups, areas of EU training, methods, mode of funding, management and
coordination with the activities for EU training, and evaluation and monitoring of training carried out.
The implementation of the Strategy for EU Training is done through biennial Operational Training
Plans, which determine the priority target groups of civil servants as well as the topics of training. The
activities envisaged in the plans are in accordance with the identified needs for EU training of
Macedonian civil servants and with the priorities of the European integration process. The funding of
operational plans is secured from the Budget of the Republic and foreign donors. The first
Operational Plan for the period of 2001-2002 and the second Operational Plan for the period of 20032004 were fully implemented.
The realisation of the Project on Establishing a Centre for Continuous Training for the European
Union within the Tempus programme of the European Commission started in 2003. In the first group
of trainers for EU training a total of 59 participants were trained, of which 19 are civil servants.
In addition to the EU training activities, a Programme for scholarship for post-graduate studies
abroad on topics concerning the EU is under way. The funding of the programme is secured through
the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia and foreign donors. On the basis of a public competition
and the established selection procedure, a total of 20 scholarships have been hitherto awarded to
junior cadres who are obliged to work for the state administration a certain period of time after they
complete the studies.
The Sector for European Integration within the General Secretariat of the Government of the
Republic of Macedonia has organised 33 trainings in the country for a total of 852 participants, of
which over 90% are civil servants. At the same time, six summer schools and one seminar have
been organised abroad, where a total of 22 civil servants have participated (See table 1. Review of
Training in the Field of European Integration )

greater capability for continuous analysis, elaboration and implementation of European standards in
the national legislation, the TAIEX Office in Brussels organised 33 seminars in the period JuneDecember 2004 for a total of 165 participants of which over 95% civil servants.
The Centre was established in 1999 for the purpose of training of employees in courts and public
prosecutor’s offices. From 2002 to 2004, apart from judges and public prosecutors, employees with a
status of civil servants have also attended training.
In the course of 2003 and 2004, the Centre for Continuous Education of the Macedonian Judges’
Association organised 17 trainings in which a total of 153 civil servants from courts and public
prosecutor’s offices participated.
Government bodies employing civil servants also perform specific trainings in topics concerning
these bodies.
The Association of Local Self-Government Units (ALSGU) financially supported from by donors
carried out training in municipal administration, encompassing 12 subject areas. According to the
ALSGU’s records, 1704 employees in the municipal administration have undergone training, in the

Liability of civil servants
Pursuant to the Law on Civil Servants, the civil servant is personally responsible for the performance
of the official tasks. The civil servant, except the Secretary General and the State Secretary are liable

40/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

to disciplinary measures. The responsibility for a criminal offence or misdemeanour does not exclude
the disciplinary liability of the civil servant. The civil servant is disciplinarily liable for a disciplinary
irregularity and disciplinary offence.
Any minor, insignificant violation of the official duties, or minor violation of the reputation of the
service or of the civil servant is disciplinary irregularity. The disciplinary violation, on the other hand,
is any major, significant violation of the official duties, or a major violation of the reputation of the
service or of the civil servant.
In the event of violation of the official duties, one of the following disciplinary measures may be taken
against the civil servant based on a decision:
−
−

Public reprimand;
A fine in the amount of 10% to 30% of the monthly salary paid in the month before the
violation of the official duties was committed.
− Termination of employment.
Disciplinary irregularity is: not coming to work in the determined time and leaving work before the
closing hours despite the reprimand by the immediate superior civil servant; disorderly maintenance
of official documents and data; unjustified absence from work up to two working days during one
calendar year, and failure to wear name-tags if such an obligation exists. The disciplinary measure
for a disciplinary irregularity may be public reprimand or a fine of 10% of the monthly salary paid in
the month before the disciplinary irregularity was committed. The measure is pronounced by the
minister or the official in charge of the body after a prior written report submitted by the immediate
superior civil servant.
Disciplinary violation is:
−
−
−
−
−
−
−
−
−
−
−

Non-performance or unconscientious, indecent, untimely or negligent performance of the
official duties;
Expressing and advocating personal political beliefs when performing the official tasks;
Refusing to provide or providing incorrect data to the state bodies, legal entities and to the
citizens, if the provision of data is prescribed by law;
Illegal management of funds;
Refusing to perform the official tasks of the job he/she is assigned or refusal of orders given

Non-compliance with the act of the official prescribing the rules for work during a strike;
Not taking or partially taking the prescribed security measures for protection of the entrusted
assets;
Causing major material damage;
Repeating a disciplinary irregularity;

Refusal of professional training and development to which the civil servant is sent.

A fine in amount of 10% to 30% of the monthly salary paid to the civil servant in the month before the
disciplinary offence was done shall be imposed for the disciplinary offences listed under items 1 to
10. If there were harmful consequences for the body and if no mitigating circumstances have been
found for the civil servant that committed the offence, the employment of the civil servant is
terminated. A fine amounting 10% to 30% of the monthly civil servant’s salary paid in the month
before the disciplinary offence was committed may be imposed for the disciplinary offence listed
under item 11.
The disciplinary measures against the civil servant related to disciplinary violation shall be decided
upon by the minister or the head of the body, following a disciplinary procedure upon the proposal of
the Commission for Disciplinary Procedure on Disciplinary Violation.

Political Criteria

Apart from disciplinary liability, the Law on Civil Servants envisages financial liability for any damage
that the civil servant causes either intentionally or due to complete negligence. The official in charge
of the body founds a commission for determining the financial liability. Based on a report of the
Commission the official in charge of the body determines the liability of the civil servant for
compensation for the damage. The body in which the civil servant works is obliged to compensate
the material damage caused by the civil servant to third parties in the course of performance of
his/her official duties. The official in charge of the body may completely or partially release the civil
servant from compensating the damage, if it were not done intentionally, or if the compensation for
the damage may jeopardise the well-being of the civil servant and his/her family.
Termination of employment
Apart from cases of termination of employment regulated by general provisions on labour relations
(with an agreement, by dismissal or by force of law), the Law on Civil Servants envisages the
following grounds for termination of employment.
−
−
−
−
−
−
−

If he/she had been convicted of a criminal offence related to his/her official duties or other
criminal offence that makes him/her unsuitable to perform the service;
If he/she was assessed with “unsatisfactory” grade for two consecutive times or for at least
three times in the past five years;
When an intern civil servant does not pass the intern exam;
In cases when the civil servant does not accept reassignment to another position as a result
of a received annual grade “unsatisfactory.”
In cases when the secretary general or the state secretary, after the expiry of his or her term
of office or after his or her dismissal refuses the reassignment to another position;
When a disciplinary measure for disciplinary violation has been taken and when mitigating
circumstances for the damages caused to the body have not been determined;
In cases of the so-called “redundancy“. Namely, the Law on Civil Servants prescribes that in
case of termination or merge of the body, reduction of its competences, reduction of the
amount of work or changes in its internal organisational structure by elimination of posts due
to structural changes in the bodies, the civil servant who performed those duties is reassigned
within the same body to a job in the same or a lower position. In cases of reassignment of a
number of redundant civil servants, priority is given to single parents, a foster parent to a child
of up to 7 years of age; parents of a severely disabled child; disabled at work; and one of the
spouses who are employed with the same employer. If the civil servant is not reassigned to
another position within a month or if he/she refuses the reassignment, his or her employment
is terminated.

Law on Military Service in the Republic of Macedonia
The status of military personnel as a special category of civil servants has been regulated by the Law
on Military Service in the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
Nos. 62/02, 98/02, 25/03 and 71/03). Military personnel are military officers (officers and noncommissioned officers), professional soldiers and civilian persons in service of the Army.
Authorised officers in the Ministry of Defence who are military officers fall under the competence of
the Law on Military Service in the Republic of Macedonia. On the other hand, authorised officers in
the Ministry of Defence, who are civilians, fall under the competence of general provisions on labour
relations.
Authorised officers in the Ministry of Defence are persons in charge of: collecting, documenting and
analysing intelligence data relevant for the defence of the Republic; detecting and preventing
intelligence and other subversive activity of foreign military intelligence and intelligence services
conducted both within the country or from abroad and aimed against the defence of the Republic;

42/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

detecting and preventing all forms of terrorist activities aimed against the Republic; performing
counter-intelligence protection of tasks and plans, documents, material and technical means, areas,
zones and objects of interest to the Republic; as well as persons in charge of preventing and
detecting criminal offences in military units and institutions, in military bivouacking areas or areas
where military personnel are trained, as well as in facilities and zones determined by the
Government. Authorised officers are appointed by the Minister of Defence.
Employment
Admittance of military personnel is carried out through employment in the Ministry of Defence by way
of public announcement. The Law determines the general and special conditions that candidates
need to meet in order to be employed as officers, non-commissioned officers, professional soldiers or
civilian persons in military service. General conditions for admittance into the service are equal for all
military personnel, i.e. they need to be citizens of the Republic of Macedonia; they need to be of legal
age; they need to be physically fit for the performance of duties and they must not have been subject
to a security measure of prohibition to conduct a profession, activity or duty. Depending on whether
an officer, non-commissioned officer, professional soldier or civilian in service of the Army is
admitted, special conditions set forth are: adequate education, age, and professional training.
Rights and duties
The Law on Military Service in the Republic of Macedonia stipulates special rights and duties for
military officers. The military officer is obliged to carry out his or her service conscientiously,
professionally, efficiently, orderly and timely, in accordance with the Constitution and law and in
accordance with international agreements ratified by the Republic of Macedonia. Military officers are
obliged to: give and sign an oath that remains in force permanently; wear a military uniform; military
identification, military book and special identification documents; carry out orders of the superior
officer; keep state, military, official and business secrets, an obligation that remains in force even
after the cessation of service; comply with the prohibition to participate in political campaigns and
other public events during his/her working hours and with the prohibition to wear or display party
symbols in office; and notify the superior in charge upon travelling abroad; they have the right to use
coercive means or firearms in accordance with regulations. The right to strike is restricted and the
military officer may use such rights not more than once a year. Military officers are entitled to free
legal assistance when they are subject to criminal, misdemeanour or civil proceedings for the use of
coercion, firearms or other interventions as well as for involvement in a traffic accident during service.
Military officers are also entitled to free health care in both military and civilian health institution
(under terms specified by law), and to insurance in case of death, bodily harm or loss of the ability to
work resulting from the performance of service. The Law also regulates the rights to vacations and
leaves as well as the working hours of military officers.
The civilian persons are equal with military officers in the following rights and duties: giving an oath,
executing an order, keeping and using firearms, keeping a secret, not participating in political
campaigns, striking, using legal assistance, healthcare, insurance, travelling abroad, working hours,
vacations and leaves.
In the line of duty, military officers and civilian persons in the armed forces are entitled to a use of a
military-owned apartment in the location of service, and if such apartment is not available they are
entitled to compensation of rental expenses. Professional soldiers are entitled to a free
accommodation in army barracks.
Deployment and promotion
Orders for appointing, promoting, dismissing, reassigning, deploying, representing and other relations
within the service for the officers with a rank of a major up to a colonel are issued by the Minister of
Defence or a person authorised by him/her. As regards professional soldiers, non-commissioned
officers and officers of a rank up to a captain, orders are issued by the Chief of General Staff of the
Armed Forces or a person authorised by him/her. Orders for deployment, reassignment to a different
post, dismissal due to professional development and training, sick leave and treatment, representing

43/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

or for other relations within the civilian service are issued by the Chief of General Staff of the Armed
Forces or by a person authorised by him/her.
The promotion of military officers to a higher rank and their assignment to a specific duty depends on
the assessment and the needs of the service. Conditions for promotion into a rank have been
determined by the Law. Officers are promoted upon the proposal of the Commission established by
the Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces. Promotion into a rank of a professional soldier, noncommissioned officer and officer up to a captain is granted by the Chief of General Staff of the Armed
Forces, while promotion into a rank of a major up to a colonel is granted by the Minister of Defence.
The promotion in rank and assignment to a duty of the officers in the rank of a general is within the
authority of the President of the Republic as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of
Macedonia.
System of salaries and allowances
The Law on Military Service determines the system of salaries and allowances for the military
personnel. The salary consists of a basic salary and supplements.
The basic salary of military personnel is determined according to the rank, duty, work experience and
the army supplement. The supplements to the basic salary are the following: for performing a specific
military service; for performing a high-risk service; for performing a service in the troops; for a special
education level as determined by the act on formation for a specific duty; as well as for
representation.
The basic salary of civilians in service of the armed forces is determined in accordance with the
education level for the position in which they have been assigned, duty, work experience, army
supplement and career supplement. The supplements to the basic salary are the following: for
performing a service in shifts or turns; for performing a high-risk service; for a special education level
as determined by the act on formation for specific duty, and for representation.
The salary value is determined in points, and the point value is the same for all military personnel.
Military personnel are entitled to allowances for vacations, leaves in cases determined by law, sick
leaves, pregnancy, birth and maternity leaves, child nourishment leaves, retraining and additional
training, professional development and training, as well as for responding to summons of courts or
other bodies.
Assessment
In the course of service, military personnel are subject to official assessment for the determination of
their success in service, which in turn secures their promotion into a rank or assignment to a specific
duty.
The assessment is carried out every 12 months, and in exceptional cases determined by the Law it
may be carried out for a period shorter than 12 months, but not shorter than six.
Assessment is done on the basis of data compiled from the following criteria: expertise, professional
efficiency, command and management, results from work and physical fitness. The data is assessed
descriptively with the following grades: "especially distinguishes himself/herself", distinguishes
himself/herself,” "good,” “satisfactory,” and “unsatisfactory."
The assessment is carried out independently by the immediate superior and deputy superior or a
manager or by a managing person who is an officer or a civilian with a higher education. The
Commission established by the Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces decides on appeals
against assessment.

Political Criteria

Professional development and training
Professional development and training for officers and non-commissioned officers, as one of the
conditions for admittance into service is conducted by the Army. In the course of service and on the
basis of plans and curricula, military personnel are obliged to attend training organised by the Army in
the premises of the Military Academy, the Defence Training Centre and the Ministry of Defence, as
well as in other institutions in the country and abroad.
Training may be carried out both in the country and abroad. The training in the country is carried out
in the Training Command, through basic courses for non-commissioned officers, while in the Military
Academy there are courses for platoon commanders (basic course for officers). The training of
military personnel (officers and non-commissioned officers) abroad is carried out through the bilateral
co-operation with NATO-member states and Partnership for Peace, and through courses, seminars
and participation into mutual military exercises. In the last three years trainings for 697 military
personnel have been conducted, specifically: courses for officers for 105 military personnel; courses
for platoon commanders for 166 military personnel; and courses for non-commissioned officers for
426 military personnel.
Within the Strategic Defence Review, the remaining higher levels of training of officers and noncommissioned officers have been defined and they are currently developed. The dynamics of training
shall be determined after the curricula are adopted. In the last three years there have been trainings
for 885 military personnel abroad (USA, Canada, UK, France, Turkey, The Netherlands, Greece,
Romania, Bulgaria, Italy, Germany and Switzerland), specifically for 322 officers, 178 noncommissioned officers, 373 professional soldiers and 12 civilians.
Liability
Military personnel are disciplinary liable for violation of the military duties and discipline, in a mode
and procedure determined by the Law.
A violation of the military discipline is every action of a military person that contravenes the provisions
for the performance of military service, as determined by the Law.
The following disciplinary measures are pronounced by competent military superiors: written
reprimand, decreasing the amount of the monthly salary between 10% and 30% for a period of one to
six months, and rank degradation and demotion to the previously held rank.
The Chief of General Staff upon the proposal of the Military Disciplinary Commission determines
disciplinary measures against professional soldiers, non-commissioned officers and officers up to a
rank of a captain, and these measures are: prohibition for promotion to a higher rank for a period of
one year, assignment to a duty at the previous rank for a period of two years; and deprivation from
the rank. The same measures are pronounced by the Minister of Defence for personnel of the ranks
from a major to colonel.
The disciplinary measure of “termination of employment” to a civilian person in service of the armed
forces is pronounced by the Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces or by a person authorised by
him/her, upon the proposal of the Military Disciplinary Commission.
Military personnel are also financially liable. If military personnel negligently or deliberately cause
damage to the property of the Republic of Macedonia related to the performance of duty, they are
obliged to compensate for the damage, in a mode and procedure determined by the Law. A battalion
commander, an equivalent or a higher military official for whom a rank of colonel or higher has been
envisaged with the Formation Book, decides on financial liabilities and compensation, in a procedure
determined by the Law.

Political Criteria

Termination of employment
The termination of employment to a military official and professional soldier is undertaken if he/she:
loses health or physical capability for service in the armed forces and does not have the general
health capability for work as required; is discharged of citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia; has
been assessed with the grade “unsatisfactory” two times consecutively for at least four assessment
data; has not been promoted to a higher rank in three consecutive procedures; is absent from work
due to serving a prison sentence (a military official for longer than two years and professional soldier
for longer than six months); has been subject to a security or correctional measure due to which
he/she is absent from work (a military official for longer than two years and professional soldier for
longer than six months); files a personal request; and fulfils the requirement for retirement.
Termination of employment to civilian persons in service of the Army is done in accordance with the
general provisions on termination of employment pertaining to civil servants.
The retirement of military personnel is done in accordance with the general provisions on retirement
of workers in the Republic of Macedonia (age retirement with 64 years of age for men, i.e. 62 years
of age for women, and 15 years of insurance). There is an exception to this rule that pertains to
military personnel who have reduced years of insurance (for aviation services, parachutists, divers,
members of special task units, performing radiological, biological and chemical protection, radar
services, electronic surveillance, crypto-protection, security, intelligence and counter-intelligence,
military police, and duties in a troop). This category of persons are entitled to an old age retirement
with at least 25 years of insurance, of which at least 15 have been effectively spent in posts of
reduced years of insurance, and 55 five years of age for men and 50 years of age for women, if their
employment has been terminated due to service cuts. In the transitional period by 31 December 2007
some military personnel are to be prematurely retired as a result of the implementation of the
rationalisation process in the Army, in accordance with a special law. Namely, the Ministry of
Defence may buy an additional length of service of five years, and thus a military official or a civilian
may acquire the right to old age retirement with 40 years of service for men and 35 years of service
for women, regardless of age.
Law on Internal Affairs
In the structure of the Ministry of the Interior, there are three categories of employees with a different
status:
−

−
−

Employees with special duties and authorities determined by the Law on Internal Affairs
(police employees and operational employees, employees performing duties directly related
to the police and operational duties, and the minister, his/her deputy, and managerial
employees in charge of particular organisational units);
Civil servants, in accordance with the Law on Civil Servants;
Other employees who perform duties and tasks for the needs of the Ministry of the Interior,
which fall under the competence of the Law on Labour Relations.

Employment of workers with special duties and authorities
The Ministry of the Interior recruits its personnel pursuant to the Law on Labour Relations, the Law
on Internal Affairs (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 19/95, 55/97, 38/02, 33/03
and 19/04), as well as to the Collective Agreement of the Ministry. Pursuant to provisions in these
laws and by-laws, any person who, apart from general conditions, fulfils the special conditions as
determined by the Law on Internal Affairs may be employed in the Ministry of the Interior. The
applicant should meet the following special conditions: to be a citizen of the Republic of Macedonia;
to be of legal age; not to have been pronounced a security measure of prohibition to perform a
profession or duty; to be physically and mentally fit for work; to be reputable and guarantee that
he/she would conscientiously and honourably perform assigned duties and tasks; and if the person is

Chapter I

Political Criteria

fulfilled prior to employment. If a person applies for the position of a police officer, he/she must not be
older than 25 years of age if he/she is being admitted to work for the first time. In addition, the person
must have completed secondary school prior to applying.
Pursuant to the Law on Internal Affairs, the Ministry may hire persons with or without a public
announcement depending on the particularity and character of the position. They may be hired
permanently or temporarily. An employment without a public announcement is offered for positions
with special duties and authorities (determined by the Law on Internal Affairs and the Rulebook on
Systematisation of Posts in the Ministry of the Interior), to scholarship beneficiaries of the Ministry
and to graduates and students from the training institution established for the needs of the Ministry.
In the course of employment there should be equitable representation of citizens belonging to all
communities, with the respect of criteria on expertise and competence.
The public announcement for employment, which is publicised in media, contains all general and
special conditions for the advertised position. After receiving all employment applications, the Ministry
conducts a concrete procedure through referring the persons to a specialised health examination and
to security scrutiny by the Directorate for Security and Counter-Intelligence. The employment
procedure is conducted by a Commission established by the minister. The Commission reviews all
applications and shortlists candidates that meet the requirements. Following the procedure the
minister brings a decision for appointment of candidates that have been admitted.
Rights and duties
The Law on Internal Affairs envisages special rights and duties for employees with special duties and
authorities. They are responsible for the lawful application of means and methods in the line of duty.
In the event of a state of emergency or war, employees of the Ministry are engaged in performing
military and other duties for security and defence purposes as well as in relief efforts following natural
disasters and epidemics. The employees of the Ministry of the Interior also assist in the enforcement
of final court decisions if there is resistance in the course of arrest. They are obliged to obey the
order of a superior, possess and carry a badge, weapons and ammunition and other prescribed
equipment. The employees with special duties and authorities are obliged to carry out their tasks in
every circumstance even if it poses risk to their life. In addition, they should provide assistance to
citizens upon their request and provide information and refer citizens to other competent bodies and
institutions. The rights of employees with special duties and authorities pursuant to the Law on
Internal Affairs are the following: right to identifying and detaining citizens for the purpose of
determining their identity; right to inspection of vehicles, persons and baggage and redirecting traffic
while necessary; right to a free public transportation and to the same insurance covering all other
passengers; right to a use of firearms and coercion means in cases determined by law; right to free
legal assistance when subject to criminal, misdemeanour or civil proceedings due to a use of
firearms, coercion means or other interventions as well as due to participation in a traffic accident or
in line of duty. The Law determines issues regarding the working hours, leaves and other rights and
obligations of employees in the Ministry (the obligation to keep state, official, military or business
secrets; obligation not to perform an activity incompatible with their duties; right to insurance; rights in
cases of death; restricted right to a strike and a right to a salary raise of 30%).
The rights and duties as well as working hours, vacations and leaves have been set forth in detail in
the Collective Agreement of the Ministry of the Interior.
The by-laws regulating the conduct of authorised officers in carrying out duties and tasks are the
Rules on the Mode of Conduct and Behaviour and Mutual Relations of Authorised Officers and the
Rulebook on the Mode of Operation of the Ministry of the Interior.
In official relations with citizens, employees of the Ministry are obliged to be polite, reasonable,
objective and correct, and respect the personality, dignity, rights and freedom of citizens, regardless
of their gender or ethnic, religious, political affiliation and social status. They are also obliged to keep
their reputation as well as the reputation of the Ministry and to continuously upgrade their knowledge,
to improve their physical and mental steadiness and to adhere to the Police Code of Ethics. The

47/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

employees must not accept gifts or other benefits from natural and legal persons in relation to their
official duties; they may not perform activities that are incompatible with their duty; and they may not
perform activities detrimental to the Ministry’s reputation. Employees with special duties and
authorities apply special methods in carrying out their duties and are responsible for the legitimate
application of such methods. The employees are obliged to carry personal weapons and equipment
necessary for the execution of particular tasks in a mode determined by a regulation, and if they wear
a uniform they are obliged to adhere to the provisions on wearing uniform and special equipment.
Employees in the Ministry are not allowed to organise and act politically. They may not publicly
express or represent stances of political parties or actively participate in their activities.
Assignment
The assignment of employees is carried out on the basis of provisions set forth in the Law on Labour
Relations as well as the provisions in the Collective Agreement of the Ministry of the Interior. In the
course of his/her employment with the Ministry the employee may be assigned to any post as
determined by the act on systematisation of posts if such a post suits his/her level of education or
professional training. An exception to this rule has been envisaged in the Collective Agreement,
which stipulates that the employee may be assigned to a one level higher degree position than the
degree he/she holds.
The assignment of employees in the Ministry is carried out on the basis of: а) the employee’s
request; b) upon the proposal of immediate superiors in organisational units; c) upon the proposal of
the Director of the Public Security Bureau or the Director of the Directorate for Security and CounterIntelligence.
The head of the local unit of the Ministry is elected by the municipal councils covered by the unit from
a list of at least three candidates proposed by the minister, of whom at least one should belong to the
community of the majority population in the respective municipalities. The minister shall retain his/her
authority for the dismissal of the local unit head in accordance with the Law.
System of salaries and rewards
Salaries and rewards have been regulated with the Collective Agreement of the Ministry of the
Interior, the Rulebook on Salaries and the Rulebook on the Form and Mode of Awarding Rewards
and Notes of Thanks and Merit.
An employee may have his/her salary raised or reduced by 5%, 10% or 15% proportionately to the
duties and assignments and his/her contribution to the total operation of the organisational entity and
the Ministry as a whole. The procedure for determining a raised or reduced amount of salary is
conducted every month upon the proposal of the head of organisational entity and following consent
from a superior.
Employees are awarded rewards, acknowledgements and notes of merit for special successes and
results in their work and contribution to the operations of the Ministry. These rewards are awarded on
the Police Day, other solemn occasions and upon retirement.
Professional training and development
Pursuant to the provisions in the Collective Agreement, the Ministry of Internal Affairs may hire an
unemployed person as an intern with at least a level IV of professional training (secondary school).
The person may be hired permanently or temporarily. The intern is trained for an independent and
professional performance of tasks and duties required from the position. The internship cannot be
shorter than 6 months or longer than 12 months. The intern is professionally trained during the
internship in accordance with a prior plan. The professional training is carried out through the
assignment of duties and tasks, learning, consultations, and guidelines and instructions by superiors
in organisational units. Following the professional training the intern takes an exam upon his/her prior
request. The exam is oral and is taken in two consecutive days before the Commission (with a two-

48/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

year mandate) established by the minister's Decision. The intern who does not pass a part or the
whole exam has a right to re-examination after 15 days have elapsed from the first one. An intern
who has not applied for examination within 12 months due to unjustifiable reasons is dismissed. The
intern who has passed the exam is given a certificate of completion.
A person employed to a position with special duties and authorities who does not have the required
education in the field of security, is referred to additional professional training in an adequate
institution.
Professional training and development of employees is carried out through conferences, courses,
and additional studies in the country or abroad. Additional professional training for police officers is
undertaken pursuant to a programme adopted by the minister. Seminars and courses are held for
different categories of employees depending on the nature and complexity of their positions. When
certain tasks necessitate a higher level of expertise the employee may be directed to expert
specialisation in the country or abroad. The employee with a higher education (level VII) may be sent
to post-graduate studies as a form of professional training for the purpose of better performance of
duties and tasks. An employee assigned to a position requiring knowledge of a foreign language may
be referred to additional training in that particular language.
Given the specificity of competencies, the Ministry creates highly educated cadres in the Police
Academy as a state institution in the field of security. The basic training of police officers, specific
trainings as well as training for security management is also carried out in the Academy.
Continued education is carried out on the basis of programmes adopted by the minister of the
Interior. The elementary police education is a 12-month academic programme, of which practical field
training takes three months, while the length of special and management courses depends on their
programmes, but may not be longer than 12 months. Following the completion of training, the
trainees are awarded a certificate of completion of basic training or special training certificate.
The Ministry continuously trains its employees with a determined dynamics. Namely, from 2001 to
2004, 1.605 employees underwent to basic training at the Police Academy, of which 239
Macedonians, 1.145 Albanians, 81 Turks, 58 Roma, 32 Serbs and 50 - of other ethnicity.
Until September 2004, a total of 127 persons underwent special training at the Police Academy, of
which 22 Macedonians, 90 members of the Albanian ethnic community and 15 members of other
communities in Macedonia.
Following the amendments to the Law on Internal Affairs and the Law on Crossing the State Border
and Movement in the Border Zone, prerequisites were created for a border police as a special
organisational entity within the Ministry. The transfer of competences related to securing the state
border and the movement in the border zone provided for a contractual taking over of 821 persons
who had previously undergone special three-month training in the Police Academy.
Liability
The procedure on determining liability due to violation of the working discipline is initiated upon a
proposal of either the Director of the Public Security Bureau, the Director of the Directorate for
Security and Counter-Intelligence, undersecretaries or of employees authorised by the minister. The
proposal with all relevant evidence is submitted to the Dismissal Commission, which is established by
the minister. After completing the procedure, the Commission, pursuant to provisions from the
Collective Agreement, submits a proposal to the minister for adequate actions. The minister adopts a
decision for termination of employment if he/she agrees with the proposal submitted by the
Commission. If the minister disagrees he/she may return the subject to a review for correction of
irregularities or he/she may bring a different decision. If there are circumstances as envisaged by the
Collective Agreement of the Ministry, the dismissal may be replaced with a fine not higher than 15%
of the monthly salary for a period of one to six months. The employee has a right to appeal against
the decision of the minister to the second-instance commission within the Government in charge of
labour relations.

49/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

An employee who, by his/her fault causes damage to the Ministry in the course of his/her duty shall
be subject to a procedure for indemnity. The procedure is initiated upon a request that may be
submitted by the director of the Public Security Bureau, the director of the Directorate for Security
and Counter-Intelligence, by managerial employees or by heads of a respective organisational unit.
The request is submitted to the Commission for Determining Financial Liability established by the
minister with a Decision. The Commission conducts a procedure pursuant to provisions in the
Collective Agreement and adopts a decision. The decision is then sent to the employee who has a
right to appeal to the minister. If the employee has been found responsible and if he/she does not
compensate for the damages, the Ministry may initiate a procedure before the court after the expiry
of the three-month deadline from the time the decision has been effective.

The Law on Customs Administration (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 46/04),
regulates the particularities in the rights, responsibilities and liabilities of customs officers deriving
from the employment, the Code of Conduct, the awards and acknowledgements, as well as the
financing of the Customs Administration.
Customs officer means an officer of the Customs Administration who is uniformed or has special
duties and authorities. The Law has envisaged 26 different positions divided in three categories of
customs officers.
− Managerial customs officers are: Assistant Director; Customs House Manager; Assistant
Customs House Manager; Chief of Department; Head of Customs Office; Head of Unit;
Section Leader; and Shift Leader.
− Expert customs officers are: Advisor of the Director; Chief Inspector; Independent Advisor;
Senior Customs Worker Controller; Senior Inspector; System Engineer; Inspector; Senior
Customs Worker; Advisor; Junior Inspector; Customs Worker; Dog Handler.
− Administrative customs officers are: Chief Network Operator; Network Operator; Operator;

Officer.
With regard to required education as one of the conditions for employment, the Law on Customs
Administration prescribes that customs officers in the first group must have higher or post-secondary
education, except for the shift leader who may have higher, post-secondary or secondary education.
The customs officers in the second and third groups may also have higher, post-secondary or
secondary education.
Customs officers fall under the competence of the Law on Labour Relations and the provisions
related to health, pension and disability insurance, as well as the Collective Agreement of the
Customs Administration regarding issues not specifically regulated by the Law on Customs
Administration. Provisions in the Law on Labour Relations are also applied to the technical and
assistance personnel employed in the Customs Administration.

Employment of customs officers
Any person may be employed in the Customs Administration as a customs officer who, apart from
the general conditions, fulfils the special conditions as prescribed by the act on systematisation of
posts in the Customs Administration. The Custom administration applies the principle of equitable
representation in the course of employment of customs officers. The employment procedure is
carried out through a public vacancy announcement publicised in at least two daily newspapers of
which one in the language spoken by at least 20% of the citizens who speak a language other than
Macedonian. There are two exceptions to the rule: The first is that a customs officer may be
transferred from one into another state body without a public announcement of the vacancy if the
needs of the Customs Administration thus require; and the second is that the Director reserves the
right to grant permission to waive the publication of a public vacancy announcement on the basis of
his/her decision for promotion or transfer of a customs officer to the vacant post.
The Director makes a decision on the final selection of the applicants. The employment is established
by concluding a written employment contract between the chosen candidate and the Director.
Regulations on the examination of work capabilities and the procedures for commencing employment
is determined under the Collective Agreement or under operational instructions brought by the
Director.
The Law also envisages probationary period upon concluding an employment contracts or upon
promoting customs officers. Thus a newly employed or a promoted customs officer is required to
serve a probationary period of 6 to 12 months. The Customs Administration provides vocational
training to all employees for the performance of their tasks. In the course of probationary period the
customs officers are placed under the care and direct supervision and assessment of their immediate
superior. At the end of the probationary period a decision is taken whether to confirm the
appointment or terminate the employment. As an exception, the decision for termination of
employment may also be brought before the expiration of the probation period, if it is determined that
the customs officer does not meet the requirements of the post. In case of promoted customs officers
who do not perform satisfactorily during the probation period, a decision shall be taken to return them
to their previous position.
Rights and duties of customs officers
One of the fundamental principles in the performance of customs officers is the principle of nondiscrimination. The law explicitly stipulates that the Customs Administration and the customs officers
shall not discriminate against any person on any ground, such as: gender, race, skin colour, ethnic or
social origin, political and religious affiliation, property and social status or other status. Furthermore,
the Law regulates the following fundamental rights of the customs officer: the right to guaranteed
work in accordance with the Law; the right to protection from competent authorities in the
performance of his/her tasks; the right to adequate working conditions for the performance of official
duties; the right to apply for a higher position; the right to seek court protection in exercising his/her
rights, or protection from other competent authority or trade union; the right to salary and allowances;
the right to vacation, leaves, and absences; the right to professional development and training; the
right to additional work out of the working hours if such work is not incompatible with his/her official
duties and activities; and the right to found and be a member of a trade union or professional
organisations.
Due to specifics of the duties they carry out, customs officers have a right to a safe and healthy
environment free of dangers to life or body; however, they also are required to adhere to the
prescribed measures and norms regarding protection at work.
The Law on Customs Administration prescribes that the customs officers are obliged to carry out their
duties conscientiously, professionally, efficiently, orderly and timely, in accordance with the
Constitution and law and other regulations in customs administration. Furthermore, the customs
officer is obliged to perform his or her activities impartially and without the influence of political

parties; he/she may not be guided by his or her own political beliefs or personal financial interests;
he/she is required to execute orders of the immediate superior; he/she must not accept financial or
other benefits in the line of duty; he/she is required to attend professional training and development;
he/she must handle equipment with care and respect the order and discipline of the institution.
The customs officers are subject to special provisions regarding the prevention of conflict of interests.
The customs officers may not perform any other profit making function, duty or activity, which is in
conflict with their official duty. In addition, the customs officers may not conduct an activity in conflict
with their official duty as owners or partners in companies, members of a board of directors or of
supervisory authorities of trade companies. The Director defines activities in conflict of the customs
officer’s duties. The customs officers may undertake other work and perform other activities only after
prior approval by the Director.
The protection of documents and data defined as official, business or any other secret has been
determined as a duty of the customs officers even after the termination of employment until the
restricted period of confidentiality ceases. In addition, the customs officer must not use or
communicate for unauthorised purposes any information to his/her knowledge pertaining to customs
matters.
Reassignment and promotion of customs officers
In the interest of the Customs Administration, the customs officer may, for a specified or unspecified
period, be reassigned to another post that corresponds to his/her professional background,
knowledge and qualifications. When the customs officer is being reassigned for a specified period
(which may last up to 6 months with a possibility for another 6-month extension) he/she is obliged to
return to the previous or equivalent post after the expiry of reassignment. The customs officer who
has been reassigned is entitled to compensation of expenses unless he/she has been reassigned
upon his/her own request.
In the course of reassignment the Director has a right not to put out a public vacancy announcement.
The Director is entitled to the same right in the course of promoting customs officers. Both the
reassignments and promotions may be permanent and temporary. The customs officer may be
permanently reassigned (promoted) to another higher position for which an internal vacancy
announcement is made, hence only employees may apply. The temporary promotion means that a
customs officer is placed to a higher position for a certain period of time. After the expiry of the period
the customs officer is returned to his/her permanent position or other adequate post.
Monthly Salary, Allowances, Rewards and Bonuses
Customs officers are entitled to monthly salaries, salary allowances and other allowances. They
receive 30% of the salary in addition to the regular salary for special work conditions, as well as for
special responsibility resulting from the post. The amount for specific posts demanding more specific
qualifications or specific skills, and which are of particular significance to the efficiency of the
Customs Administration, may be higher but cannot exceed 50% of the salary. Customs officers
receive rewards as a result of the assessment of their performance, particular outstanding
performance or detection of customs-related crimes or offences.
Assessment of customs officers
The assessment of the customs officers is made on the basis of data regarding the professional
knowledge and skills of the post, the efforts, the results achieved, and the creativity and
conscientiousness in the performance of official duties. The customs officers are assessed once a
year, but not later than the first quarter of the subsequent year for the year that has expired.
Performance evaluation and assessment of a customs officer may also be conducted prior to the
annual evaluation assessment whenever the needs demand a decision regarding unsatisfactory work
results, reassignment, promotion and disciplinary measures.

Chapter I

Political Criteria

Customs officers who do not achieve satisfactory results in their performance are directed to
additional training and support from their superiors. If they do not achieve a satisfactory result within
a period of time, a procedure for termination of employment follows.
Professional development and training of customs officers
Customs officers have a right and duty to professional development and training in accordance with
the needs of the Customs Administration. The Customs Administration provides all customs officers
professional training for the performance of tasks in the new position. The training is not only
provided to the newly employed customs officer, but also to those promoted. In addition, the customs
officer who does not perform satisfactorily is entitled to a support from the immediate superior and
additional training for a certain period of time in order to achieve the desired and satisfactory results
in performance.
Liabilities of customs officers
The Law on Customs Administration envisages disciplinary and financial liability of customs officers.
In addition, they may be subject to misdemeanour and criminal proceedings in accordance with the
law. The customs officers are disciplinary liable for the non-fulfilment of the official duties and
functions, failure to comply with the general obligations stipulated in this Law, unsatisfactory
performance results and lack of knowledge and ability for the performance of the functions of the
post, as well as for violation of the Code of Conduct. The customs officer who intentionally or due to
complete negligence causes damage by acting contrary to the law and other regulation is
disciplinarily liable. The determination of disciplinary liability, procedures, punishments and protection
in the course of procedure is determined in accordance with general and special provisions on labour
relations and the collective agreement. A disciplinary measure is pronounced by a decision of the
Director.
Notwithstanding the disciplinary liability, the customs officer may also be financially liable for the
damage he/she has caused to the property used by the Customs Administration.
Termination of employment
The Law on Customs Administration stipulates the cases when the employment is terminated. The
termination of employment of a customs officer occurs in the following cases:
−
−

−
−
−
−
−

−
−

Upon his/her request;

For instance, the public institution for the study of social affairs and problems and for the promotion of
social activities (the Institute for Social Affairs in Skopje) is also authorised to perform training of
expert public servants. This institute also prepares instructions and manuals and uses them in
seminars on the introduction of contemporary methods for the treatment of social pathology. In recent
years there have been approximately 500 participants in such seminars. The funding of training has
been supported from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia and foreign donors, including the
PHARE Programme. In addition, the Institute for Social Work and Social Policy within the Faculty of
Philosophy, of the University “Ss. Cyril and Methodius”, - Skopje, has organised more than 50
trainings for over 1200 participants from the whole country within the framework of the multi-annual
project for the promotion of the potential of social development. The Pension and Disability Fund has

7. Is there a transparent legal or regulatory basis for actions taken by public servants? In
particular, how is impartiality and non-discrimination of actions by public servants ensured?
In the Republic of Macedonia there is a transparent legal basis for the impartial and non-discriminatory
actions of the civil servants. The guarantees therefore are provided in the Constitution, the laws
governing the administration and the administrative procedure, as well as in specific laws regulating
separate areas.
The legal system of the Republic of Macedonia is based on the principles of constitutionality and legality,
stated by Article 51 of the Constitution: Laws shall be in accordance with the Constitution and all other
regulations shall be in accordance with the Constitution and the laws.
The Law on Organisation and Operation of the State Administrative Bodies (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 58/00 and 44/02), Article 3 stipulates that state administrative bodies
perform their competencies defined by law based on the principles of legality, responsibility, efficiency,
cost-efficiency, transparency, equality and predictability. Additionally, Article 4 of the same law stipulates
the obligation of the state administrative bodies to provide to the citizens efficient and lawful exercise of
their freedoms and rights guaranteed by the Constitution. It is also stipulated that within their competence
the state administrative bodies provide efficient and lawful implementation of the rights and interests of all
the parties in the administrative procedure.
Each individual decision of a public body must be founded on a Law or a regulation based on law (for
more details see I_C_9).
Furthermore, the existing laws and regulations that regulate the status, the rights and the duties of
the civil servants and the other public employees, envisage the obligation of impartiality and nondiscrimination when undertaking legal actions, especially when deciding on concrete rights and
interests of the citizens and other legal persons in administrative procedures. Such laws are the Law
on Civil Servants, the Law on Internal Affairs, the Law on Customs Administration and other
regulations (for more details see I_C_6).
The Law on Civil Servants (Official Gazette of the RM Nos. 59/00, 112/00, 34/01, 103/01, 43/02,
98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04 and 69/04), provides that the civil servants must perform their
duties conscientiously, professionally, efficiently, orderly and timely, in accordance with the
Constitution and law. Furthermore, the civil servant is obliged to perform his/her activities impartially
and without the influence of political parties; he/she may not be guided by his/her own political beliefs
or personal financial interests; and he/she must refrain from misuse of authorisations and the status
of a civil servant and protect the reputation of the body. The civil servant is, in accordance with law,
obliged to provide information upon request of the citizens required for exercise of their rights and
interests, except the information classified as state or official secret. The Code of Ethics for Civil
Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 96/01 and 16/04), determines the
manner of civil servants’ behaviour and conduct in order to secure the respect of principles of legality,
professional integrity, efficiency, and loyalty during the execution of their official duties.
The Law on Internal Affairs ("Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia", Nos. 19/95, 55/97,
38/02, 33/03 and 19/04), and relevant bylaws specify that the employees of the Ministry of Internal
Affairs have to respect the personality, dignity, rights and freedom of citizens, regardless of their
gender or ethnic, religious, political affiliation and social status.
The Law on Customs Administration (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 46/04),
explicitly stipulates that the Customs Administration and the customs officers shall not discriminate
against any person on any ground, such as: gender, race, skin colour, ethnic or social origin, political
and religious affiliation, property and social status or other status.
The Codes of Ethics which are adopted for specific categories of civil servants (the Ethical Code for
Civil Servants, the Police Code of Ethics, etc.) additionally regulate the principles of equal treatment,
i.e. non-discrimination, and impartiality in the work of the civil servants. If these regulations are
violated a procedure for evaluation of the accountability, and responsibility of the civil servants is

undertaken, which does not exclude the possibility of being prosecuted for specific actions under the
Law on Criminal Procedure, or being prosecuted with a misdemeanour procedure before competent
body (for more details see I_C_6).
In accordance with the Law on Administrative Inspection (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 69/04), the National Inspectorate for Administration (body within the Ministry of
Justice), conducts supervision of the application of the procedural rules and especially over the
conduct and activities of the civil servants, with the aim to secure respect of the principles of legality,
professional integrity, efficiency, accountability, and responsibility.
The provisions of the Law on Prevention of Corruption (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 28/02, 46/04 and 83/04 - consolidated text), sanction unlawful behaviour, which is
crucial for gaining public confidence in the impartial and non-discriminatory work of the employees in
the public sector.
The Draft Law on Free Access to Public Information, which is in parliamentary procedure aims
towards improving the guarantees for access to public information available to the state
administration, the local self-government bodies, the public institutions and services, as well as the
other legal and natural persons vested with public authority.
Furthermore, the Constitution guarantees two instances in administrative procedures, i.e. the right to
appeal against individual legal acts passed in procedure in the first instance courts, administrative
bodies or organisations, or other institutions that perform public mandate (for more details see
I_C_9).
The institution of the Ombudsman provides additional protection from partial and discriminatory
behaviour of civil servants (for more details see I_G_6).
8. How is accountability of administrative bodies ensured (e.g. are administrative bodies
accountable or answerable for their actions to other administrative, legislative or judicial
authorities, and subject to scrutiny by others)?
Parliamentary scrutiny
According to the Constitution (Article 68), the Assembly carries out political control and supervision of
the Government and other holders of public office accountable to the Assembly.
The Assembly controls the Government by Parliamentary questions, inquiry committees,
interpellation motions and a confidence vote. The Assembly also controls the work of the
Government and the state administration through its committees as well as by the mechanism of
reporting of certain public bodies, established in specific laws (for more details see I_B_2).
Supervision by the Government over state administration and bodies of local self-government
units
The accountability of the state administrative bodies to the other state bodies has been in detail
elaborated in Section III of the Law, which governs the administrative supervision and the inspection.
The supervision over the work of the state administrative bodies includes the supervision over the legality
and over the efficiency in their operation. Supervision is conducted over public enterprises, public
services and institutions, as well as over natural persons and legal entities vested with public authority by
law.
The operation of the ministries is supervised by the Government. Supervision over the operation of
bodies within ministries is performed by the respective ministries, while the operation of other state
administrative bodies and state administrative organisations is supervised by the ministry competent for
the administrative matters for which the relevant body has been established.

Political Criteria

According to the Law on the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00 and 12/03), the Government determines guidelines and positions on the
enforcement of laws and other regulations. The guidelines and positions regulate the operation of
ministries, other state administrative bodies and administrative organisations in their enforcement of laws
and other regulations. In addition, the Government determines deadlines by which the authorised bodies
have to adopt acts and submit reports on specific issues. It also determines the modes of cooperation
with other state administrative bodies as well as other issues relevant for the realisation of these bodies'
functions. The Government may instruct a minister i.e. director of another state administrative body or
administrative organisation, on how he/she is to implement the Government's guidelines or positions.
If the Government deems that a particular regulation passed by a minister is not in compliance with
the Constitution, laws or other regulations, it will notify the minister. Furthermore, the Government
may suspend a regulation passed by a minister if it deems the regulation is not in compliance with
the Constitution, laws or other regulations and may propose the minister to withdraw or alter the
regulation within a certain period of time. The Government within its supervision competences may
abolish or annul a regulation or another act passed by the ministries, state administrative bodies and
administrative organisations if it is not in compliance with the Constitution, laws or other regulations
passed by the Assembly or the Government.
The Government supervises the operation of the ministries, other state administrative bodies and
administrative organisations. In carrying out its supervision over the operation of the state administrative
bodies, the Government is entitled and obliged to abolish or annul a regulation or other act of a ministry,
state administrative body or administrative organisation which does not comply with the Constitution, an
Assembly’s law or other regulation, i.e. a Government’s regulation.
The Government is entitled to abolish or annul a regulation or another act passed by the council or
another body of a local self-government unit or the City of Skopje as part of their delegated competences.
Pursuant to the Law on Local Self-Government (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
5/02), the supervision over the operation of municipal bodies includes the supervision over the legality in
their operation and control and audit of their material and financial operation. Supervision over the
operation of municipal bodies when they carry out delegated duties which are within the competences of
state administrative bodies include supervision over legality and supervision over efficiency.
Legality of municipal regulations is supervised by the ministry competent for the local self-government
issues. Legality of the municipal bodies’ operation is conducted by the competent state administrative
bodies. Audit of the municipal material and financial operations is conducted by the State Audit Office.
Supervision over the delegated municipal authorities is conducted by the state administrative body
competent for the delegated competencies.
Inspection
Inspection includes supervision over the enforcement of laws and other regulations by state bodies,
public enterprises, companies, public institutions, natural persons and legal entities and it is conducted
only by the state administrative bodies (inspectorates) within the competences defined by law.
Particular provisions on accountability are provided in the Law on General Administrative Procedure
(“Official Gazette of SFRY”, 47/86 -consolidated text and “Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”
No. 44/02), concerning responsibility of first instance bodies before the second instance bodies. Thus,
exercising the right of supervision and under legally prescribed conditions, upon a submitted legal remedy
(complaint, appeal) the superior state administrative bodies have the right to annul an act, fully or partially,
or abolish it, or change it. If no superior body exists, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia is
authorised to conduct the supervision.
Pursuant to the Law on Administrative Inspection (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
69/04), the administrative inspection includes supervision over the application of the Law on General
Administrative Procedure and other laws which include provisions on the administrative procedure. The
inspection particularly refers to: timely, cost-effective and efficient exercise of rights and interests of

60/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

citizens and other parties in the administrative procedure; acting within the prescribed deadlines in the
first and second instance administrative procedure, as well as within the deadlines stipulated in the
decisions of the judicial bodies; inclusion of concerned parties in the procedure in order to ensure
protection of their rights and interests; ex officio provision of evidence from official records kept by the
body conducting the procedure or by another state body, legal entity or person with public mandate, or by
municipalities and the City of Skopje; enforcement of final legal acts; payment of costs in the
administrative procedure; receipt of submissions; issuance of certificates and other documents from
official records; professional training of civil servants and other employees who decide in the
administrative procedure; delivery of administrative acts and other documents; mode of conduct of civil
servants and employees in order to ensure respect of the principles of legality, professional integrity,
efficiency, accountability and loyalty in carrying out their official duties; implementation of measures to
improve the operation of administrative bodies when deciding in administrative matters; use of language
by the parties in the administrative procedure and regulations pertaining to the office work.
Judicial Protection
Article 50 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia guarantees a court protection of the legality of
state administration’s individual decisions.
The Law on Administrative Disputes (“Official Gazette of SFRY”, No. 4/77, “Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 44/02), in its Article 7 stipulates that an administrative dispute before the
Supreme Court may be initiated against an administrative act adopted in second instance. Administrative
dispute may also be initiated when the authorised body, following a request or a complaint by a party, has
failed to adopt an appropriate administrative act. It may as well be initiated against an act upon which no
right to a complaint has been provided in the administrative procedure and in instances when the
administrative act has not been adopted under conditions prescribed by law. If following an annulment of
an administrative act, and within 30 days at the latest, the authorised body fails to adopt another
administrative act; the party may submit a request before court asking for the adoption of such act.
Furthermore, the Law prescribes that in case the decision is not enforced within the period determined by
the respective body, the court shall enforce it, either directly or through another court or a body.
Ombudsman
The Ombudsman of the Republic of Macedonia is one of the controlling mechanisms over the operation
of state administrative bodies. Such competences are stipulated by the Law on the Ombudsman (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 60/03). Under its provisions, in cases when the Ombudsman
has detected unlawful actions, inappropriate treatment of citizens or other irregularities, and with the
purpose of exercise of citizens’ rights, he/she may give the state administrative bodies recommendations,
proposals, opinions or directions to eliminate the detected violations. In the period from 1 January 2002 to
30 September 2004, the Ombudsman submitted 1319 recommendations, proposals, opinions or
suggestions, proposing renewal of procedures in accordance with the law or initiation of a disciplinary
procedure against officials/responsible civil servants. In the same period, the Ombudsman himself
submitted one proposal for initiation of a disciplinary procedure. In the period from 1 January 2002 to 30
September 2004, the Ombudsman submitted six requests to the Public Prosecutor for initiation of
procedure to determine criminal liability (data from the Ombudsman’s published reports and the
Ombudsman’s archive records). Pursuant to Article 32 of the Law, if the administrative bodies fail to act
upon a submitted request, proposal, opinion, recommendation or if they comply therewith only partially,
the Ombudsman shall notify thereof the immediately superior authority, the head of the respective state
administrative body or the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. Pursuant to Article 34 and 35 of the
Law, if the fail to act, the Ombudsman may bring out the case to the media (for more details see I_G_6).
Protection of Constitutionality and Legality by the Constitutional Court
In accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (Articles 108, 110, 112) performing
its basic function of protecting constitutionality and legality, the Constitutional Court decides on the
conformity of laws and of other regulations with the Constriction and the laws. The Constitutional
Court shall annul or abrogate a law if it determines that it is not in conformity with the Constitution. It

61/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

will furthermore annul or abrogate a regulation or another legal act if it determines that it does not
conform to the Constitution and the laws.
Such position of the Constitutional Court provides additional control over the operation of the
Government and the state administration as a whole – both as a proposers of laws and as a “creator”
of secondary legislation.
9. What is done to ensure that the public service is open and transparent? Can any citizen
affected by an administrative action find out the basis for the action?
Transparency
Article 16 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia guarantees free access to information.
This constitutional principle is further transposed in many laws which stipulate that the work of state
administration and public bodies is public.
Article 52 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia requires that all laws and other regulations
be published in the “Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” before entering into force.
Laws and regulations in the Republic of Macedonia provide guarantees for transparency during the
drafting and the decision-making process (for more details see I_C_11), as well as in the actions of
the public administration in the enforcement of laws and other regulations.
The Law on Organisation and Operation of the State Administrative Bodies (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 58/00 and 44/02), declares transparency as one of the principles of the
operation of the state administration. Its provisions stipulate that state bodies inform the public about
their work.
Article 70 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and the Rules of Procedure of the
Assembly of Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 60/02), the
sittings of the Assembly and of its working bodies are open to the public. The Assembly may also
decide to hold an open public discussion on a preliminary draft law, or hold a public hearing on a
draft law.
According to the Law on the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00 and 12/03), the Government is obliged to inform the public of its
work and the implementation of its Annual Work Programme. The Government will not publish
information concerning the national security, official and business secrets, neither the personal data
of the citizens according to the law that regulates protection of personal data.
The Rules of Procedure of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 38/01, 98/02, 47/03, 64/03 and 67/03), define the modes of providing
information about the work of the Government to the public and prescribes an obligation for the
Members of the Government to inform the public about the work of the Government and the
ministries. Furthermore, the Government has undertaken measures to enable closer communication
with the public through strengthening the public relations units within the Government and the state
administrative bodies and developing a communication strategy.
The Law on Local Self-Government (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 5/02),
obliges the bodies of the local self-government units to inform the citizens about their work, as well as
about the plans and the programmes that are of importance for the development of the municipality.
The municipality is obliged to provide the citizens access to the essential information about the
services it provides, in a manner and under conditions that are determined by the Statute. Similarly to
the obligation for publicising laws and regulations at the level of the state, the regulations of the
municipality must be published before they enter into force in a mode determined by the Statute.
According to Article 21 of the Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
Nos. 59/00, 112/00, 34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04 and 69/04), the state

62/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

employee is obliged, in accordance with the law, in a manner and under conditions determined by the
law or other regulation, and upon request of citizens to provide information for fulfilment of their rights
and interests, unless the information is a state or business secret.
Administrative Procedure
The principle of legality is the basic principle of the Law on General Administrative Procedure “Official
Gazette of SFRY”, 47/86 -consolidated text and “Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No.
44/02). Additionally, it establishes the principles of efficiency, material truth, interrogation of the concerned
party, evaluation of the evidence, independence in the decision making process, the right to appeal,
effective decision, cost-effectiveness of the process, assistance to an ignorant concerned party,
subsidiary implementation of the law, the usage of the languages and the alphabets, protection of the
rights of the citizens and the protection of public interest.
This law furthermore in detail defines the procedure (all its phases and elements, the rights of the Parties,
conduct of procedure), legal remedies and enforcement in administrative matters.
The Law is applied by state administrative bodies, other state bodies, public bodies vested with public
authority, and municipal bodies. It comprises the principle of subsidiarity, which means that if a specific
area administrative issues are regulated with a special law, the administrative body acts in accordance
with the law.
In line with the principle of legality, the state administrative bodies decide on the basis of the law and
other regulations. Each administrative case is decided by a body determined by law, in a procedure
defined by law.
The body which by a law or a by-law (based on a law) is authorised to deliver decisions upon
discretionary assessment must deliver the decision within the limits of the given authority and in line with
the aim of the authorisation (Article 4 of the Law). Furthermore, it is stipulated that the state administrative
body conducts the administrative procedure and delivers a decision within the scope of authority defined
by law or other regulations. The decision is issued by the head of the relevant body, if it is not otherwise
regulated by specific regulations. The head may authorise an official (a civil servant) to conduct the
administrative procedure in certain matters. The authorised official of the administrative body responsible
for the relevant administrative procedure establishes the facts and the circumstances independently,
applying the relevant laws and regulations to the specific case (Article 10 of the Law).
The decision in the administrative procedure is based on facts established upon evidence. In conducting
the administrative procedure, the authorised official examines the concerned party’s request, gathers
evidence and considers all relevant regulations. In the process of producing evidence, the official may:
hold a hearing upon his/her initiative or on the initiative of the party whereby participation of concerned
parties is granted and the hearing is officially recorded in minutes, request documents; summon
witnesses; ask for a statement; request expertise; perform an on-site inspection, at which the Party may
be present.
Every citizen who has submitted a request for the realisation of his/her rights to an administrative
body, has a right throughout the administrative procedure to be informed which administrative actions
are undertaken. He/she is also granted the right to examine all the documents contained in the file
and copy the needed files in the presence of a given public official on his/her own expense. The right
to review the materials is also guaranteed to another person who would prove his/her legal interest.
The Law prescribes in detail the content of the decision in administrative cases, thus providing the
concerned Party with clear information of the basis, substance and arguments for the administrative
decision. The decision consists of: introduction, disposition, explanation, instruction on legal remedy, title
of the administrative body, number and date, signature of the responsible official and stamp of the
administrative body. The introduction consists of: the title of the body delivering the decision, legal base of
the competence of this body, name of the concerned party and its legal representative or a proxy (if any),
and a short reference of the case. The disposition contains the substance of the decision – on the
complete subject of the case, including all the requests of the Party. The explanation of the decision

63/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

includes of: a summary of the requests of the party, the established factual situation and additionally, if
necessary, the decisive arguments for each element of the decision. The explanation of the decision in
simple matters and only including one party or a positive non-contested decision referring to more parties
may be summarised and issued on a pre-prepared form. If the decision included discretionary
assessment, this has to be specifically elaborated in the explanation, including a reference to the legal
ground. The instruction on legal remedy consists of information on the body to which and the term within
which the Party has the right to file a complaint.
Furthermore, the parties that live in a local self-government unit in which at least 20% of the population
speaks an official language other than the Macedonian have the right to communicate with the local
offices of the ministries in their language. For these local self-government units the local offices are
obliged to respond in the language and alphabet used by the Party, in addition to Macedonian.
Furthermore, in the administrative procedure these parties may submit documents in their language,
while the bodies conducting the administrative procedure will translate them and act upon them. The
bodies conducting the procedure, in deciding in administrative matters, respond to these parties in
Macedonian and in the language used by the Party.
The decision in first instance must be delivered within two months form the lodging of the request if
the administrative procedure entailed thorough examination, and one month if the procedure was
simple. If the decision is not issued in the prescribed term, the Party has the right to appeal, as if the
request were refused.
The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (Article 15) grants the right to appeal against individual
decisions issued in first instance proceeding by a court, administrative body, organisation or other
institution vested with public mandate.
In Line with the Law on the Government (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00 and
12/03), the Government of the Republic of Macedonia has established 14 second-instance commissions
to act in administrative matters. According to the Law on the Government and its the Rules of Procedure,
these commissions, in principle, have a chairperson, 4 members and their substitutes. A minister or a
deputy minister may be appointed chairperson of the Commission, while the members are from the rank
of managing and expert civil servants form the ministries, other state administrative bodies and the
General Secretariat of the Government. Officials that take part in deciding in the respective administrative
matters in first instance may not be appointed members of the second-instance commission.
If the second instance body in the time-period of sixty (60) days or less (in cases specific laws
provide for a shorter term) does not deliver a decision, and fails to do so in additional seven days
following an additional request of the Party, the Party may initiate an administrative dispute, as if the
appeal were rejected (for more details see I_C_8).
The official who is conducting the administrative procedure is responsible, if as a result of his/her
fault certain procedural actions in the procedure have not been completed.
A new Draft-law on General Administrative Procedure is in parliamentary procedure.
10. What are the procedures for administrative control to guarantee citizens’ rights of
recourse against public service actions? Describe these (e.g. parliamentary committees,
ombudsman's office, internal and external audit, inspectorates, standard-setting authorities).
The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (Article 24) guarantees the citizens’ right to file petitions
before, and receive responses from state bodies and other public services. At the same time, the
Constitution provides that a citizen may not be held accountable nor suffer adverse consequences due to
attitudes expressed in petitions, unless committing a criminal act.
Besides this general constitutional provision and in addition to the court protection (for more details see
I_C_8), there are a number of institutes in the Republic of Macedonia, by which administrative control is
ensured in order to guarantee the citizens’ right of recourse against actions of public services.

64/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

For the protection of their rights against public services’ actions, citizens may address the following
institutions: the Standing Inquiry Committee within the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, the
Ombudsman, the State Administrative Inspectorate as a body within the Ministry of Justice, as well as
other inspection bodies.
Standing Inquiry Committee for Protection of Citizen’s Rights and Freedoms
The Committee is established by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, pursuant to the
Constitution. The Committee, among others, explores issues pertaining to the implementation of
Constitutional provisions, laws and other regulations and acts important for the exercise and protection of
civil rights and freedoms. The Committee also considers submissions from citizens and decides on
position upon them (for more details see I_B_2).
A total of 74 petitions were submitted before the Committee in 2003, 30 of which were collective and 44 of
which were individual petitions. Petitions referred to the following: labour relations - 16, court matters 14, administrative procedure - 10, social affairs - 6, police conduct - 5, urban planning - 4, matters
pertaining to status in public or private enterprises - 4, displaced persons - 4, operation of state
administration and local self-government - 4, public prosecution issues - 3 etc.
Following the petitions, the Committee’s actions included: hearing of 47 petitioners, giving guidelines to
33 petitioners for the exercise of their rights and request of information from the competent bodies in 32
cases.
In the period from January to September 2004, the Committee received a total of 83 petitions which were
considered and upon which action was taken.
After petitions by citizens or initiatives by Committee Members have been considered, and upon a
previously provided information by the competent state administrative bodies or institutions, the
Committee adopts appropriate conclusions requesting, recommending or pointing to respective bodies to
bring their work in line with the legal rights of citizens. The Committee also has direct contacts with
citizens or groups of citizens whose rights have been violated.
In addition, the Committee reviews periodic or annual reports on the operation of bodies and institutions
which deal with the protection of constitutional and legal rights of citizens and adopts conclusions
pointing to measures that are to be undertaken in order to provide for their more efficient exercise, while
taking into account the competences of these bodies.
The Committee cooperates with the Ombudsman, the State Administrative Inspectorate, the State
Commission for Prevention of Corruption, the Judicial Council of the Republic, the Broadcasting Council,
etc.
The Committee’s findings represent a basis for the initiation of the procedure to determine public officeholders’ responsibility.
Ombudsman of the Republic of Macedonia
The Office of the Ombudsman was established pursuant to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia
and the Law on the Ombudsman (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 60/03). Citizens of
the Republic of Macedonia and any other person may file petitions to the Ombudsman in cases when
their rights, granted by Constitution and law have been violated by state administrative bodies, bodies
and organisations with public mandates as well as public institutions and services.
The procedure before the Ombudsman is regulated by the Law on the Ombudsman and the
Ombudsman’s Rules of Procedure, under which the Ombudsman may also initiate procedures upon
his/her own initiative. If in the petition or during the investigating procedure, violations of the constitutional
and legal rights of the petitioner or of the person on whose behalf the procedure has been initiated are
detected, the Ombudsman shall, in accordance with his/her legal competence, undertake measures to

65/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

eliminate the illegal actions of the public administration and to ensure the exercise of the rights of the
petitioner or of the person on whose behalf the procedure has been initiated.
Concerning the operation of its Office and the degree to which human rights and freedoms have been
respected, the Ombudsman submits an annual report to the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia.
Over the past period, the Ombudsman has submitted six annual reports which have been publicly
announced and made available to citizens, governmental and non-governmental organisations and
international bodies and organisations.
The Office of the Ombudsman in 2003 received 2605 petitions, which represented an increase of 38,
71% compared with the previous year. The majority of petitions were in the following areas: judiciary –
415, labour relations – 406, property relations - 267, protection of rights in police procedure – 266, urban
planning and civil engineering – 209, utility and other fees – 188, pension and disability insurance – 169,
social affairs - 167, housing relations - 161, protection of children’s rights - 62, health care - 46, education,
science, culture and sport - 26, finances and financial transactions – 22. The remaining petitions referred
to other areas.
Over the period from January to September 2004, the Office of the Ombudsman received 1521 petitions
in various areas. Procedure was initiated upon 957 of these cases.
It follows from the Ombudsman’ practice so far that citizens most often complain on delays of procedures
in judicial and administrative bodies, encountered difficulties in the sphere of housing and social affairs,
unemployment and other civil rights. Complaints pertaining to fundamental freedoms and rights
guaranteed by the Constitution or international acts and documents were less frequent (for more details
see I_G_6).
External (State Audit)
Pursuant to the Law on State Audit (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 73/04 –
consolidated text), the external audit entails: review of documents, licences or reports on the
performed internal control and audit; review of accounting and financial procedures and other records
in terms of whether financial reports are accurate and present realistically the financial situation and
effects of financial transactions under the accepted accounting principles and standards and the
INTOSAI International Auditing Standards.
The state audit also includes assessment of the use of resources in terms of cost-effectiveness and
efficiency.
Subject to an external audit are the following: Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, budgets of the
local self-government units, funds’ budgets, budget beneficiaries and individual budget beneficiaries,
public enterprises, National Bank, legal entities in which the state is the dominant shareholder,
political parties funded from the Budget, agencies and other institutions established pursuant to the
law, other publicly funded institutions and beneficiaries of funds of the European Union and other
international organisations.
Pursuant to the existing Law, external audit encompasses: inspection of documents and reports on
the internal control and audit that has been carried out as well as inspection of accounting and
financial procedures and other records from the aspect of whether such financial reports truthfully
and objectively represent the financial situation and the results from financial operations as
prescribed by accounting principles and standards, including the International Audits Standards of
INTOSAI.
The external audit is conducted in accordance with the timeframe determined in the Annual
Programme of the State Audit Office which is adopted by the Chief State Auditor. The Programme
includes:

66/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

1. Entities subject to regular annual audit pursuant to the Law: the funds’ budgets, beneficiaries of
funds under the State Budget and the budget of the local self-government units, public enterprises
and Budget funded political parties, and
2. Entities subject to audit in a certain number of years. Since no inclusion of all entities is possible
within the Annual Programme, the selection is done under the following criteria: potential risks of
deviations within the entities; percentage of their participation in the budgetary expenditures;
information gathered from the media; written or verbal information; information collected during
debates in the Assembly and in the municipal councils; submissions of the State Commission for
Prevention of Corruption; findings of previously conducted audits and individual requests for audits.
The external audit is conducted by authorised state auditors and state auditors, employed in the
State Audit Office (for more details see 28_I_A_1). Pursuant to the Law, the State Audit Office
submits an annual report on the conducted audits and on its operation before the Assembly of the
Republic of Macedonia. In addition, the State Audit Office publishes its reports on its official web site,
which is an obligation determined by law.
Internal Audit
The internal audit in the public sector is regulated by the Law on Internal Audit in the Public Sector
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 69/04), and the Rulebooks on the Modes of
Conduct of Internal Audit. Pursuant to the Law, the internal audit has been defined as an
independent and objective activity of checking of information, verifying their accuracy and providing
advice, which is aimed at enhanced operation of the entities. It assists the entities to fulfil their
objectives by applying a planned, strictly determined approach of evaluation and enhancement of
risk-management, control and management practices.
All public sector entities are obliged to establish internal auditing units, provide resources for their
operation and ensure their organisational and functional independence. Depending on their
competences and the number of their employees, the internal audit in various state administration or
other bodies has been organised in departments or units.
Pursuant to the Government Conclusions of its Session held on 26.01.2004, the development of
internal audit and enhancement of financial control within budget beneficiaries and funds shall be
conducted in three stages:
−

The first stage entails establishment, by 31.03.2004, of internal auditing units in 17 large-scale
budget beneficiaries and training of 23 internal auditors by 30.04.2004;
− The second stage includes training of internal auditors in the other budget beneficiaries and
establishment of their internal auditing units by the end of 2005;
− The third stage entails training of internal auditors in the local self-government units and
establishment of their internal auditing units by 31.03.2006.
The first stage of setting up internal auditing units has been completed and within 15 budget
beneficiaries and funds such units have now been established.
Inspection over the enforcement and implementation of legal and other regulations is carried out by
the state administrative bodies (inspectorates) within their competences pursuant to the law.
Pursuant to the Law on Organisation and Operation of the State Administrative Bodies, internal
auditors put forward initiatives for inspection and monitor the measures undertaken by the inspection
authorities (for more details see 28_I_B_11).

State Administrative Inspectorate
Pursuant to Article 17 of the Law on Organisation and Operation of the State Administrative Bodies, the
State Administrative Inspectorate is a body within the Ministry of Justice, which deals matters of
administrative inspection in the Republic of Macedonia.
The scope of work of the State Administrative Inspection is defined in the Law on Administrative
Inspection (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 69/04).
The inspection is carried out ex officio pursuant to the Annual Programme for the Inspectorate’s
Operation and pursuant to monthly plans, as well as upon initiatives and proposals submitted by citizens,
organisations and entities which, in exercise of their rights, interests and obligations, encounter
irregularities in the operation of state administrative bodies or institutions with public mandates.
The inspection is carried out in state administrative bodies, other state bodies, organisations, public
services, institutions and other legal entities with legally assigned public mandates which decide in
administrative matters, as well as in municipalities, the City of Skopje and municipalities within the City of
Skopje when, as part of their competences, they decide in administrative matters on the rights,
obligations and legal interests of natural persons and legal entities pursuant to law.
When conducting the supervision, inspectors are authorised to carry out inspection into the enforcement
of laws and other regulations and to request related information, order elimination of irregularities in the
application of laws and other regulations, order specific manners of action in the state administrative body
or the administrative organisation with public mandates. State administrative bodies and institutions with
public mandates are obliged to enable unimpeded inspection and conduct of the administrative
supervision and, if requested by the inspector, provide him/her with the necessary materials within a
determined period. When an inspector detects violation of regulations, the enforcement of which is
supervised by another body, he/she has to immediately notify of such findings. If the inspector considers
that by such violation a criminal act, a misdemeanour or severe violation of duties has been committed,
he/she is obliged, without delays, to raise criminal charges, submit request for initiation of misdemeanour
procedure or submit request for initiation of procedure to determine responsibility for severe violation of
duties. If he/she has determined that a certain act is not in compliance with a law or another regulation,
the inspector shall request from the state administrative body to eliminate within certain deadline the
detected irregularities. If the respective body fails to do so, the inspector may initiate a procedure for
assessing the constitutionality and legality of the disputed act.
In 2003, the State Administrative Inspectorate carried out 832 supervisions, 454 of which were regular

the Law on General Administrative Procedure and in material laws; 3685 cases were resolved after the
expiry of the legally prescribed deadline; in 827 cases it was impossible to determine the time of their
resolution due to the non-existence of evidence as to a successful delivery of the administrative acts;
5169 cases were not resolved although the legal deadlines were expired and in 2345 cases the period for
their resolution was running. In order to ensure elimination of irregularities detected during inspection, the

Inspectors prepare minutes on the conducted inspection, presenting the detected situation. Elimination of
the detected irregularities is ordered by a decision which also prescribes deadlines. On measures
undertaken upon the decision, the respective bodies are obliged to inform the inspectorate within the
determined deadlines. Inspectors ensure enforcement of the decision by which elimination of the
detected irregularities has been ordered, by conducting controlling inspections and preparing minutes
thereof. Inspectors are entitled to act upon petitions, requests, initiatives and other submissions by
citizens and legal entities, when their rights have been violated by state administrative bodies.
Other Inspection Authorities
Inspection is carried out only by the state administrative bodies within their competences. For the
purpose of conducting supervision, inspectorates have been established as bodies within the
respective ministries. Inspection is performed by inspectors. An inspector initiates the inspection
procedure ex officio and upon requests, proposals and initiatives submitted by citizens. He/she
conducts the inspection in accordance with the rules of administrative procedure and is obliged to act
in compliance with law or other regulation.

Political Criteria

The Assembly votes separately on each of the amendments submitted to the draft amendments to
the Constitution by a majority vote of the total number of representatives. The Assembly by a majority
vote of the total number of representatives determines each draft amendment individually and the
draft amendments as a whole.
Pursuant to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and the Assembly’s Rules of Procedure, a
proposal to adopt the law may be put forward by each of the representatives in the Assembly, the
Government and at least 10,000 voters. These are the authorised law proposers.
Pursuant to the Constitution and the Rules of Procedure of the Assembly of the Republic of
Macedonia, any citizen, group of citizens, institutions and associations may submit to an authorised
proposer an initiative to adopt a law. The initiative submitted to the Assembly is then forwarded to the
representatives and the Government. If the authorised proposer accepts the initiative for adoption of
the law, he/she may submit to the Assembly a text of the proposal to adopt the law.
When the Government is authorised to propose the law, it shall be drafted by the ministry competent
in the respective area. The Ministry which has drafted the proposal to adopt a law, prior to submitting
it for review before the Government, requests an opinion from any ministry or a state administrative
body the competence of which have common aspects with the subject matter governed by the

the EU legislation.
When, upon a request by the Government, the proposal to adopt the law has been drafted by a
special committee, scientific or specialised institution or by individual experts or academics, the

Secretariat. The legal practice in the Republic of Macedonia requires that the competent state
administrative body which observes the developments in the respective field conducts analyses in
that particular field, determines the legal and factual state of affairs and identifies the need for
regulation of specific issues before the text of the proposal to adopt the law is drafted.
As part of the analyses, the competent body shall survey opinions, attitudes, interests and
requirements submitted before it by stakeholders (citizens, non-governmental organisations, legal
entities). In the phase of the preparation of the law, the participation of stakeholders is ensured by
way of public announcement of the text of the law, by organisation of public hearings etc. When
making the analyses, the competent body shall, if it deems it necessary, consult academics or
experts in that particular field. In addition to the analyses, it shall conduct comparative research of the
methods of regulation of the particular area in other countries.
The competent state administrative body which monitors the implementation of the laws in the
respective area shall also conduct assessment of whether the objectives have been reached i.e.
whether the practical application of the laws is efficient and sound. It shall point to all the detected
weaknesses or ambiguities and shall put forward suggestions on how to overcome them in the law
that is to be drafted. Based on this, the drafting of the initial text of the law the adoption of which is to
be proposed shall commence. At this stage, the practice has been that more alternatives are
proposed on the regulation of certain issues in the law. Laws which require their harmonisation with
the EU legislation are drafted with assistance of foreign experts or are submitted for expertise that
will enable consistent transposition of EU directives in the national legislation. When drafting the
provisions of laws, efforts are made to ensure that they are expressed clearly, in the concise manner
that ambiguities are avoided, and that provisions are mutually consistent and harmonised.
With regard to the structure of the laws, particular attention is paid to ensure that they include section
of general/basic provisions, special part which includes substantial legal provisions, transitional and
final provisions and provisions regulating the entry into force of the law. Depending on the
substantive issues regulated in a specific law, it may also include sections on supervision and penal
provisions.

state administrative body may decide that the supervision is conducted by a specialised organisation
in the respective area.
The supervision over the work of the ministries is conducted by the Government.
The supervision over the work of the bodies within the ministries is performed by the relevant
ministries. Supervision over the operation of other state administrative bodies is conducted by the
ministry competent for the administrative matters for which the respective body has been established.
The supervision over the work of an administrative organisation is performed by the ministry
competent for the administrative matters for which the respective organisation has been established.
Supervision over the implementation and application of laws and other regulations on the part of the
state bodies, public enterprises, companies, institutions, natural persons and legal entities, is
conducted as an inspection by the state administrative bodies as part of their competences.
For the purpose of performing inspection, an inspectorate may be established as a body within a
ministry. Inspection duties are performed by inspectors.
Everyone is entitled to put forward an initiative for inspection and to propose that appropriate
measures be taken by the ministries or state administrative bodies competent to perform inspection.
An inspector starts and manages the inspection ex officio, in accordance with the rules of the
administrative procedure.
In doing so, the inspector shall prepare minutes for the inspection performed, by which he/she shall
take note of the actual situation. If he/she identifies specific irregularities, he/she shall make a
decision to undertake administrative measures determined by the law in that particular field. The
inspector may also submit a request for initiation of a misdemeanour i.e. criminal procedure if he/she
has found that a misdemeanour i.e. a criminal act has been committed as a consequence of the
irregular application of the regulation.

Within the exercise of its rights, duties and responsibilities, the Government harmonises and guides
the operation of the state administrative bodies and may decide on general principles of the
implementation of the determined policy and application of laws, other regulations and general acts
passed by the Assembly or the Government. Furthermore, it may impose on these bodies a duty to
adopt specific regulations and to take measures within their authorisation, may set deadlines for
implementation of certain activities within their competence and request that they explore
developments in areas within their scope of actions, report to the Government and propose
appropriate measures.
In addition to these methods of supervision, our legal system provides also for a preventive
supervision, which most often entails approval of statutes. Namely, the Government i.e. the
municipality gives approval to the statutes of public enterprises it has established. Furthermore, it
approves the amendments to the statute or changes in the organisation of a public enterprise, its
regulation on the use of the accrued funds and on the covering of losses, its borrowing act, its act
setting its products and services’ prices, its balance sheet, the enterprise's business report and its
annual investment programme harmonised with the overall economic development.
Statutes of public services and institutions established by the Government are approved by the
ministries competent in the respective fields.
Certain laws set forth duties for specific bodies to report to the ministries and to the Government. For
example, pursuant to Article 67 of the Health Insurance Law (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 25/00, 36/00, 30/01, 48/01, 50/01, 11/02 and 31/03), the Health Insurance Fund is
obliged to submit a report on its operation to the Ministry of Health and to the Government at least
once a year. Pursuant to Article 162 paragraph 3 of the Law on Pension and Disability Insurance
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 80/93, 3/94, 14/95, 35/95, 40/96, 70/96, 71/96,
24/97, 25/97, 32/97, 24/00, 96/00, 5/01, 58/01, 85/03 and 50/04), the Management Board of the
Pension and Disability Fund has to report about its work to the Government of the Republic of
Macedonia, at least once a year. Pursuant to Article 54 of the Law on Fully Funded Pension
Insurance (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 29/02 and 85/03), the Agency for
Supervision of Fully Funded Pension Insurance submits a report about its work in the previous year
to the Government. Its report is adopted by the Government.
The Law on Local Self-government governs the control over the legality of municipal regulations
before and after their publication in the municipal official gazette. Thus, the mayor conducts control
over the legality of the councils’ regulations before their publication. If the mayor considers that a
council’s regulation does not comply with the Constitution or a law, he/she is obliged to suspend its
publication by enacting, within 7 days form its submission, a decision elaborating on the reasons for
its suspension. The council is obliged, within 15 days from the day of the publication of the decision,
to review it and decide on it. If the council approves the regulation, the mayor is obliged to publish it
and, at the same time, to submit an initiative for a procedure before the Constitutional Court in order
to assess the constitutionality and legality of the disputed regulation. For such an initiative, the mayor
is obliged to inform the minister of Local Self-government.
The Ministry of Local Self-government conducts supervision over the legality of regulations of the
units of local self-government and the City of Skopje. The mayor is obliged, no later than 10 days
from the day of publication of a municipal regulation, to forward it to the Ministry of Local Selfgovernment. If the Ministry of Local Self-government considers that the respective regulation is not in
compliance with the Constitution or a law, it is obliged to suspend its application by enacting, within
45 days from its submission, a decision elaborating on the reasons for its suspension. Such a
decision is published in the “Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”. Within 30 days from the
day of the publication of the decision, the Ministry of Local Self-government shall submit to the
Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia an initiative to assess the constitutionality and
legality of the suspended regulation. If no procedure is initiated before the Constitutional Court within
this deadline, the validity of the decision suspending the application of the municipal regulation shall
terminate and it shall become effective.

Prior supervision exists on the local level, as well, and it entails prior approval of the municipal
regulations. If, when adopting a municipal regulation, prior approval is required by another body, it
shall provide such approval within 60 days from the day the draft regulation has been submitted to it.
If the prior approval has not been provided within this period, the regulation shall be deemed
accepted as it has been proposed by the municipality.
12. What mechanisms exist to link strategic planning and budgeting, in each Ministry, at
Governmental level?
Basic governmental mechanisms linking strategic and budgetary planning in each of the ministries
are defined in the Decision on the Methodology of Strategic Planning and Drafting of the Government
of the Republic of Macedonia Annual Work Programme and the Budget Circular.
The strategic planning process provides the Government with a mechanism to identify the objectives
deemed priority (identification of priorities). By integrating the process of identifying priorities with the
budgetary process, the Government’s capacity to carry out its functions has substantially increased.
The most important point taken into account by the Government in the strategic planning process is
the fact that the budget funds are limited i.e. that the Government has limited financial power to carry
out its plans.
Therefore, due to
budgetary process,
Government of the
Finance are jointly
process.

the inter-connection between the process of definition of priorities and the
the Strategy, Planning and Monitoring Sector in the General Secretariat of the
Republic of Macedonia and the Budgets and Funds Sector in the Ministry of
responsible to coordinate the process of defining priorities and the budgetary

The strategic planning is a complex process that involves all ministries. It affects the policy
development process in such a way that it clarifies what policy-related compromises and trade-offs
have to be made in order to accommodate the process of policy implementation in a fiscally restricted
budget framework. For that purpose, the required institutional capacities are being developed within
the ministries (sectors or units) which should support the strategic planning and the budget
preparation process and ensure that each budget user prepares its budget submission in accordance
with the previously developed strategic plan.
1. Definition of Government strategic priorities
The first step in the strategic planning process is the definition of Government strategic priorities.
Strategic priorities entail major changes relating to specific issues and problems that the Government
intends to address.
Strategic priorities are established on a general level and are more wide-ranging than the specific
initiatives by the ministries.
Several ministries may engage in the definition and implementation of strategic priorities. The
strategic priorities may refer to a period of several years, and as they greatly influence the human
and financial resources in the next year budget, they exceed individual ministry’s capacity.
The selected priorities are determined by a Government decision. The decision is preceded by an
analysis prepared by the General Secretariat of the Government on the basis of existing documents
that contain guidelines for development of the government policies. Accordingly, at the start of the
process of definition of 2004 strategic priorities, the Government’s General Secretariat prepared an
analysis based on the Programme presented by its President upon his appointment, the existing
development-related documents, the Framework Agreement etc. In accordance with the analysis, the
Secretariat drafted a Decision on the Strategic Priorities of the Government of the Republic of
Macedonia for 2004, adopted by the Government on its Session held on 9.06.2003.
The Government approved six strategic priorities for 2004:

Implementation of the Framework Agreement;
Employment increase and poverty reduction;
Stabilisation of the country’s security and defence and the NATO integration process;
The EU integration process;
Fight against organised crime and corruption and strengthening of the rule of law;
Public sector optimisation.

Taking into account the political developments in the country, the Government adopted the Decision
on the Strategic Priorities of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia for 2005, on 6.09.2004:
I. Strategic priorities of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia are, in continuity, NATO
and European Union integration.
II. As priority objectives and initiatives in the implementation of the 2005 strategic priorities, the
following have been established:
1. Full and consistent implementation of the Constitutional amendments, laws and other
regulations stemming from the Framework Agreement and implementation of the remaining
obligations thereof;
2. Decentralisation of power and development of local self-government;
3. Judicial reform;
4. Strengthening the fight against organised crime and corruption;
5. Accelerating the economic development, providing incentive for the domestic and attracting
foreign investments;
6. Strengthening the market economy and reduction of unemployment and poverty.
2. Allocation of funds for strategic priorities as part of the Fiscal Strategy
Following the adoption of the Decision on the Strategic Priorities, the Government initiates the budget
process by establishing the next year fiscal projections and by adopting a fiscal strategy. At this
stage, the Government sets the overall expenditures limit on the basis of the fiscal balance or
projected deficit, and the revenue projections. Within the overall expenditure limit, the Government
establishes “set-aside“ funds for the strategic priorities.
The amount of funds allocated for the strategic priorities is determined by the fiscal plan potentials,
while taking into account the realistically probable savings amount.
The competent ministry for the preparation of the Fiscal Strategy is the Ministry of Finance which
proposes, in consultation with the General Secretariat, the “set-aside” funds that are to be allocated
for support of the Government strategic priorities.
The Government of the Republic of Macedonia projected an amount of 400.000.000 MKD in the
2004-2006 Fiscal Strategy to finance specific initiatives and activities of the ministries and other state
bodies that support the implementation of the 2004 strategic priorities. Funds in the amount of
492.706.000 MKD to support the implementation of the strategic priorities were allocated in the 2004
Budget.
3. Establishment of individual priority initiatives to implement the strategic priorities of the
Government
Following the establishment of the overall amount of “set-aside” funds to carry out the strategic
priorities of the Government in the Fiscal Strategy, the General Secretariat and the Ministry of
Finance jointly recommend for approval by the Government the initiatives submitted by specific line
ministries, including an assessment of the extent to which they contribute to the implementation of
the strategic priorities and their viability in the context of the allocated funds for specific purposes in
the Fiscal Strategy.

Chapter I

Political Criteria

Once the initiatives that are to be financed from the next year budget have been determined, the
ministries incorporate them in their strategic plans and budget calculations. The decisions on
approval of the initiatives and on the ministries budget submissions based on the budget circular are
taken separately. Although both procedures preceding the decision-making process are carried-out
almost concurrently, the decision on the initiatives is made prior to the completion of the ministries’
budget proposals, in order to enable incorporation of the approved initiatives in the overall Budget
Proposal for the next year.
4. Establishment and adoption of strategic plans and ministries' budget proposals
The budget proposal is a supplement to and a document appended to the ministries’ strategic plans.
The strategic plan presents the main goals and priorities of the respective ministry, provides
description of each of the programmes and the manner in which it contributes to the achievement of
the ministry’s objectives, as well as the strategies that the ministry will follow - all these within the
budget limitations. To this end, one of the basic qualitative changes proposed with the 2005 Budget
Circular is the integration of the strategic plans of the budget users within the budget planning
process. In accordance with the 2003 Action Plan for Implementation of the Recommendations
included in the European Commission’s Stabilisation and Association Report on the Republic of
Macedonia, as well as the 2004 European Partnership Action Plan the budget users are obliged to
prepare functional analyses, including a separate document – a Strategic Plan. The following budget
users have already prepared their strategic plans: Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Finance, General
Secretariat of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, Customs Administration, State Audit
Office, Directorate for Protection of Classified Information, Protection and Rescue Directorate,
Commodity Reserves Bureau, Civil Aviation Administration, Hydro-Meteorological Directorate,
Veterinary Directorate, State Archive and Struga Penitentiary. The development of strategic plans is
underway in the other budget users.
The budget submission provides detailed description of the manners in which the ministry allocates
its resources for the programmes and the strategies indicated in its strategic plan.
The deadlines for submission of the budget proposals and strategic plans of the ministries are
coordinated. The Ministry of Finance and the General Secretariat provide coordinated assessment of
the plans and budget proposals of the ministries, in particular in terms of implementation of the
Government priorities. In addition, the Ministry of Finance checks the accuracy and rationality of the
projected expenditures and the allocation of funds, i.e. whether they comply with the fiscal strategy
and the budget circular letter.
5. Establishment of the Government Annual Work Programme
Once the specific priorities have been defined as part of the budgetary process, a detailed
Government Annual Work Programme is developed, in accordance with the Government’s Rules of
Procedure.
The Annual Work Programme includes a list of documents and draft-regulations that the ministries
plan to submit before the Government in the course of the year. In addition to the initiatives defined
through the budget process, the list also includes other priorities related in particular to the European
Union integration and to the obligations under various international agreements, as well as to
individual priorities of the ministries. In case these initiatives require funds, they are to be coordinated
through the budgetary process.
The Government’s General Secretariat is responsible for the drafting of the Annual Work
Programme. The activities undertaken by the General Secretariat when drafting the Annual
Programme include an assessment of the extent to which the ministries' programmes are in line with
the Government strategic priorities and whether specific initiatives are not included. Consistency
between the ministries’ programmes and the budget funds provided for such programmes is ensured
through coordination of the General Secretariat’s work with the Ministry of Finance.

6. Monitoring of the implementation of the Government strategic priorities and the Annual Work
Programme
The Government monitors the pace of implementation of the strategic priorities and the Annual Work
Programme. An analysis of the achievements is made by the end of the year. The General
Secretariat coordinates the monitoring.
13. What structures exist to ensure the coordination of European Integration issues?
Pursuing its commitment to integrate in the European Union, ever since 1992, the Republic of
Macedonia has been developing structures in charge of relations with the European Union and for
coordination of European integration issues. The development of the European integration
coordination structure has in continuity been motivated by the goal of the Republic of Macedonia to
accede to the European Union, clearly defined as early as its independence, and has followed the
advancement of the Euro-integration process in the country.
Today this system has the following basic structure:
Parliamentarian (legislative) level - Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia:
−

Committee on European Affairs;

Government (executive) level:
−
−
−

Committee for Euro-Atlantic Integration;
Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Macedonia;
Minister of Foreign Affairs;

Central (administrative) level:
−
−
−

Sector for European Integration;
Ministry of Foreign Affairs;
European integration units in the Ministries;

Inter-ministerial structure:
−

−

Working Committee on European Integration (substructure: Sub-Committee on Approximation
of Legislation and the Working Groups on Harmonisation of Legislation with the acquis
communautaire);
Committee of Ministers for Foreign Aid Coordination (substructure: Coordinative Technical
Group).

(See Organigram: I_Annex_04)
Following a Decision of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia” Nos. 62/97 and 12/98), the Committee on Euro-Atlantic Integration was
established, chaired by the Prime Minister of the Republic of Macedonia. The members of the
Committee are the Deputy Prime Ministers, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Finance,
the Minister of Defence, the Minister of Internal Affairs, the Minister of Justice, the Minister of
Economy, the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Resources Management, the Minister of
Environment and Physical Planning, and the Minister of Transport and Communication. Three
additional members, proposed by the Prime Minister, may participate in the work of the Committee,
as well as the President of the Macedonian Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Governor of the
National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia.
The Prime Minister designates a Deputy Prime Minister in charge of European issues. The Deputy
Prime Minister in charge of European issues is responsible for coordination of all Government

activities in the process of the country’s European integration and activities under the Stabilisation
and Association Agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the European Union and its
Member States. The Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Macedonia is at the same time
National Foreign Aid Coordinator.
The Working Committee on European Integration at the Government of the Republic of
Macedonia was established following a Decision on Establishment of the Working Committee for
European Integration at the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 63/97). The Working Committee is chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister
in charge of European integration and the Deputy-Chairperson is the Minister of Economy. The
Secretary of the Working Committee is the Head of Sector for European Integration. In the period of
1997-2003 the members of the Working Committee were the deputy ministers. Afterwards a new
Decision on Establishment of Working Committee on European Integration at the Government of the
Republic of Macedonia was adopted (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 25/03),
according to which the members of the Working Committee are the state secretaries.
Representatives of the Legislative Secretariat, the State Statistical Office, the Customs
Administration, the Civil Servants Agency and the National Bank also participate in the activities of
the Working Committee.
The main tasks of the Working Committee are:
−

Coordination and synchronisation of the activities in the Stabilisation and Association Process
of the Republic of Macedonia and in the process of European integration;
− Monitoring the implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the
Republic of Macedonia and the European Union and its Member States;
− Monitoring the overall financial cooperation of the Republic of Macedonia with the European
Union;
− Monitoring the work of the Sub-Committee on Approximation of National Legislation and its
working groups and sub-groups;
− Monitoring and providing guidelines for the work of the network of units for European
integration in the ministries;
− Monitoring all other issues related to the process of European integration of the Republic of
Macedonia.
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure of the Working Committee on European Integration, the
Sub-Committee of the Working Committee for European Integration for Approximation of
Legislation is established. The main task of the Sub-Committee is to develop the Annual
Programme for Approximation of National Legislation with the EU legislation, following the priority
areas defined in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. Furthermore, the Sub-Committee
monitors the implementation of the Annual Programme for Approximation of National Legislation with
that of the EU. The Sub-Committee is composed of a Chairperson, Secretary and members. The
Chairperson of the Sub-Committee is the Head of the Sector for European Integration in the General
Secretariat of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. Members of the Sub-Committee are
senior civil servants from the ministries, the Legislative Secretariat and other state bodies and
institutions.
The Sub-Committee for Approximation of Legislation has Working Groups and Sub-Groups for
Harmonisation of the Legislation of the Republic of Macedonia with the acquis
communautaire. According to the screening structure, 29 working groups are established. The
working groups and sub-groups monitor the process of harmonisation of the national legislation,
deliver expert opinions on given areas in terms of legislative harmonisation, give guidelines and
recommendations on the implementation of the National Programme for Approximation of National
Legislation.
The Sector for European Integration at the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (SEI) is
the central administrative structure at the General Secretariat of the Government of the Republic of
Macedonia in charge of coordination of the European integration process.

Chapter I

Political Criteria

The present organisational structure of the Sector for European Integration is a result of several
previous stages of development. After the Republic of Macedonia became a beneficiary of the
PHARE Programmes on 1 September 1996, an Aid Coordination Unit was established. The
intensification of the cooperation with the EU resulted in strengthening of the institutional structure for
European integration. Hence, in March 1999, the Aid Coordination Unit was transformed into a
European Integration Unit. In accordance with the Rulebook on Internal Organisation of the General
Secretariat of the Government, adopted on 8 October 2001, the European Integration Unit was
transformed into a Sector for European Integration.
The Sector for European Integration currently has 52 full time employees, and six persons are
engaged based on service contracts. According to the Rulebook amending the Rulebook on
Systematisation of Jobs in the General Secretariat of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia,
85 posts are envisaged for the Sector. The SEI builds its capacities, inter alia, through the
Programme of Scholarships for European Post-Graduate Studies, under which 21 persons have
received scholarships and are/will be engaged at the SEI, i.e. other ministries after completion of
their studies.
The main competence of the Sector for European Integration is to coordinate and guide the process
of European integration within the state administrative bodies of the Republic of Macedonia. In
addition, the SEI provides administrative support to foreign assistance coordination activities.
According to the Rulebook Amending the Rulebook on Internal Organisation of the General
Secretariat as a Service of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, the Sector for European
Integration is responsible for:
−
−

− Unit for Institution Building;
− Unit for General Affairs and Budget;
− Unit for Foreign Assistance Coordination;
− Unit for Translation of EU Legislation
− Unit for Public Relations.
The Unit for Integration in the Economic-Social Area and the Unit for Integration in the Area of Justice
and Home Affairs monitor the policies and legislation of the EU, the harmonisation of the legislation
of the Republic of Macedonia with that of the EU and the implementation of the Stabilisation and
Association Agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the EU in the respective areas.
The Unit for Institution Building is in charge of strengthening the internal infrastructure necessary for
the integration of the Republic of Macedonia in the EU, as well as of the training, coordination of the
network of units for European integration at the ministries and other state administrative bodies and
of promoting the cooperation with the civil sector in the area of European integration. The Unit is also
in charge of bilateral cooperation with the countries in the region, through conclusion of Memoranda
of Cooperation or other agreements.
The Unit for General Affairs and Budget provides expert and administrative support to the Working
Committee on European Integration provides IT support to the process of European integration, is in
charge of the human resource management, the planning and monitoring of the budget allocations
for European integration, and for the documentation and the library.
The Unit for Foreign Assistance Coordination is in charge of the process of programming and
planning the priorities of the Republic of Macedonia for utilisation of foreign assistance, coordination
of activities of multilateral and bilateral donors and providing administrative support to the Committee
of Ministers for Foreign Aid Coordination, chaired by the National Foreign Aid Coordinator. The
Committee members are the Deputies of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Macedonia, the
Minister of Finance, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the Minister of Economy. The Coordinative
Technical Group harmonises the positions at technical level, drafts decisions and monitors the
implementation of the conclusions reached by the Committee.
The Unit for Translation of EU Legislation manages the process of translation of the EU legislation,
the expert and legal revision and proof reading of the translated documents and the establishment of
the counter-part terminology. The line ministries have established technical committees for
translation dealing with expert and legal terminology revision of the translated documents, which also
include external experts.
The Unit for Public Relations manages the implementation of the Public Relations Strategy in the
process of European Integration, and is especially focused on providing timely information about the
process of European integration of the Republic of Macedonia, maintaining the web page,
communication with the media, monitoring and analysing the public opinion about the European
integration process, organising briefings and press conferences.
There are plans to change the status of the Sector for European Integration and to transform it into a
Secretariat for European Affairs, as a special and autonomous service of the Government, with the
capacity of a legal entity, managed by a Deputy Prime Minister. Such changes in its status would
strengthen its coordinative function and would help build its capacities.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in charge of the relations of the Republic of Macedonia with the
EU, the political dialogue, the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the EU and the Common
Security and Defence Policy. As part of its regular activities, the Ministry carries out the diplomatic
communication of the Republic of Macedonia with the European Union institutions, through the
Mission of the Republic of Macedonia in Brussels, as well as with the member-countries through the
diplomatic and consular missions of the Republic of Macedonia. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs
ensures that the Republic of Macedonia presents unison positions in the relations with the EU.

In 1992, a special unit in charge of EU related issues was established in the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs. In 1994, there was an assistant minister appointed for relations with the European
Community; upon the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Macedonia and
the EU by the end of 1995, a Department for European Integration in the Ministry was established.
Today the EU Department has the following Units:
− Contractual Relations Unit;
− European Union Integration Process Unit;
− European and Regional Cooperation Unit.
The Contractual Relations Unit monitors the fulfilment of contractual relations between the Republic
of Macedonia and the EU, undertakes activities for their advancement and upgrading in all areas,
prepares the meetings of the Stabilisation and Association Council, the political dialogues between
the Republic of Macedonia and the EU and the meetings with the EU institutions.
The European Union Integration Process Unit initiates, coordinates and monitors the activities in the
process of accelerated rapprochement of the Republic of Macedonia with the EU; it prepares the
meetings of the Committee for Euro-Atlantic Integration, participates in the activities of the Working
Committee on European Integration and in the Government committees and bodies on issues related
to the Republic of Macedonia-European Union relations, participates in the process of drafting
strategies for accession of the Republic of Macedonia to the EU.
The European and Regional Cooperation Unit deals with the Common Foreign and Security Policy
(CFSP) and the European Security and Defence Policy (CSDP); it coordinates the process of
alignment of the Republic of Macedonia with the joint declarations, statements and demarches under
the CFSP of the EU; it follows and analyses the process of stabilisation and association of the other
countries; it coordinates activities for implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy; it
coordinates activities under the Stability Pact.
Units for European integration (departments or units) are established in all ministries, except in
the Ministry of Defence. Their tasks are analogous to those of the central Sector for European
Integration at the Government. They are the key element in the chain of coordination of activities
related to European integration in the Ministries, as well as with the Sector for European Integration
at the central Government level. Currently, they employ 54 persons. The units for European
integration function in a network, coordinated by the Sector for European Integration at the General
Secretariat of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia.
The Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, as the legislative body, has its role in the process of
harmonisation of the Macedonian legislation with that of the EU; it also has the role of controlling the
executive branch of power, and the role of raising public awareness about the Euro-integration
process. Each three months, the Government submits a Report to the Assembly about the progress
of the Euro-integration process.
The Assembly has established a Committee on European Integration, which exclusively deals with
the process of European integration. The Committee has a Chairperson, 12 members and their
deputies (for more details see I_B_2).
The Committee considers issues related to:
−
−

−

Harmonisation of the proposals for adoption of laws, i.e. The harmonisation of draft laws with

Procedures for examination of the harmonisation of the proposed laws with the legislation of
the European Union have been established in the legislative process in the Republic of Macedonia.
The Rules of Procedure of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 38/01, 98/02, 47/03, 64/03 and 67/03), stipulate that the proposers of
legal acts, subject to harmonisation with the acquis communautaire, are obliged to enclose a
Statement on conformity with the acquis communautaire. The Statement contains data on the EU
documents with which the proposed legal acts are harmonised, the level of harmonisation, reasons
for eventual discrepancies and terms for achieving complete harmonisation. The Statement also
contains information on the conformity with the SAA.
Following the adoption of the Law Amending the Law on Government of the Republic of Macedonia
in 2003 (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 12/03), Legislative Secretariat was
entrusted to provide assessments on the conformity of legal acts with the EU legislation.
In accordance with the Decision Amending the Decision on Establishment of Working Bodies
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 20/03), the Legislative Committee of the
Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia considers draft legal acts from the viewpoint of their
conformity with the EU legislation (for more details see I_B_2).
14. Please describe in detail how far the Republic of Macedonia has advanced in
implementing the commitments taken in the Framework Agreement concluded at Ohrid on 13
August 2001 (see also Section J below).
The main goal of the Framework Agreement is building of an integrated multi-ethnic society, which
will guarantee the peace, stability and democratic development of the Republic of Macedonia.
The Framework Agreement is an expression of the inviolability of the sovereignty, territorial integrity
and the unitary character of the state; it has helped restore the stability on the country’s entire
territory, developing mechanisms for future confidence building.
The Framework Agreement prompted substantive changes of the constitutional order and legislation,
aimed at significant advancement of the rights of ethnic communities, thus making the motives for
ethnically based conflicts in the Republic of Macedonia illegitimate. Furthermore, the principles of
equitable representation and enhanced inclusion in public life are the basis for the reintegration of the
Macedonian society, increasing its cohesion.

Political Criteria

Therefore, the Framework Agreement has become the prerequisite for the economic development,
for investments and creation of new jobs, as well as for the integration of the Republic of Macedonia
into the EU and NATO.
The Framework Agreement was signed on 13.08.2001, in Skopje. The signatories were the
Presidents of the then four most relevant political parties (SDSM, VMRO-DPMNE, DPA and PDP).
The negotiations for the conclusion of the Agreement were held under the auspices of President
Boris Trajkovski, and its guarantors were representatives of the international community – the
Special Envoys of the USA and of the EU.
The Framework Agreement consists of:
1. Basic text of the Agreement
2. Annexes
− Annex A: Constitutional Amendments
− Annex B: Legislative Modifications
− Annex C: Implementation and Confidence-Building Measures
The Basic text of the Agreement consists of the following Sections:
1. Basic Principles
2. Cessation of Hostilities
3. Development of Decentralised Government
4. Non-Discrimination and Equitable Representation
5. Special Parliamentary Procedures
6. Education and Use of Languages
7. Expression of Identity
8. Implementation
9. Annexes
10. Transitional and Final Provisions
The implementation of the Framework Agreement is a complex, continuous process. Its
implementation is of importance not only in terms of establishing the country’s stability, but also in
terms of building a democratic and prosperous Republic of Macedonia. One of the highest strategic
priorities of this Government is the timely and complete fulfilment of the obligations arising under the
Framework Agreement.
Furthermore, its implementation is continuously supported by the international community, both
politically and financially, starting with the mediation in the negotiations for signing of the Ohrid
Framework Agreement and the Donor Conference organised for support of its implementation in
March 2002.
The presentation on the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement follows the structure of
its text:
1. Basic Principles 1
1.1. The use of violence in pursuit of political aims is rejected completely and unconditionally. Only
peaceful political solutions can assure a stable and democratic future for Macedonia.
1.2. Macedonia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the unitary character of the State are
inviolable and must be preserved. There are no territorial solutions to ethnic issues.

All extracts from the Framework Agreement are given in italic.

1.3. The multi-ethnic character of Macedonia’s society must be preserved and reflected in public life.
1.4. A modern democratic state in its natural course of development and maturation must continually
ensure that its Constitution fully meets the needs of all its citizens and comports with the highest
international standards, which themselves continue to evolve.
1.5. The development of local self-government is essential for encouraging the participation of
citizens in democratic life, and for promoting respect for the identity of communities.
The basic principles of the Framework Agreement have been and are supported by all relevant
political factors in the Republic of Macedonia, forming the basis of the platform for cooperation
among political parties-coalition partners in the Government established in November 2002.
2. Cessation of Hostilities
2.1. The parties underline the importance of the commitments of July 5, 2001. There shall be a
complete cessation of hostilities, complete voluntary disarmament of the ethnic Albanian armed
groups and their complete voluntary disbandment. They acknowledge that a decision by NATO to
assist in this context will require the establishment of a general, unconditional and open-ended
cease-fire, agreement on a political solution to the problems of this country, a clear commitment by
the armed groups to voluntarily disarm, and acceptance by all the parties of the conditions and
limitations under which the NATO forces will operate.
The signing of the Framework Agreement facilitated the cessation of hostilities and the parties clearly
expressed their agreement for political resolution of the problems in the country. A process of
disarmament of the ethnic Albanian armed groups started and gradually conditions were created for
presenting and realising of the political claims through legitimate political subjects.
On 15.08.2001, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia agreed to the deployment of the
NATO Task Force for the operation “Essential Harvest” that collected the voluntarily handed over
weapons.
Following a Decision of the President of the Republic of Macedonia of 28.08.2001, according to the
set conditions to be fulfilled by the Army of the Republic of Macedonia for the start of the operation
“Essential Harvest”, the units of the Army of the Republic of Macedonia relocated some of the tanks
and heavy armament.
The Task Force conducted passive collection of weapons and coordinated the transfer and
destruction of the weapons and ammunition. According to the Report of the NATO structures in the
Republic of Macedonia, 3875 pieces of weapons and 397.625 pieces of mines, explosives and
ammunition were collected.
After the NATO forces concluded the operation, the members of the ethnic Albanian armed groups
were given the opportunity to reintegrate in the society following the adoption of the Law on Amnesty
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 18/02). The Law was fully implemented (for
more details see I_M_2).
Furthermore, after the completion of this operation, the state security forces, with a participation of
ethnic Albanian police officers, gradually re-entered former crisis regions and started fulfilling peacetime law enforcement obligations in all parts of the country, strictly abiding by international standards
and general human rights principles and accepting the monitoring by the OSCE and the EUMM.
However, even after the “Essential Harvest” operation, there has been a high number of incidents
involving the use of weapons, in which a number of citizens were killed or injured. This has clearly led
to the conclusion that there are still large quantities of illegal weapons in the hands of the citizens,
especially in the former crisis regions.
Therefore, in 2003, the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia adopted the Law on Voluntary HandOver and Collection of Firearms, Ammunition and Explosives and on Weapons Legalisation (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 37/03). A special Coordinative Body was established to

90/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

implement the operation of voluntary hand-over of weapons, supported by a public awareness
campaign. The action lasted from 01.11 to 15.12.2003, at 123 collection points throughout the
Republic of Macedonia.
The quantities of weapons handed-over, according to the international standards classification
(SEESAK) were:
1. Weapons, total of 7.571 pieces
2. Ammunition, total of 100.219 pieces
3. Explosives, total of 1.257 pieces and 165,35 kg explosive
4. Accompanying arms, total of 1.001 pieces and 497,65 m fuse and cable.
In connection with the return of the police in the former crisis regions, the permanent police presence
countrywide and the consolidation of the rule of law in the former crisis regions, see I_F_2 and I_F_4.
3. Development of Decentralised Government
3.1. A revised Law on Local Self-Government will be adopted that reinforces the powers of elected
local officials and enlarges substantially their competencies in conformity with the Constitution (as
amended in accordance with Annex A) and the European Charter on Local Self-Government, and
reflecting the principle of subsidiarity in effect in the European Union. Enhanced competencies will
relate principally to the areas of public services, urban and rural planning, environmental protection,
local economic development, culture, local finances, education, social welfare, and health care. A law
on financing of local self-government will be adopted to ensure an adequate system of financing to
enable local governments to fulfil all of their responsibilities.
3.2. Boundaries of municipalities will be revised within one year of the completion of a new census,
which will be conducted under international supervision by the end of 2001. The revision of the
municipal boundaries will be effectuated by the local and national authorities with international
participation.
3.3. In order to ensure that police are aware of and responsive to the needs and interests of the local
population, local heads of police will be selected by municipal councils from lists of candidates
proposed by the Ministry of Interior, and will communicate regularly with the councils. The Ministry of
Interior will retain the authority to remove local heads of police in accordance with the law.
The development of decentralised government according to this Section, implied Amendments to the
Constitution, defined in Annex A and amending legislation as set forth in Annex B to the Framework
Agreement.
Amendment XVII was integrated in the Constitution:
Amendment XVII
In units of local self-government, citizens directly and through representatives participate in decisionmaking on issues of local relevance particularly in the fields of public services, urban and rural
planning, environmental protection, local economic development, local finances, communal activities,
culture, sport, social security and child care, education, health care and other fields determined by
law.
In the city of Skopje, citizens directly and through representatives participate in decision-making on
issues of relevance to the city of Skopje particularly in the fields of public services, urban and rural
planning, environmental protection, local economic development, local finances, communal activities,
culture, sport, social security and child care, education, health care and other fields determined by
law.
The legislation in this area was amended in accordance with items 1, 2, 3 and 4 of Annex B:

The parties will take all necessary measures to ensure the adoption of the legislative changes set
forth hereafter within the time limits specified.
B.1. Law on Local Self-Government
The Assembly shall adopt within 45 days from the signing of the Framework Agreement a revised
Law on Local Self-Government. This revised Law shall in no respect be less favourable to the units of
local self-government and their autonomy than the draft Law proposed by the Government of the
Republic of Macedonia in March 2001. The Law shall include competencies relating to the subject
matters set forth in Section 3.1 of the Framework Agreement as additional independent
competencies of the units of local self-government, and shall conform to Section 6.6 of the
Framework Agreement. In addition, the Law shall provide that any State standards or procedures

further promote the municipalities’ independent exercise of their competencies.
B.2. Law on Local Finance
−

The Assembly shall adopt by the end of the term of the present Assembly a law on local selfgovernment finance to ensure that the units of local self-government have sufficient resources

shall:
Enable and make responsible units of local self-government for raising a substantial amount
of tax revenue;
− Provide for the transfer to the units of local self-government of a part of centrally raised taxes
that corresponds to the functions of the units of local self-government and that takes account
of the collection of taxes on their territories; and
Ensure the budgetary autonomy and responsibility of the units of local self-government within
their areas of competence.
B.3. Law on Municipal Boundaries
The Assembly shall adopt by the end of 2002 a revised law on municipal boundaries, taking into
account the results of the census and the relevant guidelines set forth in the Law on Local SelfGovernment.
B.4. Laws Pertaining to Police Located in the Municipalities

Accordingly, the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia adopted all the above-mentioned laws,
which enlarged the competencies of the local self-government units and ensured adequate financing:
1. Law on Local Self-Government (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 05/02);
2. Law on Territorial Organisation of the Local Self-Government in the Republic of Macedonia
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 55/04);
3. Law on the City of Skopje (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 55/04);
4. Law on Financing the Units of Local Self-Government (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 61/04 and 96/04);
5. Law on Communal Fees (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 61/04);
6. Law Amending the Law on Administrative Fees (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 61/04);
7. Law on Property Taxes (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 61/04);
8. Law Amending the Law on Internal Affairs (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
No. 38/02).
Laws Nos. 1-3 envisage enlarged competencies of the units of local self-government in accordance
with the above quoted provisions of the Framework Agreement, as well as new territorial organisation
of the Republic of Macedonia, defining also an appropriate solution for the City of Skopje. The Law
on Territorial Organisation of the Republic of Macedonia and the Law on the City of Skopje were
disputed under the initiative for a Referendum, which was in favour of returning to the old territorial
organisation of 1996. At the Referendum held on 8.11.2004, the initiative did not get the necessary
support, enabling continuation of the process of decentralisation in compliance with the Framework
Agreement and the relevant adopted laws.
Under the new Laws, the number of municipalities was reduced from 123 to 84, with average
population of 25.000 inhabitants. The Skopje City area now has 10 instead of 7 city municipalities,
and the relations between the municipalities and the City administration have been clearly defined.
Laws Nos. 4-7 regulate the revenues for the units of local self-government, in accordance with the
conditions laid down in the Framework Agreement, i.e. local self-government authorities are ensured
sufficient resources enabling them to fulfil their responsibilities, in compliance with the new Law on
Local Self-Government. Furthermore, the laws ensured relevant budgetary autonomy and
responsibility for the units of local self-government.
Law No. 8 fully incorporates the provisions of the Framework Agreement regarding the election of
local heads of police and the obligation that the local police head communicates with and reports to
the Municipal Council, as well as the possibility of the Council to adopt a report on the public safety to
be forwarded to the Minister of Interior and to the Ombudsman. These provisions will be applied after
the election of the new local authorities, or 01.07.2005 at the latest.
In addition, the Assembly has adopted a series of laws in other sectors, defining the transfer of
competencies from the central to the local authorities, in accordance with the adopted Operational
Programme of Decentralisation (for more details see I_C_17).
In accordance with the above stated, the provisions of the Framework Agreement contained in
Section 3 - Development of Decentralized Government have been fully incorporated in the
Macedonian legislation and their practical implementation will follow the local elections, to be held on
13.03.2005.
Provision 3.2 of the basic text of the Framework Agreement also envisaged organising a new census
of the population. This provision is elaborated in item 2.1 of Annex C to the Framework Agreement:
C. 2.1. The parties confirm the request for international supervision by the Council of Europe and the
European Commission of a census to be conducted in October 2001.

In 2001, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia invited the European Commission and the
Council of Europe to organise international monitoring of the Census of Population and Households.
The objectives of the monitoring were to ensure that the Census is carried out in accordance with the
international standards, to encourage citizens to take part in the census and to increase the trust in
the census process.
The Final Report of the international monitoring of the Census was published in December 2003,
concluding that the 2002 Census of Population and Households in Macedonia was carried out
professionally and successfully, in line with international census standards. This, on its part, means
full implementation of the referred to provisions of the Framework Agreement.
4. Non-Discrimination and Equitable Representation
4.1. The principle of non-discrimination and equal treatment of all under the law will be respected
completely. This principle will be applied in particular with respect to employment in public
administration and public enterprises, and access to public financing for business development.
4.2. Laws regulating employment in public administration will include measures to assure equitable
representation of communities in all central and local public bodies and at all levels of employment
within such bodies, while respecting the rules concerning competence and integrity that govern public
administration. The authorities will take action to correct present imbalances in the composition of the
public administration, in particular through the recruitment of members of under-represented
communities. Particular attention will be given to ensuring as rapidly as possible that the police
services will generally reflect the composition and distribution of the population of Macedonia, as
specified in Annex C.
4.3. For the Constitutional Court, one-third of the judges will be chosen by the Assembly by a majority
of the total number of Representatives that includes a majority of the total number of Representatives
claiming to belong to the communities not in the majority in the population of Macedonia. This
procedure also will apply to the election of the Ombudsman (Public Attorney) and the election of
three of the members of the Judicial Council.
In general terms, the Framework Agreement stipulates two types of mutually connected measures to
ensure enhanced participation of non-majority communities in all spheres of public life: the principle
of non-discrimination and equal treatment (referred to in item 4.1) on one hand, and equitable
representation on the other (referred to in items 4.2 and 4.3). Even prior to the Framework
Agreement, in Macedonia, the principles of non-discrimination and equal treatment were legally
regulated in a manner compatible with the EU and Council of Europe standards. In respect of the

94/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

second type of measures, even prior to the Ohrid Framework Agreement, in specific areas there
were measures of de facto (and de jure in the field of education) positive discrimination applied.
The new quality that the Framework Agreement adds are the numerous measures for active and
prompt change of the level of participation of the non-majority communities in many spheres,
primarily by ensuring equitable representation and positive discrimination.
Specifically, provisions contained in Section 4 were transposed into constitutional amendments, as
set forth in Annex A and legal regulations, as set forth in Annex B to the Framework Agreement.
Namely, Amendments VI, XI, XIII, XIV и XV have been incorporated in the Constitution:
Amendment VI
The fundamental values of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia are:

bodies of state administration and by other bodies and organisations with public mandates. The
Public Attorney shall give particular attention to safeguarding the principles of non-discrimination and
equitable representation of communities in public bodies at all levels and in other areas of public life.
Amendment XIII
The President of the Republic is President of the Security Council of the Republic of Macedonia.
The Security Council of the Republic is composed of the President of the Republic, the President of
the Assembly, the Prime Minister, the ministers heading the bodies of state administration in the
fields of security, defence and foreign affairs and three members appointed by the President of the
Republic. In appointing the three members, the President shall ensure that the Security Council as a
whole equitably reflects the composition of the population of Macedonia.
The Council considers issues relating to the security and defence of the Republic and makes policy
proposals to the Assembly and the Government.
Amendment XIV
The Republic’s Judicial Council is composed of seven members.
The Assembly elects the members of the Council. Three of the members shall be elected by a
majority vote of the total number of Representatives, within which there must be a majority of the
votes of the total number of Representatives claiming to belong to the communities not in the majority
in the population of Macedonia.
Amendment XV
The Constitutional Court of Macedonia is composed of nine judges.
The Assembly elects six of the judges to the Constitutional Court by a majority vote of the total
number of Representatives. The Assembly elects three of the judges by a majority vote of the total

the Constitutional Court.
In line with Amendment XI and item 9 of Annex B, a new Law on the Ombudsman was adopted
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 60/03), which defines the manner of election,
dismissal, competencies of the Ombudsman and the manner of operation of this institution. This Law
incorporates principles set forth in several constitutional amendments:
-

the Ombudsman. These provisions of the Law have been implemented, as described in I_G_ 6,
I_G_ 7, I_G_ 8, I_G_ 9 and I_J_18.
The Constitutional Amendment XIII has been fully implemented in the appointment of members of
the National Security Council of the Republic of Macedonia.
The Constitutional Amendment XIV has been transposed into the Law on the Judicial Council of the

mandate, the principle of equitable representation of citizens belonging to all communities shall be
respectively applied, while respecting the criteria of expertise and competence.
Laws Nos. 4 and 5 stipulate that in the appointment of the Public Prosecutor and Deputy Public
Prosecutors, and judges and lay judges, respectively, while respecting the criteria laid down by law,
equitable representation of citizens belonging to all communities in the Republic of Macedonia shall
be ensured. Furthermore, all these Laws prescribe the obligations of publishing all advertisements for
employment i.e. appointment in at least two daily newspapers, one of which is in the language of the
communities that do not constitute the majority.
In the period following the signing of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, the Governments of the
Republic of Macedonia have introduced specially designed policies, aimed at practical improvement
of equitable representation of non-majority communities in the public administration, focussing
especially on the police and army structures. The objective pursued in this context was to fully
implement obligations set forth in Annex C - Implementation and Confidence-Building Measures - to
the Framework Agreement.
C.5. Non-Discrimination and Equitable Representation
C.5.1. Taking into account i.a. the recommendations of the already established governmental
commission, the parties will take concrete action to increase the representation of members of
communities not in the majority in Macedonia in public administration, the military, and public
enterprises, as well as to improve their access to public financing for business development.
C.5.2. The parties commit themselves to ensuring that the police services will by 2004 generally
reflect the composition and distribution of the population of Macedonia. As initial steps toward this

end, the parties commit to ensuring that 500 new police officers from communities not in the majority
in the population of Macedonia will be hired and trained by July 2002, and that these officers will be
deployed to the areas where such communities live. The parties further commit that 500 additional
such officers will be hired and trained by July 2003 and that these officers will be deployed on a
priority basis to the areas throughout Macedonia where such communities live. The parties invite the
international community to support and assist with the implementation of these commitments, in
particular through screening and selection of candidates and their training. The parties invite the
OSCE, the European Union, and the United States to send an expert team as quickly as possible in
order to assess how best to achieve these objectives.
C.5.3. The parties also invite the OSCE, the European Union, and the United States to increase
training and assistance programs for police, including:
- professional, human rights, and other training;
- technical assistance for police reform, including assistance in screening, selection and promotion
processes;
- development of a code of police conduct;
- cooperation with respect to transition planning for hiring and deployment of police officers from
communities not in the majority in Macedonia; and
- deployment as soon as possible of international monitors and police advisors in sensitive areas,
under appropriate arrangements with relevant authorities.
C.5.4. The parties invite the international community to assist in the training of lawyers, judges and
prosecutors from members of communities not in the majority in Macedonia in order to be able to
increase their representation in the judicial system.
Since the main focus was placed on improving the ethnic structure of the police and the Army of the
Republic of Macedonia, these provisions (item 5.2. of Annex C specifies the requirements for the
police) have already been fully implemented. This has facilitated the establishment of multi-ethnic
police patrols that have successfully returned to the former crisis regions, and were accepted and
supported by the local population. Training, defined in item 5.3. of Annex C, has been or is currently
realized.
For more details see I_F_3, I_F_8, I_F_10 and I_J_7.
Following the improvement of the equitable representation in the security forces, the focus was
placed on equitable representation in the administration and public enterprises. Therefore, in
February 2003, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia adopted the Basis for Preparation of a
Programme for Improvement of Equitable Representation of Communities in the Public
Administration and in Public Enterprises.
In April 2003, additional measures were adopted to improve the equitable representation of
communities in the public administration and in public enterprises specifically related to: building
translation capacities, opening bilingual posts, analysis of vacancies in the administration, and
training program for recruitments in the public administration, as well as to communication strategy.
As part of the additional measures, supported by the CARDS 2002 funds, 600 persons belonging to
the non-majority communities - candidates for expert-administrative civil servants in the state
administration have been trained. The first group of these candidates were employed in December
2004-Janaury 2005; the second group will be employed in the state administration in February 2005.
On 01.03.2005, the training of 100 translators/interpreters belonging to the non-majority communities
for work in the state administration bodies and in the courts will commence. Following the training,
which is organized under a project of the 2004 CARDS Programme, the selected candidates will be
employed in the state administration bodies and courts, and will be obliged to work in those bodies
for at least 2 years after completing the training.
However, the general conclusion in this respect is that in the last two years there has been an
evident increase of the representation of all communities in the administration, which has required
and requires significant budget allocations. The overall participation of non-majority communities in

98/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

the public administration rose to 19,69 %, while the participation of the Albanian community rose to
14,54% (for more details see I_J_4, I_J_5, and I_J_7).
It has to be taken into account that the entire process was conducted in a period of strict budgetary
conditions and of downsizing the number of employees in the administration, which added to the
complexity of the process, making it even more painful.
Accordingly, provisions contained in Section 4 of the Framework Agreement have been fully
implemented in the laws and in practice. However, the general policy of equitable representation
requires continuous activities and permanent political and financial commitments.
5. Special Parliamentary Procedures
5.1. On the central level, certain Constitutional amendments in accordance with Annex A and the
Law on Local Self-Government cannot be approved without a qualified majority of two-thirds of votes,
within which there must be a majority of the votes of Representatives claiming to belong to the
communities not in the majority in the population of Macedonia.
5.2. Laws that directly affect culture, use of language, education, personal documentation, and use of
symbols, as well as laws on local finances, local elections, the city of Skopje, and boundaries of
municipalities must receive a majority of votes, within which there must be a majority of the votes of
the Representatives claiming to belong to the communities not in the majority in the population of
Macedonia.
Provisions of Section 5 have been transposed in constitutional amendments, as defined in Annex A
and in the legislation, in compliance with Annex B of the Framework Agreement.
Namely Amendments X, XII, XVI и XVIII have been incorporated in the Constitution:
Amendment X
For laws that directly affect culture, use of language, education, personal documentation, and use of
symbols, the Assembly makes decisions by a majority vote of the Representatives attending, within
which there must be a majority of the votes of the Representatives attending who claim to belong to

the Assembly regarding the application of this provision, the Committee on Inter-Community
Relations shall resolve the dispute.
Amendment XII
The Assembly shall establish a Committee for Inter-Community Relations.
The Committee consists of seven members each from the ranks of the Macedonians and Albanians
within the Assembly, and five members from among the Turks, Vlachs, Roma and two other
communities. The five members each shall be from a different community; if fewer than five other
communities are represented in the Assembly, the Public Attorney, after consultation with relevant
community leaders, shall propose the remaining members from outside the Assembly.
The Assembly elects the members of the Committee.
The Committee considers issues of inter-community relations in the Republic and makes appraisals
and proposals for their solution.
The Assembly is obliged to take into consideration the appraisals and proposals of the Committee
and to make decisions regarding them.
In the event of a dispute among members of the Assembly regarding the application of the voting
procedure specified in Article 69(2), the Committee shall decide by majority vote whether the
procedure applies.
Amendment XVI

Chapter I

Political Criteria

Skopje shall be adopted by a majority vote of the Representatives attending, within which there must
be a majority of the votes of the Representatives attending who claim to belong to the communities
not in the majority in the population of Macedonia.
Amendment XVIII
The decision to initiate a change in the Constitution is made by the Assembly by a two-thirds majority

A decision to amend the Preamble, the articles on local self-government, Article 131, any provision
relating to the rights of members of communities, including in particular Articles 7, 8, 9, 19, 48, 56,
69, 77, 78, 86, 104 and 109, as well as a decision to add any new provision relating to the subject
matter of such provisions and articles, shall require a two-thirds majority vote of the total number of
Representatives, within which there must be a majority of the votes of the total number of
Representatives claiming to belong to the communities not in the majority in the population of
Macedonia.
The change in the Constitution is declared by the Assembly.
These constitutional provisions are fully implemented, i.e. all referred to laws are adopted or
amended in accordance with the described procedure.
6. Education and Use of Languages
6.1. With respect to primary and secondary education, instruction will be provided in the students'
native languages, while at the same time uniform standards for academic programs will be applied
throughout Macedonia.
6.2. State funding will be provided for university level education in languages spoken by at least 20
percent of the population of Macedonia, on the basis of specific agreements.
6.3. The principle of positive discrimination will be applied in the enrolment in State universities of
candidates belonging to communities not in the majority in the population of Macedonia until the
enrolment reflects equitably the composition of the population of Macedonia...
The right to primary and secondary education in the languages of the nationalities (i.e. non-majority
communities) is set forth in the 1991 Constitution (Article 48 of the Constitution) and previously in the
legislation of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia in the framework of the former SFRY. This right has
already been realized in practice. Hence, in this context, the Framework Agreement only reaffirms
and emphasises the already existing normative and de facto situation. Primary and secondary
education instruction in the Republic of Macedonia is carried out in the Macedonian, Albanian,
Turkish and in the Serbian languages and there are optional classes for studying the Vlach and the
Roma languages.
Out of 344 elementary schools in total, in the 2002/03 academic year, in 134 schools the instruction
was carried out exclusively in Albanian language or in Albanian and in Macedonian languages. Out of
90 secondary schools in the Republic of Macedonia, in 26 schools instruction is carried out in
Albanian.
The same academic year, the percentage of ethnic Albanians in the total number of pupils in
secondary education was 18,57%, and this academic year (2004/05) the percentage is 22,52%.
The Assembly has adopted the following laws:
−
−

Law Amending the Law on Primary Education (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia
No. 63/04) and
Law Amending the Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 67/04),

100/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

which only additionally enabled keeping pedagogical records in the language and alphabet of
persons belonging to communities, in addition to the Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet.
In accordance with item 6.2. the Law on the Establishment of State University in Tetovo was adopted
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 8/04), thus fulfilling the obligation for state
funding of higher education in the language spoken by at least 20% of the population in the Republic
of Macedonia. The instruction at the Tetovo University started in the 2004/05 academic year,
following the accreditation of this higher education institution.
Pursuant to item 6.3 the Law Amending the Law on Higher Education was adopted (“Official Gazette
of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 49/03), under which positive discrimination has become legal
obligation in enrolment at state universities. However, it has to be mentioned that this measure has
been practically applied by the state universities ever since 1994. Namely, as of 1994 the
Government sets a separate quota for government funding of higher education of students belonging
to all minorities depending on their proportional representation in the total population (for example if
1000 are to be enrolled under state funding, in addition to this 1000 student quota, 230 Albanians
could additionally be enrolled under state funding, since at that time the percentage of Albanians was
22.6%). Until 2003, this practice was applied based on a Government Decision, followed by a public
advertisement for enrolment of students at the then two state universities (in Skopje and in Bitola). By
pursuing such policy of evident positive discrimination in the field of higher education, the number of
students belonging to the Albanian community has rapidly grown from 2,23% in 1992 to 5,7% in
2000.
Following the establishment of the University of Southeast Europe (privately financed university,
supported by the international community, offering education in Albanian, Macedonian and English)
and the start of the Tetovo University, the percentage of enrolled students Albanians reached 15,5%
of the total number of students in the Republic of Macedonia (for more details see I_J_16).
6.4. The official language throughout Macedonia and in the international relations of Macedonia is the
Macedonian language.
6.5. Any other language spoken by at least 20 percent of the population is also an official language,
as set forth herein. In the organs of the Republic of Macedonia, any official language other than
Macedonian may be used in accordance with the law, as further elaborated in Annex B. Any person
living in a unit of local self-government in which at least 20 percent of the population speaks an
official language other than Macedonian may use any official language to communicate with the
regional office of the central government with responsibility for that municipality; such an office will
reply in that language in addition to Macedonian. Any person may use any official language to
communicate with a main office of the central government, which will reply in that language in
addition to Macedonian.
6.6. With respect to local self-government, in municipalities where a community comprises at least 20
percent of the population of the municipality, the language of that community will be used as an
official language in addition to Macedonian. With respect to languages spoken by less than 20
percent of the population of the municipality, the local authorities will decide democratically on their
use in public bodies.
6.7. In criminal and civil judicial proceedings at any level, an accused person or any party will have
the right to translation at State expense of all proceedings as well as documents in accordance with
relevant Council of Europe documents.
6.8. Any official personal documents of citizens speaking an official language other than Macedonian
will also be issued in that language, in addition to the Macedonian language, in accordance with the
law.
Provisions of items 6.4-6.8 have been transposed into the Constitutional Amendments, as defined in
Annex A and in the legislation, in accordance with Annex B of the Framework Agreement.
Namely, Amendment V was incorporated in the Constitution.

101/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

Amendment V
The Macedonian language, written using its Cyrillic alphabet, is the official language throughout the
Republic of Macedonia and in the international relations of the Republic of Macedonia.
Any other language spoken by at least 20 percent of the population is also an official language,
written using its alphabet, as specified below.
Any official personal documents of citizens speaking an official language other than Macedonian
shall also be issued in that language, in addition to the Macedonian language, in accordance with the
law.
Any person living in a unit of local self-government in which at least 20 percent of the population
speaks an official language other than Macedonian may use any official language to communicate
with the regional office of the central government with responsibility for that municipality; such an
office shall reply in that language in addition to Macedonian. Any person may use any official
language to communicate with a main office of the central government, which shall reply in that
language in addition to Macedonian.
In the organs of the Republic of Macedonia, any official language other than Macedonian may be
used in accordance with the law.
In the units of local self-government where at least 20 percent of the population speaks a particular
language, that language and its alphabet shall be used as an official language in addition to the
Macedonian language and the Cyrillic alphabet. With respect to languages spoken by less than 20
percent of the population of a unit of local self-government, the local authorities shall decide on their
use in public bodies.
Annex B defines the relevant legislative changes:
B.7. Rules of the Assembly
The Assembly shall amend by the end of the term of the present Assembly its Rules of Procedure to
enable the use of the Albanian language in accordance with Section 6.5 of the Framework
Agreement, paragraph 8 below, and the relevant amendments to the Constitution set forth in Annex
A.
B.8. Laws Pertinent to the Use of Languages
The Assembly shall adopt by the end of the term of the present Assembly new legislation regulating
the use of languages in the organs of the Republic of Macedonia. This legislation shall provide that:
− Representatives may address plenary sessions and working bodies of the Assembly in
languages referred to in Article 7, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Constitution (as amended in
accordance with Annex A);
− Laws shall be published in the languages referred to in Article 7, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the
Constitution (as amended in accordance with Annex A); and
− All public officials may write their names in the alphabet of any language referred to in Article

official documents.
The Assembly also shall adopt by the end of the term of the present Assembly new legislation on the
issuance of personal documents.
The Assembly shall amend by the end of the term of the present Assembly all relevant laws to make
their provisions on the use of languages fully compatible with Section 6 of the Framework
Agreement.
Hence, in accordance with Amendment V to the Constitution and in accordance with items 7 and 8 of
Annex B, the following Laws were adopted:
А. In respect of the Assembly rules and publication of laws (item 7 and 8):
−
−

Rules of Procedure of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia” No. 60/02);
Law Amending the Law on Publication of Laws and other Regulations and Decrees in the
Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”
No. 43/02).

102/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

This enabled members of the Assembly to use the language spoken by at least 20% of the citizens at
the plenary sessions and at meetings of the working bodies of the Assembly, while laws published in
the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia are published also in the language and alphabet
used by at least 20% of the citizens, belonging to the non-majority communities in the Republic of
Macedonia.
Both provisions are fully and continuously implemented.
B. In connection with court proceedings (item 6.7) and communication with local units of ministries
(paragraph 4 of Amendment V):
−

Law Amending the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 44/02);
− Law Amending the Law on Civil Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
No. 44/02);
− Law Amending the Law on Execution Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of

− Law Amending the Law on Administrative Disputes (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia” No. 44/02);
− Law Amending the Law on General Administrative Procedure (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 44/02).
Under these legislative amendments, in addition to the Macedonian language and its Cyrillic
alphabet, in the proceedings before courts and state administration bodies and other state bodies,
another official language is the language and alphabet used by at least 20% of the citizens, in
accordance with the respective laws.
Furthermore, in April 2004, the Rules of Procedure amending the Court Rules of Procedure were
adopted (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 27/04), which aimed at facilitating the
application of Amendment V and the above referred to legislative changes regarding the court
proceedings. Forms for correspondence with the parties to the court proceedings were developed,
and in accordance with the amendments to the procedural laws and the Rules of Procedure
Amending the Court Rules of Procedure, the translation of the forms has been distributed to all
judicial bodies in the Republic of Macedonia. In order to improve the transparency and to inform
citizens about the implementation of the Framework Agreement and Amendment V to the
Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, the forms for correspondence with the parties to court
proceedings were published in the daily newspaper in the Albanian language “Flaka”, and in the
Macedonian language daily newspaper “Utrinski Vesnik” (for more details see I_J_14).
Following the amendments to the procedural laws, which regulate the right to use the languages of
the communities in judicial and administrative proceedings, there is an on-going selection procedure
and training of translators belonging to the non-majority communities to be recruited in the state
administration bodies and courts, as explained in Section 4 - Non-Discrimination and Equitable
Representation.
The provisions related to the communication with the local units (offices) of state administration
bodies are currently being implemented. Thus, tenders have been published for the printing of
bilingual forms (for more details see I_J_13).
C. In respect of personal identification documents (item 8) the following laws were adopted:
−
−
−
−

Law Amending the Law on Personal Identity Card (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 38/02 and 16/04);
Law Amending the Law on Personal Identification Records (“Official Gazette of the Republic
of Macedonia” No. 38/02);

Following the adoption of the above referred to Laws, all personal identification documents of citizens
(personal identification cards, passports, birth, marriage, death certificates, driving licenses,
registration certificates) and their forms are issued in accordance with item 6.8, i.e. Amendment V to
the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia.
In practice, the issuance of these documents also in the languages of the communities has started, in
accordance with the legal amendments (for more details see I_J_15).
D. Regarding personal names (item 8):
This provision setting forth the possibility all public officials to write their names in the alphabet of the
language used by at least 20% of the citizens is applied in practice, although not regulated in a
specific law.
E. In respect of local self-government
The provisions related to the issue of official languages at the level of units of local self-government
have already been incorporated in the laws regulating this area. Accordingly, in all municipalities in
which at least 20% of the population uses a certain language, that language and its alphabet are in
official use, in addition to the Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet, meaning that this
provision has been fully implemented.
Furthermore, the Law Amending the Law on Road Traffic Safety (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 38/02), sets forth that traffic signs, in units of local self-government in which at least
20% of the citizens speak an official language different from the Macedonian, shall be written in that
language and its alphabet.
Additionally, in the field of use of languages, the adoption of the following laws should be mentioned:
−
−
−
−

Law on Election of Members of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette
of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 42/02);
Law Amending the Law on Election of the President of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 11/04);
Law Amending the Law on Local Elections (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
No. 35/04); and
Law Amending the Law on the Census of Population, Households and Dwellings 2002
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 43/02).

These Laws define the use of language and alphabet of persons belonging to the communities in the
ballots, while the Law Amending the Law on Local Elections defines the use of the language and
alphabet of persons belonging to the communities in all election related activities. Following the
amendments to the Law on the Census, the Census is carried out in the Macedonian language and
its Cyrillic alphabet and in the languages and alphabet of all ethnic communities.
These legal provisions were fully implemented in the elections for Members of the Assembly of the
Republic of Macedonia in 2002, and in the elections for President of the Republic of Macedonia in
2004, as well as in the course of the 2002 Census. See answer to question I_H_33.
The only remaining Law to be adopted in accordance with Section 6 is the Law on Use of Languages
of Communities in the Republic of Macedonia, which will be adopted in the first half of 2005. The Law
on Official Seals and the Law on Referendum and other forms of direct expression of citizens will
also be appropriately amended.
7. Expression of Identity
7.1. With respect to emblems, next to the emblem of the Republic of Macedonia, local authorities will
be free to place on front of local public buildings emblems marking the identity of the community in
the majority in the municipality, respecting international rules and usages.

Chapter I

Political Criteria

Provisions of Section 7 have been transposed in the Constitutional Amendments, as defined in
Annex A and in the additional provisions on the implementation of confidence building measures in
accordance with Annex C of the Framework Agreement.
Namely, Amendments VII, VIII and IX have been incorporated in the Constitution:
Amendment VII
The freedom of religious confession is guaranteed.
The right to express one's faith freely and publicly, individually or with others is guaranteed.
The Macedonian Orthodox Church, the Islamic Religious Community in Macedonia, the Catholic
Church, and other Religious communities and groups are separate from the state and equal before
the law.
The Macedonian Orthodox Church, the Islamic Religious Community in Macedonia, the Catholic
Church, and other Religious communities and groups are free to establish schools and other social
and charitable institutions, by ways of a procedure regulated by law.
Amendment VIII
Members of communities have a right freely to express, foster and develop their identity and
community attributes, and to use their community symbols.
The Republic guarantees the protection of the ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity of all
communities.
Members of communities have the right to establish institutions for culture, art, science and
education, as well as scholarly and other associations for the expression, fostering and development
of their identity.
Members of communities have the right to instruction in their language in primary and secondary
education, as determined by law. In schools where education is carried out in another language, the
Macedonian language is also studied.
Amendment IX
The Republic guarantees the protection, promotion and enhancement of the historical and artistic
heritage of Macedonia and all communities in Macedonia and the treasures of which it is composed,
regardless of their legal status. The law regulates the mode and conditions under which specific
items of general interest for the Republic can be ceded for use.
Item 6 of Annex C follows the same direction:
C.6. Culture, Education and Use of Languages
C.6.1. The parties invite the international community, including the OSCE, to increase its assistance
for projects in the area of media in order to further strengthen radio, TV and print media, including
Albanian language and multiethnic media. The parties also invite the international community to
increase professional media training programs for members of communities not in the majority in
Macedonia. The parties also invite the OSCE to continue its efforts on projects designed to improve
inter-ethnic relations.
Separate bodies have been established for promotion of the culture and education of persons
belonging to the non-majority communities in the Republic of Macedonia:
−

Office for Affirmation and Promotion of the Culture of Persons Belonging to the Communities
in the Republic of Macedonia within the Ministry of Culture;
− Office for Development and Promotion of the Education in the Languages of Persons
Belonging to Communities, within the Ministry of Education and Science.
For more details see I_J_18.
As regards the media, there has been evident progress after the National Broadcaster - the
Macedonian Radio and Television - introduced a channel broadcasting programs in the languages of
all non-majority communities in the Republic of Macedonia. At this channel, sessions of the Assembly
of the Republic of Macedonia are broadcast with simultaneous translation into the Albanian
language.

Amendment VIII envisages free use of symbols of the communities. This issue is to be legally
regulated by the Law on Use of Symbols of the Communities to be adopted in the first half of 2005. In
practice, even now, in municipalities having a majority of ethnic Albanian population, the Albanian
ethnic flag, which is identical to the state flag of neighbouring Republic of Albania, is hoisted at public
premises.
8. Implementation
8.1. The Constitutional amendments attached at Annex A will be presented to the Assembly
immediately. The parties will take all measures to assure adoption of these amendments within 45
days of signature of this Framework Agreement.
8.2. The legislative modifications identified in Annex B will be adopted in accordance with the
timetables specified therein.
8.3. The parties invite the international community to convene at the earliest possible time a meeting
of international donors that would address in particular macro-financial assistance; support for the
financing of measures to be undertaken for the purpose of implementing this Framework Agreement,
including measures to strengthen local self-government; and rehabilitation and reconstruction in
areas affected by the fighting.
In accordance with the above stated, these provisions have been fully implemented.
Annex A to the Framework Agreement envisaging 15 Amendments to the 1991 Constitution of the
Republic of Macedonia was fully implemented on 16.11.2001, when the Assembly adopted these
Amendments (Amendments IV-XVIII). Except for certain modifications of the Constitution Preamble
and the provision regarding religious communities (in respect of which there was full agreement
reached among the signatories of the Framework Agreement) the text of the amendments adopted
by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia is identical to the text of the Amendments contained in
Annex A to the Framework Agreement.
Annex B has been implemented in its major part (see above), including the adoption of the Law on
Election of Members of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic
of Macedonia”, No. 42/02), in accordance with item 6 of Annex B, based on which the Parliamentary
elections were held on 15.09.2002. In the first quarter of 2005, the two remaining laws arising from
the Framework Agreement are to be adopted: the Law on the Use of Languages of the Communities
and the Law on the Use of Symbols of the Communities.
In compliance with the provisions of Annex C (those which have not been elaborated in the hitherto
text of the Answer):
−
−

The Parliamentary elections were held on 15.09.2002, under international monitoring and
according to the ODIHR assessment they were principally in line with the international
standards, fair and democratic.
In respect of return of displaced persons, reconstruction and rehabilitation of the former crisis
regions, the Framework Agreement, in this Annex, envisages the following:

C.3. Refugee Return, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction
C.3.1. All parties will work to ensure the return of refugees who are citizens or legal residents of
Macedonia and displaced persons to their homes within the shortest possible timeframe, and invite
the international community and in particular UNHCR to assist in these efforts.
C.3.2. The Government with the participation of the parties will complete an action plan within 30
days after the signature of the Framework Agreement for rehabilitation of and reconstruction in areas
affected by the hostilities. The parties invite the international community to assist in the formulation
and implementation of this plan.
C.3.3. The parties invite the European Commission and the World Bank to rapidly convene a meeting
of international donors after adoption in the Assembly of the Constitutional amendments in Annex A
and the revised Law on Local Self-Government to support the financing of measures to be

undertaken for the purpose of implementing the Framework Agreement and its Annexes, including
measures to strengthen local self-government and reform the police services, to address macrofinancial assistance to the Republic of Macedonia, and to support the rehabilitation and
reconstruction measures identified in the action plan identified in paragraph 3.2.
the OSCE to continue its efforts on projects designed to improve inter-ethnic relations.
In the course of the crisis, the number of internally displaced persons reached 76.046 (on
11.09.2001), 3921 of whom were accommodated in collective centres and the other with host
families. The process of their return required stabilisation of the political and security situation, return
of the police, reconstruction of damaged houses and rehabilitation of the communities and the
economy.
After the Donor Conference, intensive activities for reconstruction of the houses started (6634 objects
were damaged). At the end of 2004, there remained 112 objects eligible for reconstruction, for which
no funds were provided.
Most of the internally displaced persons returned to their homes and according to the new
registration, the current number of displaced persons is 1424. In cooperation with donors, the
Government has envisaged several instruments for economic rehabilitation of these regions (for
more details see I_K_1, I_K_2, I_K_3 and I_K_4).
15. How is the implementation of the Framework Agreement coordinated? Which are the
bodies involved?
The implementation of the Framework Agreement is coordinated at several levels, as a result of the
complexity of the Agreement and the commitments taken on by its signatories. Consequently, it
imposes obligations for different political agents and requires a strong and continuous political
dedication. Therefore, the continuous political impulse has been crucial for the implementation of the
Agreement and its transposition into the legal system of the Republic of Macedonia and into practice.
Late President Boris Trajkovski, under whose auspices the Agreement was signed, initiated and
conducted political consultations with the signatories with regard to the key questions of the
Framework Agreement.
Subsequent to the 2002 elections the newly emerged political actor (the Democratic Union for
Integration) which accepted the obligations of the Agreement was included in the consultations.
Following the tragic death of President Trajkovski, the newly elected president Branko Crvenkovski,
continued the practice of convening highest level political consultations concerning the key issues of
the implementation of the Agreement. Upon entering the final phase of the implementation of the
Framework Agreement, initiated by President Crvenkovski, a Declaration for Support of the Strategic
Interests of the Republic of Macedonia was signed in Ohrid on 10.11.2004. The Declaration
confirmed the pledges of the Framework Agreement as a viable model for building and promotion of
stable inter-ethnic relations. At the meeting it was agreed to draft a report on the implementation of
the Framework Agreement, which would be the basis for further political consultations.
The key responsibility for the concrete measures for the implementation of the Framework
Agreement lies with the state institutions of the Republic of Macedonia, particularly its Government
and all political actors in the Republic of Macedonia. However, having in mind that the Framework
Agreement was signed with the facilitation of the European Union and the United States of America,
and furthermore that the international community is interested in its implementation as a guarantee
for the stability of the country and the region, information and opinions are regularly exchanged with
the representatives of the international community.
The coordination of the coalition partners within the Government proceeds through the regular
exercise of Government duties and competencies, in accordance with the legal and procedural
norms. If necessary, additional consultations of government coalition partners are conducted, on the
level of party presidents and other levels.

With regard to specific articles e.g. principles of the Framework Agreement and aiming at more
efficient and accelerated implementation of the Framework Agreement, the Government of the
Republic of Macedonia established special bodies for coordination and monitoring of the activities
and the achieved specific objectives. The development of a decentralised government (Part 3 of the
Agreement), non-discrimination and equitable representation of members of non-majority
communities (Part 4), the return of the refugees, rehabilitation and reconstruction (Annex C of the
Agreement) are the three focuses of the Framework Agreement for which the Government has
formed special coordination bodies.
Regarding the point Development of Decentralised Government, the Government of the Republic of
Macedonia has established a three-tiered institutional mechanism for coordination of the
decentralisation process:
- First tier: Working Group. The working group comprises of high ranking civil servants, and their
deputies, representatives of all the ministries – 14 in total. The State Secretary of the Ministry of
Local Self-government chairs this working group. Its task is the formulation of proposals and
initiatives regarding the transfer and management of competencies, the passing of laws determined
by the Government Operational Programme for Decentralisation of Power 2003-2004, adopted in
February 2003, as well as the general strategy in the process of decentralisation.
- Second tier: State Secretaries Group. This group is comprised of the state secretaries of all the
ministries and is chaired by the Minister of Local Self-government. Its members are also the
Secretary of the Legislative Secretariat, the Head of the Sector for European Integration within the
Government of the Republic of Macedonia and the Secretary General of the Association of Local
Self-government Units. This group has a dual function: it provides guidelines and advice for the
actions in the process of decentralisation, and resolves and harmonises the views on the open issues
related to the process of decentralisation.
- Third tier: Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, responsible for
the implementation of the Framework Agreement. The Deputy Prime Minister in cooperation with the
Minister of Local Self-government presents the above-mentioned views to the Government of the
Republic of Macedonia.
In relation to the point Non-Discrimination and Equitable Representation of Members of Non-Majority
Communities the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, established bodies entrusted with
coordination and monitoring of the improvement of equitable representation of members of underrepresented non-majority communities in the public administration and public enterprises. These are
the following:
- Committee of Ministers in charge of monitoring and coordination of the activities aimed at the
improvement of equitable representation of members of non-majority communities in the public
administration and public enterprises (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 09/03).
The Committee is chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister responsible for the implementation of the
Framework Agreement and it comprises of the Minister of Justice, Minister of the Interior, Minister of
Finance and the Minister of Labour and Social Policy.
- Coordination Body for the Preparation of an Operational Programme for Improvement of Equitable
Representation of Members of Non-majority Communities in Public Administration and Public
Enterprises (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 9/03, 11/03 and 15/03). The
Director of the Civil Servants Agency chairs the Coordination Body, while its members are the Deputy
Director of the Civil Servants Agency, the Deputy Secretary General of the Government of the
Republic of Macedonia and state counsellors from the following 11 ministries: Ministry of Economy,
Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Local Self-government, Ministry of Transport and
Communications, Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Education and Science,
Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Labour and Social Policy and Ministry of Health.
Regarding Annex C, i.e. the point on Refugee Return, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction, the
Government of the Republic of Macedonia has established a Coordination Body which monitors the

108/453

situation of the internally displaced persons and suggests measures for overcoming the problems
related to these persons, until they are returned to their homes. A minister without portfolio chairs the
Coordination Body, while its members are civil servants in the Ministry for Transport and
Communication, the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Water Resources Management, and Ministry of Labour and Social Policy. If required, representatives
of other ministries participate in the work of this body.
At its session held on 05.04.2004, the Government reviewed and adopted a Report on Establishment
of the Sector for Implementation of the Framework Agreement. Accordingly, the Secretary General of
the Government, on 20.04.2004, amended the Rulebook on Internal Organisation of the General
Secretariat as a service of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. Based on the new
provisions of the Rulebook, the Sector for Implementation of the Framework Agreement which is
established within the General Secretariat of the Government performs the following tasks: provides
administrative support to the Government in the implementation of the strategic priorities related to
the obligations stemming from the Framework Agreement, and in particular ensuring equitable
representation of members belonging to non-majority communities in the public administration and
other public institutions; monitors the process of decentralisation and public administration reform;
prepares a methodology for adoption of Аction Plans of the Government in the field of
implementation of the Framework Agreement; prepares an Action Plan for development and
monitoring of projects related to the Framework Agreement and for coordination of its
implementation; ensures regular communication, monitors and coordinates the activities for
implementation of the projects of the Action Plans with the specific ministries and other state
administrative bodies; provides expert advise and analytical reports; coordinates the activities with
the state bodies and with external bodies and donors; promotes staffing of required human
resources; supports the activities for ensuring the required funds; actively communicates with the
public; prepares reports for the Government about the implementation of the Framework Agreement;
improves the process of implementation of the Framework Agreement; co-operates with other
sectors of the General Secretariat, gives expert opinion related to the implementation of the
Framework Agreement.
The following units perform the activities within competence of the Sector for Implementation of the
Framework Agreement: Unit for Equitable Representation of the Non-majority Communities; Unit for
Coordination and Co-operation; Unit for Monitoring of the Process of Decentralisation and Public
Administration Reforms in the Republic of Macedonia related to the Framework Agreement; Unit for
Human Resources and Financing; and Unit for Public Relations.
16. What is the current structure of regional and local administration?
The Constitution stipulates the right to local self-government as one of the fundamental values of the
Constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia (Article 8, paragraph 1, line 9).
As prescribed in the Constitution, the local self-government was regulated with the Law on Local
Self-government, the Law on Territorial Division of the Republic of Macedonia and Determination of
the Areas of Municipalities, the Law on the City of Skopje, and the Law on Local Elections, adopted
in 1995 and in 1996.
In 1997, the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia ratified the European Charter of Local SelfGovernment thereby endorsing European standards for the organisation of the local self-government.
Following the signature of the Framework Agreement and the adoption of the Amendments to the
Constitution in 2001, new basis was established for further development of the local self-government,
especially with regard to the new and expanded competencies of the municipalities, advanced
democratic relations in the decision-making on matters of local importance, the new territorial
reorganisation of the local self-government units in the country and fiscal decentralisation

109/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

.
According to the Amendment XVI of the Constitution, the local self-government is regulated by a law
adopted by a two-thirds majority vote of the total number of Representatives in the Assembly, within
which there must be a majority of the votes of the total number of members who belong to nonmajority communities. The same principle is foreseen for the adoption of the laws on municipal
financing, local elections, municipal boundaries and the Law on the City of Skopje.
In line with the Framework Agreement provisions, in 2002 a new Law on Local Self-government was
adopted (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 05/02).
The legal framework for the local self-government in the Republic of Macedonia was completed with
the adoption in August 2004 of these laws: Law on Territorial Organisation of the Units of Local Selfgovernment in the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
55/04), Law on the City of Skopje (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 55/04), Law
on Financing of Local Self-Government Units (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
61/04).
The Republic of Macedonia has a single-tier system of local self-government.
According to the Law on Local Self-government, units of local self-government are the municipalities
and the City of Skopje, as a special unit of local self-government.
The municipalities and the City of Skopje as units of local self-government are founded upon criteria
established by the Law on Local Self-government. The area, the name, and the seat of these units,
as well as the procedure for founding new units of local self-government are determined by the Law
on Territorial Organisation of the Units of Local Self-government in the Republic of Macedonia
(”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 55/04). According to this Law, 84 municipalities
and the City of Skopje, as a special unit of local self-government, are established. Out of these, 33
municipalities have their seat in a city, 41 in a village and 10 municipalities have a seat in the City of
Skopje.
In order to execute their competences, the municipalities and the City of Skopje have their own
sources of revenues which they manage autonomously.
The citizens exercise the right to local self-government directly and through their representatives in
the municipal bodies.
The bodies of the municipalities and the City of Skopje are the Mayor and the Council. The Mayor of
a municipality is the executive of the municipality and is elected every fourth year at general, direct
and free elections through secret ballot in accordance with the Law on Local Elections. The Mayor of
the City of Skopje is elected in the same manner. The members of the municipal Council are citizen’s
representatives elected at general, direct and free elections, by secret ballot and for four years term
of office. The election of the members of the Council is regulated by the Law on Local Elections.
The number of members in the Council is determined depending on the number of inhabitants in the
municipality and cannot be lower than 9 or higher than 33. The Council of the City of Skopje
comprises 45 representatives also elected at general, direct and free elections, organised on the
territory of the City of Skopje. The municipal Council/ the Council of the City of Skopje elects a
president of the Council amongst the ranks of the Council members.
The elections for the bodies of the municipalities and the City of Skopje are called and held
simultaneously in all the municipalities in the Republic of Macedonia and the City of Skopje.

110/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

The competence and organisation of the work of the bodies of the local self-government units (the
Council and the Mayor) are regulated by the Law on Local Self-government and the statutes of the
municipalities/the City of Skopje adopted independently by the municipal councils.
In the municipality where at least 20% of the population, as established by the last census, are
members of a non-majority community, a Committee for Inter-Community Relations is established,
comprising an equal number of representatives of each community represented in that municipality,
elected in a manner determined by the statute. The Committee reviews issues pertaining to relations
among communities represented in that municipality and gives opinions and proposals for resolution
of issues in this area.
Municipal administration is organised for implementation of tasks within the competences of the
municipal bodies.
The organisation, competencies and the manner of implementation of the duties of the municipal
administration are determined by the Council, upon a proposal of the Mayor.
For execution of specific competencies, two or more municipalities may establish joint administrative
bodies for specific areas in accordance with the Law.
The status of the employees in the municipal administration, with exception to those who perform
technical and logistical tasks, is equal to the status of those employed in the central civil service.
They have a status of civil servants and the provisions of the Law on Civil Servants apply to them, as
well (for details see I_C_6).
Municipal administration and administration in the public enterprises established by the municipality
is recruited taking into consideration the principle of equitable representation of the members of nonmajority communities represented in the municipality at all levels of administration, as well as
respecting the criteria of expertise and competence.
In the area of the municipalities, local neighbourhood communities may be formed for the purpose of
direct participation of the citizens in the decision-making process concerning issues of every day
importance for the life and activities of the citizens of that area. As a form of neighbourhood
community with a seat in a city, these communities are defined as urban communities, and those with
a seat in the villages are defined as local communities.
The mayor of the municipality has a legal authority to delegate the execution of specific matters to
the chair of the urban council, or of the local council.
The direct participation of the citizens in the decision-making process concerning questions of local
importance can be realised through a civic initiative, citizen’s gathering or referendum, in a manner
and in a procedure determined by law.
The municipalities, within the framework of the Constitution, the Law on Local Self-government, and
in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, have a right to conduct matters of public interest in the
areas not excluded from their competencies, or not in a competence of the state administrative
bodies.
The municipalities, within the national legal framework, regulate matters of public interest
independently and in a manner determined by law; hence, they are responsible for their execution.
The competences of the municipality, as a rule, are complete and non-transferable and cannot be
taken from them or be limited, except in cases determined by law.
The municipalities are responsible for carrying out matters of public interests of the local community
in the following areas: urban planning; protection of environment; local economic development; utility
services; culture, sports and recreation; social care and child care; education; health care; protection
and rescue of citizens and their property from damages of war, natural disasters, and other

111/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

accidents, as well as protection from the consequences of such events, fire protection and other
matters as determined by law.
The duties are carried out in accordance with standards and procedures determined by laws
regulating the specific areas. These laws also determine the mandatory duties of the municipality.
The laws that define the new competencies of the municipalities also identify the sources of financing
for the exercise thereof.
For the exercise of their competencies, the municipalities establish public services in accordance with
law. Two or more municipalities may pool funds and may establish joint public services in order to
facilitate the realisation of common interests and activities within the competences of the
municipalities.
The state administrative bodies can delegate the execution of specific functions to the mayor in
accordance with law. The manner in which these competencies are discharged may be adapted to
the local conditions; however, the standards determined by law must be respected.
Certain state administrative bodies (ministries and other) depending on the types of competencies
they exercise, within their internal organisation, may organise local offices or other type of
organisational entities in the municipalities, having a seat in a city. These offices are responsible to
perform duties within the competence of the relevant central administrative bodies for the area of two
or more municipalities, within the lines of the municipal boundaries comprising the area.
The municipalities in the Republic of Macedonia are associated in the Association of Local Self–
Government Units (ALSGU).
The Government is obliged to consult the municipalities in the procedures of planning and decisionmaking on issues pertaining to the municipalities, as well as in planning public works, when preparing
the Spatial Plan of the state, in a manner determined by a law in the respective area.
For coordination in planning, developing programmes and implementation of policies in specific areas
or a group of areas, the Government may sign co-operation agreements with one or more
municipalities in the areas of joint interest and may make consultations concerning specific
questions.
17. Is there a detailed plan for the transfer of powers to local governments as foreseen by the
Framework Agreement? Which powers have been effectively delegated? Please explain how
this has been implemented in practice (staff, training, infrastructure, etc.).
Regarding the development of decentralised government the Framework Agreement foresees
adoption of a revised Law on Local Self-government, which would strengthen the authorities of the
elected local representatives and would significantly increase their competences, in accordance with
the Constitution. The increased competences concern the following areas: public services, urban and
rural planning, environment protection, local economic development, culture, local finances,
education, social security and healthcare.
In November 2001, the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia adopted the Amendments to the
Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia which created the constitutional basis for development of
legislation on the specific competences of the local self-government defined under the Framework
Agreement.
In January 2002, the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia adopted the Law on Local Selfgovernment (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 5/02), which as an organic law
establishes the new local self-government in the Republic of Macedonia and specifies the
competencies defined by the Framework Agreement and stipulated in the Amendments to the
Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia.

112/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

The transfer of competences including the development of the normative framework, as a first stage
of this process, and their actual transfer, as the second stage, is designed and implemented in
accordance with the relevant programme documents adopted by the Government of the Republic of
Macedonia.
In February 2003 the Government adopted the Operational Programme on Decentralisation which, in
accordance with the specified competencies of the local self-government, identified the activities, the
responsible bodies and the time frame.
The Programme envisaged adopting or amending 42 laws governing the areas covered by the
Framework Agreement, and regulated by the Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of
Macedonia and the Law on Local Self-Government.
The enactment of the laws under the Operational Programme for Decentralisation created legislative

Republic of Macedonia”, No. 55/04);
− Law on the City of Skopje (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 55/04);
− Law Amending the Law on Local Elections (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
No. 12/04 and 52/04).
In order to implement the adopted laws and to further coordinate and plan the actual transfer of
competences, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia adopted a Programme for
Implementation of Decentralisation Process 2004-2007 and an Action Plan in November 2004. They
specify the activities time - frame and responsible bodies for the actual (effective) transfer of
competences, in conformity with the defined legislative framework and the target dates.
The Programme for Implementation of the Decentralisation Process 2004-2007 establishes an
obligation, until the date for the local elections, within the established system of coordination of the
decentralisation process, to develop a Detailed Plan for Transfer of Property, Equipment and Human
Resources from the central to the local level. The process of detailed planning of the realistic transfer
of competences is in its final stage. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia in January 2005
adopted the draft version of the detailed transfer plan, and by March 2005 it shall adopt the final text
of the Plan.
The basis for development of the plan for transfer of the property, equipment and human resources
are the individual analyses and plans of the ministries for registration and transfer of property,
equipment and human resources to the new municipalities that will start functioning after the local
elections.
The Plan describes:
−

Phases - timeframe of transfer;

−
−

Political Criteria

Number and type of property, assets, equipment and human resources that will be
transferred;
Actual number of civil servants that will be transferred;
Necessary funds to transfer to municipalities in order to be able to perform the transferred
competencies;

Pursuant to the draft versions of the plan, the key transfer of property, equipment, human resources
and finances has been envisaged in the following areas:
−

Education (responsible: Ministry of Education);
• A total of 1.016 primary schools and 81 secondary schools will be transferred as
well as 3.759 technical staff;
•

−

The complete transfer of competences and resources for salaries of teachers and
other staff as well as costs for maintenance of transferred facilities shall be
finalised by 2007;

Security (responsible: Ministry of the Interior);
• Transfer of fire brigades (property, equipment and 751 personnel);

−

Finances (responsible: Ministry of Finance) transfer will be made of premises and computer
equipment as well as of 177 employees working with municipal and financial accounts,
management, collection of utility fees and property tax;
− Culture (responsible: Ministry of Culture) - 48 institutions (libraries, arts centres, museums,
etc) will be transferred to the municipalities, including the transfer of legal rights as well as 577
employees; and
− Social and child care – Transfer of: kindergartens, homes for elderly, other social care
institutions.
The effective transfer of competences from the central to the local level is established by the
provisions of the respective laws governing the issues of transfer of competences. Most of these laws
envisage effectuating of the transfer following the local elections, as of 01.07.2005. The basic reason
for this is that the current 123 municipalities and the City of Skopje are reorganised into 84 new
municipalities and the City of Skopje, which will start functioning as new entities after the local
elections. The agglomeration of the municipalities is aimed at creating viable entities, capable to
efficiently perform the new and increased competences.
A certain type of competencies in specific areas, which does not require transfer of property,
equipment and human resources and which essentially does not depend on the size and the current
capacities of the municipalities, can already be performed pursuant to the provisions of the respective
laws. Those are the following competencies:
−
−

Education, healthcare and social care – management of institutions of local importance;
Crafts - determining the working hours of the crafts workshops, depending on the local
customs and needs, as of September 2004;
− Healthcare – general measures for protection against spreading of communicable diseases,
as of mid-October 2004.
A specific area where the transfer of competences has effectively started is culture. In this area, the
municipalities have adopted the relevant acts, pursuant to the new Law on Culture, for transfer of the
establishment rights of the Cultural Centres of local importance, which are located within their
territory.
It is planned that the transfer of personnel is done based on a regulation of the Government of the
Republic of Macedonia, upon prior registration and allocation of the civil servants from the local units
of the ministries, the competences of which are transferred to the local level. The training of the
municipal administration is carried out and coordinated in accordance with the Memorandum signed
among the Ministry of Local Self-government, the Civil Servants Agency and the Association of
Municipalities in the Republic of Macedonia (ALSGU)

Training of municipal administration is carried out and coordinated pursuant to the Memorandum
signed between the Ministry of Local Self-Government, the Civil Servant Agency and the Association
of Municipalities in the Republic of Macedonia. Additionally, a national plan within the Trilateral
Committee for Coordination of Training is currently in preparation.
Implementation of certain pilot-projects in the areas of finances and of culture is also under way,
through which the capacities of the municipalities to exercise their competences are simulated.
18. Please elaborate on the issue of fiscal decentralisation. How has funding been ensured, or
is going to be ensured, to enable local governments to fulfil all their responsibilities? Have
measures been taken to strengthen the financial management capacity of the municipalities?
1. The fiscal decentralisation in the Republic of Macedonia aims at ensuring financial independence
of the municipalities (own revenues which the local self-government units will manage independently)
and resource matching the transferred competencies (ensuring proportionate relationship between
the sources of revenues and the costs of exercising the competencies).
Fiscal autonomy is provided for the municipalities within the framework of legally established ceilings
for taxes, charges and other fees for delivery of public services. In line with Article 6 of the Law on
Property Taxes (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 61/04), and Article 2 of the Law
on Communal Fees (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 61/04), revenues from
taxes, charges and other fees present own sources of financing for the municipality. Their level is
determined by a decision of the municipal council. Additional revenues of the municipalities are the
grants from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia.
The sources of financing are regulated in Articles 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Law on Financing of Local
Self-government Units (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 61/04 and 96/04).
Fiscal decentralisation is envisaged to be implemented in two phases in order to establish
mechanisms of financing the municipalities that will be transparent and based upon objective criteria
and measures. The phase-in approach will be carried out based on the following principles:
−

Gradual transfer of competencies, in accordance with the capacities of the municipalities to
assume these competencies;
− Equitable and adequate provision of funds to the end of efficient and smooth exercise of the
transferred competences, and
− Reduction of the resources in the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia and the extrabudgetary funds relating to the functions to be transferred under the competences of the
municipalities.
The phase-in approach of fiscal decentralisation is regulated by Articles 44, 45 and 46 of the Law on
Financing of Local Self-Government Units ("Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No.
61/2004).
2. Resources for exercising the competences by the municipalities will be provided from own
(municipal) sources of revenues, transfers of resources from the Budget of the Republic of
Macedonia and from the budgets of the extra-budgetary funds, as well as by borrowing in
accordance with Article 3 of the Law on Financing of Local Self-Government Units.
According to Article 4 of this law, own sources of revenues are the following:
a) Local taxes determined by law, the rate of which is determined by the Municipal Council:
−
−
−
−

Property tax;
Inheritance and gift tax;
Tax on transactions of real estate, and
Other local taxes determined by law.

116/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

b) Local fees determined by law, the amount of which is determined by the Municipal Council:
−
−
−

Utility fees;
Administrative fees, and
Other local fees determined by law.

c) Local charges determined by law, the amount of which is determined by the Municipal Council or
the maximum amount of which is determined by law:
−
−
−
−

Charge for landscaping construction land;
Charges from utility activities;
Charges for spatial and urban plans, and
Other local charges determined by law.

d) Ownership revenues:
−
−
−

Revenues from rent;
Revenues from interest;
Revenues from sale of property, in case when the sale does not disturb public functions and
competencies.

e) Revenues from donations;
f) Revenues from fines established under special laws in particular areas;
g) Revenues from voluntary contributions:
e) Other revenues determined by law.
According to Article 5 of the Law on Financing of Local Self-government Units the following are also
considered as revenues of the municipalities:
−
−

Personal income tax revenues collected in the amount of 3% on earnings originating from
salaries of natural persons, collected in the municipality in which the natural persons have
their registered dwelling and place of residence and
Personal income tax revenues collected in the amount of 100% on natural persons carrying
out craftsmanship, registered pursuant to the Law on Craftsmanship in the area of the
municipality where they are registered for performing such activity.

Additional revenues in the budget of the municipality for financing its competences, defined by law
are provided in the form of grants from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia and from the
budgets of the extra-budgetary funds, in accordance with Article 8 of the Law on Financing of Local
Self-government Units. The grants are allocate as follows:
−
−
−
−
−

VAT revenues;
earmarked grants;
capital grants;
block grants; and
grants for delegated competences.

VAT revenues, according to Article 9 of the Law on Financing of Local Self-government Units (as
general grant) are allocated to municipalities according to the Decree on Methodology of Allocation of
Revenues from the Value Added Tax adopted annually by the Government of the Republic of
Macedonia, by 30th of June at the latest in the current year, for the following year. With respect to
2005, the Decree should be adopted two months before the application of the Law on Financing of
Local Self-government Units at the latest, i.e. by 01.05.2005.. At least 50% of the VAT revenues is
allocated according to the population criterion and other criteria. The municipality decides
independently about the usage of the VAT revenues.

Chapter I

Political Criteria

The earmarked and capital grants referred to in Articles 10 and 11 are used for specific purposes investments in accordance with the needs of the municipality and/or the development of the state.
The purposes and amounts of these grants are determined in a transparent way through publishing
the criteria, procedures and deadlines for allocation of these grants for the following year by the line
ministries and extra-budgetary funds, by 30th March of current year at the latest, as stipulated in
Article 8, paragraph 4. With respect to the allocation of these grants in 2005, the Government of the
Republic of Macedonia will have to adopt Decrees on Methodology of Allocation of Earmarked and
Capital Grants, excluding the resources for salaries and wages, two months before the application of
the Law on Financing of Local Self-government Units at the latest, i.e. by 01.05.2005.
The block grants referred to in Article 12 are allocated for financing the competencies in the area of
culture, social care and childcare, education and health care. The use of the block grants will begin
when the conditions for the second phase of the fiscal decentralisation are fulfilled. Thus, the
competencies in the areas of culture, social care and childcare, education and health care will be fully
financed. The municipalities will receive appropriate amounts of revenues and will manage them
independently according to the methodology for establishment of criteria for allocation of block
grants, based on a formula that uses appropriate indicators on the needs of each programme.
The grant for delegated competences referred to in Article 13 is used for financing specific
competences delegated by a state administrative body to the mayor of the municipality.
VAT revenues and block grants transferred from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia to the
budget of a municipality is carried out in at least 12 instalments, pursuant to Article 17, thus providing
timely execution of the functions of the municipalities.
It is considered that this system of financing of the municipalities will ensure better collection of the
own revenues, the share of which in the total municipal revenue is 33.20%. Furthermore, these
revenues are expected to increase in the following period. Additionally, the system of grants should
provide smooth execution of the responsibilities of the municipalities, including the financial
equalisation that should reduce the disparities in the fiscal capacities of the municipalities.
3. Most of the activities for strengthening the financial management capacities of the municipalities
the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Local Self-Government undertake in cooperation with
international donors.
To the end of improving the financial and accounting reports, part of the local offices of the Ministry of
Finance performing the financial and accounting tasks for the municipalities, are equipped with
computers and other IT equipment and office supplies. Funds for this purpose are provided from the
Budget of the Republic of Macedonia in the amount of 6.000.000 MKD.
At the end of 2002, the Ministry of Finance signed a Memorandum of Cooperation with the
municipalities of Veles, Gostivar, Sveti Nikole and Struga for launching pilot projects for improvement
of the collection of property taxes and utility fees. The Mayors were given full competences for
determining and registering the taxpayers. Thus significant progress was achieved in these
municipalities and the revenue collection was increased (property tax by 41.9%, tax on transfer of
real estate by 195.0%, inheritance and gift tax by 106.4%, and utility fees by 16.6%).
The main objective of this cooperation was ensuring better recording of taxpayers and greater
revenue collection in these municipalities. By improving the IT equipment and preparing software
program for collection of the utility fees necessary to be finally tested and approved by the Public
Revenue Office and the municipalities, it is believed that the collection of local taxes will definitely
improve. In the coming period, it is planned to prepare a software for property taxes, for personal
records of taxpayers and for tax accounting, as modules of an integrated system of data processing
of the local taxes and fees.
During the drafting of the Law on Financing of Local Self-government Units (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 61/04, 96/04), the Law on Property Taxes (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 61/04), and the Law on Utility Fees (“Official Gazette of the Republic of

118/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

Macedonia”, No. 61/04), significant assistance was provided to the Ministry of Finance by experts
from the IMF, USAID under the Local Government Reform Project and the Council of Europe
Resident experts and part-time engaged experts for certain issues provided significant support to the
working groups in preparing the text of the laws (analysis of laws of the EU Member States and other
countries in the region, documents related to acquis communitaire, comparative analyses).
Taking into account the amount of arrears of the municipalities, having potentially large influence on
the implementation of the decentralisation process, the Ministry of Finance, under the 2003 CARDS
Programme, prepared a Report on the Debt of the Municipalities in the Republic of Macedonia in the
period May-June 2004. The report identified the amount of the debt and defined guidelines for further
activities for settling the arrears.
Continuing activities in the Ministry of Finance aimed at realisation of the project that should propose
Plan for Rescheduling, Restructuring and Settlement of the Municipal Debt. The plan is realised with
technical assistance by the USAID Macedonia. So far, the types of debt as well as the creditors have
been identified and separate financial records for each municipality in terms of arrears have been
prepared. Information was submitted to the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, together with
draft conclusions. Further activities will be carried out under coordination by the Ministry of Finance.
At the same time, activities have been undertaken to the end of training the employees in the
municipal administration, especially in financial management. Manuals were prepared to the end of
efficient financial management of the municipalities, those being: Manual on Financing Local SelfGovernment Units, Manual on Preparation of Municipal Budgets and Manual on Execution of
Municipal Budget, providing detailed instructions to the local civil servants in planning of the political
and program directions and guidelines of the local authorities related to financing the competences,
pursuant to the laws and regulations.
The advantages of joint administration from the point of view of improved management of the funds
and decrease of the costs, as an objective to be met by the municipalities with weaker fiscal capacity,
were promoted by a project supported by the Organisation for Cooperation and Security in Europe.
The Municipality of Kičevo and six other municipalities in that region were taken as a pilot project.
The project also included training activities for improved management of the municipal administration
throughout the year. To the end of strengthening the capacities of the civil servants in specific
ministries and Mayors of some municipalities, study tours and seminars were organised during 2004,
and cooperation with other states from the EU and the region was realised in order to get familiar
with the systems of these countries (Germany, Austria, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro). During
2004, more than 600 persons (mayors, employees in the municipal administration, civil society
representatives, etc.) participated in the training Management of Available Resources.
On the basis of research, studies, and publications by the UNDP Macedonia in the past two years,
financial management capacities of the local and central government were strengthened. The
following reports were published: National Report on Human Development 2004 - Macedonia;
Decentralisation for Human Development; Socio-economic Disparities Among Municipalities in
Macedonia; Data and Indicators for the Municipalities in Macedonia; Profile of a Municipality in
Macedonia - Definitions and Sources, Study on the Financial Management of the Municipalities in
Macedonia.
On the basis of the Report on the Assessment of Measures for Oversight, Financial Control and
Supervision Over the Operations of the Municipalities, UNDP Macedonia Project, in co-operation with
the Ministry of Local Self-government and the Civil Servants Agency, organised a number of trainings
in the period January-March 2003. These trainings were attended by 159 persons, and were aimed
at strengthening the capacities of the local authorities by building capacities for financial
management and transparency.
At the beginning of 2005, a number of donors (World Bank – Municipality Development Project,
European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR), OSCE spill-over mission in Skopje, USAID Macedonia)
have jointly prepared a coordinated Programme for the development of a plan for training in financial

119/453

management and reporting in the municipalities, including Train the trainer and training of financial
officers.
Manuals have been prepared on laws and regulations with respect to the employees in the municipal
administration and with respect to the newly elected officials in the municipal bodies, all that to the
end of improving the understanding of this target group of the decision-making process and
management of the available resources.
Strengthening of the capacities of all participants in the process of fiscal decentralisation is also an
aim of the EAR project, financed under the 2004 CARDS Programme, Financial Management and
Reporting of the Municipalities, to be conducted in 2005.
19. Which changes have been introduced to the boundaries of the municipalities?
The Law on Territorial Organisation of the Local Self-government in the Republic of Macedonia,
adopted on 11.08.2004 (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 55/04), provides for the
reduction of the number of municipalities from 123 to 84. The changes in the municipal boundaries
were done in order to enlarge and consolidate the municipalities in the Republic of Macedonia. With
a few exceptions, the enlargement of the municipalities has been mainly carried out by a full merger
of two or more municipalities as defined by the former Law on Territorial Organisation.
Some settlements from one municipality are adjoined to another municipality due to the better
communication links with the new municipal centre. These are the settlements: the village of Kjafa
from the municipality of Oslomej (according to the previous Law on Territorial Organisation from
1996) has been merged with the municipality of Gostivar; the villages of Mogorče, Osoj and Gari,
from the municipality of Mavrovo-Rostuše, merged with the municipality of Debar; Gorno Jabolčište,
Dolno Jabolčište, and Drenovo, from the municipality of Veles, merged with the municipality of
Čaška; the villages of Zubovce, Klečevce, Jačince, Kosmatec, Murgaš, Dovezence, and Beljakovce
from the old municipality of Klečevce, merged with the new municipality of Kumanovo, while the
villages of Drenok, Alince, Orah, Rugince, Oblavce, Strezovce, and Vojnik, are merged with the
municipality of Staro Nagoričane. One of the main parameters for such mergers was the provision of
Article 18 of the Law on Local Self-Government (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
05/02), which provides that municipal boundaries must not cross the boundaries of the cadastre
municipalities.
Under this Law, 41 municipalities ceased to exist, while 2 new municipalities were formed (see Table
- List of Transformed Municipalities). The share of the small municipalities (those with up to 5.000
inhabitants) in the total number of municipalities has reduced from 37% to 19%, while the share of
municipalities with 20.000 to 50.000 inhabitants has increased from 12% to 20%. At the same time,
the share of large municipalities (from 50.000 to 100.000 inhabitants) has increased from 7% to 16%.
The average size of the municipalities has increased from 209 km2 to 306 km2 and from 16.443 to
24.078 inhabitants. The biggest municipality, according to the number of inhabitants, is Kumanovo
(with 105.484 inhabitants), replacing the formerly biggest municipality of Kisela Voda (within Skopje)
which had 125.379 inhabitants and was split into two new municipalities (more detailed information
about the 123 municipalities is given in Chapter 21, Section I Territorial Organisation 21_I). The
smallest municipality is Vraneštica with 1.322 inhabitants, replacing the previously smallest
municipality of Staravina with 316 inhabitants. Following the changes in the municipal boundaries,
there are no municipalities with less than 1.000 inhabitants in the Republic of Macedonia. The
biggest municipality in terms of territory is Prilep with 1.039 km2 while the smallest municipality is that
of Šuto Orizari with 6 km2. Before the changes of the municipal borders, the biggest municipality
according to territory was the municipality of Konopište with 606 km2, while the smallest one was
Šuto Orizari with 6 km2. With the Law on Territorial Organisation of the Local Self-government in the
Republic of Macedonia, the former municipalities of Saraj and Kondovo were adjoined to the City of
Skopje, forming a new tenth municipality - Saraj within Skopje.

The Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia is consisted of 25 judges. Among the Supreme
Court’s judges, a President is elected for a term of four years, with a possibility of one re-election for
another four year term. The election of the Supreme Court's President is carried out by the Assembly
of the Republic of Macedonia, upon a proposal submitted by the Judicial Council of the Republic.
The Supreme Court has a Secretary, three court departments (Criminal, Civil and Department for
Administrative Disputes), IT Centre, Case Law and Training registry and Service of the Court.
The Supreme Court’s competences include: deciding in second instance on its Chambers’ rulings
pursuant to a law; deciding in third and final instance upon appeals on appellate courts’ rulings and
its Chambers’ rulings brought in second instance pursuant to a law; judging upon extra-legal
remedies against final court judgments and rulings of its Chambers pursuant to a law; judging upon
conflicts of competence between basic courts falling under jurisdiction of different appellate courts,
between appellate courts and basic courts and between different appellate courts, as well as
deciding upon handing over the territorial jurisdiction from one court to another.
At its general sessions, the Supreme Court:
−

Delivers opinion on election and on existence of reasons for dismissal of judges;
Decides upon requests for protection of legality against its Chambers’ rulings, and
Considers reports on its performance and the performance of other courts.

The competences of appellate courts
Appellate courts are second instance courts. They are competent to decide upon appeals on rulings
of basic courts. Besides this primary prerogative, appellate courts are empowered to decide in
conflicts of competence between basic courts falling under their jurisdiction and to perform other
duties determined by law.
The competences of basic courts
All basic courts are first instance courts and they are empowered to decide in first instance in cases
of judicial competence in criminal, civil and non-contentious matters; execution and security;
verification of title deeds; misdemeanours (unless provided by law that other bodies decide upon
specific types of misdemeanours in customs, foreign exchange, foreign trade and tax issues).
Sixteen basic courts, besides the above mentioned competences, in the territory for which they are
established, pursuant to Article 32 of the Law on Courts, are also competent to:

protection against illegal activities and on recognition and permission to execute foreign courts’
judgments. Finally, these courts conduct activities of international legal assistance unless other
body’s competence has been stipulated by law.
Only three basic courts are authorised to keep court registers: the Basic Courts of Skopje, Bitola and
Štip. In order to ensure single records of the registered entries, a collective court register has been
established for the entire territory of the Republic of Macedonia kept by the Skopje I Basic Court. The
three aforementioned basic courts are also authorised in cases of perpetrated crimes against the
armed forces.

3. Independence of the judiciary: Is independence guaranteed by the Constitution? How are
the rights of the judiciary protected? Please describe the selection, promotion and
disciplinary procedures of judges and prosecutors and indicate how they relate to the
accountability and independence of the judiciary.
Independence of the judiciary
Article 93 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 1/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), guarantees the independence of the
judiciary. It stipulates that courts are autonomous and independent and act on the basis of the
Constitution, laws and the international agreements ratified pursuant to the Constitution.

128/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

The Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/02),
includes a number of provisions which guarantee the independence of the judiciary. In performance
of their functions and goals, courts are bound only by the Constitution and laws and the international
agreements ratified pursuant to the Constitution. In application of the law, a judge is not bound by a
superior court’s legal opinion. A judge renders unbiased rulings on the basis of his/her free
judgement of evidence and application of law. Any form of influence over a judge is prohibited in
relation to proceedings upon specific cases and, in particular, public statements aimed at exerting
influence over the course and the outcome of a court procedure. No restrictions, influences,
incentives, pressures, threats or direct or indirect interference are allowed in decisions rendered by a
judge. No one is entitled to restrict in any manner or prevent a judge’s right to freely pronounce a
ruling. A re-consideration of court rulings or changes in a court’s composition aimed at influencing
their judgement may not be allowed by a law or by an act of the state authority. Every state authority
is obliged to refrain from committing or tolerating actions which prevent bringing of judgements or
enforcement of court decisions.
The independence of the judiciary is also ensured with the provisions of the Law on Courts which
provide for the inviolable effect of a legally valid court decision, as well as with the provision under
which a court ruling may be changed or abolished only by a competent court and in a procedure
stipulated by law. Furthermore, court decisions are binding for all natural and legal persons and are
superior in authority in relation to any other body’s decisions. The enforcement of a final and
effective court decision shall be conducted as promptly and efficient as possible, and may not be
prevented by any other state body’s decision.
The judicial function is incompatible with any other public office, profession or membership in a
political party. Public offices that are incompatible with the judicial office, pursuant to the Law on
Courts, are the following: Member of Parliament, i.e. Member of a Municipal Council and official in a
state body, municipal body or a body of the City of Skopje. In addition, the Constitution, in Article
100, paragraph 3, explicitly prohibits political organisation and activity in the judiciary. A judge may
not be a member of a political party and may not conduct political office in a political party, or
perform party or political activities. Judges may establish associations in order to exercise their
interests further their professional education and protect the independence and autonomy of the
judicial office.
Judges are granted immunity. The immunity of judges is decided upon by the Assembly of the
Republic of Macedonia. A judge or a lay judge may not be held accountable for an opinion
expressed or a ruling made in rendering judicial decisions. A judge may not be detained without an
approval of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, unless caught while perpetrating a criminal
act punishable by imprisonment of at least five years. The procedure of deciding upon judges’
immunity is urgent and is conducted following a prior opinion of the Judicial Council.
Significant for ensuring the independence of the judiciary are also the provisions of the Law on
Courts under which a judge, while performing the judicial office, may not accept gifts from parties in
a procedure or from persons having direct or indirect interests in a trial. Similarly, significant is the
provision which prohibits an indemnity or another lawsuit against a judge or a lay judge instituted by
a party dissatisfied with a court ruling.
Pursuant to the Law on Courts, the police may not enter the court premises. Police may enter the
court premises only if necessary, in order to prevent a general threat or upon a request by the
president of the court, or by a request of a judge in case of president’s absence so as to prevent a
punishable act. Security of courts’ facilities, property, persons and keeping of order is provided by
the court police.
Apart from the fact that the independence of judiciary has been guaranteed as one of the postulates
of the rule of law, the right to an independent and impartial court is also guaranteed as an affirmative
and personal right that every person enjoys in the course of criminal proceedings or upon decisions
made in relation to a person’s civil rights and duties. The independence and impartiality of the judge
in the course of decision-making upon a concrete case is ensured through the application of the
principle of derogation. Pursuant to Article 36 of the Law on Criminal Procedure, a judge or a lay

129/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

judge may not perform judicial office if, а) he/she has been an injured party in the criminal offence; b)
the defendant, the plaintiff, their legal representative or authorised person is his/her marital i.e. nonmarital partner, a lineal relative by blood of any degree or collateral relative up to the fourth degree;
c) he/she has been in a relationship of a foster-parent, foster-child, adopter, adoptee, guardian,
sustained, with either the defendant, his/her attorney, the plaintiff or the injured party; d) has
performed investigative proceedings in the same case or has participated in the examination of the
defendant prior to the main hearing, or has participated in the procedure as a prosecutor, defending
attorney, legal representative or authorised person, or has been examined as a witness or an expert
and e) if he/she has participated in rendering of judgement by the lower-instance court in the same
case.
Similarly to the above, in civil proceedings the judge may be derogated in the event of grounds for
suspicion that he or she will not be impartial (Articles 65-70 of the Law on Litigation Procedure). The
rules on distribution of cases in accordance with objective and previously defined criteria ensure the
right to the so-called “natural judge.”
Election of judges
Pursuant to the Constitution and the Law on Courts, judges are elected to a permanent term of
office. Judges are elected and dismissed by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, upon a
proposal by the Judicial Council. The establishment of this body was the final stage of the process of
ensuring the independent position of the judicial authorities, as it ensured that assessment in the
most sensitive segment (election and dismissal of judges) is done by a professional rather than a
political body.
The procedure of election of judges commences by the publication of a public announcement in the
Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia on selection of a judge at the respective court. The
number of judges in each court is determined by a decision of the Assembly of the Republic of
Macedonia, upon a proposal put forward by the General Session of the Supreme Court of the
Republic of Macedonia. The number of lay judges in each court is decided by the Assembly, upon a
proposal of the first-instance courts and courts of appeals.
Elected as a judge may be a citizen of the Republic of Macedonia who fulfils the general, legally
prescribed conditions on employment in a state administration body; who is a graduate lawyer; and
who has passed the bar examination and enjoys an adequate reputation for performing the judicial
office. Apart from these conditions, for a judge in a first-instance court, the candidate is required to
have a working experience of over 5 years with proven results in legal matters after he/she has
passed the bar examination. For a judge in a court of appeals, the candidate is required to have
such experience of over 9, whereas for a judge at the Supreme Court the candidate’s experience
must be over 12 years. A full or a part-time university professor who has been teaching a legal
subject related to the judicial practice for more than 10 years may also be elected as a judge at the
Supreme Court.
A court president is elected under conditions, in a procedure and manner applied for election of
judges, for a term of four years and from among the judges at the respective court, with a possibility
of one re-election to another four year term. If not re-elected, the outgoing president of a court shall
continue to work as a judge in the respective court.
The conditions for election of a lay judge are the following: to be a citizen of the Republic of
Macedonia of legal age and to have completed at least high school and to enjoy adequate reputation
for performing the duty. Lay judges are elected for a four year term with a possibility of re-election.
The Judicial Council nominates for election the person with highest professional and working merits
among the candidates fulfilling the prescribed criteria. In that, particularly taken into account shall be
the data on the working performance of the candidate, upon a provided opinion on the professional
and working merits of each of the candidates from the court, the body or other legal entity in which
he/she has been employed, by the court to which elected, a higher-instance court and the Supreme

130/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

Court of the Republic of Macedonia. On the Council Session at which a proposal is determined for
election or dismissal of a judge, opinion is given by the Minister of Justice and the President of the
Supreme Court.
In order to further the independence of the judiciary in the Republic of Macedonia, the system of
election of judges will be changed. The foreseen changes have been clearly defined in the Judicial
Reform Strategy (for more details see I_Annex_02). Namely, it has been proposed that the election
of judges will be excluded from the competence of the Assembly as it is a political body. Election
(appointment) will be transferred to the Judicial Council that will be composed primarily of judges.
Hence, its members will be selected from the judiciary itself, which will be the primary guarantee for
the respect of the independence of the judiciary. Another important novelty shall be the introduction
of an initial training of candidates for judges that will last between 12 and 15 months and will be
performed by a School for judges. The introduction of these changes will also establish a system of
career promotion, under which the Judicial Council will decide on the appointment of a judge to a
higher court, on the basis of clearly defined objective criteria.
Dismissal of judges
A judge may be dismissed in cases determined by the Constitution and in a legally prescribed
procedure. Pursuant to the Constitution, a judge is dismissed, а) upon his/her request; b) if he/she
becomes permanently incapacitated to perform the office, which is determined by the Judicial
Council; c) if he/she fulfils conditions for retirement; d) if sentenced for a criminal offence to an
imprisonment of at least six moths; e) if he/she commits a serious disciplinary offence, as stipulated
by law, which makes him/her unsuitable to perform the office as decided by the Judicial Council and
f) owing to unprofessional or negligent performance of the office, as decided by the Judicial Council
in a procedure stipulated by law.
The following are considered serious disciplinary offences which make a judge unsuitable for
performance of the office and owing to which he/she may be dismissed: a) serious breach of public
order and peace which damages his/her reputation and reputation of the court; b) party or political
activity; c) performance of another public office or profession; d) serious disturbance of relations
within the court that have serious effect over the performance of the office and e) serious violation of
the rights of parties and other participants in a lawsuit, with damaging effect over the reputation of
the court and the judicial office.
The Council institutes a procedure for determining disciplinary liability of the judge if there are wellfounded suspicions that the judge has committed a severer disciplinary violation as defined by law, which
makes him/her unsuitable for performing the post of judge.
Prior to the initiation of the procedure, the Council requests from the judge to plead with regard to the
allegations against him/her in the proposal for the initiation of a procedure. Until the procedure is initiated,
the proceedings are confidential in order not to damage the judge's public reputation.
The Council decides on the disciplinary responsibility of judges pursuant to the factual situation
determined by the Commission on Determining a Disciplinary Liability of Judges. The Commission
comprises three Council members of which one chairs it. The Council appoints members of the
Commission and an equal number of deputies for a three-year term.
A proposal for instituting a procedure for determining the disciplinary liability of a judge may be filed by
the Court President, the President of the higher court and the General Session of the Supreme Court of
the Republic of Macedonia.
As an exception, a proposal for instituting a procedure for determining a disciplinary liability of a judge in
the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia may only be filed by the General Session of the
Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia.

131/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

The proposal for instituting a procedure for determining disciplinary liability of a judge is filed within 15
days from the day of detecting the severe violation. The procedure for determining disciplinary liability of
the judge is instituted within 30 days from the receipt of the proposal.
The instituting and processing of disciplinary procedures becomes obsolete after a certain time frame
pursuant to provisions pertaining on initiating and processing of disciplinary procedures in the Law on
Labour Relations.
The judge is given the proposal on the initiation of a procedure for determining his/her liability as well as
a summons to attend the Commission’s debate.
The submitter of the proposal is also invited to attend the debate and he/she represents the proposal.
The Commission interrogates the judge, collects the necessary documents, inspects and examines other
documents in order to determine facts and circumstances related to the disciplinary liability of the judge.
The procedure for determining disciplinary liability of a judge is conducted legally and meticulously and in
a manner that does not damage the reputation and dignity of the judge.
The Council makes a decision with a two-thirds vote from the total number of members. The Council
President appoints one of the Council members as a rapporteur on the disciplinary liability of the judge.
Following the determined disciplinary responsibility of a judge, the Chamber may pronounce
disciplinary sanction written rebuke (reprimand) or temporary reduction of the salary of up to 15% of
its monthly amount, for a period of one to six months.
A judge shall be temporarily suspended from the performance of the office while in custody. A judge
may also be temporarily suspended during an investigation for criminal offence, when a disciplinary
procedure has been initiated, or when a procedure has been instituted for his/her dismissal.
Appointment of public prosecutors and deputy public prosecutors
The operation of the Public Prosecutor’s Office in the Republic of Macedonia has been regulated with the
Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04). The
procedure of appointment of public prosecutors and deputies commences by a public vacancy
announcement in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia. The appointment of a public
prosecutor, i.e. a deputy public prosecutor is conducted by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia,
upon a proposal by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, following a prior affirmative opinion
provided by the Public Prosecutors Council. If the Government does not approve of the opinion provided
by the Public Prosecutors Council, it may request its re-consideration. If the Public Prosecutors Council,
following the re-consideration of the proposal, gives another affirmative opinion by a two-thirds majority,
the Government is obliged to accept the opinion.
Public prosecutors are appointed for a term of six years. Important novelty introduced with the new Law
on Public Prosecutor’s Office (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04), is the
establishment of permanent term of office for deputy public prosecutors in accordance with the
Recommendation (2000) 19 of the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers. This provision contributes
for the strengthening of their independence. The Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office prescribes the
necessary conditions for a person to be appointed as a public prosecutor or deputy public prosecutor.
Namely, elected as a public prosecutor or a deputy may be a citizen of the Republic of Macedonia who
fulfils the general, legally prescribed conditions for employment in a state body, and is a graduate lawyer
who has passed the bar examination and enjoys adequate reputation to perform the office. In addition, a
candidate for a basic public prosecutor or deputy is required to have a working experience of over 5
years with proven results in legal matters after he/she has passed the bar examination. A candidate for a
high public prosecutor or deputy has to have such experience of over 9 years. For a state public
prosecutor or deputy, a candidate has to be a prominent legal expert with a working experience of over
12 years, with proven results in legal matters. Another important novelty is the provision under which a
public prosecutor in a basic or a high public prosecutor’s office shall be, as a rule, elected from among
the deputy public prosecutors in that office or from among the public prosecutor or deputy-public
prosecutors in another prosecutor’s office. This provision has significantly enhanced the operation of the

132/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

public prosecution and has considerably limited the possibility for external influences in the process of
appointment of public prosecutors.
Additional guarantee provided for a public prosecutor who shall not be re-appointed, is the provision
under which he/she shall continue to perform the office of a deputy public prosecutor in the same public
prosecutor’s office.
The Public Prosecutors Council is a newly established body introduced with the Law on the Public
Prosecutor’s Office. It comprises nine members. Ex officio members to the Public Prosecutors Council
are the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia, who chairs the Council; high public prosecutors
and the Skopje Basic Public Prosecutor, two members determined by the Collegium of the Public
Prosecutor’s Office and two members determined by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia,
upon a proposal put forward by the Minister of Justice.
The Public Prosecutors Council is authorised, among other, to give a positive opinion on the appointment
of a public prosecutor, i.e. deputy public prosecutor; to decide in second-instance in a procedure for
determining disciplinary responsibility, unprofessional performance of duties or unsatisfactory results in
performance of duties. It also performs other duties stipulated by law.
Termination of office and dismissal of public prosecutors and deputy public prosecutors
The conditions for dismissal of a public prosecutor or deputy public prosecutor have been stipulated by
the Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office. They shall be dismissed upon their request; if they
permanently lose their mental and physical capacity for performing the office, which is determined by the
Public Prosecutors Council on the basis of a finding and opinion by a competent medical committee;
when they fulfil the conditions for old-age retirement; if sentenced for criminal offence in abuse of the
office or for other criminal offence to imprisonment of more than six months; if sentenced to
imprisonment of shorter duration or to other criminal sanction for a criminal offence which make them
unsuitable for performance of the office; when it shall be determined that they have committed serious
disciplinary violation of the office, as stipulated by law, thus damaging the reputation of their office; and
when determined that they have performed their office in an unprofessional manner or have yielded
unsatisfactory results in their office. The proposal for dismissal of deputy public prosecutors in the Public
Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia and such proposals for the basic and high public
prosecutors and their deputies are submitted before the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia by the
Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia. A proposal to dismiss the Public Prosecutor of the
Republic of Macedonia is submitted to the Assembly by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia.
The law determines what is to be regarded as a disciplinary violation of the office, and what shall be
regarded as unprofessional manner of performance of the office or unsatisfactory results in the office.
The Law determines the following conduct as a serious disciplinary violation of the office, a) serious
violation of the public order and peace damaging his/her reputation and the reputation of the public
prosecutor’s office; b) performance of another public office or profession; c) serious violation of the rights
of parties and other participants in a procedure, damaging the reputation of the public prosecutor’s office;
and d) dishonest behaviour towards individuals, state bodies or other legal persons, both in performance
of the office and beyond.
The law determines what is unprofessional manner of performance of the office or unsatisfactory results
in the office of a public prosecutor - failure to carry out duties; negligent or unprofessional performance of
official duties; unjustified refusal of official duties, i.e. failure to act upon guidelines given in accordance
with this Law; and violation of the regulations on protection of a state or professional secret.
A procedure to determine responsibility for serious disciplinary violation, unprofessional manner of
performance of the office or unsatisfactory results in the office shall be initiated upon a proposal of the
Government for the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia; the Public Prosecutor of the
Republic of Macedonia for all public prosecutors and deputy public prosecutors; a high public prosecutor
for basic public prosecutor, deputy high public prosecutor and deputy basic public prosecutor; and a
basic public prosecutor for a deputy basic public prosecutor.

Political Criteria

The Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office stipulates the following disciplinary sanctions: public
reprimand; a fine in the amount of 20% of a monthly salary paid in the month immediately preceding the
committing of the offence; and dismissal from the office.
A procedure to determine disciplinary responsibility, unprofessional performance of duties or
unsatisfactory results in performance of the office is conducted by a five-member Committee, whose
composition shall be determined by the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia. Prior to the
procedure, the Committee shall request from the respective public prosecutor i.e. deputy public
prosecutor to respond to the allegations in the proposal for initiation of procedure. The second-instance
authority in the procedure is the Public Prosecutors Council. Following its decision, the Public Prosecutor
of the Republic of Macedonia shall submit to the Assembly a proposal for dismissal of the prosecutor in
question.
A public prosecutor i.e. deputy public prosecutor shall be temporarily suspended from performance of
the office while in detention. He/she may also be temporarily suspended during an investigation for
criminal offence, when a disciplinary procedure has been initiated for serious disciplinary offence, for
unprofessional performance of duties or unsatisfactory results in performance of the office. A
decision on suspension is adopted by the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia, following
a prior response on the allegations by the public prosecutor i.e. deputy public prosecutor. The
decision for the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia is adopted by the Government of the
Republic of Macedonia, upon a proposal by the Minister of Justice.
4. What could be the obstacles preventing judges from enjoying the necessary discretion
when deciding a case?
The judge is not bound by a higher court’s legal opinion. In the principle, case law is not considered
as a source of law in the Republic of Macedonia. According to the traditional approach the role of
judges is considered to be interpretation and not creation of laws. However, the case law has an
influence on the work of courts, which to a lesser of greater extend, base their decisions of the case
law. Decisions in more important or characteristic cases are regularly published in collections of court
decisions, by which the case law contributes to the correct and uniformed application of the law.
Uniformity in the application of laws is also ensured by the Supreme Court, as the highest instance
court in the Republic of Macedonia. At its general session the Supreme Court defines positions on
the principle and principled legal opinions, which are of great importance in the application of laws by
courts.
Despite the fact that legal positivism is evidently strong in the Republic of Macedonia, under which
courts are bound by legal norms, it is understandable that positivism cannot consistently resolve
complicated cases, the resolution of which requires referring to legal theories and general principles
of law. Therefore, it is clear why judges rely on moral principles to complement the principles of law.
The law overall requires judges to accept, as much as possible, that the law is a structure of coherent
sum of principles of justice, fairness and procedural correctness, requiring also that these principles
are applied in the cases that shall be deliberated by judges. In respect of complicated cases judges
are referred to apply principles, as the principles of justice and fairness, in light of their importance
and weight that rules are lacking. Judges rely on these principles to complement the rules. A certain
policy, a standard which defines the goals of the community of economic, political or social nature,
can also be used.
The basic principles of the Law on Courts prohibit any influence on the judge in connection with
deliberating in a specific case prohibiting especially any public statement aimed at influencing the
course or outcome of the court proceedings. A court decision may be changed or derogated only by
a competent court in a procedure prescribed by law.
A judge may not be taken liable due to an opinion or a decision made when judging. No restriction,
influence, encouragement, pressure, threat or direct or indirect interference in the procedure are
allowed over a judge when deciding in a case. The judicial function is incompatible with any other
public office or profession. A judge may not be a member of a political party. He/she may not perform

134/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

political office in a political party nor carry out party or political activities. A judge may not receive
presents from parties or other persons with direct or indirect interest in a trial. The independence of
judges has been ensured by their permanent office (a judge is elected to a permanent term of office)
as well as by the immunity set forth in Article 100 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia.
In addition, procedural laws, include provisions that point to the inviolability of the discretionary rights
of judges when deciding.
Namely, Article 8 of the Law on Litigation Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
Nos. 33/98 and 44/02), stipulates that a Court decides on the basis of its own judgement on the
evidence that shall be taken as proven, based on a conscientious and careful evaluation of each
evidence individually and of all evidence jointly, as well as on the basis of the results of the entire
procedure.
Article 339 of the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
15/97, 44/02 and 74/04), provides that a Court makes its ruling only upon facts and evidence
presented during the principal process. The Court is obligated to assess conscientiously each
evidence individually and in relation with other evidence and on that basis to draw conclusion on
whether certain fact has been proven.
Judges decide based on free assessment of evidence and application of laws. This implies that a
Court is not bound by any formal evidence rules, but evaluates evidence freely and in accordance
with its conviction. However the Law on Criminal Procedure envisages strict evidence related
prohibitions in connection with evidence gathered in an illegal manner or by violating the rights and
freedoms, set forth by the Constitution, law and ratified international treaties, and the ensuing
evidence. Such evidence may not be used and the court decisions may not be based on such
evidence. In the Republic of Macedonia all constitutional and legal pre-conditions have been put in
place for impartial ruling and for prevention of any kind of pressure over court's judgement.
However, the transition, implementation of privatisation, redistribution of power, and occurrence of
organised crime increase the potentials for pressures on judges. What’s more, judges’ salaries are
not proportionate to the status, dignity and responsibility of their office.
An indirect obstacle to full discretionary ruling by judges could be the existing manner of election and
promotion of judges, facilitating political influence. Aimed at resolving this problem, the Judicial
Reform Strategy defines an appropriate solution (for more details see I_Annex_02)

decisions in criminal cases was 32.50 %, in civil cases 41.9% and in commercial cases 40,7%.
6. What is the average duration of cases for (a) civil and (b) criminal decisions? In case of
delays in handling cases, which problems are they mainly linked with?
(For example: complex summoning process; intentional delays by attorneys; prolonged
period for collection of evidence; police evidence not being accepted in courts; failure by
witnesses to appear; failure by judicial experts to appear; workload associated with enterprise
registration; workload associated with high number of appeals; absence of alternative dispute
resolution mechanisms; complex case management; lack of technical equipment.)

The analysis of the performance of the judicial system in the Republic of Macedonia demonstrates that
the delivery of court summons or documents has been one of the main reasons for delays in the
proceedings. The legal provisions that govern this matter leave large space for abuse on the part of the
involved parties by avoiding to receive court summons or documents, or by indicating incorrect or
concealing the accurate address. The principle of personal delivery that has been accepted in the
procedural legislation (both criminal and civil) as a condition associated with individual freedoms and
rights, does not correspond consistently with the other regulation (for residence registration) that would
allow greater civil obedience and functioning of a so-called “mail box” system.
Furthermore, laws allow for an abuse of the institute of exemption (in practice, besides the request for
exemption of the sitting judge, and after a negative ruling upon such a request, an exemption could also
be requested for the Court’s President and even for the Court itself, and even more on several occasions
during the same proceedings upon a single case).
Frequent delays of trial hearings also occur as a result of the failure of the involved parties, attorneys,
witnesses or court experts to appear before the court, despite having been orderly summoned. Such
occurrence has been typical in particular for cases involving larger number of parties, i.e. defendants and
attorneys.
The existing legal provisions which allow new facts and evidence to be presented in proceedings upon
appeals, directly contribute to the delays in proceedings (if a party is not satisfied with the Court’s ruling,
by presenting new facts and evidence in the appeal, it exercises a possibility that the decision may be
revoked by a higher court and the case be remanded to the court of first instance for re-trial and reassessment).
Regarding the alternative resolution of disputes, until now there has been no such system developed in
the Republic of Macedonia. Mediation has been stipulated neither in civil nor in criminal proceedings. The
Law on Litigation Procedure, in Chapter 30 (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 33/98

136/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

and 44/02), regulates the procedure before selected courts; however its scope of application has been
very limited.
Additional reasons for delays in procedure are the non-existence of adequate registers and records, as
well as the low level of technical equipment available to the courts in their handling of cases. Namely,
there is still lack of an integrated and authorised access to good-quality information, as well as of
generation and storage mechanism for all documents from the initiation up to the permanent filing of a
case (inappropriate document management).
At the same time, the flow, organisation and analysis of data are a slow process.
7. Please provide statistics (separate figures for civil, criminal and administrative cases) on
the number of pending cases over the last five years.
The enclosed charts include figures on the received new cases in procedure, decided cases in the
course of the current year, total cases in procedure and the backlog of cases at the end of the year.
The provided figures are for the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia, Appellate Courts and
Basic Courts in the Republic of Macedonia.
If administrative disputes are set aside the figures lead to the conclusion that the Supreme Court is
efficient in deciding upon civil and criminal cases. Similarly efficient in deciding are the appellate
courts. In basic courts, majority of cases are in the domain of misdemeanours. Furthermore, a large
number of the newly received cases for procedure in the courts are enforceable civil (general and
commercial) cases.
An analysis of the performance of courts in the Republic of Macedonia points to the fact that per
year, they manage to decide a number of cases almost equal to the number of the received cases.

8. Are there plans to reduce the backlog of cases? If so, please provide details.
A conclusion may be drawn from the information given in the answer to the question I_D_7 that the
largest backlog of cases has been in the basic courts. Taking into account the inflow of cases and the
dynamics in their resolution, the appellate courts have been efficient in their procedure. If the
structure of the backlog of cases is analysed, we see that the three most serious bottlenecks in
courts are misdemeanours, enforceable civil cases and administrative disputes.
The reasons for backlogs of cases in courts are complex. Partly, they are of a subjective and partly of
an objective nature. Most typical are the difficulties with the delivery, abuse of procedural powers by
the involved parties, certain weaknesses in the procedural laws, organisational position of courts etc.
In addition the large number of court cases is due to the privatisation process, the layoffs resulting
from the economic reforms, the emergence of certain forms of organised crime and other
phenomena typical of transitional societies.
In order to overcome the problem with backlog of cases in courts, the Republic of Macedonia has
undertaken serious measures and actions defined in the Judicial Reform Strategy (see I_Annex_02).
The enhancement of the efficiency in the judiciary is a short term priority within the judicial system
reform and it shall be fulfilled by taking action in several directions. Simplification of procedures,
changes in the organisation and competence of courts, completion of the process of installation of IT
in courts and introduction of a system of measures for alternative resolution of disputes are the
crucial points at which action shall be taken as part of the reform of the judiciary in the Republic of
Macedonia. The effects of these reforms should be - increased efficiency of courts and their
enhanced independence.
Namely, amendments will be proposed to the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/03), in respect to the responsibility and the obligation for case
management and organisation of court delivery service or engagement of specialised delivery services. In
parallel with this activity, appropriate amendments shall be proposed to procedural laws that govern the
delivery process.
Simplification of judicial procedure is a basic precondition to increase the efficiency of the judiciary. In
that direction, reforms of the criminal procedure law have been envisaged, and in a short time the
adoption of a new Law on Litigation Procedure (passed first reading in Parliament) and Law on
Execution and Security (second reading is ongoing), that will include novelties which will allow for an
efficient enforcement of civil judgments, is foreseen.
In the sphere of legislation governing criminal proceedings, and in order to speed up the proceedings,
solutions have been incorporated in the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02 and 74/04), and Law on Misdemeanours (“Official Gazette of the Republic
of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97 and 35/97), based on European standards for accelerating the procedure and
for exercising the right to a trial within a reasonable time. Amendments refer to the efficiency of delivery,
elimination of the abuse of procedural rules by the involved parties aimed at its intentional postponement,
reduction of terms, reassessment of legal remedies and the manner of deciding upon them.

Chapter I

Political Criteria

In the new Law on Litigation Procedure, changes have been envisaged in the following direction:
ensuring clear position of court and parties in the case; more order and discipline in procedural actions;
making sure that the requests and proposals submitted to the court are clear, accurate, well- argument
and submitted in the determined time frame so as to allow the Court to accurately apply the law and
make the decision. The new law will also revise the principle of substantive truth - the burden of proof will
pass on to the parties; the principle of concentration of procedure will be strengthened; presentation of
new facts and evidence in proceedings upon appeals will be prevented; conditions and procedure of
disqualification will be revised; financial sanctions for abuse of procedural powers on the part of the
involved parties will be introduced; a new mechanism of delivery will be developed; the institute of
inactivity of proceedings will be abandoned and certain extra-legal remedies will be redefined.
As far as the alternative dispute resolution mechanisms are concerned, given that the extra-judicial
resolution of disputes by the application of the institute of mediation contributes most directly to reducing
the number of cases and in that way relieving the judiciary from the burden of acting upon cases that
could be resolved in this manner, the Strategy recognises the need to draft a Law on Mediation that
would regulate the various forms of mediation and reconciliation, the arbitral resolution of conflicts, as well
as the legal effect of acts and rulings reached in such an extra-judicial procedure.
With regard to the workload in courts associated with enterprise registration, the Strategy envisages
that the registration is to be conducted out of courts, and that courts only determine the facts of
registration. The objective that is to be achieved is to relieve the courts from acting upon purely
administrative matters related to registration of enterprises and thus accelerate and simplify the
registration procedure itself.
In the sphere of administrative disputes, it has been stipulated that they are derogated from the
competence of the Supreme Court and that they pass into the competence of basic courts.
Reforms aimed at reducing the backlog of misdemeanour cases have been envisaged to be carried
out in two stages. In the first stage, a new Law on Misdemeanours will be adopted that will stipulate a
prior procedure of mandatory sanctions and mediation and settlement between the body competent
to initiate the misdemeanour procedure and the perpetrator of the misdemeanour, and in that way
alleviate the pressure of misdemeanour cases on courts. The second stage will include initiation of
amendments to constitutional provisions which stipulate an exclusive court competence over
misdemeanours as punishable acts. The new constitutional solution should provide for a competence
of administration to decide upon specific minor misdemeanours in traffic, customs, finance and
business, providing at the same time constitutional and legal guarantees for legal protection of
citizens against illegal acts of the state administration.
With regard to the measures and activities pertaining to the changes in the courts’ organisation and
jurisdiction, particularly important is the introduction of a double system of first instance competence by
establishing higher courts of first instance and transformation of certain courts of “minor competence” into
departments within other courts.
In order to simplify and speed up procedures before courts and handle court cases more efficiently, the
implementation of the Judicial IT project will be intensified in the forthcoming period by implementing its
sub-projects in all segments of the judiciary as a follow-up to the already completed project of introduction
of IT in courts. Namely, this project has started with the PHARE 2000 and will be finalised with CARDS
2003 Programme.

The area of enforcement of civil judgments represents one of the most serious problems in the
judiciary. Namely, at the end of 2003 there was a backlog of 175.000 enforceable general cases and
around 35.000 enforceable commercial cases. (For more details see I_D_6 and I_D_7)
The already identified weaknesses in the system of enforcement of civil judgments, such as: the
inappropriate legal framework, favouring of the debtor at the expanse of the creditor, which is a residue
from the previous political system, lack of adequate registers and records and the low level of the
available technical equipment, funds and personnel in the court’s enforcement units, will be to a great
extent overcome by the adoption of the new legal framework.
The new Law on Execution and Security, that is in parliamentary procedure (second reading), will shorten
the deadlines for using the appeal and petition rights, will substantially reduce the grounds for using these
institutes and will develop a concept whereby the position of favouring the debtor will be abandoned.
Furthermore, the new law will create a basis for proper staffing and provision of funds and technical
capacities in courts’ enforcement units and will develop a system of enforcement of rulings out of courts
that will be conducted by authorised persons who will be issued a working licence by the Minister of
Justice.
In order to improve the use of certain records and registers in the country and thus make the information
on debtors, necessary in the execution procedure, available to the competent judicial bodies and trial
parties, changes will be proposed to the laws governing the central register, banking, cadastre and court
register.
On the basis of the aforementioned, the difficulty with the enforcement of civil judgments has been
identified in the Judicial Reform Strategy as a priority that should be tackled in short term. (For more
details see I_Annex_02)
10. Please describe the procedure for executing civil judgements. Is a separate execution
decision by a judge normally required?
The Law on Execution Procedure (“Official Gazette of Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 53/97, 59/00 and
64/03), regulates the rules according to which the courts may act to enforce a ruling imposing obligations,
and to secure claims. (Article 1)
Execution and security procedures are initiated upon the proposal of the creditor or ex officio when so
determined by law. Execution and security is approved and performed by the court (Article 3). The court
is obliged to act urgently in carrying out execution and security procedure.
For execution of decisions in civil matters, the judge needs to adopt a separate execution decision, which
is passed in an execution procedure.
An individual judge conveys the first-instance execution procedure, while a council of three judges
conveys the second-instance ones. The rulings are adopted in a form of a decision or a conclusion. By a

143/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

conclusion, an official person is ordered to enforce certain action(s). The execution conclusion also
contains decisions on other issues related to administering the procedure.
The court allows the execution of procedures on the basis of execution documents (court decision, court
settlement, a decision or settlement in an administrative procedure if it refers to securing claims, notary
documents) or valid documents (invoice, bill, cheque, public document, excerpts from certified business
records, a personal document certified pursuant to law, a document signifying a public document).
The proposal on execution must specify the creditor and the debtor, the legally valid or authentic
document, the obligation of the debtor, the method and subject to execution and other data relevant for
the execution. More creditors, who realise their claims from a single debtor and in the same matter, shall
be disbursed in the order in which they have acquired the right to disbursement in that particular matter.
The court adopts a decision on the proposal, which includes the same elements as the proposal. The
execution decision shall be delivered to both, the creditor and the debtor, while a decision rejecting the
proposal shall be delivered only to the creditor.
Following the execution decision, the judge may undertake execution measures for enforcement of a
ruling imposing obligations, as well as for securing claims.
The execution is conveyed within the limits prescribed by the execution decision.
The execution procedure provides for the following legal remedies: appeal, as a legal remedy against a
first instance execution decision adopted on the basis of a legally valid document; and plea as a legal
remedy against an execution decision adopted on the basis of an authentic document. An appeal shall be
filed within 8 days from the day of the delivery of the first instance decision. No revision or re-opening of
the procedure is allowed against a legally valid decision adopted in the execution and security procedure.
In case the execution document has been legally annulled, amended, abrogated or repealed; if the debtor
has disbursed the creditor’s claims during the execution procedure; if the execution decision has been
legally annulled or amended; if the execution conveyed over the funds registered at a debtor’s account
within the holder of the payment operations or by cash payment has been declared inadmissible, then the
debtor may file a proposal with the court for counter-execution, requesting that the creditor pays back
what he/she has been given with the execution.
Execution aimed at recovery of claims may be carried out through: execution over movable objects;
execution over financial claims of a debtor; execution over claim to hand over or deliver movable objects
or hand over a real estate; execution over shares; execution over other property rights and execution over
real estate. Execution over movable objects is performed by an inventory and assessment of the objects;
by selling the objects and disbursing the creditor out of the acquired amount. The Law includes separate
provisions governing the execution over property of legal entities in order to provide for recovery of
outstanding money claims.
Execution to recover non-financial claims shall be performed through: hand-over and delivery of movable
objects; clearing and delivery of real estate; obligation to act, obligation to be a subject to an action or
obligation to refrain from acting; return of an employee at work; entry of rights in a public register; division
of objects and making a statement of will.
The Law separately regulates the security procedure. As security measures only the following may be
allowed: right to lien on property; establishment of rights to lien on real estate and movable objects, upon
an agreement between the parties; prior measures; and temporary measures.
The Law on Execution Procedure in Article 12 prescribes execution and security restrictions to foreign
state properties in the Republic of Macedonia. Namely, such execution or security may be allowed only
by prior consent from the Ministry of Justice. This consent shall not be necessary if the foreign state has
explicitly agreed on the execution or security.

11. How do you ensure that natural and legal persons from EU Member States have access to
your courts free of discrimination compared to your own nationals?
The principle of equality of the citizens before the courts derives from the general principle of equality of
the citizens as stipulated in Article 9 of the Constitution (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), according to which the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia
are equal in the freedoms and rights regardless of their gender, race, colour, ethnic origin or social status.
The citizens have equal rights before the Constitution and the law.
The rights of foreign citizens are determined by Article 29 according to which they enjoy freedoms and
rights in the Republic of Macedonia guaranteed with the Constitution, under conditions determined by law
and international treaties.
The constitutional provisions for equality are materialised with the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/03). According to Article 7 of this Law, everyone has a
right to equal treatment in front of the courts for the protection of his/her rights and his/her legally based
interests. Everyone has a right to a fair trial within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial
court established by law. No one may be denied access to courts due to lack of material means.
The right to a fair trial in the Republic of Macedonia is guaranteed to each person accused for a criminal
act, regardless of the fact whether he/she is a citizen of the Republic of Macedonia, foreigner, or a
stateless person. Moreover, foreigners have additional guarantees, as in circumstances when they are
detained or deprived from freedom. In such cases they have access to the consular and diplomatic
representative offices as well as a right to a free assistance of an interpreter during the police and court
procedure.
Concerning the civil procedure the Law on Resolving Conflict of Laws with Regulations of Other
Countries in Specific Areas (“Official Gazette of SFRY”, Nos. 43/82 and 72/82), Article 82, stipulates the
obligation for the foreign citizens when submitting appeals to the Macedonian courts to give cautio
iudicatum solvi (securing the costs of due process at the request of the defendant party). Due to this
obligation, the foreign subjects must be released, if the Republic of Macedonia has established diplomatic
or factual reciprocity with the country of origin of this subject.
With the Member States of the European Union, the Republic of Macedonia has established diplomatic
reciprocity in terms of exemption from giving cautio iudicatum solvi, through the ratification of the following
international conventions:
− Civil Procedure Convention, of Hague, 1 March 1954 (“Official Gazette of the SFRY”, No.
06/62); and
− Convention on International Access to Justice, of Hague, 25 October 1980 (“Official Gazette
of the SFRY”, No. 04/88).
With these two Hague Conventions, legal and natural persons from the European Union are guaranteed
the right to exemption from paying the court costs in case of poor financial state.
Member states of the European Union which are not members of the aforementioned Hague conventions
are exempted from paying cautio iudicatum solvi on the basis of factual reciprocity.
The Republic of Macedonia has ratified the European Convention of Human Rights with the additional
protocols and the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Macedonian constitutional
and legal provisions are in compliance with these instruments. The Republic of Macedonia guarantees all
persons under its jurisdiction (including foreign natural persons and legal entities) the right of access to
the courts and the right not to interfere in the private property, as guaranteed by Article 6 of the
Convention and Protocol No.1 to the European Convention on Human Rights. This convention is part of
the domestic legal order and is self-executing (Article 98 and 118 of the Constitution of the Republic of
Macedonia).

The average duration of detention in 2001 was 39 days, in 2002 - 41 days, in 2003 - 44 days,
whereas in the first six months of 2004 it was 46 days. (Source: State Statistical Office)
b)
Pursuant to Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 1/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), a person’s liberty is inviolable.
No person’s liberty may be restricted except by a court decision and in cases and procedure
prescribed by law.
A pre-trial detention before indictment may last, by a court ruling, up to 180 days from the day the
person has been deprived of liberty. Once the indictment have been submitted to the court, detention
may be extended or decided upon by the competent court in cases and in a procedure determined by
law.
Pursuant to Article 1 paragraph 2 of the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic
of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02 and 74/04), the freedom and rights of a defendant and of other
persons, prior to a final ruling, may be restricted only to a necessary extent and under conditions
prescribed by law.
One of the measures that may be taken against a defendant in order to ensure his/her presence and
successful conduct of the criminal proceedings is detention.
The Law on Criminal Procedure in Article 183 sets forth that detention may be ordered only under
conditions stipulated therein. A pre-trial detention must be reduced to the shortest necessary
duration. All bodies involved in criminal proceedings and those that provide legal assistance are
obliged to act with particular urgency if the defendant has been in detention. Throughout the
proceedings, the detention shall be vacated as soon as the reasons for the detention cease to exist
and the detainee shall be released.
Pursuant to Article 184 of the Law, detention may be ordered of a person for whom there is a
reasonable suspicion of having committed a criminal offence and if:
− He/she has been hiding;
− His/her identity may not be determined or in case of other circumstances which point to a risk
of his/her escape;
− A reasonable fear exists that he/she may destroy traces of the criminal act or if there are
specific circumstances pointing that the person may hamper the investigation by influencing
witnesses, accomplices or conceivers;
− Specific circumstances justify the fear that he/she may repeat the criminal act, attempt a
crime or commit a criminal act which he/she has threatened to commit.
Detention is mandatory in case of a reasonable suspicion that the person has committed a criminal
offence punishable by a sentence of life imprisonment.

146/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

Detention is ordered and vacated by an investigating judge. The detained person may appeal to the
Chamber against the detention order within 24 hours from its delivery. If interrogated for the first time
after this deadline has expired, the defendant may appeal while being interrogated. The appeal,
along with the interrogation minutes in cases in when the detained has been interrogated, and the
detention order, shall immediately be submitted to the Chamber. The appeal shall not postpone the
enforcement of the order. The Chamber which decides upon the appeal has to pass its judgement
within 48 hours.
Detention by a judge’s order or a detention ordered by a Chamber (consisting of three judges) for the
first time during an investigation may last up to 30 days from the day of the deprivation of liberty. Any
deprivation of liberty shall count to the duration of detention. In the course of an investigation, the
Chamber may prolong the detention for a term not longer than 60 days. If the crime in question is
punishable by imprisonment of at least 5 years, after the expiry of the 60 days period, a Chamber of
the immediately superior court may extend the detention by up to 90 days. The total duration of pretrial detention may not be longer than 180 days. Upon expiration of this period, the detainee must
immediately be released. During investigation, the investigating judge may cancel detention (Articles
189 and 190).
Once charges have been brought and until the completion of the main hearing, detention may be
ordered, extended, or cancelled only by a Chamber’s decision, either ex officio or upon request by an
authorised plaintiff. The so determined detention may last up to one year (for crimes punishable by
sentence of up to 15 year) and up to two years (for crimes punishable by a life imprisonment). After
30 days elapse from the validity of the latest detention order, the Chamber which has decided on the
detention is obliged, even without the parties’ request, to deliberate whether reasons for detention
still exist and rule on its cancellation or extension. If the defendant flees, a detention period starts
again (Article 191).
Prior to bringing charges in summary proceedings, detention may last as long as necessary to
conduct investigation, but no longer than 8 days. Once charges have been brought and until the
completion of the main hearing, detention may last up to 60 days (Article 419).
c)
Treatment of detained persons has been regulated by the Law on Criminal Procedure. Basic
principles are the following: during detention, the personality and dignity of the defendant may not be
offended and only such measures are allowed against him/her which may be necessary to prevent
an escape or a plan that could be harmful for a successful conduct of the proceedings. The rights of
the detainees have been regulated in detail in a number of provisions of the Law where their rights
have been elaborated. Detainees are recognised the right to 8 hours of uninterrupted rest over 24
hours and the right to stay at least two hours per day in open air within the prison. These rights are
unconditional. Furthermore, detainees are entitled to a diet at their own expense; may bring their own
clothing and use their own linen; supply at their own expense books, newspapers and other objects
that serve their usual needs, providing that this may not be harmful for a successful conduct of the
proceedings, a matter decided upon by the investigating authority.
Following an approval by the investigating judge who conducts the investigation and under his/her
supervision, a detainee may, within the house rules, be visited by his/her close relatives, or by a
physician or other persons, if so requested by him/her. Particular visits may be denied if they may be
detrimental to the course of the proceedings. By knowledge and under supervision of the
investigating authority, a detainee may correspond with persons outside the prison. The right to send
and receive letters and other parcels may be forbidden if they are detrimental for the conduct of the
proceedings. No ban, though, may be imposed on submission of petition, appeal or complaint.
Foreign citizens that have been detained following an approval of the investigating judge may be
visited by heads of diplomatic and consular missions in the Republic of Macedonia. Visit approval
shall be requested through the Ministry of Justice. In addition, detained persons may, upon approval
of the investigating judge, be visited by members of the European Committee for the Prevention of
Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment as well as by members of the

147/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

International Committee of the Red Cross. Upon the Committee’s request, the investigating judge is
obliged to approve them a visit and communication with detainees. These visits may not be
supervised.
In case of a disciplinary offence, the investigating judge i.e. the president of the Chamber may
pronounce disciplinary sanction to restrict visits. However, this sanction does not apply to the
defendant’s communication with his/her attorney. Against the pronounced disciplinary sanction,
appeal may be filed before court’s Chamber. (Articles 193 - 196)
A provision in Article 197 of the Law on Criminal Procedure regulates the supervision over detainees.
This supervision is conducted by the Court’s President or a judge appointed by him/her. Appointed to
conduct such supervision, though, may not be an investigating judge. The Law stipulates that they
are obliged to visit the detainees at least once a week. During the visits, with no presence of a
warden or a guard, they are to become acquainted with the dietary details, the way detainees are
supplied with other necessities and the way they are being treated. If irregularities are observed, the
court’s president or a judge appointed by him/her is obliged to take measures for their elimination. A
public prosecutor may be present during such visits.
As regards disciplinary liability of the security services staff and of the prison staff in general, the Law
on Execution of Sanction (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia Nos. 3/97, 23/99 and 74/04)
refers to general regulations governing labour relations and to the Law on Organisation and
Operation of State Administrative Bodies (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 58/00
and 44/02), Articles 205-212, which envisage disciplinary proceedings against employees for
violation of employment obligations and for other violations of the work discipline when perpetrated
by fault of the employee, and especially if the employee does not fulfil the entrusted tasks
conscientiously and in an orderly manner, if he /she does not abide by the law and other regulations
or by the rules of conduct in the course of work or in relation to the work.
Cases of unprofessional conduct by police officers are examined by the Sector for Professional
Standards (at the Ministry of the Interior). Non-fulfilment of prescribed procedures implies disciplinary
and/or criminal liability of the police officers. In 2002 the Internal Control and Professional Standards
Sector at the Ministry of the Interior has received 220 applications, which resulted in 66 disciplinary
proceedings. In 2003, 770 applications were processed, 273 of which ended in disciplinary
proceedings (item 28 of the Report of the Committee for Prevention of Torture - CPT of July 2004).
The CPT Report recognises progress in respect of important issues: as compared with the previous
visits, the Delegation has received fewer allegations for ill-treatment of persons deprived of freedom
(item 7). However, it has been established that there remain serious problems in the system of
responsibility.
On more details concerning legislative and administrative measures aimed at prevention of
occurrence of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in state institutions, prisons or
police stations; on their compliance with international human rights standards; on measures that
enable inspection of the premises hosting persons deprived of liberty or police stations and on the
legal remedies intended for victims, please see question I_H_12.
d)
Incorporation of human rights in the training of the Macedonian police is a process that has been
accepted by the Ministry of the Interior as a necessity aimed at effective and efficient fulfilment of working
assignments.
Human rights and freedoms have been part of the continuing professional training at the Police Academy
which includes a separate subject in the curriculum: “Human Rights and the Police”. There have also
been additional training programmes and special courses for retraining and professional upgrading.
During the seminars on Human Rights and the Police and Policing in a Democracy, which the Ministry of
the Interior has organised together with the OSCE and the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, special
attention was dedicated to the protection of human rights in police custody.

148/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

In order to enhance the respect of the rights of persons held in custody, in every police station a poster
has been placed, featuring a question "Do you know your rights?” On the poster, which is to be found in
the most prominent part of every police station, the 6 (six) basic rights are written in seven languages namely, 1 – the right to be immediately informed in a language he/she understands of the reasons for
being deprived of liberty and of any criminal charges against him/her; 2 – right to remain silent and to
choose not make a statement against him/herself or against his close persons; 3 – right to be advised by
a lawyer and to have an attorney during interrogation; 4 – right that his family or other person of his/her
choice be informed; 5 – right to be examined by a physician; 6 – right to be brought before a judge within
24 hours. Every police officer assigned to work with apprehended persons or those held in custody must
inform and read out these rights to them. If a person held in custody invokes any of these rights, the
police officer has to enable that right i.e. do everything in order to ensure respect and protection of the
human rights and freedoms of the apprehended i.e. of the person held in custody, when he/she has been
restricted freedom of movement.
The International Committee of the Red Cross has been engaged to organise humanitarian law seminars
for the members of the Special Police Unit “Tiger” and of the Special Police Unit for Rapid Deployment,
as well as other police officers of the Ministry of the Interior.
Similarly, a number of domestic and international governmental and non-governmental organisations
have continuously organised seminars, forums, workshops etc. Topics include human rights in all
aspects, and in particular conduct of the police while enforcing policing authority. All members of the
Ministry of the Interior have been actively participating in these events.
As part of the additional and continuous training of employees of the Ministry of Interior and within the
Police Training Reports, special emphasis has been given to the respect and protection of human rights
while enforcing police authority. Particularly highlighted have been the following topics: Introduction to
human rights and basic human rights issues; deprivation of freedom; arrest and detention within the
context of restriction of the right to freedom of movement; use of force, coercion means and use of
firearms within the context of protection of the right to life; human rights during interrogation in terms of
ensuring a possibility for a fair trial and presumption of innocence; non-discrimination in policing on any
grounds with special emphasis on the rights of vulnerable groups (children, women, elderly and persons
with special needs); arbitrary interference in private life in terms of protection of the right to privacy and
correspondence; policing in a democracy with an emphasis on the basics of democracy; multi-ethnic
society and police; rights of minorities, their representation; and police ethics as a brief police constitution
for their conduct.
The Ministry of the Interior, in cooperation with the non-governmental sector (Peace and Democracy
Initiative and the Frederich Ebert Foundation – Office Macedonia), has carried out a project Partners in
Peace and Prevention. The Project promoted the concept of conflict prevention and early warning by
raising awareness among actors at the local level. Fifty police officers were anonymously surveyed on the
project. This project’s objective was also to obtain feedback on the new decentralisation process that will
raise the level of responsibility of local authorities including the police.
With regard to multi-ethnic tolerance and policing in multi-ethnic environment, workshops have been
organised on the Police in Multiethnic Environment, as a result of cooperation between the Ministry of the
Interior and the non-governmental sector (the Citizens’ Association - Centre for Open Communication),
with an emphasis on the challenge of policing in multiethnic environment.
In 2004 changes to the Criminal Code (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.19/04),
domestic violence have been defined (Article 122). Within the additional police training on the rights of
women, they have been treated as part of human rights Particular emphasis was put on the rights of
vulnerable groups like children, elderly people and persons with special needs. Furthermore, the Ministry
of the Interior in cooperation with UNICEF, Foundation Open Society Institute Macedonia and NGO’ s,
has organised a series of seminars and workshops on domestic violence, sexual abuse of women and
children, trafficking in human beings, attended by the Ministry of the Interior personnel. This kind of
additional training has been planned for 2005, as well. (For more details, see I_F_10)

Similarly, the Police Academy provides higher education and conducts scientific and research
activities, practical work, as well as continuous training. The Police Academy provides training for the
personnel of the Ministry of the Interior and other bodies, institutions and legal persons that operate
in the field of security. In addition, the Academy provides continued education of persons with already
acquired degree of knowledge by providing elementary police education, special training, and
education and training in security management. At all levels of education, all educational components
of the human rights are being incorporated, including rights of women and minorities (Constitutional
law, police and human rights, police ethics and deontology, victimology, international law and
international relations, conflict management, European law, police law and authority enforcement,
policing in multi-ethnic society, gender difference awareness).
With regard to the prison personnel, a Prison Personnel Training Centre has been established which
provides for their comprehensive education, further training and assessment of knowledge.
е)
In the prison system in the Republic of Macedonia, the right to human treatment of detainees has
been guaranteed, as well as the principle to ensure that their personality and dignity are not
offended.
In order to protect the psychological and physical integrity of detainees and ensure the respect of
human personality and dignity the Law on Execution of Sanctions (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 03/97 and 23/99), forbids any form of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment, collective punishment, and coercion.
For violation of the rights of detainees on the part of the prison personnel, a penal procedure,
disciplinary or criminal, is initiated against the official who has violated these rights.
Detainees who have been victims of torture and other forms of inhuman and degrading treatment or
punishment may exercise their rights pursuant to Article 50 of the Constitution according to which,
every citizen may invoke the protection of freedoms and rights set forth in the Constitution, before
courts of law and the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia, in a procedure based upon
principles of priority and urgency.
In cases when torture and other forms of inhuman treatment have elements of a criminal offence,
detainees may exercise their right to protection by filing criminal charges to the public prosecutor.
Acts subject to a private lawsuit may be filed to the court of law. For criminal offences subject to ex
officio prosecution, in case the public prosecutor has dropped the charges, the victim i.e. the injured
party has a right to take over the prosecution as a subsidiary prosecutor. If a person has suffered
damage as a result of a criminal offence, he/she has a right to file a damages claim, and if he/she is
referred to a lawsuit the case shall be resolved in a civil suit in accordance with general provisions on
indemnity.
In cases of torture or other forms of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, protection may
be sought from the Ombudsman (Articles 24, 31, 32 from the Law on the Ombudsman), who, in
accordance with the Constitution, protects the freedoms and rights of citizens when they have been
violated by an act or activity of state administrative bodies or bodies and organisations with public
authority. If the Ombudsman detects violation of constitutionally and legally guaranteed rights of
detainees, he/she may propose an initiation of a disciplinary measure against the official person, or
may file to the public prosecutor a request on initiation of criminal proceedings against that person.
Furthermore, Article 20 of the Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office (“Official Gazette of the

criminal and other legally determined punishable offences, the public prosecutor is authorised to
ensure consistent implementation of sanctions pronounced for punishable acts and protection of
persons who have been detained.

13. Detention:
a) What is the ratio of prison sentences compared with alternative sentences?
b) Are inquiries into cases and allegations of ill treatment of detainees followed up? If so, how
is this done? What is done to ensure a thorough, transparent and independent process?
c) What is the average number of prisoners per cell? Are prisons over-crowded?
d) Is special attention devoted to female prisoners and young offenders? If yes, please
provide a detailed description.
e) Are alternative measures to imprisonment being developed or in place? If yes, please
describe the measures.
a)
Pursuant to Recommendation Number R (92)16 of the European Rules on Community Sanctions and
Measures, adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on 19.10.1992, the
Republic of Macedonia has incorporated in its domestic legislation alternative measures with the
adoption of the Law Amending the Criminal Code (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
No. 19/04), passed on 30.03.2004. Taking this into consideration, there are still no indicators as to
the ratio between prison and alternative sentences.
However, even before the 2004 amendments to the Criminal Code, the system of sanctions had
included probation, probation under supervision and court reprimand as alternative sanctions. Since
these sanctions were pronounced in lieu of prison sentences, serving as indicator may be the
statistical data on the ratio of the pronounced prison sentences compared with probations and court
reprimands as distinct criminal sanctions, which have now, with the amendments to the Code, been
transformed into alternative measures. Thus, in 2003, 5796 persons were sentenced to prison,
probation was pronounced to 2831 and court reprimand was imposed on 183 persons. It follows that
the ratio of pronounced criminal sanctions probation and court reprimand (which under the new
Criminal Code are alternative measures) compared with the prison sentences was 52 %.
b)
Taking as the starting point the Constitutional provision that no one may be restricted freedom,
except by a court decision and in cases and procedures prescribed by law (Article 12), as well as the
endorsement in the Law on Execution of Sanctions, (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
Nos. 03/97, 23/99 and 74/04), of international standards set forth in the UN Standard Minimum Rules
for the Treatment of Prisoners and the European Prison Rules, persons that are subject to sanctions
are treated in a humane manner, with respect for their human dignity and by protecting their physical
and moral integrity. Any form of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is prohibited.
Article 184 (paragraph 1) and 185 of the Law on Execution of Sanctions regulate the use of coercion
and firearms. On the use of coercion or firearms information shall be provided to the Sanctions
Enforcement Authority, which shall assess the justification of the application of these methods. If
unlawful use of coercion has been determined, against the official who had used the coercion or had
ordered such a use, a penal procedure, disciplinary or other, shall be initiated, depending on the
extent to which the competence had been exceeded.
Pursuant to Articles 163-167 of the Law on Execution of Sanctions, the convicted persons are
entitled to file complaints and other submissions to protect their rights to competent authorities and
other institutions, and they are entitled to be given answers. A convicted person is entitled to an oral
or a written complaint to the head of the institution, who is obliged to consider it and decide on it
within 15 days. Against this decision or in case the head of the institution does not pronounce any
decision on the complaint, the convicted person is entitled to file an appeal to the Directorate for
Execution of Sanctions, the decision of which is final and after which the convicted person has a right
to court protection.

The Ombudsman of the Republic of Macedonia, too, follows the developments in the area of
protection of the rights of detained and apprehended persons or persons serving prison sentences.
They are entitled to file submissions to this body. The Ombudsman may perform visits and
inspections anytime without prior announcement or approval; he/she may talk to persons deprived of
liberty without the presence of official persons.
In respect to this question, for more details see I_H_12 and I_D_12.
c)
In the prisons in the Republic of Macedonia, there are on average 3 to 5 persons per cell, with the
exception of the premises in the two wings of the Closed Unit of the Idrizovo Penitentiary where there
are 20 persons per cell, but rooms are spacious and the standard of 9 m3 per person is fulfilled.
Activities are currently underway for the complete refurbishing of one of the two wings, which shall
include division of rooms into smaller cells. In the third wing of the Closed Unit of the Idrizovo
Penitentiary that has already been refurbished, each cell houses 2-3 persons.
Taking as the standard the criterion of 9м3 per person for housing of prisoners, the following prisons
are over-crowded: the Skopje Prison (semi-open institution) which hosts 56 prisoners beyond its
capacity (out of whom 43 are convicted, 10 serve misdemeanour sentences and 3 are detained) and
the Tetovo Prison (semi-open institution) that hosts 13 prisoners beyond its capacity (including 3
convicted, 9 detained and one person serving misdemeanour sentence), which makes a total of 69
prisoners. It should be noted that in the Tetovo Prison, activities are currently underway for an
extension of the Prison’s building. Despite the fact that the aforementioned prisons are over-crowded,
each of their inmates has his own bed, linen and locker in the cell where accommodated. The overcrowded accommodation refers to the fewer cubic meters than the prescribed 9м3 per person. The
other semi-open or open institutions as well as the closed institution in the Republic of Macedonia are
not over-crowded and their capacity is not filled if the 9m3 per person standard is taken into account,
as there is room for more than the currently accommodated prisoners.

d)
There is a separate female wing in the Idrizovo Penitentiary. Female persons serving prison
sentences are accommodated in this wing. In a separate segment within the same wing, minor
females serve juvenile prison sentences.
In addition to the aforementioned categories, a separate segment within this unit is the one for
females to whom a correctional measure has been pronounced.
It should be noted that the number of younger female juveniles is small. Namely, currently there is
only one person in this category, but there are periods with no such offenders.
Particular attention is dedicated to pregnant prisoners and mothers who are provided the necessary
professional medical care. Before and after giving birth, pregnant inmates and mothers are provided
a diet in accordance with the type and quantity prescribed by a physician. Pregnant inmates, upon a
proposal by a physician, are transferred to the maternity unit. As a rule, the transfer is done six
weeks before delivery, but it may be done earlier if so proposed by the physician. Pregnant inmates
give birth in specialised health care institutions. Mothers stay in the maternity unit until the infant is
one year old, unless released earlier from serving the sentence. All costs for nurturing and health
care of the child are borne by the prison. Once the child has become one year of age, the Social
Centre shall take the necessary measures for its accommodation. The Birth Register must not
include information that the child was born in prison. With regard to the work leave during pregnancy,
childbirth and maternity, the general conditions apply.
In all other aspects, female prisoners are entitled to equal rights and obligations as male prisoners.
Pursuant to the legal provisions in the Republic of Macedonia, to younger prisoners juvenile prison
sentences may be pronounced of up to ten years. Male individuals serve juvenile prison sentences in
a separate institution.
Correctional measure may be pronounced to younger individuals and they may be placed in
correction institution. A pronounced correctional measure may last from one to five years. Male
individuals serve pronounced correctional measure in a separate institution.
On reception in the institution, young offenders are evaluated by an expert team that includes
psychologist, pedagogue, social worker, physician, as well as other experts if need be. Applying
special scientific methods, the team conducts a social, medical, psychological and pedagogical
examination of the person and designs an individual programme. Methods of corrective work with the
offender are determined and these activities are coordinated with school lessons in primary and
secondary education and with engagement in the workshop where practical training is conducted.
Measures are also proposed for an enhanced correction process. On the basis of the results from the
examination, classification is done and an correctional programme is designed so as to ensure active
participation of the young offender during his/her stay in the Institution. Personal deficiencies are
detected for the purpose of their elimination through individual work. In accordance with the
requirements for their re-education, a type of work is determined for the inmates by taking into
account their physical and intellectual capacities and the institution’s available resources. When
determining a type of work, individual wishes of the inmate are taken into account. An inmate who
shall obtain specific qualification in the Institution shall be given a certificate which must not indicate
that it had been obtained in the Institution.
At least once a year a comprehensive medical examination of the inmates is conducted. They are
offered possibilities for spare time activities, such as culture, amusement and sport. They are
regularly visited by the Social Centres staff. Frequent visits are enabled to their families and close
persons.
Disciplinary measure of sending to a solitary confinement may last from 3 to 7 days for minors to
whom corrective measure has been pronounced and up to 10 days for minors serving a juvenile

prison sentence. No measure of isolation may be pronounced to minors. A daily diet of at least
14.600 joules per person is provided to minors. Their daily stay in open air may not last less than two
hours.
In all other aspects, young offenders are entitled to equal rights and obligations as other prisoners.
e)
Alternative measures were introduced in the Republic of Macedonia by the Law Amending the
Criminal Code (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 19/04).
Types of alternative measures:
1. Probation;
2. Probation under supervision;
3. Conditional dismissal of charges;
4. Community service;
5. Court reprimand;
6. House arrest.
Alternative measures are executed once the court ruling by which they have been pronounced becomes
final/ enforceable.
The aim of these measures is not to use punishment for lighter crimes against a criminally
responsible perpetrator when this is not necessary and when it may be expected that the purpose of
the punishment may be achieved by a warning with a threat of punishment (probation), by a warning
itself (court reprimand) or by measures of assistance and supervision of the perpetrator’s behaviour
while free.
1. Probation
Probation as an alternative measure is pronounced by court when it determines a sentence of
imprisonment for a perpetrator of crime and at the same time determines that the sentence shall not be
executed in case the perpetrator does not commit further crimes over a period to be determined
by court, which may not be shorter than one or longer than five years. Probation is provided in
cases when a sentence of up to two years of imprisonment or a fine has been prescribed. When deciding
upon probation, the court is guided by the offender's personality, his/her previous life, his/her
conduct after the perpetration of the crime and other circumstances. Should the offender
commit further criminal offences during the controlling period, the probation shall be revoked.
2. Probation under supervision
Probation may also be pronounced under supervision to be conducted by the Social Centre. Probation
under supervision entails that the criminal offender shall have specific obligations to fulfil such as
undergoing medical treatment, ban on use of narcotics and alcohol, family obligations, acceptance of a
job etc. If the offender does not abide by the determined obligations, the court may extend the duration of
the probation or revoke it.
3. Court reprimand
Court reprimand is pronounced for criminal acts punishable by prison sentence of up to 1 year. When
deciding upon the reprimand, the court takes into consideration the offender's personality, his/her
previous life, his/her conduct after the perpetration of the crime and the degree of criminal responsibility.
In practice, this para-penal sanction has been pronounced in criminal acts such as defamation, insult,
disclosure of personal or family circumstances, and other acts which contain elements of reduced social
threat.
4. Conditional dismissal of charges

154/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

This alternative measure may be pronounced to a perpetrator of a criminal act punishable by a fine or by
a prison sentence of up to one year. In such a case, once the defendant and the injured party have been
interrogated and the injured party has given consent, the court may interrupt the proceedings, providing
that the defendant does not commit further crimes during the period for which the proceedings have been
dismissed (controlling period). The procedure may be dismissed for a period of up to one year, during
which the period of limitation does not run. Providing that the offender does not commit further criminal
acts during the controlling period, the court shall stop the proceedings. When deciding upon the use of
this alternative measure, the court shall in particular take into consideration the expressed regret on the
part of the offender, removal of the consequences of the criminal act, consequences suffered by the
victim and compensation of the damages caused by the criminal act.
5. Community service
Community service is pronounced for a criminal act punishable by a fine or a sentence of imprisonment of
up to three years. The court may pronounce this alternative measure with consent by the offender, if the
crime has been perpetrated under mitigating circumstances and if the offender has not been previously
convicted. This measure may be pronounced for duration of 40 to 240 hours, and it imposes on the
offender an obligation to render service, with no financial compensation, in a state body, public enterprise,
public institution or a humanitarian organisation. Community service is organised during state holidays,
Saturdays or Sundays, with duration of at least five hours per week in a period of up to 12 months. The
court conducts supervision over the execution of the responsibilities on the part of the offender. The court
shall issue a written reprimand in case the offender fails to fulfil his/her responsibilities. If he/she continues
with such conduct, there is a possibility that the hours of community service be extended, or that the
unfulfilled part of the service be replaced with a fine or imprisonment, whereby for every three hours of
community service a day of imprisonment is calculated or a daily fine i.e. an equivalent of 20 EUR in
MKD.
6. House arrest
The alternative measure house arrest may be pronounced if a perpetrator of a criminal act, punishable by
imprisonment of up to one year, is an elderly or exhausted person, i.e. is seriously ill or is a pregnant
woman. Upon his/her prior consent, the court may decide that he/she serves the sentence in house
arrest. The Court may replace a prison sentence with house arrest if conditions exist to control with
modern electronic or telecommunication devices the enforcement of the house arrest. Supervision over
the enforcement of house arrest shall be conducted by the court, which is also entitled to decide on
specific measures of supervision to be undertaken by the police in the place where the house of the
convicted is located, with an obligation for regular reports on the conducted supervision. If the offender
violates the ban on leaving his/her house, the court may decide that the sentence be entirely served in a
punitive institution.
14. What is the annual budget of the judiciary? Please provide a breakdown for the last five
years. What is the procedure for deciding the budget?
Financing of the Judiciary
By the adoption of the Law on the Court Budget (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
60/03), a new way of judicial authority funding was introduced that contributed to the enhancement of
the independence of the judiciary of the Republic of Macedonia.
Under this law, the judicial budget is a part of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, classified as
a separate “Court System” section. This part of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia is
determined in its total amount, in accordance with the criteria decided by the Court Budget Council,
on the basis of the fiscal policy and the main categories of projected revenues and expenditures. The
Court Budget Council allocates these funds to the courts.

155/453

Chapter I

Political Criteria

The Court Budget Council plays a key role in the financing of the judiciary. It constitutes of a
President and eight members. Presiding over the Court Budget Council is the President of the
Supreme Court, while its members are as follows: the President of the Judicial Council of the
Republic, the Minister of Justice, Presidents of the Appellate Courts in Skopje, Štip and Bitola and
three presidents of basic courts at a rotation system. The President of the Court Budget Council
actively participates in the drafting and the approval of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia.
He/she represents the judiciary at the Government session when the Draft Budget is approved and at
the working bodies’ sessions and the plenary session of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia
on which the Budget is discussed.
The Court Budget Council has a substantial competence in the sphere of financing of the courts’
system. This body sets the criteria and methodology for drafting of the Court Budget, allocates Court
Budget funds to courts, takes measures aimed at prompt execution of the Court Budget and
approves funds for new jobs in courts within the determined Court Budget’s total salary amount. A
service unit has been established as an internal organisational entity within the Supreme Court of the
Republic of Macedonia assigned with the Court Budget Council’s administrative matters.
The Law on Court Budget fully prescribes the procedure of drafting, determining and execution of the
Court Budget. The drafting of the Court Budget is made on the basis of the fiscal policy and the main
categories of projected revenues and expenditures for the next fiscal year, as well as the internal
criteria and methodology established by the Court Budget Council.
The Court Budget Council submits to the courts a circular letter including the main guidelines for
drafting courts’ financial plans. It also includes the methodology for drafting of the courts’ financial
plans (key parameters, procedure and the deadline to draft the financial plan), as well as the
indicative total expenditure for each beneficiary, within which a projection has to be made by types
and the necessary data that are to be attached to the budget.
On the basis of the above-mentioned guidelines, courts submit to the Court Budget Council, by 01.06
of the current year at the latest, the following data:
−
−
−
−
−

Projection of the expenditures for the fiscal year, by expenditure items and sub-items;
Projection of the expenditures for the next two fiscal years, by expenditure categories;
Review of the required expenditures for necessary new employments;
Proposals that include the future liabilities or several-year expenditures, including investment
projects indicated separately; and
Expenditures for each of the following years indicated separately.

Besides the indicated data, courts are obliged to submit to the Court Budget Council an explanation
on the level of amounts needed per position. Once the Court Budget Council receives proposals, it
drafts the Draft - Court Budget and, along with the explanation on the level of amounts, submits it to
the Ministry of Finance. Before submitting the Draft Budget of the Republic of Macedonia to the
Government of the Republic of Macedonia, the Minister of Finance shall necessarily harmonise the
“Court System” section of the Draft Budget with the President of the Court Budget Council. If no
assent is reached, Ministry of Finance prepares a report and submits it to the Government.
In the execution stage, the Court Budget Council allocates funds to courts. Each court’s President is
responsible for the execution of the court’s financial plan.
The Court Budget Council follows the financial plan execution and in case it identifies irregularities or
violations in the process on the part of a court’s president, it shall notify the Supreme Court of the
Republic of Macedonia, the Ministry of Justice, the Judicial Council, the Ministry of Finance and the
State Audit Office.
The Law on the Court Budget is fully in line with the Law on Budgets and other regulations in the
area of finance. It also provides for an internal audit over the financial plan execution in courts that
shall be done by an internal auditor appointed by the Court Budget Council.

Financing of the Public Prosecution Offices
The new Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
38/04), introduced novelties in financing of the public prosecution organisation. The main
characteristics of the financing of the public prosecution offices follow the positive trends and
experience acquired in the implementation of the new financing model in the judiciary.
Namely, the financing method of the public prosecution offices has been regulated under a separate
chapter in the Law on Public Prosecutor’s Office. Funds for the operation of the public prosecution
offices are provided from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia through the budget beneficiary –
Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia. Funds for the operation of the primary and
the high public prosecution offices are provided from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia
through the budget beneficiary – Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Before the approval and the vote on the Budget in the Assembly, the Ministry of Finance that
proposes the Public Prosecution Offices Section in the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia has to
submit it for an opinion to the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia. This opinion is
necessarily submitted to the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia along with the proposal of the
Public Prosecution Offices Section in the Draft-Budget of the Republic of Macedonia.
At the stage of drafting of the Budget, the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia
drafts a single budgetary calculation based on the calculations submitted by the primary and the high
prosecution offices and the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia. The Public
Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia submits to the Ministry of Finance the single
budgetary calculation for all prosecution offices and the explanation on the level of the requested
amounts. Before submitting the Draft-Budget of the Republic of Macedonia to the Government of the
Republic of Macedonia, the Minister of Finance harmonises this part of the Draft Budget with the
Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia.
In the stage of the Budget execution, the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia,
upon a prior consent by the Council of Public Prosecutors, shall allocate to the prosecution offices
the funds approved in the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, applying adequate measures and
criteria.

15. How is effective access to free legal aid in criminal cases ensured? Can free legal aid also
be obtained in civil cases? Please give details on the criteria for receiving legal aid in civil
matters.
The right to defence is a constitutional category, which under the Constitution of the Republic of
Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03)
is guaranteed starting with the police procedure. The person charged in a criminal procedure has the right
to defend himself/herself in person or by legal assistance of his own choosing and to have legal
assistance assigned to him/her, in any case where the interests of justice so require, and without
payment by him/her in any such case if he/she does not have sufficient means to pay for it. This right is
not absolute in light of the fact that the accused can choose exclusively a lawyer to act on behalf of
his/her defence and according to the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02, 74/04), there are cases determined in which the accused must have a
defence attorney, who is appointed by the court, if the accused does not appoint one (in case the
accused is a dumb or a deaf person, or incapable of defending himself/herself, or in case of a criminal
procedure against him/her for a criminal act for which a prison sentence of 10 years is prescribed or life
sentence is prescribed in the law, if detention has been determined or is tried in abstention). The accused
may be exempt from payment of defence lawyer costs if the payment of costs would threaten his/her
subsistence or of his/her family. In such cases the costs are covered by the state budget.
The accused my have free legal assistance even when there are no conditions for obligatory defence
(Article 67) if the procedure is instituted against a criminal offence for which the law prescribes a prison
sentence more than a year. In such cases the the accused may be appointed a defence attorney on
his/her request, provided that his/her property status would not allow him/her to cover the costs of
defence.
Deciding upon the request shall be the President of the Chamber, while the President of the Court shall
appoint the defence attorney.
The appointment of a defence attorney to an accused of poor material status is possible only upon a
submitted request. The costs incurred to prove the poor material status shall be covered by the accused.
In deciding on granting free legal assistance when this is required by the interests of justice, domestic
court follows the criteria established with the jurisprudence of the European Human Rights Court:
seriousness of the criminal offence and the severity of the possible sanction, the complexity of the case
and the personal circumstances of the accused.
Free legal assistance in, civil law is regulated by the Law on Litigation Procedure (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 33/98 and 44/02), which prescribes the so called indigent law as a form of
relief for the participants in the procedure.
The Law on Litigation Procedure stipulates that the Court shall relieve from paying the costs of procedure
a party whose material status does not allow the coverage of these costs without endangering the party
and his/her family’s essential personal sustenance.
When making a decision to relieve from paying the costs of procedure, the Court shall closely evaluate all
the circumstances, and shall in particular take into account the value of the matter of conflict, number of
persons sustained by the party and the income of the party and members of his/her family.
In these procedures the court may appoint a proxy from the ranks of lawyers. Upon the request of the
party to the procedure, when the party is exempt from payment of the costs for the procedure, the court
shall determine that the party is represented by a proxy-lawyer is necessary for the protection of the rights
of the party to the procedure (Article 160 of the Law on Litigation Procedure).
Taking as the starting point the position of the Bar in the Republic of Macedonia, which is defined as
public service that provides legal assistance and performs competences in accordance with the law, free

159/453

legal assistance is prescribed in Article 6 of the Tariff on Reward and Remuneration for Lawyers’
Services, which stipulates that a lawyer is obliged to provide free legal assistance to a party who may,
under law, be exempt from paying the costs in the procedure (indigent law).
The Bar Association of the Republic of Macedonia offers free legal assistance through its Project “Free
legal assistance, legal culture and socialisation”.
The main goal of the Project is to provide regular and adequate services to specific categories of persons
unable to pay for the services and whose right to free legal assistance is guaranteed by the Constitution
and the laws of the Republic of Macedonia.
This group includes all social welfare users, such as: handicapped persons, single parents, family
violence victims, child abuse victims and those in need of a free legal advice and protection in particular
circumstances. These persons shall submit evidence for their social status by a competent state body.
These services are offered in all types of cases: civil, criminal and administrative.
Beneficiaries are offered full protection of their legally guaranteed rights, if being denied, violated or
endangered. Full protection consists of free legal assistance that includes preparation and drafting of
acts, legal advice, as well as a possibility to benefit from free copies of legal texts.
Free legal assistance is provided by the lawyers-members of the Bar Association of the Republic of
Macedonia, who, to no compensation, represent their clients’ interest in courts and other institutions, as
well as in the European Court of Human Rights, in Strasbourg.
So far, the Bar Association has opened six offices for free legal assistance in Bitola, Kumanovo, Gostivar,
Delčevo, Štip and Ohrid, encompassing 70% of all lawyers in the Republic of Macedonia.
16. Human resources policy:
a) Describe the methods and criteria for the selection, appointment and promotion of
candidates for judicial office. How are judges and prosecutors recruited (are there competitive
exams)?
b) Is the performance of holders of judicial office assessed? If yes, describe the body in
charge as well as the relevant methods and criteria. Is there a merit based career system?
c) Is there a higher council of the judiciary? If so, describe its composition, role, premises and
budget. How are members appointed? How long is their mandate? Can the mandate be
renewed?
d) Is there an Inspection Service for the judiciary? If so, describe its composition, role, way of
functioning and budget.
a)
Pursuant to the Constitution (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92,
31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) and the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/02), judges are elected to an unrestricted term of office. Judges are elected
and dismissed by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, upon a proposal by the Judicial
Council of the Republic of Macedonia.
Elected as a judge may be a citizen of the Republic of Macedonia who fulfils the general legally
prescribed conditions for becoming an employee in a state administration, who is a law graduate, has
passed the bar exam, and has adequate reputation for the judicial office. Besides these conditions, a
candidate for a judge to a basic court, once having passed the bar examination, has to have a
working experience in legal matters of over 5 years, with confirmed results. A candidate for a judge to
an appellate court has to have such experience of over 9 years, whereas for a Supreme Court judge
election, the candidate’s experience has to be over 12 years. Elected as a judge to the Supreme
Court may also be a full-time or an associate university professor with a tenure related to judicial
practice for more than 10 years.

160/453

A court’s President is elected under conditions, in a procedure and manner applied for the election of
judges, for a term of four years and from the judges in the respective court, with a right to one reelection to another four-year term. If not re-elected, the outgoing court’s President shall continue to
work as a judge in that court.
The Judicial Council nominates for the election the candidate with the highest professional and workrelated qualities among those fulfilling the prescribed criteria. In the process, particular account is
taken of the information on the achievements of the candidate, deriving from the provided opinions
on the professional and work-related qualities of each of the applicants by the court or the other legal
entity in which employed, the court to which being elected, a higher-instance court and the Supreme
Court of the Republic of Macedonia. At the Council’s session that determines the proposal for
election or dismissal of a judge, opinion is also given by the Minister of Justice and the President of
the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia.
The criteria for election of judges have been set forth by the Judicial Council. The general criteria
upon which a Judicial Council’s nomination is based are the following: the nominee should be a law
graduate from the appropriate study programme, should have the reputation and authority necessary
for performing the judicial function, should have undergone prior preparations for successful
performance of the judicial function, should have the necessary working experience, independence,
competence, diligence and commitment, conscience and impartiality, ethics, professionalism,
physical and mental ability and should be a citizen of the Republic of Macedonia.
Within the existing system for election of judges in the Republic of Macedonia, there is no direct
merit-based career promotion system i.e. a candidate can be appointed to a higher court only
through a separate selection process in accordance with the indicated procedure and conditions.
Still, in practice, the judges to higher courts are most often selected from those in the lower courts,
whereas judges to basic courts are mainly selected from among the expert associates (law clerks)
within the courts.
So far there has been no special school for judges authorised to provide their initial training. As has
been previously indicated, the condition to be elected a judge or a appointed a public prosecutor is to
have passed the bar exam. The bar examination is taken following the graduation from a law faculty
and a completion of a two-year long internship. The bar examination is conducted in accordance with
a specially designed programme enacted by the Minister of Justice, which includes institutes and
questions of the various law branches necessary for the professional development of the law
graduates. The Law on Bar Examination (“Official Gazette of the SRM”, Nos. 26/80 and 07/88),
provides that the bar examination consists of a written and an oral part. The written part includes
questions about criminal and civil law, while the oral part includes questions about criminal law, civil
law, Constitutional order and Constitutional law, business and labour law. Pursuant to the law, bar
examination is taken before a Committee appointed by the Minister of Justice. The manner of taking
the bar examination, application for the examination, contents of the minutes and issuance of a
certificate for a passed examination have been regulated in detail in the Rulebook on the Manner of
Taking Bar Examination (“Official Gazette of the SRM”, No. 09/89). This examination, however, is
not a competitive examination for election of judges and prosecutors. It is only one of the conditions
for interested law graduates to apply at the competition. Further on, judges are elected by the
Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, upon the proposal of the Judicial Council.
In order to strengthen the independence of the judiciary in the Republic of Macedonia, improvement
of the system of appointment of judges has been envisaged. The improvements have been clearly
defined in the Judicial Reform Strategy (see I_Annex_02). Namely, it has been stipulated that the
election of judges be exempt from the competence of the Assembly, it being a political body, and be
transferred to the Judicial Council, that shall primarily consist of judges. Its members shall be
appointed from the judiciary itself, which shall be the essential guarantee for the judiciary’s
independence. Another important novelty shall be the introduction of initial training of candidates for
judges, to last between 12 and 15 months and to be performed by a School for judges. The entry in
the School shall be conditional on taking an entry examination. During the initial training, candidates
for judges shall receive adequate financial remuneration provided by the state. The introduction of

161/453

these changes shall also establish a merit-based system of career promotion, whereby the Judicial
Council shall decide on the appointment of a judge to a higher court, on the basis of clearly defined
objective criteria.
b)
Pursuant to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, one of the competences of the Judicial
Council is to evaluate judges’ expertise and ethics in performance of their office. This Constitutional
provision has been further elaborated in the Law on the Judicial Council of the Republic of
Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 80/92, 50/99 and 43/03). Namely,
the Council evaluates the judges’ expertise and ethics in case the information on the achievements,
number of decided cases, working quality and efficiency suggest lack of professionalism, expertise or
ethics. The assessment of professionalism and conscientiousness of judges while performing their
post may not only be raised by the Council, but also by the President of the relevant court, the
President of the higher court as well as by the General Session of the Supreme Court of the Republic
of Macedonia.
According to the current system of election of judges, there is no direct merit-based form of career
promotion. However, judges advance in career by way of being elected to a higher court. In these
cases, the Council evaluates a judge’s previous expertise and ethics in performance at the office, by
exploring the information supplied by the Ministry of Justice on the quality and efficiency in his/her
work, participation in training activities etc.
c)
The position, composition and competence of the Judicial Council have been set forth in the
Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. These Constitutional provisions have been further
elaborated in the Law on the Judicial Council of the Republic of Macedonia. The Judicial Council
consists of seven Members elected by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia from among the
prominent lawyers, to a six year term of office with a right to one re-election. Three of its Members
are elected by a majority vote of the total number of Members, within which there must be a majority
vote of the total number of Members in the Assembly belonging to the non-majority communities in
the Republic of Macedonia. From among its Members, the Council elects a President for a period of
three years, with no right to re-election.
The office of a Member of the Judicial Council terminates if he/she resigns. A Council Member shall
be dismissed if he/she is sentenced for a criminal offence to imprisonment without probation of at
least six months, or in case he/she permanently loses the ability to perform the duties, which is
determined by the Council on the basis of the finding and opinion by a competent medical committee.
Members of the Judicial Council are granted immunity, decided upon by the Assembly.
The office of a Member of the State Judicial Council is incompatible with performance of any other
public office, profession or membership in a political party.
The Judicial Council proposes to the Assembly election and dismissal of judges, decides on the
disciplinary liability of judges, evaluates their expertise and ethics in the performance of the office,
and proposes two judges to the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia.
The Judicial Council has its Service headed by a Secretary General. Number of expert associates
and other employees in the service, as well as their activities and tasks, have been set forth in the
Job Description and Classification Act.
Currently, the Council’s Service includes 9 employees. A plan for 2005 foresees provision of further
staff by employing 15 additional persons, three of whom shall be representatives of non-majority
communities in the Republic of Macedonia. Premises and funds available to the Council are sufficient
for the time being. Each of the Council Members and each advisor have his/her own office and a
computer. The Judicial Council has an electronic data base including all relevant data on the work
and training of judges. Furthermore, as part of the digitalisation of the judiciary, preparation of

162/453

software for the operation of the Judicial Council is in final stage. Next project in this sphere shall be
the IT networking of the Council, courts, the Ministry of Justice and the School for judges.

d)
In the Republic of Macedonia, there is no conventional inspection in the judiciary. Still, within the
judicial administration, in the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
36/95, 45/95 and 64/03), provisions of Articles 76 – 78, a competence has been stipulated of the
Ministry of Justice to conduct inspection over the application of the Court’s Rules of Procedure, i.e.
conduct supervision over the courts’ efficiency and their implementation of the Court’s Rules of
Procedure.
As part of the forthcoming reform in the judiciary, the establishment of a body that shall perform
inspection supervision over the operation of courts has been stipulated. Namely, the Reform Strategy
envisages that such body be composed of judges and that results from the conducted supervision
have no effect over the judge’s ruling in the actual case that has been supervised.

c)
Organisation of law graduates internships:
The issue of the apprenticeship of the law graduates is regulated by the Rulebook on the Mode for
Performance of the Apprenticeship of Graduated Lawyers in the Bodies of the Judiciary (“Official
Gazette of the SRM”, No. 09/89). Namely, it establishes the mode for performance of the
apprenticeship – graduated lawyers in the bodies of the judicial system. The establishment of the
mode for performance of apprenticeship has the purpose of empowering the apprentice to perform
activities and tasks to which they are assigned and to prepare them for the bar exam. Pursuant to
the Rulebook, the apprentices are alternately assigned to perform certain activities and tasks and in
the course of the apprenticeship are introduced to and have their skills developed to perform all
activities and tasks from within the scope of the justice system bodies. The Rulebook regulates in
detail the area to which the apprentices are assigned in the justice system bodies where they perform
the apprenticeship; the period is defined within which they acquire the practice in each of the services
within the body, as well as the mode for performance of the practice. For the individual
apprenticeship of each apprentice, a programme is prepared, which establishes the specific tasks,
which they need to perform, the employee responsible for their apprenticeship, as well as the records
maintained of the performed tasks. The provisions from the aforementioned Rulebook are also
related to both, volunteers and graduated lawyers, which are sent to practice in the bodies of the
judiciary from other bodies and organisations.
d)
School or institute for judges:
In the Republic of Macedonia there is no system of initial training for judges and public prosecutors.
However, there is a system of continuing education of the judges and the prosecutors, executed by
the Centre for Continuing Education (CCE). The CCE was established in March 1999 within the
Macedonian Judges Association, as a form of continuity from the Committee for Education, which
primarily focuses on continuing education and professional improvement of the judges, law clerks,
and the court administration.
The programme and the activities of the CCE are directed towards increased competence,
professionalism and ethical conduct of the judicial personnel, promotion and strengthening of the
judicial independence, public confidence and respect towards the judiciary.
A Board composed of nine members with voting rights manages CCE, out of which five are
representatives of the Macedonian Judges Association and the President of the Association is a
member by virtue of their position. The remaining three members are representatives of the Ministry
of Justice, of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia and of the Judicial Council of the
Republic. The executive manager of the CCE is present at the Board sessions and is authorised to
participate in its work, but has no right to vote. Also, a representative from the Foundation Open
Society Institute – Macedonia (FOSIM) and the Constitutional and Legal Policy Institute (COLPI), as
well as one representative of the American Bar Association – Central and Eastern European Law
Initiative (ABA/CEELI) which financially support this project, participate as Board members, without
the right to vote (About the role of the Centre for Continuing Education, its programme and
implemented trainings, for more details see I_D_18).
The system for election of judges and of public prosecutors is explained in I_D_3, where it is
indicated that, besides the other prerequisites, the candidates need to have passed the bar exam.
The bar exam can be passed after a completed two-year apprenticeship, after the graduation from
the Faculty of Law. The bar exam is taken according to a special curriculum adopted by the Minister
of Justice, which contains institutes and questions from certain legal branches, necessary for skills
development of the graduated lawyers. The Law on the Bar (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 26/80 and 7/88), establishes that the bar exam consists of a written and an oral
part. In the written part, Criminal and Civil law are subjects of examination, and in the oral part
Criminal Law, Constitutional Order and Constitutional Law, Commercial Law and Labour Law.
Pursuant to the Law, the bar exam is taken before a committee appointed by the Minister of Justice.

167/453

The mode for taking the bar exam, application for the exam, contents of the minutes and issuance of
a certificate for the passed bar exam are regulated in detail in the Rulebook on the Mode for Taking
the Bar Exam (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 09/89).
Introduction of a system of initial training of candidates for judges and public prosecutors is envisaged as
a priority in the Judicial Reform Strategy (see I_Annex_02), whereby the Centre for Continuing Education
will grow into a public institution – School for Education of Judges, Public Prosecutors and other
employees in the courts and the Public Prosecutor’s Office. The programmes for continuing education will
be established by a Board of the School for Education of Judges and Public Prosecutors, where
members will be representatives from the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia, the Public
Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia, the Ministry of Justice, the Judicial Council, the Council
of Public Prosecutors, Macedonian Judges Association and the Association of Public prosecutors, as well
as relevant higher education institutions.
The introduction of the initial training would raise the level of quality of the judges and public
prosecutors, having in mind the fact that they would undergo a planned and systematically structured
training before entering the position of a judge or a public prosecutor. Namely, the Strategy foresees
that upon a Job Advertisement for candidates for judges and public prosecutors, the candidates
should take an entrance exam to enrol in the School for Judges and Public Prosecutors. After the
completed initial training, they would take a final exam, and only then would be appointed as judges
and public prosecutors.
18. Training:
a) Is there an independent national training centre for the judiciary? What is its role? If there is
more than one, is the training harmonised?
b) Are specific training courses organised for judges in new areas such as company law,
cyber crime, financial crime etc., but also on ethics in justice as well as on human rights and
fundamental liberties? Is there any continued training for judges?
c) How many and what types of specialised judges and prosecutors are there?
d) Is there in-service training? Is it compulsory? Please describe the extent and how often it
occurs.
e) What percentage of judges, prosecutors and other staff in the judicial sector has received
further training over the last 5 years (compared with the profession as a whole)?
a)
Pursuant to Article 51 of the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
36/95, 45/95 and 64/02), judges have a right to and an obligation for continued professional training
in the course of their terms of office. The Law on the Court Budget (“Official Gazette of the Republic
of Macedonia”, No. 60/03), stipulates that at least 2% of the total funds allocated for the financing of
the judiciary shall necessarily be earmarked for professional training of judges, civil servants, court
police and other court employees.
The judges’ continued education is conducted by the Centre for Continuous Education (CCE)
established in May 1999 within the Judges Association of the Republic of Macedonia, as a follow-up
to the Education Committee, primarily focused on the continuous education and professional training
of judges, expert associates and court administration.
The CCE programme and activities have been focused towards enhancement of expertise,
professionalism and ethics of judges, promotion and enhancement of judges' independence, public
confidence and reputation of the judiciary.
CCE is managed by a Board of 9 Members with a right to vote, five of whom are representatives of
the Judges Association of the Republic of Macedonia. The Association’s President is an ex officio
Member of CCE. The other three Members include representatives of the Ministry of Justice, the
Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia and the Judicial Council of the Republic of Macedonia.
CCE Director attends Board’s sessions and is authorised to participate in its work, though with no
right to vote. In addition, representatives from the Foundation Open Society Institute Macedonia

168/453

(FOSIM), the Constitutional and Legal Policy Institute (COLPI) and the American Bar Association –
Central and Eastern Europe Legal Initiative (ABA/CEELI), that have provided financial support for the
project, attend Board’s sessions, with no right to vote.
The Board is responsible for establishing the CCE policy and approving its educational programme,
its financial plan and its budget. Similarly, it adopts its rules of procedure and submits reports on the
Centre’s activities to the Governing Board of the Judges Association of the Republic of Macedonia.
Lecturers at the seminars and counselling sessions organised by the Centre for Continuous
Education are domestic and foreign experts. Lecturers from the Republic of Macedonia include
judges of the Supreme Court and appellate courts. Foreign lecturers are primarily Council of Europe
experts.
In order to facilitate full integration in the international legal community and regular international
communication and cooperation, CCE has also organised foreign language courses. Within the
cooperation with the Peace Corps, volunteers have been teaching English language in a number of
courts throughout the country. The Foundation Open Society Institute Macedonia has provided
judges from the courts in Skopje with a possibility to attend the English language courses in its
educational centre. Furthermore, as part of the cooperation of the Judges Association of the Republic
of Macedonia and the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Macedonia with the Embassy of the
Republic of France and the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of France, French language courses
have also been organised.
In line with the strategic commitment of the Republic of Macedonia, particular emphasis within the
Centre’s educational programme has been attached to the computer training of judges, expert
associates and administrative personnel. For that purpose, the Centre has been organising computer
courses for judges, expert associates and administrative personnel in courts in the Republic of
Macedonia.
In order to enable free access to legal literature, texts of laws and latest legal publications, CCE and
JARM proceeded with furnishing the library that is at a disposal to all judges, expert associates and
other interested persons.
The Centre regularly distributes and submits all kinds of material, books and publications relevant for
the work of judges and courts.
The training of public prosecutors has been conducted through the Public Prosecutors Association.
Public prosecutors have also been included in a number of specially designed seminars organised by
the Centre for Continuous Education.
The issue of the training of judges and public prosecutors has been in detail elaborated in the Judicial
Reform Strategy (see I_Annex_02).
b)
In its training programmes, CCE has dedicated particular attention to the training in several fields,
such as are commercial law, cyber crime, financial crime, corruption, human rights etc. The enclosed
charts give a review of the seminars organised by the Centre for Continuous Education in the period
1999 – 2003, their topics and the number of judges, public prosecutors and other participants.

c)
Specialised departments are established in courts that comprise judges who decide in cases of the
same legal area. There is no formal system for specialisation of judges in a specific legal area.
However, as mentioned, in practice judges are specialised by their assignment to specific
departments.
Pursuant to the Court Rules of Procedure, every basic court includes a criminal and a civil
department. Within the criminal department, the following divisions are established: Criminal,
Investigative, Juvenile, Misdemeanour and Military. Within the civil department, the following
divisions are established: Civil, Enforcement, Trade, Labour, Non-Contentious, Inheritance etc. The
Supreme Court includes three departments: Criminal, Civil and Administrative.

174/453

Taking into consideration the fact that judges’ specialisation is conducted only in larger primary
courts, bellow is the data on the number of judges acting upon specific types of cases: In the Skopje I
Basic Court, out of the total number of 76 judges, 12 act upon criminal, 22 upon civil, 10 upon
business, 2 upon bankruptcy, 2 upon non-contentious, 1 upon registrations, 5 upon enforceable civil,
and 15 upon misdemeanour cases. In the Skopje II Basic Court, out of the total number of 75 judges,
20 act upon criminal cases and investigations, 22 upon civil, 7 upon business, 3 upon bankruptcy, 3
upon non-contentious, 4 upon execution civil and 16 upon misdemeanour cases. In the Basic Court
in Bitola, out of the total number of 30 judges, 4 act upon criminal cases, 2 upon investigations, 10
upon civil, 2 upon business, 2 upon bankruptcy, 2 upon non-contentious, 2 upon registrations, 2 upon
enforceable civil and 3 upon misdemeanour cases.
In courts of appeals, 27 judges act upon criminal and misdemeanour cases and 52 upon civil and
commercial cases.
In the Supreme Court of the Republic, there are three departments, namely: Criminal, Civil and
Administrative.
Certain specialisation for public prosecutors is envisaged in the Law on Public Prosecutor’s Office of
the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04), according to
which a Unit for Prosecution of Perpetrators of Crimes in the Field of Organised Crime and
Corruption is established.
d)
Besides the training for judges and prosecutors elaborated in the above segments a) and b) there
have been computer courses organised in courts and public prosecution offices. In the beginning of
the implementation of the 2001 Integrated Judicial Information System Project, the Ministry of Justice
organised basic computer training for employees in the judicial institutions. The group of employees
that use hardware equipment in courts includes 2100 persons (judges, expert associates, typists and
administration), in public prosecution offices 300 employees (prosecutors, deputy prosecutors, expert
associates, typists and administration), in the Judicial Council 20 employees (Members of the Judicial
Council, advisors and administration) and in the Penitentiaries 200 employees (managers and
administration). By September 2004, basic computer training was organised for the aforementioned
employees (for 1500 employees in courts, 180 employees in public prosecution offices, 20
employees in the Judicial Council and for 30 employees in the penitentiaries). Funds for the training
has been provided from the Ministry of Justice’ budget and the PHARE 2000 programme. In the
course of 2005, computer training is envisaged within the CARDS 2003 Programme for the other part
of the employees in these institutions.
e)
In 1999, a total of 19 training activities were organised by the Centre for Continuous Education over
24 working days, attended by 578 participants.
In 2000, CCE organised a total of 21 training activities over 39 working days and with 851
participants.
In 2001, CCE organised 14 training activities over 28 working days and with 609 participants
(including 421 judges and 74 expert associates).
In 2002, CCE organised 21 training activities over 52 working days and with 666 participants.
In 2003, CCE organised 27 training activities over 58 working days. They were attended by 480
judges, 28 expert associates, 82 public prosecutors and 107 guests.

175/453

19. Clerical staff:
a) Give the number of clerical staff. How does this compare with the number of judges and
prosecutors?
b) Do they have concrete job descriptions?
c) Do they receive particular initial and vocational training (on case management, IT, relations
with the public etc.)? Which institution is in charge of offering this training?
d) Which equipment (computers, e-mail, fax etc.) do clerical staffs have at their disposal to
perform their functions?
e) Are archives well managed and computerised? Is there sufficient and direct access to legal
databases?
a)
The total number of employed clerks in courts and public prosecution offices is 2301. Out of this
number, 2127 are employed in the courts, while 174 work in the public prosecution offices.
The number of judges in the Republic of Macedonia is 632, whereas the number of public
prosecutors and deputy public prosecutors is 122, which makes a total of 754 holders of judicial
office (court and prosecution).
These figures imply that there are around 3 clerks per every holder of judicial office.
b)
Pursuant to the legal regulations in the Republic of Macedonia, court clerks are civil servants and
their status, rights, obligations and responsibilities, salaries and remunerations have been set forth in
the Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00, 112/00,
34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04 and 69/04). Depending on their tasks, they
have been divided into groups (senior civil servants, expert civil servants and expert administrative
civil servants). Description of jobs and their harmonisation with the groups and positions as set forth
in the Law on Civil Servants has been stipulated in the Decree of the Government of the Republic of
Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 93/00). On the basis of the Law on
Civil Servants and the Decree, each court has enacted a Job Description and Organisation Rulebook
including an accurate description of jobs and working tasks of every civil servant.
On the basis of the constitutional separation of powers in the Republic of Macedonia into legislative,
executive and judicial, and with the purpose of implementing the judicial independence in this
segment, too, the Judicial Reform Strategy stipulates that court clerks (independent court advisors,
court advisors, expert associates, court interns, junior court officers, administrative, technical and
other court personnel) be exempt from the Law on Civil Servants. A Law on Court Service is
envisaged to be adopted, on the basis of which court clerks shall exercise their employment rights.
c)
In the course of 2004, basic computer training was organised for the employees in courts, thus
improving their skills and providing for efficient use of the court information system software, which
entails successful management of cases in court procedure.
The initial computer training was conducted in the course of 2001 and 2002, when over 300
employees in all courts in the Republic of Macedonia were introduced to the basic computer skills.
Over the past two years, intense computer training was also conducted for employees in the basic
courts by their IT personnel.
No competent institution has been formally or legally appointed for the implementation of training.
However, the Steering Committee set up under the project and comprised of representatives of all
judicial institutions, which monitors and evaluates implementation of projects, necessarily provides
computer training for court employees (this was conducted under PHARE 2000 and CARDS 2003
Programmes).

176/453

d)
The court personnel have at their disposal computer equipment that satisfies the needs for
performing their duties (PCs with Microsoft Office packages, local and network printers, servers,
switches, local area network). However, due to insufficient capacity of premises in some of the
courts, full installation of additional equipment has not been possible so far.
The Project Team of the Ministry of Justice has analysed the overall state in all courts in terms of
premises and staff. Within the implementation of the IT Projects in the period 2002 - 2004, 1209 PCs
were installed, as well as 535 local printers, 102 network printers and 57 servers. In that way, around
60% of the total needs of the judiciary were satisfied. With an optimal distribution of the equipment,
though, over 90% coverage of the judicial functions has been achieved. In addition, the Project Team
has foreseen the future needs in terms of finalisation of the installation of the necessary computer
equipment in courts. Expectations are that the optimum implementation of the CARDS 2003 Project,
which envisages procurement of additional hardware, will ensure successful finalisation of the
process of installation and use of hardware in courts. With regards to the fax equipment in courts, all
courts in the Republic of Macedonia have at their disposal sufficient quantities of fax units and
separate fax numbers.
Concerning e-mail services and their use by court employees, for the moment this kind of
communication has not been enabled in the courts. Two of the basic courts in the Republic of
Macedonia (Štip and Struga) have designed their Web pages, though these are not being updated
regularly.
All courts in the Republic of Macedonia have at their disposal a local computer network, with a
sufficient number of switches (a total of 55). Electronic communication has been enabled among
employees of courts situated in the same building (intranet). It is expected that once the CARDS
2003 Project is fully implemented, full electronic communication will be established.
e)
As to the court archives, so far they have not been computerised. However, all prerequisites have
been put in place for this to be carried out in the future. Namely, by the installation of the hardware
(the process shall be completed in the course of 2005) and by the already installed software in all
courts, as well as by completion of the IT training for all court employees and the implementation of
the CARDS 2003 Project for establishment of legal databases, computer legal databases will be
established, and managed by courts IT staff.
Furthermore, in the misdemeanour units within all 27 basic courts in the Republic of Macedonia, as
part of the PHARE 1999 Programme, application software has been installed for the operation of
these court units. An optimum quantity of hardware has been installed in the aforementioned units,
and complete training of their employees has been conducted. Namely, over 200 employees have
passed the basic computer, as well as the application software training. The application software is in
Macedonian and contains over 300 entering forms, which enables its optimum and efficient use. The
application is supported by a Windows SQL7; SQL2000 database and allows for electronic
management of cases, their electronic archiving and automatic database creation.
In all courts in the Republic of Macedonia (the Supreme Court, 3 appellate courts and 27 basic
courts) application software for court procedures has been installed. The application has been
installed on 1500 PCs.
The Ministry of Justice has implemented this part of the project in two stages. The first stage included
3 pilot courts, with over 500 employees (Skopje I Basic Court, Skopje Appellate Court and the
Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia). Besides the basic computer training, application
software training has also been conducted in these courts, thus enabling the operation of the system
in practice.
The application software is in Macedonian and contains over 600 windows which enables its
optimum and efficient use. Application is supported by a Windows SQL7; SQL2000 database and

177/453

allows for electronic management of cases, their electronic filing and automatic database creation.
Electronic management of cases has only been conducted in these three pilot courts. It should be
mentioned that training has been conducted for the court procedure software application in 26 basic
and 2 appellate courts for over 1650 employees.
As far as the data filing (back-up) is concerned, in the three pilot courts it has been performed at
three levels - firstly, saving of data on the PC hard disc; secondly, after the end of the court’s working
hours, archiving at the back-up server; finally, all data of the working week are preserved on the
DAT-track which is then deposited in the court’s safe-deposit box.
At the moment (January 2005), every court has its own database which is being built up through the
process of court application software training for all court employees and it is expected to be
integrated in a single – central database in the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia. Within
the installed software application, all PC users in courts are connected by a LAN connection, which
enables access to databases by using CDs or floppy discs. After the full implementation of the
CARDS 2003 Project, optical connection of courts will be established i.e. installation of VAN
connection (IPVPN lines) that is expected to be carried out in the course of 2005. The
aforementioned actions are expected to result in sufficient and direct access to judicial databases,
making them available to all interested parties.
The Project Team implementing the activities has prepared a Project for Legal Database IT security.
20. Accountability and discipline:
a) Is there a code of ethics for members of the judiciary? If so, by whom has it been set up?
What is its legal status? How is it being implemented?
b) Are judges irremovable from the start of their career? How is such irremovability
implemented and respected?
c) What is the procedure for lifting the immunity of a judge? What is done to ensure that this
is clear and transparent? Give examples of how this has been implemented?
d) What is the salary scale for judges and prosecutors? How does this compare with other
professions with similar responsibilities in your country (attorneys, lawyers in private
enterprises…) and to the average income?
a)
The Judges Association of the Republic of Macedonia has adopted a Code of Ethics that comprises
the most important principles that the judges should be guided by when performing their duties. The
Code defines its goals and purposes and the principles of judges’ ethics, as well as the issues of
independence, protection of court's reputation, judge’s personality, attitude towards parties,
obligations when judging in a case, professional training, immunity and privileges, restrictions related
to the performance of the judicial duty, implementation of the principles and liability for their violation.
With regard to the implementation of the Code, it has been stipulated that a fair and ethical obligation
of a judge is to apply, develop and enhance by personal example the Code’s principles and to guide
the others to their respect and application. Furthermore, an ethical liability has been stipulated for
violation of the Code’s principles.
b)
Pursuant to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), and the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of
the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/02), judges are elected to an unrestricted term
of office.
Namely, Article 99 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia provides for an unrestricted term
of office of judges. Pursuant to Articles 38 and 39 of the Law on Courts, judges are elected and
dismissed by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, upon a proposal by the Judicial Council of
the Republic of Macedonia.

178/453

Notwithstanding the unrestricted term of office and the immunity, a judge may be dismissed under
conditions and in a manner prescribed by law.
On the procedure for dismissal of judges, for more details see I_D_3.
c)
Pursuant to Article 100 of the Constitution, judges enjoy immunity. The immunity of judges is decided
upon by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia. A judge or a lay judge may not be taken
accountable for an opinion or a decision in court rulings. A judge may not be detained without
consent by the Assembly, unless caught while perpetrating a criminal offence for which imprisonment
is prescribed of at least five years. The procedure of deciding upon judges’ immunity is urgent and is
conducted following a prior opinion by the Judicial Council.
d)
The average salary of a judge in a basic court is 426 EUR (net amount), i.e. 738 EUR (gross
amount). Salary of a judge in an appellate court is 527 EUR (net amount), i.e. 850 EUR (gross
amount), whereas salary of a judge in the Supreme Court is 595 EUR (net amount) i.e. 1032 EUR
(gross amount). Salaries of public prosecutors correspond to the salaries of judges at the same level.
The ratio between judges and public prosecutors’ salaries and salaries in other jobs is the following:
the average salary in the Republic of Macedonia in 2003 was 190 EUR (net amount), while the
average salary in the public administration and defence for 2004 was 373 EUR (gross amount), in the
education 316 EUR (gross amount) and in the health care sector 324 EUR (gross amount).
21. Mobility of judges:
a) What procedure governs the allocation of judges to particular courts and regions?
b) Can judges be required to move between courts and regions?
a)
Transfer of judges to work in other courts and regions has been regulated in the Law on Courts
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/03). Pursuant to Article 37
of the Law, a judge performs judge’s duties in the court to which appointed. Against his/her will, a
judge may not be transferred neither from one court to another, nor from one court department to
another. The allocation of judges is conducted by way of an annual schedule for the operation of the
court. A judge may request to be reassigned from one court department to another.
b)
The reassignment to another court may only be temporary (six months at most) and refers only to the
judges of basic courts and of appellate courts. Upon their consent, these judges may temporarily be
transferred to judge in another court of the same instance or in a lower ranking court or from one
court department to another, on the basis of clearly determined reasons. Namely, reasons for such
transfer may be if the regular court's functioning would be effected, due to inability or derogation of a
judge, increased extent of work, or due to complexity of cases.
A transfer of a judge from one court to another is exercised by the President of the higher ranking
court. A reassignment from one department of a court to another is exercised by the President of the
court.
As an exception, by a decision of the President of the Court, a judge may be transferred to another
court department against his/her will, only if this is necessary due to the scope and the subject matter
of the court’s operation.
The Law also stipulates a provision under which a judge may request transfer from one court
department to another. Against a decision for assignment to another court department or a decision
rejecting the request for assignment to another court department, a judge may submit an appeal to
the President of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia, who is obligated to decide on it
within 7 days.

179/453

22. Equipment:
a) Is case administration in the courts computerised? Are systems and software compatible
across the country?
(The need to manage the computerisation on the national level calls for a central capacity to
define needs, implement computerisation, including procurement of software and hardware,
as well as to advise and help computerised courts.)
b) Is there a Supreme Court database with case law accessible to courts, legal and judicial
professions?
c) Are databases of other law enforcement agencies accessible by courts?
а)
The current situation in courts in the Republic of Macedonia has been assessed as partially
computerised. Out of the total number of 2.127 employees in courts, 1.209 use personal computers
with installed court system application software. In the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia,
the Skopje Appellate Court and the Skopje I Basic Court, full IT training has been conducted for all
employees, including both the basic computer as well as application software training. Currently, due
to the still ongoing application software training in the remaining 26 basic and 2 appellate courts for
their 1662 employees, the case management has still not been computerised. Computerisation is
envisaged to be introduced following the completion of training for the use of the application software
and the additional installation of the necessary hardware, as well as after the enactment of the
Rulebook on the Electronic Management of Court Rules of Procedure by the Minister of Justice.
As regards the compatibility of the equipment and software around the country, the equipment in all
courts is compatible both in terms of its contemporary brand name (HP–Compaq and Siemens) and
in terms of its configuration (Pentium 3). The already installed software application (on a Microsoft
platform) proved optimally compatible with the equipment.
Regarding the project for computerisation of the judiciary, a study is now being prepared for the
establishment of an Information Technology Centre within the Supreme Court of the Republic of
Macedonia, which shall define the organisational, personnel and technical capacities for the legal
database management.
b)
Currently, the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia has at its disposal a case law database
(in paper) in a form of periodical collections of case law.
The Project Team, in cooperation with foreign consultants, has already prepared a project by which,
in addition to the cases processed to the Supreme Court that have been published as case law, court
cases will be selected from all courts in the Republic of Macedonia through an electronic legal
database and will be delivered to the IT Centre within the Supreme Court of the Republic of
Macedonia. The equipment for electronic case law management has already been installed in the
Supreme Court and once the optical link has been installed and the Legal Database Project (CARDS
2003) implemented, an optimum technical level will be achieved that will allow access to case law
data by court employees and other legal professions.
c)
In all courts of the Republic of Macedonia Local Area Network is currently used on each court’s level,
and a possibility is allowed for the use of Intranet. However, courts have no access to databases of
other law enforcement bodies.
It should be noted that by the completion of the stage of implementation of the Integrated Judicial IT
System and implementation of CARDS 2003 Project, by the establishment of legal database, by
providing optical link between courts and other judicial institutions and by the installation of the
already prepared application software for the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the Judicial Council and the
Penitentiary administration, sufficient pre-conditions would be put in place for judicial institutions’

180/453

access to databases of other law enforcement institutions, as well as to that of the Official Gazette of
the Republic of Macedonia.
23. General working conditions:
a) Do judges and prosecutors have sufficient and separate offices, do they have computers,
printers, fax machines, secretaries, law clerks?
b) Do judges and prosecutors have access to the archives and legal databases?
a)
The organisational structure of the judiciary in the Republic of Macedonia consists of 31 courts (27
basic courts, 3 appellate courts and the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia) and the public
prosecution offices (22 basic public prosecutor’s offices, 3 higher public prosecutor’s offices and the
Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia). The working conditions are specified
below.
The premises of the basic public prosecutor’s offices are situated in the 22 buildings of basic courts.
In Kavadarci and Strumica, premises of the basic courts and the public prosecutor’s offices are
separate and due to the considerable financial investment over the past period, the working
conditions of judges and prosecutors have been improved.
In number of cities where organisational structure of basic courts exists (Kruševo, Negotino, Vinica
and Kratovo), there are no present basic public prosecutor’s offices and in that sense, judges in
these courts work in fairly good conditions.
Generally speaking, the Ministry of Justice has, over the recent period and through its own budget,
by way of implementation of capital investment projects, resolved the problems of the general
working conditions in the Basic Courts in Bitola, Prilep, Struga, Kriva Palanka, Debar. The acute
difficulties, however, remain due to the insufficient number of trial chambers in the Basic Courts in
Veles, Gevgelija and Kumanovo.
It has been estimated that the optimisation of the premises within the buildings hosting the Basic
Courts and the Basic Public Prosecutor's Offices in Tetovo, Gostivar, Kičevo, Ohrid, Resen, Štip,
Sveti Nikole, Kočani, Berovo, Delčevo and Radoviš, has provided the judges and the prosecutors
with good basis for realisation of their working activities. In that sense, the Ministry of Justice and the
Judicial Budget have pursued a consistent investment policy aimed at the general improvement of
working conditions.
The dispersion of the largest court in the country – Skopje I Basic Court, in three different buildings in
Skopje has been pointed out as an acute problem. The envisaged structure shall enable the principle
of a separate office for every judge – a principle that has already been implemented in the Supreme
Court of the Republic of Macedonia, in the appellate courts in Skopje, Stip and Bitola, in the Skopje II
Basic Court, as well as in the basic courts in Tetovo, Gostivar, Kičevo, Struga, Ohrid, Resen, Bitola,
Prilep, Kruševo, Kavadarci, Negotino, Sveti Nikole, Štip, Kočani, Vinica, Berovo, Delčevo, Strumica,
Gevgelija, Kratovo and Kriva Palanka.
The Ministry of Justice has over the past four years carried out a number of projects aimed at the
improvement of the working conditions for judges and prosecutors. In the period 2001-2003, over 2
million EUR were invested for all courts in the Republic of Macedonia (new building of the Supreme
Court was put in operation, superstructure and extension was carried out in the buildings of the Basic
Courts in Prilep, Struga, Kriva Palanka, Debar and Bitola). All courts were provided with new
electrical installation, central heating and new furniture. In the course of 2003, over 20 digital
switchboards and over 20 digital copiers were procured for a number of courts. In 2004 in
accordance with the new Law on Public Prosecutor’s Office (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 38/04), the Government enacted the Programme on Public Investment in Public
Prosecution Offices under which, over the next several years, digital switchboards, digital copiers and
laser fax units will be supplied for all public prosecution offices in the Republic of Macedonia.

181/453

As regards the insufficient number of clerks in courts and in public prosecution offices, it has been
pointed out that their number needs to increase and their status within institutions needs to improve
as part of the comprehensive judicial reform.
b)
On the availability of the legal data base, for more details see I_D_22.
24. How is co-operation between actors (judges, prosecutors, investigators, clerks, judicial
police etc.) in the criminal justice system ensured to facilitate the functioning of the system?
a) Do the different actors have clear roles and responsibilities? How is it ensured that an
overlap of responsibilities is avoided? How is efficient communication between the different
actors ensured?
b) Are court procedures supervised by a higher ranking court? Please describe the current
appeal procedures.
a)
The role and responsibilities of all parties involved in criminal cases have been clearly defined both in
the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02 and 74/04), and other relevant laws.
Namely, the competences of courts and public prosecution offices have been delimited by the
Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/03), and the Law on the Public Prosecutor's Office (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04). Judicial power is exercised by courts which are
autonomous and independent state bodies. The Public Prosecutor’s Office is a single and
autonomous state body that prosecutes the perpetrators of criminal and other punishable acts. Types
of courts, their competence, establishment, abrogation, organisation and composition have been
regulated by the Law on Courts, while the establishment, organisation, competence, territory of
jurisdiction and main public prosecution offices have been regulated by the Law on the Public
Prosecutor’s Office.
Furthermore, pursuant to Article 9 of the Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office, in matters of
importance for performing their functions and matters of general interest, public prosecutors
cooperate with the bodies detecting criminal and other offences and their perpetrators, as well as
with courts and other bodies and legal entities.
Pursuant to Article 21 of the Law, the Public Prosecutor’s Office, in order to carry out the prosecution,
in co-operation with the investigative and other competent bodies and legal entities, ensures that the
measures and actions are taken to detect criminal and other punishable acts and their perpetrators.
A public prosecutor guides the work of the authorised officials in the Ministry of the Interior and in
other competent state bodies in order to take the necessary measures for detecting a perpetrator of a
criminal offence, for ensuring that a perpetrator or an accomplice does not hide or flee, and for
detecting and providing traces of a criminal act and objects that may serve as evidence. He/she may
request that the Ministry of the Interior and other competent bodies or legal persons collect all
information and take other measures to detect criminal or other punishable acts and their
perpetrators. A public prosecutor may ask from the Ministry of the Interior that documents and other
items of evidence found when detecting the criminal or other punishable acts and their perpetrators
be made available to him/her for inspection. A public prosecutor may request from the state bodies,
the bodies of the local self-government units, as well as from the organisations with public mandates,
that they submit documents, papers, cases or announcements that may be necessary for his/her
carrying out the actions within his/her competence. Similarly, he/she may request information from
other legal entities and individuals for whom there are reasonable doubts that they possess such
data or information, and may also consult or take an opinion by experts in the respective field, which
may be necessary to him/her in order to make a decision.

182/453

Competences of courts have been specifically determined in the Law on Courts (Articles 30 – 35).
Within their determined competences, appellate courts decide upon conflicts of competence between
basic courts that fall under their jurisdiction. On the other hand, the Supreme Court of the Republic of
Macedonia decides on conflicts of competence between basic courts falling under the jurisdiction of
different appellate courts, on conflicts of competence between appellate courts and basic courts and
such conflicts between different appellate courts, as well as on handing over the territorial jurisdiction
from one court to another. Besides being regulated by these provisions, courts’ competences have
also been stipulated by procedural laws.
Pursuant to Articles 18 and 19 of the Law on Courts, courts are obligated to provide mutual legal
assistance. On the request by a court in performing its competence, state bodies and other legal
persons are obligated to submit without any delay all necessary information, papers or documents
that are available to them and which are needed in the procedure.
The role of the Court Police has been regulated in Article 103 of the Laws on Courts. The Court
Police provides security of facilities, property, persons and keeps order in courts.
b)
The right to appeal has been guaranteed in the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. Pursuant
to Article 15 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, a right to appeal is guaranteed against
individual legal acts issued in proceedings before a court, an administrative body or organisation or
other institutions with public competences. The two-instance principle is one of the basic principles of
all court proceedings.
Pursuant to Articles 350 and 351 of the Law on Criminal Procedure, against a first instance decision,
parties, defence attorney, legal representative of the defendant and the injured party may submit
appeal within 15 days from the day of the delivery of the judgment. On behalf of the defendant,
appeal may be submitted by his/her marital, i.e. extramarital partner, his/her first degree blood
relative, his/her adoptive parent, his/her adopted child, his/her brother, sister and custodian.
The Law on Criminal Procedure stipulates the following 4 grounds to appeal a first instance
judgment: 1) substantive violation of the procedure; 2) violation of the Criminal Code; 3) incorrectly or
incompletely determined factual situation; and 4) a decision on criminal sanctions, deprivation of
material gain, criminal procedure expenses, property and legal requests or a decision to announce
the verdict in the press, radio or television. Most important essential violations of the criminal
procedure rules include: violation of rules on the court composition, violation of rules of compulsory
presence at the main hearing, exclusion of the public from the main hearing in violation of the Law,
exceeding of the indictment, violation of the prohibition to found the judgment on evidence collected
in an illicit manner and by a violation of freedoms and rights as determined by the Constitution, laws
and ratified international treaties, violation of the right to an interpreter in the proceedings etc.
The second instance court decides on the appeal at a session of the Chamber or on the basis of a
conducted hearing (Article 363). Notified of the session of the Chamber shall be the defendant and
his/her attorney, the injured party as a plaintiff who, within the time limit prescribed for appeals or
answers to appeals, have requested to be notified of the session or have proposed that hearing be
held before the second instance court. The Chairperson of the Chamber may decide that parties be
notified of the session even when they have not requested it, in case their presence would contribute
for the matters to be clarified.
If the defendant has been detained or is serving a sentence and has an attorney, his/her presence
would be provided only if the Chairperson of the Chamber or the Chamber finds it worthwhile.
The public may be excluded from a session of the Chamber attended by the parties due to the same
reasons prescribed for exclusion of the public from a first instance court. (Article 362)
Pursuant to Articles 364 and 365 of the Law on Criminal Procedure, a hearing before the second
instance court shall be conducted only if, due to an incorrectly or incompletely determined factual

183/453

situation, this is necessary in order to present new evidence or repeat the previously presented
evidence or in case justified reasons exist to not return the case to the first instance court for a
renewed main hearing. Summoned to the hearing before the second instance court, shall be the
defendant and his/her attorney, the prosecutor, the injured party, his/her legal representatives and
agents, as well as witnesses and experts that the Court decides to be examined. If the defendant has
been detained, the Chairperson of the Chamber of the second instance court shall undertake all
necessary measures to bring him/her to the hearing. At the hearing, parties may present new
evidence and facts.
The second instance court reviews the judgment in the part that has been challenged by the appeal,
however it must ex officio always examine: whether there has been any violation of the criminal
procedure provisions on the court’s composition and competence; whether there has been any
violation of the rules prohibiting use of illegally obtained evidence; whether the indictment has been
exceeded; whether the pronouncement of the verdict has been contradictory, incomprehensible or
whether there have been no reasons for the judgment or those reasons have been incomprehensible
or contradictory; or whether the main hearing, contrary to the provisions of this Law, has been held in
absence of the defendant, or in case of a mandatory defence, in absence of the defendant’s
attorney. The second instance court must ex officio examine whether the Criminal Code has been
violated to the detriment of the defendant. (Article 367)
If an appeal has been submitted only on behalf of the defendant, the verdict may not be changed to
his/her detriment in reference to the legal assessment of the deed and the criminal sanction (Article
369).
If, in reference to the appeal, the second instance court finds that reasons due to which it has
decided in favour of the defendant are also beneficial to any of the co-defendants who have not
submitted an appeal or whose appeal had not been in that direction, it shall ex officio act as if such
an appeal had existed. (Article 371)
The second instance court, may upon an appeal decide as follows: reject the appeal as untimely or
not allowed; reject the appeal as unfounded and confirm the judgment of the first instance court
(when it determines that there are no reasons to challenge the judgment and that there have been no
violation of the law); endorse the appeal, cancel the first instance judgment and return the case to a
renewed trial (in case it determines that there has been essential violation of the criminal procedure,
or in case it considers that, due to an incorrectly or incompletely determined factual situation, a
renewed main hearing has to be ordered before the first instance court); or endorse the appeal and
alter the first instance judgment if it determines that the decisive facts have been correctly
determined and that in view of the determined factual situation and by an appropriate application of
law, a different judgment has to be brought. If in a renewed trial on the same case the second
instance court finds that the factual situation has been incorrectly or incompletely determined, it shall
hold a hearing and bring judgment. (Articles 372-380)
The Law on Criminal Procedure (Article 381) also allows for a right to appeal the judgment of the
second instance court only in a limited number of cases, namely:
− If the second instance court has pronounced a sentence to life imprisonment or has confirmed
the first instance verdict by which such a sentence had been pronounced;
− If the second instance court has, on the basis of a conducted hearing, determined different
factual situation than the first instance court and has, on the basis of the so determined
factual situation, founded its decision;
− If the second instance court has altered the first instance judgment by which the defendant
had been released from the charges and has pronounced a judgment by which the defendant
has been found guilty;
Upon an appeal against a second instance judgment, a court decides in third instance at a session of
the Chamber, pursuant to the provisions that apply to the second instance procedure. The sole
exception is that there may be no hearing before the third instance court.

E. ANTI-CORRUPTION MEASURES
1. Please provide succinct information on legislation or other rules governing this area, and
adhesion to relevant international conventions (e.g. the Council of Europe Civil and Criminal
Law Conventions on Corruption, the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search,
Seizure and Confiscation of proceeds from crime and the OECD Conventions on Combating
Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions and on Bribery in
International Business Transactions)
The following laws regulate the area of prevention and supression of corruption:
The Law on Prevention of Corruption (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
28/02,46/04 and 83/04-consolidated text ) forsees preventive and protective mechanisms for
prevention of corruption defined as abuse of official position, public authorisations, official duty or
position for acquisition of personal gain, or gain for any other person.
The Law on Prevention of Money Laundering and Other Proceeds from Crime (”Official Gazette
of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 46/04), is an important factor in the prevention of money
laundering and other forms of crime. It provides a legal basis for more efficient system of preventive
measures and actions against money laundering. At the same time, the Law is in compliance with the
United Nations Convention against Trans-national Organised Crime, European Union Directive on
Prevention of the Use of Financial System for the Purpose of Money Laundering 91/308/EEC and the
European Union Directive 2001/97/EEC amending the previous one, and the FATF Forty
Recommendations on Prevention of Money Laundering and the FATF Eight Special
Recommendations Against Financing of Terrorism).
The Criminal Code of the Republic of Macedonia (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
Nos.37/96, 80/99, 4/02, 43/03 and 19/04) stipulates efficient measures for prevention of corruption and
enhancement of the penal repression, defining at the same time efficient instruments for combating crime.
The Criminal Code forsees criminal liability for legal entities as a precondition for successful fight against
organised crime and corruption. The legal institute of confiscation of property or proceeds from criminal
offences has also been stipulated.
The Law on Criminal Procedure (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02
and 74/04) has been brought into line with the commitment to create legal basis for combating organised
crime and corruption. In that manner, harmonisation of the domestic legislation with that of the European
Union and with the provisions of the ratified international documents was ensured. Namely, with the
amendments to this Law, an implementation of special investigative measures has been introduced in the
legal system of the Republic of Macedonia. Furthermore, measures to secure defendant’s presence in
the proceedings have been enhanced; protection has been ensured for witnesses, collaborators of justice
and victims; a procedure has been prescribed to determine liability of legal entities as well as a procedure
of confiscation of property and proceeds.
The Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia (”Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04) regulates the procedure for efficient detection and prosecution of
perpetrators of criminal acts related to organised crime and corruption.
The Republic of Macedonia has undertaken a number of activities on international level, by ratifying
numerous international documents in the area of prevention and fight against corruption and their
implementation in the domestic legislation.
The Republic of Macedonia has ratified the following international anti- corruption conventions:

15.09.2004 (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 41/04);
2. What anti-corruption laws exist? How and by which bodies are they implemented?
a) Lex specialis is the Law on Prevention of Corruption (”Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 28/02, 46/04 and 83/04 - consolidated text). This law introduces efficient measures
for prevention of corruption. More precisely, the law defines the measures and the activities for
prevention of corruption in exercing power, public authority, official duty and in politics; the measures
and activities for prevention of conflict of interests; prevention of corruption while performing maters of
public interest as well as prevention of corruption in the private sector. The penalties for acts of
corruption remain in the sphere of the penal laws.
b) Penal laws that prohibit corruption and related acts and regulate the procedure:
The Criminal Code of the Republic of Macedonia (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
Nos. 37/96, 80/99, 4/02, 43/03, and 19/04), in Chapter XXX includes the perpetration of criminal
offences that are committed in exercising of duty and public authority which primarily violate the public
authorisations as well as some other goods, rights or property. Corruption is incriminated in the
following criminal offences: Receiving a bribe (article 357); Giving a bribe (article 358); Unlawful
intermediation (article 359); Abuse of official position and public authority (article 353);
Unconscientious performance of duties (article 353-v); Concealing the resources of disproportional
acquired property (article 359-a); Abuse of public, business or military secret (article 360-a).
In addition, the criminal code contains articles which define the acts of giving a bribe during elections
and voting (article 162), and unauthorised reception of gifts (article 253) as special criminal offences.

186/453

The act of money laundering and other proceeds from crime (article 273) is incriminated as a specific
criminal offence . The new definition of this offence contains elements which are in compliance with
the European Union Directive on Prevention of the Use of the Financial System for the Purpose of
Money Laundering (91/308/EEC and 2001/97-EEC amending the previous one), as well as with the
following ratified conventions: The Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and
Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.58/99);
the United Nations Convention against Trans-national Organised Crime with its Protocols (the
Palermo Convention) (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.70/04).
The Law on Criminal Procedure (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02
and 74/04) establishes specific provisions for the use of special investigative measures (articles 142b, 142-v, 142-d and 142-e), which are in accordance with the European standards for the use of
adequate investigative measures necessary in discovering organised crime, corruption, money
laundering, and other forms of serious crime offences.
The new provisions (articles No. 202, 203-a, 203-b, 203-g, and 207) in Chapter XVIII - Investigative
Actionss- of the Law on Criminal Procedure stipulate the procedure for applying the measure of
temporary securing of property or resources that are related with criminal offence. The measure in
question can be applied as temporary freezing, seizure and confiscation of funds.
These new legal instruments are harmonised with the following ratified conventions regulating this
area: The Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the
Proceeds from Crime (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 58/99); the United Nations
Convention (the Palermo Convention) against Trans-national Organised Crime with the Protocols
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.70/04) and the United Nations Convention
Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and Precursors (the Vienna
Convention) (“Official Gazette of the SFRY”, No.14/90)
The Draft Law on Interception of Communications which implements the Amendment XIX of the
Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos
52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) in relation to Article 17 is in parliamentary procedure. The
amendment in question relates to the legalisation of the interception of communications, under certain
conditions and procedure stipulated by law, if this is necessary for the prevention or revelation of
criminal offences, for the course of a criminal procedure or if it is required by the interests of security
and defence of the Republic.
The Law on Protection of Witnesses which will provide protection to witnesses that reveal
information and are witnesses of acts of corruption and organised crime is also in parliamentary
procedure.
c) Other laws containing provisions for prevention or suppression of corruption:
The Law on Prevention of Money Laundering and Other Proceeds from Crime (”Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.46/04) provides and establishes an efficient system
for organisation and control of the state bodies responsible to carry out measures and actions for
discovering and prevention of money laundering and other proceeds from crime. It also regulates
the competencies and authorisations of the bodies authorised for conducting an investigation.
The Law on Financing of Political Parties (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
76/04) creates prerequisites for greater transparency, public responsibility, and accountability of
the political parties. This law provides larger prerogatives for the responsible agencies to inspect
and control the financing of the political parties.
The new Law on Public Procurement (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 19/04),
establishes precise mechanisms and procedures for procurement of public goods, which outrule
discretionary practices in the decision making, and provide transparency in the procedure. In addition,
according to the provisions of the Law, a Public Procurement Bureau has been established.

187/453

The Law on State Audit (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 65/97, 70/01, 31/03,
19/04 and 73/04 – consolidated text) strengthens the existing control mechanisms of state auditing.
Besides this, the provisions of this law also stipulate that the Annual Report on Conducted Audits
should include data on all material cases of corruption, of which the State Commission for Prevention
of Corruption was notified (Article 11).
In accordance with the Strategy for Judiciary Reform, the planned reforms for strengthening the
independence and efficiency of the judiciary are generally aimed at strengthening the integrity of the
judiciary. In that regard, the Law on the Court Budget (”Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 60/03) strengthens the independence of the judiciary in the field of financing and
decision-making regarding the need for financial resources necessary for efficient functioning of the
judiciary in the Republic of Macedonia.
The abovementioned laws are implemented by the following state bodies:
According to the Law on Prevention of Corruption a State Commission for the Prevention of
Corruption has been established. For more details on the composition and the competencies of this
Commission, see answer I_E_04).
The Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia, on the basis of the Law on Public
Prosecutor’s Office (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04) takes legal actions
against persons who commit criminal offences. Pursuant to article 29 of this law, in the framework of
the Public Prosecutor’s Office, a special Unit for fighting organised crime and corruption was
established in September 2004. The Unit acts upon cases of this kind before all courts in the Republic
of Macedonia, depending on their territorial jurisdiction and jurisdiction ratione materiae. With the
establishment of this Unit, the Republic of Macedonia has implemented the recommendation of the
Greco Group of the Council of Europe for the fight against corruption. This law gives a basis for
strengthening the co-operation between the competent state bodies.
The police is performing its function of detecting the perpetrators of criminal acts according to the
Law on Internal Affairs (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 19/95, 55/97, 38/02,
33/03 и 19/04), the Criminal Code and the related secondary legislation. In accordance with the
adopted Action Plan of the Police Reform Strategy, a Department for Organised Crime was
established in January 2005. Within the framework of this Department in the Sector for Financial
Crime, a Section for Money Laundering and Corruption is working on discovering cases of bribery
and other corruptive actions.
For implementing the anti-corruption laws, a Directorate for Prevention of Money Laundering, has
been established in accordance with the Law on Prevention of Money Laundering and Other
Proceeds from Crime (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.46/04). The Directorate for
Prevention of Money Laundering, as an administrative body within the Ministry of Finance, is
responsible to gather data and process reports submitted by the subjects obliged to undertake
measures and actions to detect and prevent money laundering, such as the Customs Office, the state
bodies competent to carry out supervision, as well as other state bodies. The Directorate is also
responsible to gather and process data from competent institutions from other countries. If during the
processing of the reports, the Directorate finds that some transaction is suspicious, it is obliged to
undertake a detailed analysis, to request additional information and documentation from state bodies
or financial institutions or to gather information from foreign competent institutions for fight against
money laundering and financing of terrorism.
The competencies of the Financial Police are regulated with the Law on Financial Police (”Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 55/02). It is responsible to control the implementation of
the tax and custom regulations. It collects information and data in co-operation with the Ministry of
Finance, the Ministry of the Interior, the Public Prosecutor’s Office and other state bodies in order to
discover law violations in cases of tax evasion, money laundering, smuggling, trafficking of goods and
products and other types of criminal offences that involve large or significant amount of taxes,
customs or other revenues.

The Financial Police within its competencies has special powers (law enforcement agency) in financerelated matters. In case of a reasonable doubt of a crime, the Financial police carry out investigative
activities ex officio, upon request of the Public Prosecutor’s Office, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of the
Interior, Public Revenue Office, Customs Office as well as the Directorate for Prevention of Money
Laundering, or upon information of other administrative bodies or persons.
The Law on Customs Administration (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 46/04)
clearly defines the competencies of the Customs Administration as a state body that secures the
implementation of laws in the sphere of customs administration operations and other laws that fall
under its competency, as well as the competencies, rights and special authorisations of the customs
officers/officials.
For more information on state bodies responsible for the implementation of anti-corruption laws,
see answers I_E_4 and I_E_8.
3. Is there a national anti-corruption strategy? What is its status? Does it cover both law
enforcement and preventive measures? Was this the subject of broad consultation at all
levels (e.g. interdepartmental at national, regional, local level, among stakeholders in the
private sector and civil society, media etc.)? Is the strategy being implemented and, if so, how
is this being done?
Based on Article 55 of the Law on Prevention of Corruption, the State Commission for the Prevention
of Corruption is authorised and obliged to draft and adopt a National Programme for Prevention and
Suppression of Corruption. In addition, the State Commission is obliged by law to adopt annual
programmes and plans for the National Programme implementation. In line with its legal obligations
and its working programme the State Commission prepared, and on 17.06.2003 adopted the National
Programme for Prevention and Suppression of Corruption, along with an Action Plan.
After its adoption, the National Programme was forwarded to the Assembly, the Government and the
Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia, as well as to all other institutions and state bodies
having specific competences in its implementation; to all embassies and representatives of
international organisations in the Republic of Macedonia; to the relevant international organisations,
such as Council of Europe, OECD and others; and to all diplomatic and consular missions abroad.
Additionally it was communicated to the Government to harmonise and coordinate the activities in
terms of implementation of the proposed measures and actions.
Hence, the Government adopted Guidelines on the Cooperation between the State Commission for
the Prevention of Corruption and the State Administrative Bodies, Public Enterprises, Public
Institutions and other legal entities managing with state capital (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 81/04). The Guidelines provide for co-operation by harmonising the activities and
measures in the fight against corruption; by establishing and maintaining communication; by
providing technical assistance through exchange of professional, academic and technical know-how,
as well as by providing of information on persons suspected to have perpetrated actions which
include elements of corruption. Pursuant to the Guidelines, an opinion is requested from the State
Commission for the Prevention of Corruption whenever legal acts or their amendments regulating
issues concerning the prevention of corruption are drafted.
The National Programme includes recommendations as to the necessary measures and activities
that are to be undertaken in order to establish an efficient system of prevention and suppression of
corruption.
The approach that was taken when drafting the National Programme was identification of possible
solutions to the problems by applying empirical methods. This has enabled specification of optimal
measures, which if fully implemented, would enable the creation of an efficient system of prevention
and suppression of corruption in the Republic of Macedonia. The fact that constitutional
amendments, a series of amendments to the existing laws and adoption of new ones followed, as
well as the establishment of new institutions, can be seen as an additional confirmation of the

189/453

comprehensive approach adopted in the preparation of the National Programme. This also speaks in
favour of the fact that without deep and fundamental reforms in the state order and political system,
in the judiciary, law enforcement institutions and the administration, statements on the commitment to
the rule of law and democratic society are irrelevant.
An integral part of the National Programme is the Action Plan for its implementation which envisages
short, medium and long-term objectives, as well as a system of monitoring and evaluation of the
implementation.
According to the Action Plan, priority shall be given to preparation and adoption of new or
amendments to existing laws, setting up new or strengthening the existing institutions, and
strengthening the control mechanisms.
Taking into consideration the significance of this document, the need to ensure its acceptance of all
structures in the political life and the society as well as the need for multidisciplinary approach and
the need to provide its efficient implementation, the State Commission, when preparing the National
Programme, established fruitful cooperation with the Government, the Assembly, the Public
Prosecutor’s Office, Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Economy, State Audit Office, Civil Servants
Agency, the Ombudsman etc. Particular contribution in the preparation of the National Programme
was also provided by academics, independent experts and representatives from non-governmental
organizations and the media, as well as experts of the Council of Europe, OSCE and the Stability
Pact. Furthermore, the State Commission submitted the National Programme to the Assembly
together with the 2002/2003 Annual Report on its operation.
As a body authorised to monitor, assess and evaluate the implementation of the National
Programme, the State Commission has conducted two levels of evaluation.
In late September 2003, the State Commission submitted a request to the Government and to other
competent bodies to provide information on the measures and activities undertaken for
implementation of the Programme recommendations. The Government instructed all relevant
institutions to report on the implementation status. Subsequently, part of the ministries and other
institutions competent for the implementation of the National Programme submitted the requested
information.
The implementation evaluation contains information which specifies that the competent institutions
had focused their activities during the first three months on the preparations of new laws stipulated in
the Programme. In this period the drafting of the following laws commenced: Law on the Public
Prosecutor’s Office, Law on the Public Attorney’ Office, Law on Prevention of Money Laundering and
Other Proceeds from Crime, Law on Customs Administration, Amendments to the Criminal Code,
Amendments to the Law on the Judicial Council of the Republic, Law on Court Budget, Law on the
Ombudsman, Law on Criminal Procedure, Law on Public Institutions, Law on Administrative
Inspection, Law on Free Access to Public Information, Law on Political Parties, Law on Prevention of
Conflicts of Interests, Law on Civil Servants, Law on Associations of Citisens and Foundations, Law
on Elections etc. In all these laws, particular attention was dedicated to the implementation of the
National Programme.
The Commission assessed that the implementation of the recommendations of the National
Programme have largely proceeded within the determined timeframes although a number of
institutions have not submitted the requested information,
The second evaluation of the implementation of the National Programme was carried out in June
2004, at the Annual Conference organised by the State Commission. The assessment indicated that
the National Programme had been implemented according to the Action Plan. However, the State
Commission, together with the members of the working group that prepared the National Programme
were assigned with concrete activities to amend the Programme with recommendations for
implementation of the already adopted laws and institutional changes. Particular attention was
suggested in the amending of the Programme following the recommendations for specific measures
for prevention of corruption within the decentralised local self-government.

4. Do specialised anti-corruption services exist? If so, please describe these indicating their
legal and institutional status, composition, functions and powers. How is the independence of
these services ensured?
For the prevention and suppression of corruption in the Republic of Macedonia the following anticorruption bodies have been founded:
1) The State Commission for the Prevention of Corruption
The State Commission for the Prevention of Corruption has been established according to the Law
on Prevention of Corruption (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 28/02, 46/04 and
83/2004- consolidated text). According to the Law, the State Commission is autonomous and
independent in carrying out the activities stipulated by this law. The State Commission in accordance
with the Law on Amending the Law on Prevention of Corruption (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 46/04) is a legal entity and has its own budget. A Secretariat has been established
within the Commission to carry out the professional, administrative and technical matters, which
enhances the autonomy and independence of the State Commission.
The State Commission is comprised of seven members, elected from the rank of eminent experts in
the field of law and economics and enjoy public reputation in their respective fields. The members of
the State Commission are appointed and dissmissed by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia.
The current members of the State Commission were appointed by the Assembly on 12.11.2002.
In accordance with the amendments to the Law, the members of the State Commission are appointed
on a five-year non-renewable term. During their term, they perform their function professionally, which
means that they are employed in the State Commission. This provision does not refer to this term of
office, which had started before the adoption of the new Law.
The members of the State Commission elect a President among themselves for a one-year nonrenewable term.
A member of the State Commission may be released of duty before the expiry of his/her term in the
following cases: upon his/her request, if he/she has been convicted for a criminal offence to
unconditional imprisonment of at least six months, and if he/she has permanently lost the ability to
perform the function.
According to the Law, the State Commission has wide competencies to achieve the general goal:
prevention of corruption in exercing power, public authority, official duty and in politics, prevention of
conflict of interests, prevention of corruption while undertaking matters of public interest, as well as
prevention of corruption in the private sector.

Prevention of Money Laundering, the Financial Police, and other state and financial
institutions.
The State Commission, apart from co-operating with institutions in the country, has an active cooperation with the respective national institutions and bodies from other countries (especially with
those from the region), as well as with international organisations active in the field of prevention of
corruption.
One of the crucial tasks of the State Commission identified as the focus of activities in the near future
is the training and the education of the institutions responsible for discovering and prosecuting
corruption and other types of crimes. In addition, an important task is to inform the public about its
activities, to raise public awareness on non acceptance of corruption and about the harmful
consequences of corruption in all segments of the society, and especially its negative impact on the
economic growth and its contribution to the growth of poverty.
The members of the State Commission are responsible before the Assembly of the Republic of
Macedonia. For their work, they submit Annual Report to the Assembly. This report is also submitted
to the President of the Republic of Macedonia, Government of the Republic of Macedonia, and the
mass media.
Elected and appointed officials, officials or responsible persons in public enterprises and other legal
entities managing with state capital, upon election, appointment, employment or termination of office,
have an obligation, in a given time frame, to submit a declaration to the State Commission on their
property situation, and on the property situation of the members of their families. During the office
term, they are obliged to report to the State Commission any changes in their property, or in the
property of the members of his/her family; about their participation in public tenders; use of donations
and other foreign aid; acquiring shareholder rights; using state loans, etc.
The State Commission also acts in cases when there are indications that an official or other official or
responsible person has brought a discretionary decision as a result of corruption.
In order to carry out its competency in prevention of the so-called electoral corruption, the State
Commission informs the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia on the potential misuse of
budgetary funds and public funds, as well as funds of public enterprises used during electoral
campaigns.
In this context, the State Commission has the right to request from competent bodies to carry out
control on the funds used for financing a political party or an election candidate in case there are
indications of use of illegal funds.
The State Commission competency for the prevention of corruption in companies is aimed to
preventing monopolistic position on the market; discrimination against other companies or legal
entities; distortion of the market and causing damage to other subjects on the market, not resulting
from loyal competition.
The prevention of corruption in the companies also includes a prohibition for a company or another
legal entity to establish business relations with another company or a legal entity when a conflict of
interests occurs. In cases when there is a well founded suspicion based on the data in the annual
account and other financial data in the business books of a legal entity, the State Commission has the
authority to request the Public Revenue Office to carry out control in the material and financial
documents of that legal entity.

192/453

Acting upon submitted complaints, and in cases when there is a well founded suspicion of committed
criminal offence- misuse of public function and corruption, the State Commission may require from
authorised institutions to carry out control on the work of the suspected legal entities, as well as to
raise an initiative before the Public Prosecutor’ Office for initiating a criminal procedure.
For the prevention of corruption in the judiciary, and acting in cases when there are indications or
well-founded suspicion for misuse of the office of specific judges, the State Commission submits a
request to the Judicial Council of the Republic for determining the liability of those judges.
Since its establishment, up to the end of October 2004, the State Commission has raised initiatives
on different grounds, such as: 11 initiatives for determining of criminal liability; in 9 cases- considering
conflict of interest issues and dismissal; 13 cases- considering the activities of certain state bodies;
discretionary rights and determining of liability. In addition, the State Commission has reviewed 7
cases on possible abuse in public procurements, one case regarding protection of person who
collaborated with the State Commission and one case each on corruption in judiciary, money
laundering, education and politics.
Since November 2002, 926 complaints have been submitted to the State Commission by the citizens,
out of which, 266- regarding the state bodies activities; 122- related to privatisation process; 186 -on
the judiciary work, 126 -regarding the activities of the public enterprises, health and education sector,
75 –regarding various indications for deviations in the companies, 54 –on irregularities during
bankruptcy procedures and 97 other cases. Besides submitted complaints, the State Commission
has raised 26 procedures on its own initiative. The State Commission handled 672 cases, out of
which 258 are finalised. In 132 complaints the State Commission found it self not competent for
further proceedings; in 26 cases after receiving additional information, it determined that there is no
ground for further proceedings (no irregularities were found), 67 cases were submitted to the
competent bodies for proceedings, and for 21 cases, an initiative for instituting procedures and taking
appropriate measures, was raised before competent state bodies.
According to the Article 34, paragraph 1, of the Law on Prevention of Corruption, 2.786 property
declarations were submitted to the State Commission, including data for property of elected and
appointed officials and members of their families, including a certified statement on revoking
protection of banking secrecy in regard to all domestic and foreign bank accounts. Furthermore, in
accordance with Article 34 of the Law, 81 reports on changes in property situation in a value which
exceeds twenty average salaries, were submitted. The total number of persons who submitted
property declarations includes all elected and appointed persons who have acquired this status in the

having this status when the Law entered into force, before the State Commission was established.
The State Commission submitted to the competent court request for instituting procedure for
misdemeanour against 82 persons who failed to submit property declarations. In 13 cases
misdemeanour warnings were delivered or the proceedings were terminated.
2) The Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia – Unit for Fight Organised
Crime and Corruption
In accordance with Article 106 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, the Public
Prosecutor’s Office is a single and autonomous state body. It performs its functions on the basis and
within the framework of the Constitution and the law. The Public Prosecutor is appointed and
discharged of office by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia for a six-year term. Therefore, the
term of office of the Public Prosecutor differs from the one of the members of the Assembly.
On the basis of Article 29 of the Law of the Public Prosecutor’s Office (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04) – a special Unit for Fight Organised Crime and Corruption was
established within the Public Prosecutor’s Office.

3) Ministry of the Interior
According to the Action Plan on Police Reform, the Department for Organised Crime has started with

prevention of organised crime and also in prevention of corruption.
The restructuring of the Unit on Organised Crime in a special Department, represent strengthening of
this office, which achieved broader structure and units specialised for different types of crime. The
assumptions for starting with activities have been created, only after the completion of the internal
structure and the adoption of the Rulebook on the Organisation and Operation of the Ministry of the
Interior (describing workings tasks and special qualifications for each working post).
The activities on combating corruption and serious economic crime are realised in the framework of
the Sector for Financial Crime, comprised of Section for Economic Crime and Section for Money
Laundering and Corruption. The Sector permanently oversee the situations, movements and forms of
economic and financial crime and corruption that occur, and on this base, plans and organises the
most appropriate and most efficient measures and activities for warning and combating of such
criminal activities.
In this framework, the Sector co-operates with other organisational units in the Ministry of the Interior,
state bodies, legal entities, police departments from other countries and international associations;
makes control over the activities of police departments and provides professional and other
assistance in combating economic and financial crime and corruption. It also plans and provides
training of inspectors on this issue; participates in drafting regulations, reports and on other expert’s
materials and exercises other activities from its domain.(For more details see answer 24_I_07)
4) Financial Police
The Financial Police as a body within the Ministry of Finance with specific competencies and working
agenda for the first time was introduced with the Law on Financial Police (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 55/02). Besides this, the law enable the strengthening of the already
established competencies in the operational activities for discovering financial crimes that cannot be
directly substantiated considering the existing evidence. In this context, methods for direct and
indirect proving of evidence are used in accordance with the law. This law also sets forth a
separation and transfer of the police supervision over financial crime from the Ministry of the Interior
to the Ministry of Finance, whereby a specialised team will trace the money proceeding from criminal
activities.
The Financial Police is a state body within the Ministry of Finances and it exercises its competencies
on the entire territory of the Republic of Macedonia. The Financial Police is managed by a Director.
The Financial Police is comprised of ten financial police officers-economists and lawyers transferred
from the Public Revenue Office, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Public Prosecutor’s Office. The
Director of the Financial Police is appointed by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and
he/she is responsible for his/her work to the Ministry of Finance and the Government. Financial police
officers are selected and appointed according to the Rulebook on Examination of the Competencies
and Evaluation of the Personal Capacities of the Persons Performing the Work of the Financial Police

194/453

(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 31/04), which provides the special preconditions for appointment.
This law provides the Financial Police with specific authorities for detecting of perpetrators of
sophisticated types of crime, tax evasion, money laundering and smuggling. The law also provides
specific competence for detecting the following types of criminal offences: illegal trade of goods and
products; criminal offences that include evasion of large or significant amounts of taxes and customs
duties; and giving legal form to profits deriving from criminal offences. If these crimes can not be
detected directly, with the existing evidence, the Financial Police detects them with application of
special methodology for indirect and direct verification of incomes determined by the Law on
Financial Police, and proscribed with other regulations in the area of finances.
5) Public Revenue Office
There are separate departments and responsible persons within this state body that have
competencies for undertaking anti-corruption measures.
The Sector for Inspection Supervision is established within the framework of the General Directorate
of the Public Revenue Office. Within the framework of each Regional Directorates (in total 6) of the
Public Revenue Office, one person in each is selected to carry out procedures in accordance with the
Law on Prevention of Corruption.
According to the Rulebook for Internal Organisation and Operation of the Public Revenue Office the
Section for Investigations, within the Sector for Inspection Supervision, in the General Directorate,
has the responsibility to prepare methodology and instructions for its enforcement and to carry out
procedures proscribed by Law where the usual tax procedure (anti-corruption measures) is not
proscribed. The Section is also responsible to realise the following measures: organisation of training
for investigative techniques and procedures, developing and coordinating of programme for
identification and fight against grey economy, and cooperate in that field with the Regional
Directorates.
The persons subject to declaring assets, on the basis of Article 34 of the Law on Prevention of
Corruption, besides to the State Commission for the Prevention of Corruption, have to submit the
property declaration to the Section for Investigations. Within the Section, the property declarations
are filed, their formal correctness and completeness is checked and a comparison with the submitted
applications to the State Commission is performed. Concerning these persons (the submitters) this
Section also compares the data from the property declaration with the data from property registers
that are kept in the Public Revenue Office. If a discrepancy is found when comparing the data of the
property declaration with the data that is kept by the Public Revenue Office, it is considered that the
person has submitted incorrect or incomplete data and a procedure for investigating the origin of the
material wealth and property is initiated.
The procedure for investigating the origin of the assets is carried out in the Regional
Directorates of the Public Revenue Office (Skopje, Tetovo, Bitola, Prilep, Strumica, and Štip). For
carrying out this procedure in every Regional Directorate, upon the proposal of the Director of the
Regional Directorate, the Director of the Public Revenue Office selects one person who is authorised
to implement procedures for investigating the origin of the material wealth and property. These
persons are autonomous in taking procedural measures (preparation of minutes, hearing of a given
person, preparation of notes, evidence gathering and so on) against given persons.
The Public Revenue Office can perform a procedure for investigating the origin of the assets against
persons performing duties of public interest, if his/her property and the property of the members of
his/her family at the time of performing of the duties have disproportionately increased in relation to
his/her income. The Public Revenue Office also carries out a procedure against, a responsible
person in a company or other legal entity or a member of body of a legal entity, if in the procedure of
supervision of the financial activity of this legal entity, the Public Revenue Office finds irregularities.

195/453

After the procedure of investigating the origin of the assets of a given person is carried out, the Public
Revenue Office, in accordance with the Law on Prevention of Corruption, prepares a decision for
taxation. If it is find out that the assets of that given person have been disproportionately increased,
the Public Revenue Office will raise an initiative before the Public Prosecutor’s Office for initiating a
procedure.
5. Is corruption defined as a criminal offence in line with the Council of Europe Criminal and
Civil Law Convention? Which type of conduct can be sanctioned as corruption? Is active
and/or passive bribery sanctioned? In the public and/or private sector? Trading in influence?
What kind of sanctions exist (e.g. possibility of confiscation of proceeds, disqualification
measures)?
The provisions of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic
of Macedonia”, Nos. 37/96, 80/99, 4/02, 43/03 and 19/04) on receiving a bribe (Article 357) and
giving a bribe (Article 358), are harmonised with the Council of Europe Criminal and Civil Law
Convention definitions on Corruption (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 32/99 and
“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 32/99) as well as with the Convention on
Protection of the European Communities’ Interests and its I and II Protocol.
Article 2 of the Law on Prevention of Corruption (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
Nos. 28/02, 46/04 and 83/04-consolidated text) defines corruption as abuse of the official position,
public authorisation, official duty and position for acquisition of personal gain, or gain for any other
person.
The offence of receiving bribe (Article 357) of the Criminal Code is defined as a passive form of
corruption committed by bribing an official or responsible person, i.e. was perpetrated when an
official shall request or receive a gift or some other benefit, or receives a promise for a gift or some
other benefit, in order to perform an official action within the framework of his/her own official
authority which he/she should not perform, or to refrain from an official action which he/she otherwise
should perform. Under the Code, the official person, committing this offence shall be punished with
imprisonment of one to ten years.
Furthermore, an official who requests or receive a gift or some other benefit, or receive a promise for
a gift or some other benefit, in order to perform an official action within the framework of his/her own
official authority which he/she should perform, or to refrain from an official action which he/she
otherwise should not perform, shall be punished with imprisonment of six months to five years.
An easier form of passive corruption (Article 357, paragraph 3) is the act of the official person who
after performing the official duty, request or receive a gift or some other benefit. The prescribed
prison sentence in such cases is from three months to three years.
The same penalties are prescribed for the responsible person and person that perform duties of
public interest, if the act has been committed in relation with acquiring or cessation of rights
determined by law or in order to acquire benefits, or to cause a damage to other; a responsible
person in a foreign legal entity; as well as a foreign official that shall commit an offence in order to
cause damage to the Republic of Macedonia, its citizen or to a legal entity. (Article 357, paragraph 4)
In all these cases, the received gift or acquired property gains shall be confiscated.
The provisions defining the crime of giving a bribe (Article 358) incriminates active corruption,
which consists of offering, giving or promising an official or responsible person a gift or other benefit,
so that he/she would perform an official action within the framework of his/her official authority which
he/she should not perform, or to refrain from an official action which he/she otherwise should
perform. The mediation in the realisation of this act is also sanctioned by the law. For all this crimes
an imprisonment of six months to five years is prescribed. When the perpetrator is a legal entity, it will
be punished with a fine.

196/453

According to the Code, a person who offers, gives or promises to an official or responsible person a
gift or other benefit, so that he/she would perform an official action within the framework of his/her
official authority which he/she must perform, or to refrain form an official act which he/she should not
perform, or a person who mediates for, shall be punished with a monetary fine, or with imprisonment
of up to three years.
In both cases, the received gift or proceeds shall be confiscated.
Beside the distinction between an official person and a responsible person, Articles 357 and 358 of
the Criminal Code have introduced a significant novelty. Namely the Code prescribes possible
exemption from sanction for the person who has offered, given or has promised a bribe upon a
request from an official person, and has reported it, before the act of bribery was detected. In such
cases, the presented gift or proceeds shall be returned to the person who has given the bribe.
Aimed at implementing the Law on Prevention of Corruption (Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia, Nos. 28/02; 46/04 and 83/04- consolidated text), the Criminal Code envisages new
criminal offences such as: Unconscientious performance of duties (Article 353-v) and Concealing the
resources of disproportional acquired property (Article 359-a).
In order to increase the preventive measures for protection from illegal acquiring of state owned
property, means from Budget and public funds, the Criminal Code in Article 353-v- Unconscientious
performance of duties- incriminates the abuse of official position by unconscientious exercise of
public duties i.e unconscientious disposal with the entrusted property. Depending on the scope of the
acquired proceeds and caused damage, the Law envisages imprisonment from three months to 10
years.
The said prison sentences are also imposed on responsible persons, including those from a foreign
legal entity having franchise in Republic of Macedonia, or on a person performing activities of public
interest, if the act has been committed in the performance of the special authorities or duties.
In cases when the official or responsible person of a pubic enterprise or a public institution presents
false data on his/her incomes, or when it has been found that the property of such persons is
significantly beyond his/her legally acquired and taxed income, or that the person conceal the true
sources of the income, shall be punished with an imprisonment of six months to five years and a fine.
In addition, the disproportionately acquired proceeds shall be confiscated. (Article 359-a)
The Law on Prevention of Corruption (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 28/02,
46/04 and 83/04-consolidated text) proscribe the bribery of voters (Article 14). The Law envisages
that giving or promising a gift or other benefits for oneself or for other, to voters during elections or
referendum, in order to vote or abstain from voting, or to vote in favour of a specific candidate or a
specific decision shall be considered as election corruption.
Granting privileges or discriminating after elections is also proscribed (Article 15).The State
Commission is authorised to request the competent bodies to undertake appropriate measures and
activities within their competencies, if it finds out any privileges or discrimination in regard to the
contracts, public procurements and other deals aimed to gain profits, concluded or executed in the
period of one year after the completion of any elections.
The Law also forbids exerting influence during election, appointment and discharge from
managerial positions (Article 16), when the influence has been exerted by a political party or a
person acting on behalf of the political party, meaning that the party i.e. person may not exert any
influence on election, appointment or discharge of a person from an official, managerial or other
public important position or duty. In addition, the Law envisages that a political party or a person
acting on behalf of the political party may not exert influence in respect of employment, assignment to
positions and termination of employment relationship of an official person (Article 17).
Furthermore, influence over employing close relatives (Article 30) is also forbidden. Thus, the Law
sets forth a prohibition for an elected or appointed official to employ or promote close relatives by

197/453

exercising influence either over the state body in which he/she is elected or appointed or over other
body. The elected or appointed official have the obligation to inform the State Commission about any
employment, promotion or appointment or a member of his/her family in a state body, local selfgovernment body, public enterprise or other legal entity managing with state capital.
For all these prohibited activities, the State Commission for Prevention of the Corruption has the
obligation to initiate proceedings before the competent bodies for establishing liability.
The issue of confiscation of property and proceeds is regulated by the provisions contained in
Articles 98-100 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic
of Macedonia”, Nos. 37/96, 80/99, 4/02, 43/03 and 19/04).
Article 97 of the Criminal Code envisages that no one may retain the direct or indirect property and
proceeds acquired through crime. The property and proceeds shall be confiscated trough a court
decision, with which the fact of the perpetration of the crime was established. The court may also
adopt a decision on confiscation in cases when due to the facts or legal obstacles it is not possible to
conduct criminal proceedings against the perpetrator. Under conditions determined by ratified
international agreements the confiscated property may be returned to a third country.
Under Article 98, the property and proceeds from crime, such as money, movable or immovable
objects of value, and other property gain, material and non-material rights shall be confiscated from
the perpetrator. If their confiscation is not possible, another property from the perpetrator
corresponding to the value of the proceeds from crime shall be confiscated. The confiscation of the
property and proceeds may be enforced also from third persons to whom they have been transferred
without relevant compensation, if they did not know, but could have known and who were obliged to
know that the proceeds have been gained through a crime.
The Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02
and 74/04) regulates the procedure for enforcement of the measure of temporary securing regarding
property or proceeds of crimes, such as temporary freezing, seizure, confiscation of funds, banking
accounts, financial transactions or criminal proceeds.
The enforcement order shall be issued by the court that delivered the judgement in first instance,
while the enforcement shall be carried out against property and proceeds designated in the order. If
the order can be enforced only partially or not at all, the execution shall be carried out against the
remaining property of the person subject to such a measure. No appeal is allowed against the
enforcement order, and the compulsory enforcement orders may be stayed only if the person
voluntarily returns the property or pays the amount of the proceeds, to an account of the court. Banks
and other financial institutions holding the accounts, against which this measure is enforced, have the
obligation without any delay, to execute the orders and prevent eventual transfers or financial
transactions. The legal acts concluded after the perpetration of the criminal act, with the intention to
decrease the value of the property subject to confiscation, are invalid. An appeal is allowed only
against the orders for enforcement against the remaining property.
According to Article 29 of the Law on Prevention of Laundering Money and Other Proceeds from
Crime (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 46/04) when there are reasonable
grounds for suspicion that money laundering or an act of financing of terrorism has been committed,
the Directorate for Prevention of Money Laundering shall file an initiative to the competent Public
Prosecutor to raise proposal for enforcement of the securing measure not later than 24 hours, since it
has learned that such transaction is under way. Under Article 29, 30, 31 and 32, the competent court
shall pass orders for enforcement of securing measures upon the proposal of the Public Prosecutor
for imposing such measures. Temporary measures consist of interrupting the transaction and
temporary seizure of assets and property, while the entire procedure for ordering such measures
would be complete within 72 hours. Such a short period for adopting a decision has been envisaged
due to the sensitivity of the measures and their infringing upon the right of clients and their material
and other interests, determined by the court, in accordance with the original decision ordering such
measures in pre-trial or in a criminal procedure.

6. To what extent and from which sources are statistical data available concerning corruption
cases (investigations, cases in court, convictions and sanction level), international cooperation in corruption cases, the link between corruption and organised crime and the link
between corruption and money laundering?
Under the Law on State Statistics (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 54/97), the
State Statistical Office is the principal agency of official statistics in the Republic of Macedonia.
According to the Statistical Research Programme for the period 2003-2007, the State Statistical
Office is in charge of collection, processing and dissemination of parts of crime statistics data.
Generally, data on crime is kept according to the Classification of Criminal Offences (”Official Gazette
of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 60/97), which is a by-law of the Criminal Code adopted in 1996
(”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 37/96). According to this Classification, a
special class belongs to the criminal offences which have the distinctive features of organised crime,
and criminal offences in the area of corruption.
Authorised bodies for maintenance of the statistical data on crimes are the Ministry of the Interior,
Ministry of Justice, the courts and the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
The modes for maintenance of the statistical data on crime rates differ depending on the bodies in
charge of the individual stages of the procedure which maintain the statistical records.
In the Ministry of the Interior, which is in charge of the pre-trial procedure, the statistical data are
categorised on the basis of the ‘criminal offence’ indicator; the statistical data in the Public
Prosecutor’s Office are categorised on the basis of the ‘person accused of a criminal offence’, while
the courts categorise the statistical data on the basis of ‘cases’, which can sometimes comprise
either several persons or several criminal offences.
The Criminal Code of the Republic of Macedonia includes corruption related criminal offences.
Regarding the number of criminal offences subject to criminal charges filed pursuant to these
provisions, the statistical data can be obtained from the statistical records of the Ministry of the
Interior. These statistical records are maintained on the basis of the legal qualification of the reported
criminal offences and for a period of one calendar year.
Within the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia, the statistical records are
classified based on ‘persons against whom there are indictments’ for a given criminal offence.
According to the mode for maintaining the annual statistical records of the Public Prosecutor’s Office,
the cases which are recorded, and which were not finalised are transferred into the next year.
Pursuant to the Law on State Statistics (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 54/97),
the courts in the Republic of Macedonia, i.e., the basic courts submit a filled questionnaire on a
defendant of age, against whom the criminal procedure has been finalised by an effective court
verdict. These questionnaires are processed by the State Statistical Office. Pursuant to the Court
Rules of Procedure, the courts maintain records on all cases, including those related to corruption,
and therefore the data in their original form are obtained from the courts.
After the end of the calendar year the institutions in charge of maintaining statistical data on crime
rates submit the statistical data to the State Statistical Office (SSO), where they are additionally
processed in accordance with the accepted nomenclature, which is different from all previously
mentioned. These data, after the processing, are published in Statistical Reports. The published data
of the SSO also disclose the data on the rate of pronounced verdicts and the types of pronounced
sanctions.
The State Commission for Prevention of Corruption, based on its competence, is not required to
maintain statistical data upon any grounds, while it records data related to its activities (received
property statements from elected and appointed officials; petitions received from citizens and legal
entities; initiatives for instituting a procedure before competent bodies).

199/453

The data on the international cooperation in corruption cases can be received from the NCB Interpol
and the Ministry of the Interior; however an efficient system for regular statistical tracking has not yet
been developed. In addition, special statistical records on the interconnectivity of corruption to the
organised crime and money laundering do not ex
7. Training:
a) How and by whom are relevant staff (anti-corruption prosecutors etc.) trained?
b) Which typical “accompanying offences” are covered by the training?
(fraud, tax offences and money laundering)
a)
In the last five years the professional training of judges and prosecutors in the Republic of Macedonia
is performed by the Centre for Continuing Education, which operates within the Macedonian Judges
Association. The Judicial Reform Strategy foresees institutionalisation of National School for
Education of Judges and Prosecutors. One of the special programmes will be the training of the anticorruption prosecutors.
The Centre for Continuous Education of Judges in 2003 organised the following seminars:
−
−

Corruption and its Criminal Law Identification,
Fight against Organised Crime, Active and Passive Corruption and Money Laundering.

Within the curricula of the Public Prosecutors Association of the Republic of Macedonia, an education
seminar was organised in cooperation with the Programme for Development, Assistance and
Training for the Public Prosecutor’s Offices in Macedonia (OPDAT) within the USA Embassy, on the
topic of Organised Crime, which took place from 11-13.03.2004. In addition, a workshop/seminar was
organised for public prosecutors, judges, criminal inspectors, financial police, custom officials and for
personnel in the Directorate for Prevention of Money Laundering on the topic of Investigations and
Criminal Prosecution of Offences of Organised Crime, which took place between 8-11.10.2004 in
Skopje.
One of the more important training programmes was the Council of Europe Octopus Programme against
corruption and organised crime with two-year duration (2001-2003), the purpose of which was to
introduce the judges and the prosecutors to the contents of the international documents and the EU
member-states legislation related to the fight against organised crime and corruption. The training was
carried out through regional seminar and study trips.
In terms of education especially important is the implementation of the CARDS 2001 Project, which
should commence at the beginning of 2005 as the programmed tasks foresee dealing with the topics
related in organised crime and corruption.
The implementation of the PACO IMPACT project is under way (Implementation of Anti-Corruption Plans
in Southeast Europe), supported by the Swedish Agency for International Cooperation and Development,
and implemented through the Council of Europe. The main project partner from the Republic of
Macedonia is the State Commission for Prevention of Corruption. A portion of the funds is earmarked for
training of prosecutors from the Unit for fight organised crime and corruption, within the Public
Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia.
b)
Within the already completed trainings there also was training of public prosecutors and personnel
from other bodies involved in the fight against corruption. The new forms of crime have been dealt
with, with special emphasis on organised and trans-national crime, corruption, cyber-crime, money
laundering, financial/commercial crime, terrorism, trafficking in human beings, trafficking in narcotic
drugs and unauthorised possession and carrying of weapons and trafficking in weapons.

8. What is done to strengthen the rule of law enforcement bodies in the fight against
corruption in general but also to fight corruption internally.
Pursuant to the National Programme for Prevention and Suppression of Corruption, and in order to
strengthen the state bodies in charge of combating corruption as well as to combat corruption in the state
administration itself, the following activities have been undertaken:
1) Public Prosecutor’s Office
Pursuant to Article 29 of the Law on the Public Prosecutor's Office (“Official Gazette of the Republic
of Macedonia”, No. 38/04) a special Unit for fight organised crime and corruption has been
established within the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
2) Ministry of the Interior
In the Department for Organised Crime at the Ministry of the Interior within it Sector for Financial
Crime, there is a Section for Money Laundering and Corruption which is in charge of suppressing
corruption (see also answer I_E_04). Also important is the establishment of the Sector for Criminal
and Intelligence analysis, competent to collect, examine and assess information and data. Analytical
information acquired in such a manner enable the execution of police actions as far as the
operational plan is concerned, and as regards the strategic plan, facilitate the planning of
development, technical, financial and other activities.
The Law on Interception of Communication (to be adopted) is expected to reinforce the Ministry’s
capacity in combating corruption.
The Ministry of the Interior established a free telephone line in May 2004 (#199) where citizens may
report corruption of the Ministry's employees.
Sector for Internal Control and Professional Standards at the Ministry of the Interior
Pursuant to the Rulebook on Systematisation of Posts in the Ministry of the Interior, a Sector for Internal
Control and Professional Standards has been established to carry out particular expert matters for the
police and criminal police. The Sector (SICPS) has a duty to investigate cases of abuse of official position
and authority as well as corruption of employees in the Ministry of the Interior. There are activities under
way for establishment of two units within the SICPS:
−
−

Criminal Affairs Unit
Unit for Submissions, Complaints, Legal Conduct and Application of Authorities.

The work and conduct of the Sector has been regulated by the Rulebook on the Performance of
Duties of the Sector for Internal Control and Professional Standards within the Ministry of the Interior.
Pursuant to the Rulebook, the Sector conducts investigation on the basis of data, information and
indications received by employees in the Ministry, and on the basis of submissions of citizens related
to illegal and unprofessional conduct of the Ministry's employees. The Sector may also launch an
investigation upon the proposal of the Minister of the Interior.
Investigations related to illegal and unprofessional conduct of employees are carried out by 21
authorised inspectors, while inspections related to illegal and unprofessional conduct of employees in
the internal affairs sectors and units are carried out by eight detached authorised officers in the seats
of regional internal affairs sectors and units.
The outcome of such investigation and inspection is presented in a final report submitted to the head
of sector or to the Minister of the Interior. In the event of a well-founded suspicion of a crime, the
sector or the organisational unit which has been given the investigation results files a criminal charge
to the Basic Public Prosecutor’s Office. In accordance with the Law on Internal Affairs and the
Collective Agreement of the Ministry of the Interior, a decision is rendered for a temporary removal of

201/453

the employee from his/her post and the employee is further subject to a procedure of termination of
employment.
In the event that employees have been suspected of corruption, yet such suspicions have not been
supported by material evidence, they are reassigned to another post.
The Sector is fully independent in its operations and in launching investigations on whatever grounds.
The Sector exclusively answers to the Minister for its work.
3) Public Revenue Office
For the purpose of reducing the risk of abuse of official duty in the process of granting tax reliefes and
exemptions (i.e. the reduction of the discretionary rights of tax officers) the Public Revenue Office has
been subject to reinforced internal control. Hence, a Sector for Internal Control was established in 2002
which in 2004 became a Sector for Internal Audit. The Unit for Audit and Harmonisation of the Systems of
Internal Control within this Sector, inter alia, carries out conformity assessment regarding the enforcement
of laws, by-laws and internal acts that are in force, as well as procedural control related to complaints
against the conduct and work of tax officers. Additionally, a free direct telephone line has been
established (#198) for reporting an abuse of official duty of employees in the Office, as well as for
reporting tax evasion and non-issuance of fiscal bills.
4) Customs Administration
In the interest of securing the integrity of customs officers and preventing corruption, a new function
within the Customs Administration has been introduced in 2003 falling under the competence of the
Sector for Professional Standards, which comprises the Internal Inspection Unit and the Internal
Investigation Unit. The staffing of the Sector started in May 2003 when the Internal Investigation Unit
was formed, while the Internal Inspection Unit is in the process of forming.
The Sector for Professional Standards has a mission to act preventively and detect and eliminate
unprofessional conduct, fraud, losses, abuses, corruption and miss-governance, i.e. all deviant
phenomena in professional conduct as stipulated in Article 123 of the Collective Agreement on
Labour Relations No. 01-1984/1 adopted on 17.03.2003 at the Customs Administration of the
Republic of Macedonia. The Sector exerts control over all functions in the Customs Administration
sectors and customs houses regarding their lawful conduct and adherence to prescribed procedures,
competence, tasks, rights and liabilities. In addition, the Sector investigates allegations on unlawful
operations by employees (uniformed personnel, authorised persons, persons with a status of civil
servants and persons without the status of civil servants).
In June 2003 and in August and September 2004 the advisory team of the US Customs Service
SECI conducted special training for the staff of the Sector for Professional Standards.
Regarding the foregoing, the Sector for Professional Standards collects information on unlawful
conduct of customs officers through the On-duty Operational Centre (the open telephone line #197
that started operating on 26.11.2003); collects information from the Sector for Control and
Investigation; uses various techniques of surveillance and shadowing in accordance with law; and
develops confidential contacts with participant subjects in the customs procedure.
The Sector for Professional Standards prepares official reports on the basis of objectively collected
facts and evidence (official notes for internal use and official information for communication with the
director and for further processing the case to the Disciplinary Commission), which serve as support
to allegations on a customs offence. In the course of the procedure, the Sector takes account of the
moral integrity of the customs officer and his/her human rights.
The Internal Investigation Unit of the Sector for Professional Standards from 01.07.2003 to
30.09.2004 instituted the following procedures:

202/453

Skopje Customs House
− A total of 27 procedures have been instituted of which 26 have been completed and the
remaining one is under way;
Kumanovo Customs House
− A total of 30 procedures have been instituted of which 29 have been completed and the
remaining one is under way;
Štip Customs House
− A total of 15 procedures have been initiated and completed;
Gevgelija Customs House
− A total of 20 procedures have been initiated and completed;
Bitola Customs House:
− A total of 32 procedures have been initiated and completed.
At the level of the Customs Administration in the Republic of Macedonia a total of 124 procedures
have been instituted, of which 122 have been completed and 2 are under way.
In the context of the above, the Sector for Professional Standards exerts its independence through
objectively collected facts and evidence regarding allegations of a customs offence, without taking
part in the further procedure, i.e. without participating in the work and the relevant decision-making of
the Disciplinary Commission. The Sector for Professional Liability is under direct jurisdiction of the
Customs Administration Director.
For the purpose of preventing corruption, the Customs Administration has introduced an official ID as
an additional part to the official uniform. The customs officer is obliged to keep his/her official ID at all
times so as he/she may be identified in the event of improper performance of duty or misconduct.
Especially important for the strengthening of the institutions that enforce the rule of law in combating
corruption is the training on corruption of judges and public prosecutors, carried out by the Centre for
Continuous Education of Judges and Public Prosecutors within the Judges Association (in the framework
of the national and regional CARDS Programme, the Council of Europe projects, etc.). For more detail on
training of judges and public prosecutors, please see answer I_E_07.
9. Public offices: is equal access guaranteed to all citizens? Do regulations exist which are
objective and founded on merit-based criteria (in terms of adequate salaries, social rights,
rotation in sensitive posts, financial disclosure obligations during office)? How are such rules
reconciled with the principle of equitable representation?
The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos
52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) in Article 32, paragraph 2 stipulates the right to work and free
choice of employment under equal conditions as one of the basic human and civil rights and
freedoms. This Constitutional principle has been applied through two basic legal acts that govern the
manner of employment of public and civil servants.
Equal access to jobs and selection based on qualifications are the two main principles for
employment of civil servants, determined by the Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00, 112/00, 34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04
and 69/04). For more details on the conditions of employment of civil servants see answer I_C_06.
The ways and procedures of employment of public servants that do not have a status of civil servants
have been regulated by the Law on Labour Relations (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”
Nos. 80/93, 3/94, 14/95, 53/97, 59/97, 21/98, 25/00, 34/00, 50/01, 25/03 40/03 and 80/03consolidated text).

203/453

The Law on Labour Relations in Article 9 emphasises the principle of equal access to every working
position for each citizen in general, including the public service, providing that the employer may not
put a person seeking employment or an employee in an unequal position on grounds of his/her race,
gender, age, health condition, i.e. disability, religious, political or other belief, trade union
membership, ethnic or social background, family status, property status or other similar state of
affairs. (For more details see answer I_C_06).
Chapter IV of the Law on Civil Servants regulates the civil servants’ system of salaries and salary
supplements (for more details see answer I_C_06)
Because a single regulation of the salary system for public servants that do not have a status of civil
servants does not exist, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and the Trade Union of the
Republic of Macedonia, as its social partner, signed in December 2002 a social agreement
committing themselves to take action towards drafting a regulation for establishment of a public
sector salary system. As a result of this commitment, the drafting of a law for the regulation of the
salaries of public sector employees is currently underway. The solutions offered by this Law shall
correspond with the solutions on salaries determined by the Law on Civil Servants.
Social rights, such as the right of daily, weekly and annual paid leave, salary during national holidays
and professional training, the right of health care insurance - have been provided for the public
servants with the Law on Civil Servants, Law on Labour Relations and the General Labour
Agreement for Public Services, Public Enterprises, State Bodies, Local Self-Government Bodies and
Other Legal Entities Performing Non-Economic Activity (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos.39/94 and 73/2001). The criteria for the length of the annual leave have been
determined with the General Labour Agreement and are related to the length of the working
experience, complexity of the working tasks at a specific working position, working conditions and the
employee’s health condition. The Constitutional base for these rights and their regulation by law and
labour agreement has been determined in Article 32 of the Constitution of the Republic of
Macedonia. No additional rights have been stipulated for public service employees in terms of
implementation of the indicated rights and, in this regard, they are equal with other employees. Civil,
as well as public servants are entitled to a salary supplement for work in special conditions: night
work, work in shifts, work under high life-endangering risks, work during weekly leaves or holidays,
and over-time work.
Taking into account the particularities of the work and the working assignments the difficulties and
specific working conditions, as well as their effect on the employees’ working capacity, the Law on
Defence (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 42/01), Law on Internal Affairs (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.19/95, 55/97, 38/02, 13/03 and 33/03) and Law on the
Execution of Sanctions (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.3/97 and 23/99),
Chapter IV of the Law on Pension and Disability Insurance (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos.80/93, 3/94,14/95, 71/96, 32/97, 24/00, 96/00, 05/01 and 50/01) provide the right of
increased duration of service insurance, appropriate reduction of the age limit for exercising the right
of pension and a special pension calculation method for the employees at certain positions in the
defence, internal affairs and the penitentiaries. Posts affected by these additional rights shall be
determined by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia upon a proposal of the Ministers of
Defence, Interior and Justice.
Rotation of sensitive posts has not largely been introduced as a method for prevention of corruption.
However, initial efforts have been made in some state administration bodies. For example, the
Ministry of Defence introduced the obligatory rotation of the working posts for the members of the
Public Procurement Commission.
The obligation to report on the property situation while in office is a highly significant and sensitive
segment in the preventive set of measures and one of the most important issues regulated by the
Law on Prevention of Corruption (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 28/02, 46/04
and 83/2004-consolidated text). The Law regulates in details the ways and procedures of reporting
on the overall property. By reporting on one's property, an image is created on the current property

204/453

situation of a person taking the office and a monitoring is enabled until the moment of termination of
the office. The article 34 of the Law on Prevention of Corruption (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No.83/2004) sets forth that an elected or appointed official, responsible person in a
public enterprise, public institution or other legal entity managing with state capital, or an official,
upon election, appointment, employment or taking an office, fills a property declaration with detailed
description of the real estate, movables of substantial value, securities, claims and debts, as well as
other property owned by members of his/her family. Persons indicated in Paragraph 1 of this Article
are obliged to fill a property declaration within 30 days from the day after termination of the office, i.e.
termination of the employment. In the Law’s basic text, adopted in 2002, this obligation referred only
to elected or appointed persons. However, the amendments to the Law on Prevention of Corruption
of April 2004 (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia, No. 46/04) have introduced an
obligation for property declaration for all officials in the state administration.
The constitutional principle of equitable representation has been implemented in many laws. When
recruitng is concerned, this principle applies if not contravening the criteria on expertise and
competence.
10. Is integrity, accountability and transparency of public administration assured, e.g. by
means of quality management tools, auditing and monitoring of standards such as the
Common Assessment Framework of EU Heads of Public Administration?
The principle of legality within the state administration has been defined as a constitutional principle
in the Republic of Macedonia. Article 96 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) prescribes that
state administrative bodies perform the functions within their sphere of competence autonomously
and on the basis and within the framework of the Constitution and laws. The principle of legality has
also been determined as a basic principle in the Law on Organisation and Operation of State
Administrative Bodies (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 58/00 and 44/02). which
in Article 3 prescribes that state administration bodies carry out their competences as determined by
law in accordance with principles of legality, accountability, efficiency, effectiveness, transparency,
equity and predictability
From a normative aspect, the principles of integrity, accountability and transparency of the state
administration have been incorporated into several laws as explicit provisions.
The Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00, 112/00,
34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04, and 69/04), in its Article 2 determines that
civil servants carry out their official duties in accordance with the Constitution and law, in a
professional, politically neutral and impartial manner. The professional integrity has been supported
by principles of impartiality and autonomy in decision-making, free assessment of evidence and
protection of citizens’ rights and public interest, as determined by the Law on General Administrative
Procedure (“Official Gazette of SFRY” Nos. 52/56, 10/65, 18/65 - consolidated text, 4/77, 11/78,
32/78 - consolidated text, 9/86, 16/86, 47/86 -consolidated text and “Official Gazette of the RM”, Nos.
44/02)
In terms of implementation of principles of openness and transparency as well as citizens’
participation, the Law on Organisation and Operation of State Administrative Bodies prescribes that
the public is informed and consulted in preparation of laws and other regulations. As for the
administration's transparency, it has been a long practice in the Republic of Macedonia that the
administration offers explanation on an administrative act or decision. Law on General Administrative
Procedure contains detailed provisions on the content of the explanation as an integral part of every
decision. (for more details see also answer I_C_09)
The responsibility of the state administration and public services, institutions, public enterprises and
natural and legal persons that have been given public authorities, has also been implemented
through legal mechanisms of supervision by the executive government, higher administrative bodies,
courts, the Ombudsman and state and internal auditors. The Law on Prevention of Corruption

205/453

contains provisions defining the principles of legality (Article 3), confidentiality (article 4), equality
(article 5), transparency (article 7) and accountability (article 7) of the public administration. Pursuant
to the Law, and within its competences, the State Commission for the Prevention of Corruption
undertakes activities aimed at control and supervision of the public administration and the mode of
exercising of discretionary rights.
The control mechanisms and forms of accountability create conditions for eliminating or reducing the
possibility of abuse of official duty for personal gains, and they strengthen the responsibility for the
legal and conscientious execution of duties. The Law on Civil Servants contains special provisions on
disciplinary and material responsibility of civil servants.
The internal audit as an important control tool in a given institution, including financial and legal audit
of execution of duties, is important for the efficiency and quality in operation, for the process of
decision-making and for the prevention of irregularity and abuse of the position (Law on Internal Audit
– “Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 69/04). Given that the Law entered into force in
October 2004, there is insufficiency of by-laws that would precisely define the standards and
procedures. Albeit measures on promotion of the foregoing principles have been envisaged through
expert training of civil servants as well as through the annual process of evaluation of their work (that
shall be conducted in 2005 for the first time), more thorough activities on introducing instruments for
quality administration, audit and supervision of the standards such as the Common Assessment
Framework of EU Heads of Public Administration have not been undertaken within the administration
as those standards have still not been introduced in the Republic of Macedonia.
11. Do precise codes of conduct exist, which indicate what is and what is not allowed, and
which are subject to a permanent monitoring process?
Ethical standards are defined in detail in codes of conduct in several areas.
The Code of Conduct for Civil Servants (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 96/01
and 16/04) was adopted in December 2001, regulating civil servant’s conduct and work in order to
ensure adherence to the principles of legality, professional integrity, efficiency, and loyalty in carrying
out their official duties.
In order to observe the elementary principles and recommendations contained in the European Code
of Police Ethics, the Code of Police Ethics (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 3/04)
was adopted in January 2004. The Code regulates the behaviour, work and objectives of the police;
the legal grounds for police operation; the relation of the police and criminal judiciary bodies; police
organisation; the qualifications; the process of selection; police employment and training; the rights of
police employees; police interventions; police accountability and monitoring; police research; and
international cooperation.
In 1998, the Minister of Justice, pursuant to the provisions of the Law on Execution of Sanctions
(”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 3/97, 23/99 and 74/04), has adopted the Code
of Conduct for Officials Working in Penitentiary and Correctional Facilities, establishing that
employees must act in accordance with the Constitution, law and other regulations in the field of
execution of sanctions, conscientiously, responsibly and justly, without bias to convicts and
detainees.
In carrying out their duties, tax officers must adhere to the principles established in the Code of
Conduct for Tax Officers, adopted by the director of the Public Revenue Office in 2000, relating to the
obligation of the tax officer to carry out their duty objectively, timely, honestly and in accordance with
law, without abusing their official position to obtain property or other gain.
In performing their work and duties, employees of the Customs Administration act in compliance with
the custom regulations and the Customs Code, stipulating a standard and unified approach to each
party, without preference, taking bribe and abuse of official position.

12. Whistle-blowing – do clear rules and reporting mechanisms exist in both the public and
the private sectors?
With the adoption of the Law on Ratification of the Civil Law Convention Against Corruption (”Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 13/02), in accordance with Article 9 of this Convention,
the Republic of Macedonia undertook a commitment to provide in its legislation appropriate
protection against any unjustified sanction for employees reporting acts of corruption.
The Law on Prevention of Corruption (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 28/02,
46/04 and 83/04-consolidated text) contains several provisions serving to protect any citizen or
official reporting a punishable act.
One of the provisions is contained in Article 5, which stipulates that anyone is entitled to prevent or
report, without any consequence to himself/herself, an act that represents misuse of office, public
authorisations, official duty and position, whereby personal gain is obtained or another person is
harmed.
Article 18 provides for the possibility that twenty Representatives of the Assembly of the Republic of
Macedonia may pose a question for establishing accountability for corruption involving elected or
appointed high-ranking officials, authorised officials, responsible persons in public enterprises and
other legal entities managing state capital.
According to Article 19, upon the request of the State Commission for the Prevention of Corruption,
the person obliged to keep a state, military or another official secret may be relieved of such duty due
to engagement in a criminal or another procedure for an act of corruption.
Article 44 prescribes the obligation to report a corruption related punishable act. The right of citizens
and legal entities to lodge a complaint to the State Commission in the event of abuse of discretionary
rights has been provided for (Article 46), whereas Article 47 obliges the elected and appointed highranking official to report an offer of bribe.
The Law on Prevention of Corruption also regulates the issue of protection of collaborators of justice
and witnesses. In accordance with this law, a person who has reported data pointing to the
occurrence of corruption cannot be criminally prosecuted or otherwise held accountable, whereas a
person who has given a statement or who has testified in a procedure for corruption is provided with
protection in accordance with law. The person is entitled to compensation for the damages that may
be suffered by them or a member of their family due to the given statement or testifying (Article 20).
Furthermore, the law provides protection of persons working on the suppression of corruption by
stipulating that the persons working in the bodies for detecting and suppressing corruption are
ensured full protection and independence for the efficient performance of their authorisations and
duties, and that they must not be subjected to pressure in their work or in taking specific actions. The
persons notify the State Commission of any exerted pressure in their work or in their taking specific
actions, and regarding the pressure on the members of the State Commission in their work or in their

207/453

taking specific actions the State Commission notifies the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia
(Article 21).
13. Which measures are taken to raise awareness of corruption as a serious criminal offence
(e.g. campaigns, media and training)? Does the law contain provisions designed to prevent
corruption?
Raising Awareness on Corruption
The Government and other state authorities, as well as the State Commission for the Prevention of
Corruption undertake measures for raising awareness on the corruption as a serious crime. The civil
sector is also involved.
On 04.05.2004 the Ministry of the Interior has established an open free telephone line (#199) for
reporting corruption of Ministry’s officials, which has been advertised both in print and electronic
media. As of the establishment of this line there have been over 541 calls and all have been
examined.
Within the Surveillance over Criminal Procedures on Acts of Corruption Project, the Ministry of the
Interior and Transparency Macedonia have signed an Agreement on Cooperation in 2003 as well as
a Statement of Confidence.
In 2004, the Customs Administration has carried out the project titled Do you have something to
report? Within the project a free telephone line has been opened (#197) enabling citizens to report
smuggling, corruption and embezzlement in the operations of the Customs Administration. An
intensive public campaign in the print and electronic media has been carried out for the
encouragement of citizens to report any such activities of the Customs Administration.
Similary, the Public Revenue Office has established a free direct telephone line (#198) for reporting the
abuse of official duty, tax evasion or non-issuance of fiscal bills.
The Ministry of Justice within the Strengthening Responsibility Project has signed a Co-operation
Memorandum with Transparency Macedonia on 18.07.2003 on the joint drafting of the Law on
Access to Public Information and the Law on Conflict of Interests.
In addition, the non-governmental sector undertakes a number of measures aimed at the further
raising of the public awareness for the hazards from corruption. These measures have been aimed at
the efficient public involvement into anticorruption activities, by encouraging public reactions on the
decisions of executive and legislative authorities as well as through the monitoring of the court
authority. Most of these activities have been realised by Transparency Macedonia (a nongovernmental organisation), in co-operation with other non-governmental organisations (the
Association of Journalists in Macedonia, Forum Strategic Research and Documentation Centre
Macedonia, Macedonian Centre for International Co-operation, Open Society Institute-Macedonia,
etc., competent state authorities and international organisations and institutions.
Several books and brochures on corruption have been hitherto published. In addition, researches
have been conducted in the field of corruption tackling issues on the access to official information,
conflict of interests, etc.
One of the more significant initiatives of the civil society has been the establishment of the coalition
“Macedonia without Corruption”, comprising 75 active non-governmental organisations. In general,
the objectives of this project have been fulfilled. Many of the non-governmental organisations have
started preparing independent projects in the field of corruption and hold round tables and workshops
on a regular basis in the cities where they operate. In addition, the Local Anti-Corruption Cooperation project was realised concurrently with the above initiative.
In the course of 2003 and 2004 employees in competent state institutions have been more closely
informed upon the forms of corruption and how to identify it in terms of legal aspects. Thus joint

208/453

seminars by the State Commission for the Prevention of Corruption and the Public Prosecutor's
Office have been organised as well as a number of seminars on organised crime and on the
necessity of reforms of the judiciary, the public prosecution service, the penitentiary system, the
public attorney, BAR and notary service.
Legal Provisions on the prevention of corruption
Apart the organic Law on Prevention of Corruption (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
Nos. 28/02, 46/04 and 83/04 - consolidated text), there are provisions on the prevention of corruptive
conduct, conflicts of interests and incompatibility of posts in the Constitution and in a number of
sectoral laws and by-laws. Below are some examples of such constitutional and legal provisions.
The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia“, Nos.
52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03)in Article 63, paragraph 5 prescribes that holding other public
offices is incompatible with the office of a Representative of the Assembly, which is subject to
regulation by a separate law.
Article 83, paragraph 1 of the Constitution stipulates that the duty of the President of the Republic of
Macedonia is incompatible with the performance of any other public office, profession or position in a
political party.
As regards provisions related to the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, Article 89, paragraph
5 determines that the office of Prime Minister and that of a Minister is incompatible with performance
of any other public office or profession.
The Constitution also lays down provisions on the incompatibility of performing a judge’s office with
other public office, profession or membership of a political party (Article 100, paragraph 3); the
incompatibility of the office of a member of the Judicial Council of the Republic with the performance
of other public offices, professions or membership of political parties (Article 104, paragraph 5); the
incompatibility of the office of the Public Prosecutor with the performance of any other public office,
profession or membership of a political party (Article 107, paragraph 3); and the incompatibility of the
office of a judge of the Constitutional Court with the performance of other public office, profession or
membership of a political party (Article 111, paragraph 1).
Law on Election of Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette
of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 42/02, 50/02 and 46/04)) in Article 6 determines the
incompatibility of the office of an MP with the performance of other public offices and professions.
Thus, paragraph 1 of the same Article determines that the office of an MP is incompatible with the
office of the President of the Republic, Prime Minister or Minister, a judge in the Constitutional Court
of Macedonia, a Judge, Public Prosecutor, Ombudsman and other offices elected or appointed by the
Assembly and the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. Paragraph 2 stipulates that the office
of an MP is incompatible with the office of the Mayor or Council member of the City of Skopje.
Paragraph 3 determines that the office of an MP is incompatible with the performance of expert and
administrative duties in state administrative bodies. Pursuant to paragraph 4, the MP office is
incompatible with performing an economic or any other profit activity. Paragraph 5 determines that
the MP office is also incompatible with membership in steering committees of public enterprises,
public institutions, funds, agencies, institutes and other legal entities, as well as with an appointment
to represent state or public capital in trade companies.
The Law on Local Self-Government (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 5/02)
contains provisions stipulating that the municipal mayor during his/her term of office may not perform
any other profession (Article 52, paragraph 3). The Law also contains a separate Article (53) defining
the conflict of interests of the mayor: he/she may not be appointed as a member in supervisory,
management or control bodies in trade companies and public services and may not participate in the
process of decision-making on issues for which he/she personally or members of his/her family
(spouse, children or second-degree relatives) have a financial or any other interest. A similar
provision on the conflict of interests relates to the members of the municipal council (Article 44). They
may not participate in the process of decision-making on issues for which they personally or their

209/453

spouses, children or second-degree relatives have financial or other interests, nor they may make
decisions related to municipal public services if they are employed in these services. In addition, the
council member may not be employed in the municipal administration of the municipality in which
elected.
The Law on the Ombudsman (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 60/03) specifies
that the office of the Ombudsman is incompatible with the performance of another public office and
profession or with membership of a political party (Article 8).
The Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
38/04) determines that the public prosecutor and his/her deputy may not perform duties incompatible
with their office (Article 49, paragraph 2). The office of the public prosecutor or a deputy public
prosecutor is incompatible with the office of an MP, a member of a municipal council and the City of
Skopje, and with other offices in the state administration, local-self government and the City of
Skopje, as well as with performance of other public office or membership of a political party (Article
50). The performance of any other public office and profession may be grounds for dismissal of the
public prosecutor or/and his/her deputy. As regards the prevention of corruption, Article 44 of the Law
determines that a public prosecutor may not be a person whose spouse, first-degree or collateral
relative to a second degree is a public prosecutor or a deputy public prosecutor in the same or higher
public prosecutor’s office covering the same region or in the Public Prosecutor's Office of the
Republic of Macedonia. At the same time, Article 51 specifies that the public prosecutor and his/her
deputies may not receive gifts or use services offered by parties that have a direct or indirect interest
in the procedure of the public prosecutor’s office.
The Law on Civil Servants (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00, 112/00,
34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04, and 69/04) in Article 18 stipulates that the
civil servant is obliged to perform his/her duties professionally, conscientiously, efficiently, carefully
and in a timely manner, in accordance with the Constitution and law. Paragraph 2 underlines that the
civil servant is obliged to perform his/her duty impartially and without the influence of political parties.
Moreover, the civil servant may not be guided by his or her political convictions or personal financial
interests and may not abuse competences and the status he/she has been given as a civil servant.
Article 68, paragraph 1, item 10 of the Law on Civil Servants sanctions the receipt of gifts or other
benefits and defines it as disciplinary violation.
The Civil Servants Code of Ethics (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 96/01 and
16/04) contains provisions related to the prevention of conflict of interests. Therefore, Article 3,
paragraph 2 of this Code determines that the civil servant may not be guided by a wrong, unjustified
or unreasonable factual situation in decision-making as a result of conflict of interests. Article 5
regulates the use of authorities and status of a civil servant and prescribes that he/she is obliged to
avoid any type of conflict of interests as well as situations that may lead to suspicion in conflict of
interests. Article 8 specifies that the civil servant may not allow his/her personal financial interest to
come into conflict with his/her position and status as a civil servant. The term financial interest does
not only denote personal gains of the civil servant, but also gains of his/her family, relatives, friends,
or natural and legal persons with whom he/she has conducted business. In addition, the civil servant
may not accept co-operation with persons or organisations that have had business interests with the
administrative body in which the civil servant is employed. Article 9 of the Code (which further
elaborates Article 68 of the Law on Civil Servants) specifies that the civil servant may not request or
accept gifts, services, aid or any other benefit that may corrupt his/her professional conduct. Article
10 prescribes that the civil servant is obliged to use state funds cost-effectively. For more details on
provisions pertaining to the status of civil servants, their independence, recruitment, career structures
and rewarding, which are important prerequisites for the prevention of corruption, see answer
I_C_06.
The Law on Internal Affairs (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.19/95, 55/97, 38/02,
13/03, 33/03 and 19/04) envisages that employees with special duties and authorities in the Ministry
of the Interior may not perform activities that are incompatible with their duties. The Police Ethics

210/453

Code (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 3/04), adopted pursuant to the Law on
Internal Affairs, contains provisions for the prevention of corruption. Thus, Article 21, paragraph 2
determines that police members may not be placed in financial or any other dependence on other
persons or bodies. In addition, police members may not use official authorities to gain personal
profits (paragraph 3).
The Customs Administration Law (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 46/04)
contains provisions regulating the performance of additional activities by customs officers (Article 60),
which in particular stipulate that customs officers may not perform any other duty or activity related to
gaining profits and which is in breach of their official duty or activity. They may not be members or
partners in trade companies or members in management or supervisory boards of trade companies.
Additionally, customs officers may not be guided by personal financial interests; may not abuse
authorities and their position in performance of duties; may not use privileges and exemptions; nor
they may accept material or other gains in the line of duty. They are obliged to act in accordance with
the Code of Conduct of the Customs Administration.
Article 1 of the aforementioned Law on Prevention of Corruption specifies that the law stipulates
measures on prevention of corruption in exercising power, public authority, anti-corruption measures
against legal entities in their performance of activities of public interest as well as prevention of
corruption in the private sector..
Provisions in this Law also determine measures against conflict of interests.
Chapter III of this Law related to prevention of corruption in the line of duty contains several
provisions determining the prohibited activities of elected or appointed officials, official or responsible
persons in public enterprises and other legal entities managing with state capital in the course of their
duties. The provisions in this Chapter also specify that appointed or elected officials, or responsible
persons in public enterprises are prohibited to perform duties incompatible with their office.
Article 30 proscribes the acceptance of gifts.
Another important obligation stipulated by the Law concerning the prevention of corruption is the
obligation of an elected or appointed official or an official person in a public enterprise, institution or
another legal entity managing state capital to report his/her property or the property of his/her family.
This obligation also applies in the event of changes in property status.
Article 28 specifies that an elected or appointed official or another official person who within three
years from the cessation of his/her term of office founds a trade company, or conducts a for-profit
business activity in relation to his/her previous post, must notify the State Commission.
Provisions that essentially relate to anti-corruption are those in Article 29 (prohibition of acquiring
shareholder rights); Article 30 (prohibition of influencing decisions regarding employment of close
relatives); Article 33 (abuse of public procurement procedures) as well as in other articles.
The prevention of conflict of interests has especially been regulated in Chapter IV providing several
articles that regulate the legality of performance of an elected or appointed official, an official or
responsible person in a public enterprise, as well as any legal entity managing with state capital.
Thus, it has been clearly prescribed that when a conflict of interests exists between the public and
personal interest, the responsible person is bound to act in accordance with the public interest;
whereby it is considered that a conflict between the personal and the public interest exists when the
performance between an official and other action affects the financial or other interests of persons
subjects to this Law or interests of their family members. In the event of circumstances implying
conflict of interests or if doubts have been raised over the impartiality in decision-making or in the
course of undertaking a certain official and other action(s), the official person is excluded from the
performance of the respective action(s). In addition, the Law prescribes that if a superior gives an
unlawful order, the official person must notify the administrative bodies or the State Commission for
the Prevention of Corruption lest the superior continues to give such orders after he/she has been
warned by his/her subordinate. Pursuant to the Law, every bearer of public office, an official person

211/453

or responsible person in a public enterprise, institution or other legal entity managing with state
capital, must report a corruption-related crime.
The provisions of this Law also prohibit any form of influence. If these prohibitions have been
violated, each citizen disposing of such information is obliged to notify the State Commission.
Grounds for filing a submission to the State Commission may also be a reasonable doubt that in the
course of execution of a discretionary authority the decision has been brought due to corruption. With
regard to anti-corruption measures, the Law prescribes that any bribe offers must be reported. In the
event of corruption charges, the person charged notifies the administrative body which has elected or
appointed him/her without delay as well as his/her superior and the State Commission. The Law also
determines that any legal matters or particular decisions that have been adopted as a result of
corruption are not legally valid, .i.e. they are considered null and void. A party that has been injured
as a result of corruption is entitled to indemnity.
Law on Associations of Citizens and Foundations (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”
No. 31/98) also contains provisions related to conflict of interests. Thus, pursuant to this Law,
associations of citizens and foundations may not perform political activities or use their property and
assets for the accomplishment of political goals (Article 3). In case of a violation of this provision the
association of citizens or foundation is terminated (Article 56).
For more details on the provisions pertaining to prevention of corruption in politics see answer I_E_05.
14. Are there clear and transparent rules on financing of political parties, social partners and
other interest groups? Are these entities subjected to external financial control in order to
avoid conflicts of interest between their representatives, public officials and the private
sector?
Article 20, paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic
of Macedonia“, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) guarantees the freedom of association of
citizens to exercise and protect their political, economic, social, cultural and other rights and convictions.
According to the constitutional concept, political parties are citizens’ associations and their funding is
carried out within political activities.
The Law on Financing of Political Parties adopted by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia in
October 2004 (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 76/04) regulates the modes and
procedures for obtaining financial recourses and disposing of them for current operations and activities.
The Law also regulates the modes of the financial and material control of political parties.
The financing of political parties is public and transparent, and they are provided by public and private
sources.
The public sources of financing are funds from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, municipality
budgets and the Skopje City budget. The Law prescribes that the total amount for the annual financing of
political parties shall be 0.06% of the total original revenues of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia.
They may only be used for the party’s goals as prescribed by the laws, statutes and other regulations of
the political party.
Up to 30% of the funds for the political parties secured from the central budget are allocated evenly to
parliamentary and non-parliamentary political parties that have won at least 1% of the votes at the last
parliamentary elections in the Republic of Macedonia or at the last local elections in the local self
government unit.
Up to 70% of the funds for political parties from the central budget are allocated to parties whose
candidates have been elected MPs in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, proportionally to the
number of their MPs. The same applies to political parties whose candidates have been elected as

212/453

mayors and councillors in municipalities, proportionally to the number of their councillors. The funds are
allocated every three months, upon Guidelines adopted by the Minister of Finance.
Private sources for financing of the political parties comprise membership fees, donations, gifts,
contributions, subsidies, sponsorships, endowments, sale of promotional and propaganda materials and
individual incomes. The membership fee amount for a period of one year, for each member, may not
exceed the average wage of the preceding year. The political parties may receive donations in a form of
money, material funds or services. They may also receive non-monetary donations if, according to the
statute, they can be used for the party’s activities. The total amount of every single donation may not
exceed 200 average wages when coming from legal entities, and 100 average wages when coming from
an individual in Macedonia, where the average wage is the one paid in the month prior to the donation.
This amount may not be accumulated more than once a year.
The political parties maintain a Register on donations including data on every donor's name, type and
value of donations and date of granting. The political parties are required to publicise the register of
donations. The political parties may not conduct business and may not acquire incomes other than those
from deposit interests, leasing the party’s premises, incomes from sale of print, audio-visual and digital
publications and propaganda materials, and incomes from sale of tickets for party events.
The political parties may not receive funds from: foreign governments; international institutions; bodies
and organisations of foreign states and other foreign persons; state and local bodies other than budgetary
funds (except funds as stipulated in the election laws); public enterprises, public institutions, funds and
other legal entities managing with state capital; public enterprises, public institutions and public funds
founded by municipalities; enterprises with at least 20% state capital; public institutions including those in
the process of privatisation; private enterprises which at the moment of donating funds for the political
party carry out public services on behalf of state bodies or institutions, enterprises and funds by way of
agreement; associations of citizens and religious communities; enterprises with mixed capital funds
where a dominant owner is a foreign investor and anonymous or unidentified sources. The political
parties may not keep funds in foreign banks or other financial institutions outside of the Republic of
Macedonia.
The supervision over the financial and material operations of political parties is conducted by the Ministry
of Finance and the State Audit Office. Pursuant to legal regulations, political parties submit their annual
account of financial operations to the Ministry of Finance, the Public Revenue Office, the Central Register
and the State Audit Office.
The political parties prepare an annual financial report for the preceding year not later than 31 March, and
submit it to the State Audit Office.
The Law prescribes sanctions for the entities that do not abide by determined norms and rules on the
amount of funds granted to political parties and for the political party and the responsible person; for not
preparing and submitting a report to competent bodies.
The Law on Prevention of Corruption prescribes that the financing of political parties, trade unions or
associations of citizens is public and they may not collect funds in cash from unidentified sources.
The Law also prescribes that political parties, unions or associations of citizens, during election
campaigns, may not be funded from budgetary funds, public funds or funds of public enterprises and
public institutions or legal persons managing with state capital, unless otherwise determined by law.
New investments and extraordinary payments during all election campaigns are also prohibited, unless
these funds have been previously allocated for that specific purpose i.e. unless a previously determined
programme is being realised. Extraordinary payments are extraordinary payments of salaries, pensions,
social welfare or other payments from the Budget, or public funds.
The State Commission for Prevention of the Corruption has the authority to undertake measures when
there is a suspicion of abuse of budgetary or public funds during an election campaign. If these
suspicions are well founded, the Commission shall inform the responsible authorities.

213/453

The State Commission for Prevention of Corruption within three months from the day of closing the
elections shall submit a report to the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia on possible abuses of
budgetary and public funds, and funds from public enterprises and other legal entities managing with
state capital. The report shall also be published in the media.
At least 20 Representatives of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia may initiate control on
possible abuse of budgetary and public funds, for which, pursuant to Article 76, paragraph 4 of the
Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, a permanent survey commission shall be set up.
A political party, union or association of citizens may be fined if they collect funds in cash or from an
unidentified source. Subject to fine shall also be the responsible person in the legal entity.
The Law on State Audit was adopted in 1997 and was amended in 2001, 2003 and 2004 (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 65/97, 70/01, 31/03,19/04 and 73/94- consolidated text). In
order to avoid conflict of interests between the political and public positions and the private sector the
amendments of the Law on State Audit adopted in 2003 have introduced the external state control (audit)
of political parties funded by budget funds.
The Social partners of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, organised on a voluntary basis in
unions, are autonomous in expressing and representing their members’ interests as well as in building
relations with state bodies and other institutions.
The right to union organisation derives from Article 37, paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of
Macedonia pursuant to which citizens have the right to establish trade unions in order to exercise their
economic and social rights.
The trade union organisation has been regulated in a separate Chapter of the Law on Labour Relations
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 80/93, 3/94, 14/95, 53/97, 59/97, 21/98, 25/00,
34/00, 50,01, 25/03 40/03 and 80/03 - consolidated text). Pursuant to Article 84, paragraph 3 of the Law,
accession to trade unions is subject to conditions determined by the Statute.
The Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00, 112/00, 34/01,
103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04 and 69/04) that regulates the status, rights, duties and
responsibilities of civil servants, also regulates the question of trade union organisation . Pursuant to
Article 26 of this Law, in order to exercise their economic and social rights, civil servants may constitute
trade unions and may become their members under conditions and mode determined by law. According
to the Law, a civil servant, apart from other responsible bodies, may also appeal to the trade union for
protection in exercising his/her rights related to his/her employment.
According to provisions found in the statutes, the trade unions in order to perform their functions provide
financial resources from membership fees, gifts, contributions, sponsorships and other sources. The
amount of the membership fee which is obligatory is determined in percentage from the net salary. The
highest body of the trade union adopts a decision on how the membership fee shall be allocated
The financial and material operations of the trade unions are carried out in accordance with legal
provisions. A Supervisory Board comprising members of trade unions shall perform the control on
financial and material operations. Supervisory board members may not be members of the Assembly or
Presidency of the Union. These solutions ensure a full autonomy and impartiality of the bodies
established to perform duties assigned by the trade union.
Pursuant to Article 61, paragraph 1 of the Law on Associations of Citizens and Foundations (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 31/98) non-governmental organisations and foundations may
acquire objects, finances and property rights. These funds are obtained from membership fees,
contributions, and donations, and may be used in accordance with the Statute and a law.
The associations of citizens and foundations may receive funds from the Budget of the Republic of
Macedonia, the local self-government budgets and from the budget of the City of Skopje. Budgetary
funds may only be acquired on the basis of a previously prepared program (project) by the associations of

214/453

citizens and foundations which must be approved by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, i. e
by the responsible ministries, or councils of local self-government units and the Council of the City of
Skopje.
Article 63 of the Law on Associations of Citizens and Foundations determines the body that shall perform
control on the inappropriate use and command of funds and incomes of the citizens’ associations and
foundations. The body that performs control comprises of members of the citizen's association or
foundation that are elected in a manner determined by the statute. Every member has the right to require
inspection on the expenditures of the funds and incomes in a mode determined by the statute.
The financing of non-governmental organisations and foundations from the Budget of the Republic of
Macedonia is made on a regular basis through allocation of funds under special item. Funds are
distributed pursuant to the Decision on the Criteria and Procedure for Distribution of Financial Assets to
Associations of Citizens and Foundations from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette
of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 60/00).
The allocation of the funds is realised in a transparent manner, through a public announcement published
in the media annually.
The applicants to the public announcement have to submit the following documents: an annual
programme; a list of completed projects and programmes for the previous year; financial support by
associations of citizens and foundations determined by the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia; a
project proposal for the current year financing; statute and registration permit; a report on received funds
for the preceding fiscal year from the Ministry of Finance and modes of their implementation; and an
approval for their own financial participation in the implementation of project proposals and programmes.
The allocation of the budgetary funds for associations of citizens and foundations is conducted by the
Government upon the proposal of a special committee established for that purpose. The decision of the
Government of the Republic of Macedonia is published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia.
15. Do effective codes of conduct, and other measures enhancing corporate social
responsibility, exist for the private sector to prevent corrupt practices?
In the last several years, in the Republic of Macedonia there has been a growing interest on the issue
of social responsibility, primarily in terms of preventing corrupt practises. The role and position of the
private sector in preventing corrupt practices has been considered and concrete initiatives and
approaches are being defined.
The initiative for drafting the Code of Ethics in Good Corporate Governance and the Code of Ethics in
Business, arising from the new Company Law (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
28/04) is aimed at strengthening the responsibility of managers and corporate governance. The
development of these Codes of Ethics for companies in order to prevent corruption and encourage
companies to contribute to the society they operate in is a step to be undertaken in the forthcoming
period.
The new Law on Securities will enable greater competitiveness at the capital market in the Republic
of Macedonia in terms of offering brokerage services, as well as a greater transparency in the work
not only of banks and brokerage firms that participate in the capital market, but also of joint stock
companies with specific reporting obligations, the management bodies’ members, general managers,
and the individual share holders. This Law inter alia envisages that large foreign brokerage firms may
open branch offices in the country. In addition to creating greater competitiveness at the stock
markets in the country, the new Law will facilitate significantly higher level of transparency in the work
of stock market institutions.
The aforementioned Codes of Ethics considered as “soft law” are expected to be adopted in the
course of 2005

215/453

The contents of the Codes of Ethics would be along the following lines:
− Prohibition of bribery (receiving and giving bribes) and other forms of corruption, such as for
example tax evasion;
− Development of internal investigation and reporting systems on this issue;
− Publishing reports on the level of corruption and the actions undertaken for its suppression.
Lack of such reports would imply that the company is not dealing with corruption;
− Transparency of companies in respect of contracts, licences, financing election campaigns,
etc, and fully transparent payment of taxes;
− Creating incentives encouraging conduct in accordance with laws, such as for example
promoting employees for such law abiding conduct;
− Preventing engagement of local subjects by foreign companies to do "dirty business" , that
would mean only transfer of the blame for corrupt practise;
− Allocation of funds for support of civil society organisations which promote the rule of law and
anti-corruption.
The experiences and activities of the Macedonian Chamber of Commerce and Amcham, and the
activities at the Faculty of Economics at the Ss. Cyril and Methodius University could serve as an
illustration of certain initiatives and activities which in the wider sense are related to the issue of
advancing corporate social responsibility for purposes of preventing corrupt practices in the private
sector.
The Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of Macedonia is involved primarily in training and
promotional activities. One of such activities is the promotion of the Code of Ethics in Business
Activities - Association of Balkan Chambers (ABC), Macedonia being one of the founding countries
(1994).
The Chamber is conducting these activities by periodical publishing of the Code of Ethics in its
publications, in the weekly publication – the Bulletin, and in the monthly publication of the Economic
Magazine.
Another institution is the Court of Honour (established in 1990) responsible for protection of good
business practices in the work of the Chamber members, as well as for prevention of activities of
unfair competition and monopoly conduct at the market. In respect of education and prevention
activities in the private sector, under the regional project Trade and Transport Facilitation in South
East Europe - TTFSE, initiated by the SECI (South East European Cooperation Initiative), financed
by the World Bank and by the US Government, the Chamber of Commerce has organised 48
seminars, elaborating 3 modules within one seminar: Business Ethics and Corruption, Foreign Trade
Operations and Transport Operations, Customs Transit Procedures.
These interactive seminars and the operative manual have been prepared by the Chamber of
Commerce of the Republic of Macedonia as the host of MAKPRO –SECI –National Pro-Committee,
engaging lecturers-practitioners, specially trained for these seminars at the Koc University in Istanbul.
A total of 954 participants have been covered with the training, 794 entrepreneurs from 657
companies and 160 customs officers from 14 cities.
The Module Business Ethics and Corruption has the following thematic units: A-Business Ethics and
B –Corruption. Finally, under the same Project the Chamber of Commerce/MAKPRO, using software
designed by the World Bank, continually conducts an anonymous surveys (among its members,
companies dealing with international trade, transport and shipping), about the efficiency and
corruption of the border crossing points, departments of ministries, and other agencies at border
crossings, authorised for issuance of relevant export-import documentation. The survey is a useful
indicator of the situation, and a tool promoting anti-corruptive conduct.
In the Republic of Macedonia the concept of corporate social responsibility is relatively new, and in
terms of education, the first time it has been elaborated in details was at the beginning of 2002.
Students and professors of the Faculty of Economics at the University of Ss. Cyril and Methodius

216/453

participated in the Future Leader’s E-Conference on Corporate Social Responsibility. One of the
main issues discussed at the Conference was the relations between corporate social responsibility
and corruption. A total of 1122 young people from 100 countries worldwide participated in this six
week on-line conference. Macedonia, according to the number and quality of its participants, was
ranked 10, preceded by Japan and followed by Canada. Today, the concept of corporate social
responsibility is part of the curricula of several subjects studied at the Faculty of Economics in
Skopje.
16. When did the Republic of Macedonia become a member of the Council of Europe Group of
States Against Corruption (GRECO) and what measures have been taken to implement
GRECO recommendations?
The Republic of Macedonia has been a member of the GRECO (Group of States against corruption)
since 06.10.2000. It was the 26th GRECO country to be examined in the First Evaluation Round. The
evaluation team visited the Republic of Macedonia in March 2002, after being provided by Macedonian
authorities with a reply to the Evaluation questionnaire.
The visit resulted with an Evaluation Report of the Republic of Macedonia (adopted on the 12th GRECO
General Meeting, 9-13.12.2002, Strasbourg), containing recommendations for government institutions.
In order to implement the recommendations contained in the Report, the Republic of Macedonia
undertakes a range of activities in the fields of legislation and institutions. The Progress Report on the
Harmonisation and Implementation of the Recommendations of the First Evaluation Report of the
Republic of Macedonia was adopted on the 21st plenary session of GRECO held in Strasbourg on
29.11.2004 – 02.12.2004.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Justice has delivered the reply to the second GRECO Questionnaire and
the second monitoring visit to the Republic of Macedonia also took place (06-10.12 2004). A number of
meetings between representatives of government and non-government institutions, among which:
representatives of the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of the Interior, the Customs
Administration, State Audit, the Public Revenue Office, representatives from the judiciary and
prosecution, the Civil Servants Agency, Transparency Macedonia, the Chamber of Lawyers, the Judges
Association of the Republic of Macedonia, the Prosecutors Association of the Republic of Macedonia, the
Centre for Continuous Education of Judges and others took place.
The priority topics of the visit were proceeds of corruption, legal entities and corruption, public
administration and corruption.
Concerning the commitments of the Republic of Macedonia, in accordance with the recommendations of
the GRECO evaluation team, the Republic of Macedonia ratified the Criminal Law Convention on
Corruption (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 32/99) and the Civil Law Convention on
Corruption of the Council of Europe (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 13/02) and has
signed the Additional Protocol to the Criminal Law Convention on Preventing Corruption (15 May 2003).
The Law on Prevention of Corruption (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 28/2002) was
also adopted, and the Law Amending the Law on Prevention of Corruption (”Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 46/04) provides: raising the degree of autonomy and independence of the
State Commission and enhancement of its role in the protection of persons working on suppression of
corruption and protection of the members of the Commission.
In November 2002 the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia elected the members of the State
Commission for Prevention of Corruption, which has both a preventive and a supervisory role and it is
autonomous and independent in carrying out its competences.
In June 2003 the Commission adopted the National Programme for Prevention and Suppression of
Corruption, containing recommendations on the necessary measures and activities to be undertaken in
order to establish an efficient mechanism for prevention and suppression of corruption. An integral part of
the anticorruption programme of the State Commission is the Action Plan containing measures to be

217/453

undertaken in short, mid and long-term by the competent authorities for preventing and sanctioning
corruption.
Along with these activities, and in accordance with the recommendations of the GRECO team, the
necessary amendments to Article 17 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia were adopted on
26.12.2003, whereby, the use of special investigative measures was allowed in criminal investigations for
the most serious criminal offences, including corruption, but only upon a court decision, under conditions
and in a procedure established by law and if this is necessary to prevent or reveal criminal offences, for
conducting a criminal procedure, or when it is required by the interests of the security and defence of the
Republic.
The preparation of the new Law on Interception of Communications is underway in order for the new
constitutional provision to obtain its legal regulation. These legal amendments will be followed-up with
appropriate training and appropriate technical equipment for police officers, prosecutors, investigative
judges and judges.
In order to create and above all implement a comprehensive legal framework precisely defining measures
for witness protection, establishing a procedure for interviewing collaborators of justice and other
witnesses whose identity is known only to the competent judicial body, in accordance with the GRECO
recommendations, the following activities are undertaken:
The new amendments to the Law on Criminal Procedure (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
No. 74/04) provide a new chapter entitled Protection of Witnesses, Collaborators of Justice and Victims
(Article 270-a, 270-b). These provisions enable the public prosecutor, i.e. investigative judge or council
chairman to undertake actions in the course of the procedure to ensure efficient protection of witnesses,
collaborators of justice and victims if they appear in the procedure as witnesses when there is a danger of
them being exposed to intimidation, threat with revenge or danger to their life, health of physical integrity,
or when their protection is necessary.
The new text of the Draft Law on Witness Protection, which is in Parliament procedure, is toward the
implementation of the provisions contained in the Law on Criminal Procedure.
Towards implementing one of the GRECO recommendations, is the new Law on the Public Prosecutor’s
Office (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.38/04) which present the legal base for the
establishment of the Unit for fight organised crime and corruption, within the Public Prosecutor’s Office of
the Republic of Macedonia (Article 29 of the Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office). The Unit has been
established and it acts for crimes for which prosecution is undertaken ex-officio and which have been
committed by an organised group of at least three persons working for a certain period for the purpose of
obtaining direct or indirect financial benefit or another kind of material benefit, and which commits one or
more crimes, as well as for other crimes for which a prison sentence of at least four years is prescribed by
law. The department is responsible to act before basic courts on the entire territory of the Republic of
Macedonia.
The Law on Financial Police (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 55/2002) confirm the
competence of the Financial police for investigating suspicious agreements as a form of corruptive
behaviour.
As regards the GRECO recommendations concerning the issue of immunity, they are not
implemented as their realisation imposes amendment to the existing constitutional solution. Namely,
the issue of which person and under which conditions enjoy immunity is regulated by the
Constitution.

F. INTERNAL SECURITY
1. Please describe the structure of the security forces, including possible paramilitary forces.
To what extent have paramilitary forces that existed during the crisis of 2001 been
dismantled? Please explain when and how this has been done.
According to the Law on Organisation and Operation of the State Administrative Bodies (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 1/95, 55/9758/00 and 44/02) and the Law on Internal
Affairs, (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 58/00 and 44/02) the Ministry of the
Interior is responsible for the internal security of the State.
The relevant structures of the Ministry of the Interior are:
I. Bureau for Public Security
The operations in the system of public security under the competence of the Bureau for Public
Security are carried out through police officers with special duties and authorities (authorised officers)
and civil servants without Police authorities. These operations are structured in the border and
criminal Police, organised and authorised for the following issues:
1) Department for Police comprising the Sector for Public Order and Peace; Road Traffic Safety
Sector; Special Task Unit and the Rapid Deployment Special Unit.
Pursuant to Article 1 of the Law on Internal Affairs, operations regarding the maintenance of public
order and peace, the regulation and control of road traffic, the security of lakes and other operations
falling under the authority of the Police.
The Special Task Unit–established in 1981 is engaged in all security cases and events when regular
Police Units are not capable to fully respond to complex tasks in the fight against terrorism, hostage
situations, countering armed resistance, providing security for VIPs and public facilities and supports
the fight against organised crime. Currently, this unit consists of 220 members from the ranks of
authorised officers of the Ministry as well as cadets from the Police Academy. The new organisation
of the unit that was introduced on 01.11.2004 envisages the reduction of its members to 183.The
new formation composition entails command, three operational groups, shadowing and surveillance
team, negotiation team and a group for planning, support and logistics.
The Rapid Deployment Unit has a task to support exclusively police units on the territory of the
Republic of Macedonia. Its tasks also include fight against organised crime in rural areas and
securing the public order and peace. The unit has been trained to independently perform high-risk
police operations in different environments, as well as temporary duties in operations of surveillance,
patrolling and apprehending in rural areas. Rescue missions in mountainous regions as well as
rescue missions during a natural disaster are also within the competencies of this unit.
2) Department for Border Police
The Department for Border Police performs operations regarding the protection of the state border;
border crossing control; detecting and resolving border accidents and other violations of the state
border, as well as other operations as determined by law.
3) Department for Criminal Police

Chapter I

Political Criteria

Since January 2005 a Department for Organised Crime has been established.
II. Directorate for Security and Counter-Intelligence
Pursuant to Article 13 of the Law on Internal Affairs, the Directorate performs operations related to
the protection from espionage, terrorism and other activities aimed at the endangering or destruction
of democratic institutions, established in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of
Macedonia. The Directorate also has authorities in the protection from more severe forms of
organised crime.
The ongoing police reform through the implementation of the Strategy and the Action Plan, has
resulted in phased restructuring of the Police forces (for more details see I_F_05, I_F_07)

In the course of the crisis in 2001 and in a complex security situation in the country, the President of
the Republic of Macedonia issued a Decision for Establishing a Temporary Unit for Fight Against
Terrorism. Similarly, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia adopted a Decision for the
Establishment of а Special Task Units for the Prevention and Fight Against Terrorism in Macedonia,
incorporating units of the Army of the Republic of Macedonia designated by the President of the
Republic with a special decision and Police units designated by the Minister of the Interior with a
special order. Pursuant to these decisions, the Minister of the Interior has brought a Decision for the
Establishment of a Police Battalion for Rapid Intervention of the Ministry of the Interior by the act Sc.
No. 16.1-4475/1 of 06.08.2001, which establishes the Police Battalion for Rapid Intervention,
comprising members of the Special Police Unit, Regular police officers and Reserve Police members.
The Battalion for Rapid Intervention – the Lions, as an internal organisational form of the Sector for
Special Units, within the Department for Police of the Ministry of the Interior, was introduced in
September 2001, in accordance with the Rulebook Amending the Rulebook on Systematisation of
Posts in the Ministry of the Interior SC. No. 16.1/5091/1 of 05.09.2001. Pursuant to the changes in
this Rulebook SC. No. 16.1-6239/1 of 07.11.2001, its name was changed into a Rapid Intervention
Unit – Lions, as an independent internal organisational form of the Department for Police.
The procedure for the establishment of this Unit had been carried out contrary to the legal acts and
by abusing the Decisions of government institutions. Most of the persons incorporated in the Unit had
not been members of the Special Police Unit or members of either the regular or reserve composition
of the Police. They had voluntarily joined the Police for the protection of the sovereignty and the
territorial integrity of the Republic of Macedonia.
With the Decision for transformation of this unit, (No. 3/1 of 27.01.2003 adopted by the Government
of the Republic of Macedonia), the Decision for the Establishment of the Special Task Unit - the Lions
became null and void, as well as all acts adopted on the basis of the Decision (the Decision for the
Establishment of a Police Battalion for Rapid Intervention of the Ministry and the Order for the
Designation of the Ministry’s Units to Enter into the Temporary Joint Unit for the Fight Against
Terrorism). The Decision for transformation of this unit, also provided for the reassignment of its
members (those already employed in the Ministry of the Interior) into the organisational units of the
Ministry, was followed by a procedure before established commissions in the Ministry. These
commissions took into consideration all relevant factors for every employee in accordance with the
existing laws and on the basis of received consent for secured funds for such reassignment. Persons
included into the Unit without a valid employment contract were required to surrender all arms and
equipment as well as vehicles and uniforms in property of the Ministry. They were also asked to
leave the facilities of the Ministry. Measures were stipulated for persons not obeying such orders in
accordance with the provisions of the Decision and existing laws. Pursuant to this Decision, 430
members of the former Unit – the Lions were reassigned to regular police services throughout the
country; 200 were reassigned to positions in the Army of the Republic of Macedonia, and the rest
were discharged of the equipment and dissmissed. Thus, the process of dismantling was finalised.

220/453

2. Is there currently a permanent police presence throughout the country?
The Ministry of the Interior is organised on a territorial principle. It performs its law-enforcement
authority through twelve Sectors for Internal Affairs as regional organisational units within the
Ministry. They include a total of 123 Police stations. Such organisational structure allows Police
presence on the entire territory of the Republic of Macedonia.
The institutions of the Republic of Macedonia are enforcing the state legal system on its entire
territory.
In the period following the 2001 crisis, the Ministry of the Interior faced cases of deteriorated security
situation in certain regions of the country, manifested with citizens’ lack of confidence in the
institutions of the system, in particular, in the police. In that context, in accordance with the Principal
Plan for Return of the Security Forces in the Crisis Regions and Establishment of Control Over these
Regions, activities were undertaken for gradual stabilisation of the security situation and creation of
pre-conditions for return of the internally displaced persons.
The implementation of the Principle Plan, which started in October 2001, was completed by
12.07.2002, despite certain resistance and protests by the local population. This was achieved
through phased return of the Police in these regions and by consolidating citizens’ confidence. In
regions with population of mixed ethnic origin, police patrols were of multi-ethnic composition.
Coordinator of all activities stipulated by this Plan was the Coordinating Body for Crisis Management
within the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, which carried out its function in cooperation
with the Ministry of the Interior, the Army of the Republic of Macedonia, local authorities and
international missions to Macedonia.
The positive trend towards full establishment of the rule of law in the former crisis regions and the
significant decrease in the number of incidents continued in accordance with the Plan for Police
Conduct after the Implementation of the Principal Plan. A set of measures was stipulated with this
Plan for continuation of the confidence-building activities between the Police and the local population.
In addition, the Plan expressed the commitment for joint action in resolving everyday problems so
that the citizens would restore confidence in the institutions of the system.
This was especially important in cases when citizens, living in the crisis regions, and in particular in
certain areas close to the state border with Serbia and Montenegro, in the part towards Kosovo, were
blocking roads, mostly in order to create pressure to fulfil their requirements for resolving
infrastructural problems. In addition, the Ministry had to deal with a number of criminal gangs
composed of criminals from the Republic of Macedonia and abroad, that remained as remnants of
the conflict of 2001 terrorising the local population.
In these cases, the Ministry resolved the issues in a satisfactory manner for the citizens, by providing
support to the local authorities through everyday contacts with them and by respecting and
guaranteeing citizens’ rights. In doing so, the Ministry emphasised the obligation of all citizens to
exercise their rights and fulfil duties in accordance with the laws and regulations.
By acting in this manner, the Ministry of the Interior has attained the goal of being permanently
present among citizens, guaranteeing their personal security, security of their property and promoting
the quality of policing, i.e. becoming a true citizens’ service.
3. What percentage of police officers/members of the security forces are from ethnic
minorities? If available, please provide a breakdown of such figures by rank and seniority.
Adhering to the provisions of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, the Ministry of the Interior has
accelerated the dynamics of employment of members of non-majority ethnic communities. A number
of public vacancy announcements have been publicised for the employment of Police trainees, civil
servants and for employment of persons with a higher education degree into the Criminal Police and
the Directorate for Security and Counter-Intelligence.

4. What measures have been taken to ensure the return of the police to the former crisis
areas? What measures have been taken to consolidate the rule of law in the former crisis
areas?
Security forces of the Republic of Macedonia, being guided by the commitment for comprehensive
implementation of the 2001 Framework Agreement which brought resolution to the crisis, after the
completion of the operation “Essential Harvest”, and in order to ensure phased return of the security
forces, including in particular return of the Police, have envisaged numerous measures and activities,
which were part of the Principal Plan for Return of the Security Forces in the Crisis Regions.
During the preparation of the Plan, officials from the Ministry of the Interior and the Army of the
Republic of Macedonia had numerous meetings with the representatives of the international
community in Macedonia, including representatives of OSCE, EUMM and NATO Forces (“Amber
Fox”), in order to determine an optimal plan for gradual return of the security forces in the
settlements. The plan resulted in re-integration of these regions into the territorial integrity of the
country and the re-establishment of the sovereignty, thus enabling free movement of people and
return of the internally displaced persons.
The basic guiding principles for the Ministry of the Interior in this process were the following:
coordination, transparency, legality, responsibility, gradual implementation, and flexibility. These
principles served as a basis for restoration of confidence between the population in these areas and
the Police. The gradual implementation became a basic methodological principle for implementation
of the Principle Plan. Principle coordinator of all activities stipulated by the Principle Plan has been
the Crisis Management Coordinating Body within the Government of the Republic of Macedonia,
which carried out its function in co-operation with the Ministry of the Interior, Army of the Republic of
Macedonia, local authorities and international missions to Macedonia.
The Draft Principle Plan for Return of the Security Forces of the Republic of Macedonia in the Former
Crisis Regions was submitted for review and approval by the Government. The Government adopted
the Plan on 04.12.2001 and it became the framework of measures and activities for the security
forces in their return to these regions. Upon a proposal by the working group comprising
representatives of the Ministry of the Interior and the Army of the Republic of Macedonia, the
representatives of the international community supported the approach that, prior to the initiation of
the gradual return of the security forces, mixed ethnic patrols (with Macedonians and Albanians)
carrying only personal arms – handguns and batons, test the implementation of the Principle Plan in
five villages. Previously, a Pilot Plan was prepared for entering these five villages (Lešok and Tearce
in the Tetovo region, Grušino in the Skopje region and Lopate and Opae in the Kumanovo region) on
the basis of a thorough security analyses that had been previously carried out in these villages.
Once it was determined that the security situation in these five villages was stable and allowed a
secure entry of Police and international community’s representatives, it was decided that the Police
would return to these villages. The return was successful and proved the value of the concept for
gradual return of the Police in the crisis region, as set forth in the Principle Plan.
The Principle Plan stipulated return of the Police in three phases:
− First phase: entering into settlements (villages) assessed as the most stable ones;
− Second phase: entering into villages with disturbed security;
− Third phase: entering into villages with more complex security situation;

Each of these phases was implemented within specific timeframe, within the stipulated six subphases of measures and activities:
First sub-phase (information and preparations):
− Media campaign;
− Establishing co-operation with non-governmental organisations;

223/453

−
−
−

De-mining of accessing roads;
Assessment of the villages’ status (in terms of the phase in which respective village is to be
included);
Deciding on the patrols' structure;

Second sub-phase (entering):
− Entering the villages;
− Establishing contacts with villages’ leading personalities and initiation of co-operation with the
population;
− Start of patrolling;
− Identification of initial problems;
Third sub-phase (patrolling):
− Evaluation of damages and threats posed by unexploded mines and explosives;
− Coordination with the non-governmental organisations’ activities;
− Extension of the patrolling duration (extended presence of Police patrols in the villages)
− Enforcement of traffic control (without taking full legal measures – only warning and pointing
to problems);
− Establishment and start of operation of contact offices for direct communication between
citizens and the Police);
− Preparations for the establishment of Police stations;
− Fourth sub-phase (regular Police duties):
− Investigation and reporting on criminal actions;
− Policing over 24-hour period;
− Removal of Police checkpoints and their substitution with ethnically mixed Police patrols;
− Fifth sub-phase (broadened Police duties):
− Investigation of incidents during late hours;
− Establishment of regional Police stations;
Sixth sub-phase (24-hour Police patrols without presence of the international observers).
After completing the tasks and measures stipulated by the Principle Plan, the Ministry of the Interior
has continued its activities and measures for consolidation the rule of law in the former crisis regions.
This set of measures was stipulated in a separate document - Plan for Police Conduct After the
Implementation of the Principle Plan. The Plan envisaged continued actions aimed at building
confidence between the Police and the local population, as well as a commitment for joint efforts to
resolve certain difficulties in order to restore citizens’ trust in the institutions of the system.
Contribution in this regard was provided by the Community Policing Project under which advisory
groups for citizens were established, in which Police officers were ensured with active participation.
Large number of Police facilities in the crisis regions were damaged or fully destroyed in the military
activities, so there was emerged need for their reconstruction that would enable a 24-hour Police
presence in the villages.
Therefore, the Police facilities have been reconstructed and have been put into operation.
Construction of a number of new Police stations is in the final stage. Hence, the conditions for
policing in these regions will be improved.
5. What are the main elements of the reform of the security forces?

224/453

Since its independence, the Republic of Macedonia has been developing the national security
system on the basis of its national interests, in order to respond to the new challenges in the security
environment of the Republic of Macedonia.
The design of the internal security system is based on the constitutional principle of the rule of law,
and is conditioned by the clearly expressed orientation towards adhering to European standards in
the area of Justice and Home Affairs. At the same time, the design of the system of internal security
has been strongly influenced by the internal political conditions and the transition changes, which
have significantly modified the risks and threats to which the security systems should respond.
On the basis of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia from 1991, a transformation of the
internal security system has taken place, which resulted in intensive legislative activities in the years
following the independence. A legislative reform has been undertaken – of the criminal, substantive
and procedural legislation (Criminal Code, Law on Criminal Procedure), of the laws regulating the
operation of the competent administrative bodies (Law on Internal Affairs, Law on Organisation and
Operation of the State Administrative Bodies) and of other laws regulating this area. The basic
direction and feature of the overall reforms are the strengthening of democratic institutions in the area
of security, primarily strengthening the guarantees and mechanisms for protection of human rights
and freedoms and ensuring democratic control over the security forces.
In the process of development of adequate security capacities of the Republic of Macedonia, the
distinction between the basic elements in the system of public and state security (intelligence and
counterintelligence) is of particular importance.
In parallel with the adoption of the Law on Internal Affairs in 1995(“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 19/95, 15/97, 55/97, 38/02, 13/03 and 33/03) the Law on the Intelligence Agency
was adopted (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 19/95), which created formal and
legal conditions for establishment of the Agency. Its basic purpose is collecting data and information
of significance for the security and defence of the Republic of Macedonia. Part of the employees of
the Ministry of the Interior, who worked in the former State Security Service, and some of employees
in other services as well were transferred as staff in the Intelligence Agency.
The National Security and Defence Concept (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
No.40/03) identifies the risks and threats against the state security, and, inter alia, clearly establishes
the foundations of the internal security policy.
The established internal security policy has imposed the need of a new Police structure. It includes
establishment of the border Police, i.e., transfer of competences for control and securing of the state
border (“green border”) from the Ministry of Defence to the Ministry of the Interior, then establishment
of a new organisation and operational methods to combat crime and suppress all its forms, especially
the trans-national crime, and also changes in the relations between the Police and the public, for the
purposes of joint action aiming at crime prevention.
Reforms in the Police of the Republic of Macedonia
One of the central issues is needs assessments and defining the basis for a modern model of Police
organisation which comprises the competences of the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of
Macedonia and a shift in their focus following the new democratic processes.
Therefore, the Ministry of the Interior developed a Strategy for Police Reforms, which is a basis for
establishment of a new organisational structure and methods of operation of the Police.
The Strategy for Police Reforms was adopted by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, at
its session of 11.08.2003 (with annexes adopted in October 2003 and January 2005), defining
precise obligations which the Ministry of the Interior must fulfil in the process of transformation of the
existing model of Police operation.
The Strategy for Police Reforms has identified the basic strategic objectives:

225/453

−

Efficiency in the Police operation, through activities aiming towards maintenance of the public
order and peace, reduction of the crime rate, institutionalisation of crime prevention, and
coordination of activities with other institutions, agencies and with the public;
− Fight against organised crime, i.e., ensuring adequate and effective approach to this problem,
in conformity to the UN Convention against Trans-national Organised Crime and its Protocols,
as well as the relevant standards and best practices of the European Union;
− Planning, development and education of the personnel, aiming towards increased efficiency in
performance of the functions, through establishment of forms and various levels of education
and training in the Police Academy, as well as establishment of an appropriate mechanism for
human resources management, with a special emphasis on the selection and recruitment of
appropriate professional staff, its development and promotion at the Ministry of the Interior;
− Equitable representation of persons belonging to communities which do not constitute the
majority in the Republic of Macedonia, in the context of ensuring a harmonised framework for
the future of the democracy in the Republic of Macedonia, and enabling development of
closer and better integrated relations between the Republic of Macedonia and the European
structures, by designing a recruitment employment policy which enables the Police services in
general to reflect the composition and distribution of the population in the Republic of
Macedonia;
− Improved organisation, professionalism and cost-effectiveness in the operation, which
requires precise legal definition and distinction of the activities between the criminal Police
and their competence at the central, regional and local level, through establishment of
relevant control and cooperation; responsibility and motivation of the employees by providing
autonomy of the regional organisational units with transfer of part of the competences;
technical and technological equipment with modernisation of the communication systems and
forensic laboratories;
− Enhancement of the regional and international cooperation, through the existing
organisational units, aiming towards implementation of the activities and obligations based on
the established international relations;
− Function of the Police as a service for the public, which implies transformation of the Police
from a “force” into a “service” and bringing it closer to the public, as well as applying
“community policing”, with joint action of the Police and the citizens in resolving the security
problems and implementation of confidence building measures by way of equitable
representation of
non-majority ethnic communities within the Police structure and
establishment of the so-called “non-police functions” in order to implement the principles of
pragmatism, efficiency and cost-effectiveness and improvement of services that certain
organisational units within the Ministry of the Interior offer to the citizens, in the area of various
status related rights, aiming at their transfer to the competence of other ministries or bodies.
Furthermore, special emphasis is placed on the development of regional cooperation, which is also
stressed in the National Strategy for European Integration, in the Chapter on Justice and Home
Affairs.
The development of the Strategy for Police Reform was supported by the European Commission
Justice and Home Affairs Team (ECJHAT), as well as on a project basis (CARDS). Significant
support in the implementation of the Police reforms is ensured through the presence of and
cooperation with the EU Police Mission in the Republic of Macedonia, PROXIMA.
The primary objectives established in the Strategy for Police Reforms are the full transformation of
the Ministry of the Interior and the establishment of new organisational structure (see: 24_Annex_04).
This structure is oriented towards efficient performance of the tasks, in conformity to precisely
determined level of functioning (strategic, operational and tactical). Therefore, in order to ensure
efficient implementation of the basic principles of modern Police operation, pursuant to the Strategy
of Police Reforms, the Ministry of the Interior will be composed of:

226/453

−

−
−

Services responsible for coordination, international cooperation and public relations of the
Ministry, as well as establishment of the general directions for implementation of activities of
the Ministry of the Interior;
Bureau for Public Security consisting of services of advisory nature, in charge of strategic,
conceptual planning and establishment of the general directions and operational standards;
The operational services (Central Police Services, Border Police and Regional Police
Services) in charge of the operational tasks of the Ministry of the Interior, by implementing
specific activities and actions, aiming towards implementation of the basic functions of the
Ministry of the Interior

Directorate for State Security and Counterintelligence
On the basis of the analysis of the document, and having in mind the objectives of the Police reform
process, as well as the need to precisely distinguish between its competences and the competencies
of certain organisational units that have functions related to the system of public security, it has been
concluded that it is necessary to adequately restructure the Directorate, and especially some of its
organisational units. Therefore, the Ministry of the Interior has established a special Working Group,
which works on restructuring of the Directorate for State Security and Counterintelligence, and
especially on precise establishment of the competences and of the cooperation between the
Directorate for State Security and Counterintelligence and the Bureau for Public Security.
Additional element of the reforms is development of coordination within the Police, but also
establishment of mechanisms for coordination with the other law enforcement services.
Police Academy
The Police Academy is a state-financed higher education institution in the area of security, educating
personnel for the needs of the Ministry of the Interior, other state authorities, as well as other
organisations, institutions and legal entities performing activities in the area of security. It establishes
a modern and comprehensive system of personnel education, as well as for acquiring higher
education, professional degree – specialist, academic degree – master, and academic degree –
doctor of sciences, as well as continuous education of persons who have already acquired a degree.
Transparency in the process of implementation of Police reforms
In the framework of the overall process of Police reforms, the Working Group for Implementation of
the Police Reforms, respecting the principle of transparency, works on the implementation of an
appropriate information campaign. The employees at the Ministry of the Interior and its regional
organisational units have been informed about the process of Police reforms at regular working
meetings with the representatives of the Working Group. At the same time, they are actively involved
in the process of implementation of the activities within the working bodies and structures of the
Working Group. In that manner, a special information bulletin, for the employees at the Ministry and
its regional organisational units, is published. As envisaged, the information bulletin will be regularly
updated and distributed in the future stages of the implementation of the Police reform process.
Furthermore, the basic data and information related to the Strategy for Police Reforms are available
at the web-site of the Ministry of the Interior, and regular press conferences are conducted, as well as
organised panel debates for the employees at the Ministry and the general public.
Reforms in the Army of the Republic of Macedonia
The transformation of the system of national security requires parallel and complementary legislative
and implementation activities in the systems of the defence and internal security. Such activities have
been directed towards clear identification of the competences of all entities, as well as towards
coordination and cooperation to ensure integrity of the entire system of national security. The

227/453

Defence Law (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 42/01 and 05/03) established in
detail the competences and obligations of all entities in this area, as well as the deployment of the
Army for civilian purposes. The participation of the Army in international missions is also defined in
this Law.
On the basis of Article 36, paragraph 5 of the Law on Government of the Republic of Macedonia,
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 59/00), the Government of the Republic of
Macedonia, at its session of 10.05 2004, adopted the Programme for Transformation of the Defence
and the Army of the Republic of Macedonia (Strategic Defence Overview, Stage III, Skopje, May
2004), on the basis of which the Army of the Republic of Macedonia is transformed into a more
efficient military force, capable of defending the country from all potential threats. In this respect, the
fight against terrorism, along with the primary task to defend the territorial sovereignty and integrity, is
a fundamental task of the Army. Main elements in the Army reform in the long run are creating forces
capable of responding to the new security challenges upon the territory of the Republic of
Macedonia, as well as enhancing the capacities for active contribution towards the collective security
systems.
On the basis of the available resources, a new structure of forces of the Army of the Republic
Macedonia has been developed, envisaged to be operational and completely professional as
01.01.2008. The number of commands and units has been reduced, which presupposes reduction
the personnel of the active forces – from 12.858 to 7696, and of the reserve forces form 16.000
4.850 persons.

6. How is police primacy in dealing with internal security ensured? What is the legal
framework and how is it implemented? What arrangements exist for calling up army
resources under police command in specific crisis situations?
The supremacy of the Police in dealing with the internal security is established in the legal system of
the Republic of Macedonia, as well as in the adopted strategic documents.
The competence of the Ministry of the Interior established by law clearly locates the role of the Police
in the internal security of the state.
Pursuant to the Law on Organisation and Operation of the State Administrative Bodies (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 58/00 and 44/02) the Ministry of the Interior performs
the activities related to the enforcement of the system of the state and public security.
The Article 1 of the Law on Internal Affairs (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
1//95, 55/97, 38/02, 33/03 and 19/04), defines the role of this body as aiming towards protection of
life, personal security and property of citizens, prevention of crime, detection and apprehension of
perpetrators of criminal offences and their hand over to the competent bodies, protection of human
rights and freedoms, guaranteed by the Constitution, prevention of violent destruction of the
democratic institutions established by the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia.
The same Law defines the competences in the area of maintenance of public order and peace,
prevention of incitement to national, racial or religious hatred or intolerance, securing of certain
persons and facilities, regulation and control of traffic on the roads, and other issues related to the
traffic safety, protection of the state border, control of crossing of state border and stay inside the
border zone, residence and movement of aliens, establishment and resolution of border incidents
and other violations of the state border, placement, control and maintenance of the marks
demarcating the borderline on land and water.
Regarding the rights and duties of the Ministry of the Interior in the area of defence, the personnel of
the Ministry, with regards to performance of military and other obligations in the area of defence, are,
as a rule, military deployed within the Ministry of the Interior.

228/453

Pursuant to the Law, in circumstances of war or state of emergency, for protection of the security in
the Republic of Macedonia or maintenance of the public order and peace when it is violated to a
greater extent, the Ministry calls upon persons with a military deployment schedule and working
obligations at the Ministry, i.e. members of the reserve forces, which are deployed within the Ministry
for as long as the reasons due to which they were called upon last.
Pursuant to the Defence Law, the President of the Republic of Macedonia, who is also the Supreme
Commander of the armed forces, enacts documents for the use of the Army and issues the orders for
the use of the Army.
On the other hand, the Law establishes that the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, orders
the use of the Police in the state of war, as support to the Army.
The Defence Law (Article 40) also regulates the participation of the Army in the removal of
consequences of state of emergency, whereby the order is issued by the President of the State,
while the instructions on the manner of participation are issued by the Minister of Defence.
The National Concept on Security and Defence (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
40/03), identifies the security risks and threats, as well as areas and instruments of the national
security policy. The Concept also establishes the policy of internal security, while the system of crisis
management is especially elaborated, in which respect the focus is placed on the coordination aimed
at relevant assessment, prevention and resolution of specific crisis situations.
The Strategic Defence Review (enacted in October 2003) in relation to the treatment of the
implications of the internal security policy on the defence policy, prescribes an obligation for the
Ministry of Defence and the Army of the Republic of Macedonia to plan the provision of support to the
civil authorities, as well as to participate in deterring the risks and threats against the internal security
of the Republic of Macedonia. Here, especially terrorism is identified as a risk for which mutual
support is necessary. Furthermore, it is established that the Army of the Republic of Macedonia
provides support to the activities of the Police in dealing with such threats, placing its forces and
capacities, intelligence infrastructure and the specialised personnel at the disposal of the Police.
On the basis of the aforementioned strategic national documents, further improvement to the national
legislation are foreseen, aiming at establishment of precise solutions for action in specific crisis
situations.
7. Is there an Action Plan for the reform of the Police, including proper budgetary allocations?
What is its stage of implementation?
The Government of the Republic of Macedonia adopted the Action Plan for the Implementation of
Police Reform on 10.01.2005.
The development of the Action Plan was entrusted to the Strategic Body for Management of the
Police Reform Process, composed of officers of the Ministry of the Interior from various services.
There are several subgroups which work on certain aspects of implementation of the reform process.
It is worth mentioning that the original version of the plan was finalised in January 2004, but due to
the need of additional harmonisation, especially within the Project for Police Reforms, the adoption of
the Action Plan by the Government had been postponed. Additionally, harmonisation of several
ongoing projects in support to the reform process was needed. However, considering that many
tasks were already established in the Strategy and the Draft Plan, the implementation of the defined
activities was carried out in parallel with the finalisation of the document.
The Action Plan contains: the implementation concept, the fiscal impact analysis and the foreseen
activities, grouped by areas.
The foreseen activities are the following:

229/453

Identification and operational development of the competences of the organisational units within the
Ministry of the Interior, establishment of the internal organisational structure of the Ministry oriented
towards efficient performance of the professional obligations and description of the jobs, as well as
building an information structure appropriate to the strategic needs of the process of management,
operational planning and management of the tactical operations and objectives
Implementation status:

Rulebook on the Organisation and Operation of the Ministry and the Rulebook on the
Systematisation of Posts.

Identification of needs to modify the legislation, aimed towards creating the necessary legal
prerequisites for operation of the police and the methodology of operation (adoption of new, as well
as amending the existing legislation necessary for the successful implementation of the reform), as
well as establishment of procedures regulating the relations and procedures between the
organisational units on the one hand and approximation of the national legislation to the EU acquis in
the area of home affairs and its implementation within the legal system of the Republic of Macedonia,
on the other hand;
Implementation status:
−

The complete legislation necessary for the implementation of reforms has been identified and
it envisages the adoption of new laws and by-laws and amending the existing ones. The timeframe for the adoption of the laws has also been defined (all should be adopted in 2005);
while the by-laws shall be adopted six months after the respective laws have entered into
force. There are approximately 100 pieces of legislation.
− The Law on Weapons (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 7/05) and the Law
on Personal Data Protection (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 07/05) have
been adopted.

adequate formal, legal and institutional capacities aimed at operational development of the activities
in this area and ensuring adequate and effective dealing with this issue, in conformity with the
European standards and experiences (establishing of a precise definition of the notion of organised
crime, reorganisation of the structure and the functions, strengthening of the research capacities, as

230/453

well as establishment of the organisational units in charge of the fight against the organised crime,
and strengthening of their capacities);

carried out in two groups;
The Department started to operate on 24.01.2005.

Defining the material and technical means (finances, logistics and facilities) necessary for the
implementation of the reform, and analysis of the spatial, material and technical needs of the
organisational units within the new organisational structure, according to the previously established
status of affairs in the Ministry regarding this issue, as well as the financial calculation for material
and technical equipping and for facilities, i.e., establishment of projects for material and technical
equipping and for facilities and defining the specific priorities in this segment.
Implementation status:
−
−
−

An analysis of the spatial, financial and technical resources has been conducted;
An assessment for the necessary equipment has been made on the basis of the current state
and the exigencies of the reform process
An assessment of financial implications has also been made.

Full implementation of the document Strategy for Police Reforms is expected not later than the end of
2005, whereby specific timeframe was determined to implement the necessary steps in individual
segments.
A system of monitoring of the implementation of the Action Plan was envisaged, according to which
the Ministry of the Interior will inform the Government of the Republic of Macedonia about the
implementation of the Plan, each six months.
In this area, the establishment of the institutional cooperation between the Ministry of the Interior and
the relevant ministries and institutions in the state is of special importance, in order to provide for
efficiency in the operation and coordination of activities between these institutions. The
aforementioned activities are supported by the obligations based on the document “Concrete
Measures-Activities for Fight Against Organised Crime”, adopted by the Government of the Republic
of Macedonia and supported by the Council of the European Union, with the participation of the
Ministry of Justice, the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia, the courts, the
Ministry of Finance, the Customs Administration, the State Committee for Prevention of Corruption,
and the Associations of Judges and of the Prosecutors.
Fiscal impact of the police reforms process
The implementation of the police reform process will have a fiscal impact, and the Ministry of the
Interior undertakes specific steps to determine it precisely. Namely, according to the established
parameters to determine the financial means necessary for the implementation of the police reforms
(total number of population, basic elements of the new organisational structure in the Ministry of the
Interior, in conformity with the Police Reforms Strategy, the number of present personnel at the

231/453

Ministry, personnel needed according to the new organisational setup, etc). The Ministry of the
Interior has prepared a global fiscal impact analysis of the process of general improvement of police
services, the cost of which is assessed between 100.000.000 and 120.000.000 EUR.
These financial means would be necessary for the supplying of the Ministry of the Interior with
modern and sophisticated equipment, provision of adequate premises, and procurement and
equipping of the police with adequate IT equipment and software, telecommunications equipment,
instruments for the forensics, special equipment for the special investigative techniques, modern
transport vehicles, personal, protective and other specific equipment; building, upgrading, repair and
leasing of facilities; equipping of the facilities and education of the personnel.
Taking into consideration the establishment of the Organised Crime Department as the first priority in
the process of police reforms implementation, a fiscal impact assessment of the priority needs of
material and technical means for 2005 was made, amounting to 39.300.000 EUR.
Part of the finances necessary for the implementation of the police reforms process are provided by
budgetary allocations of the Republic of Macedonia, whereby in parallel the Ministry of the Interior will
work on initiating and implementing specific projects through the programmes and instruments of the
European Union and on a bilateral basis.
8. What measures have been taken to ensure an increased awareness within the security
forces of issues such as human rights, non-discrimination and community policing methods?
In accordance with Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (Chapter 2 Fundamental freedoms and rights of the individual and the citizen), citizens of the Republic of
Macedonia are equal in their freedoms and rights, regardless of gender, race, skin colour, ethnic or
social origin, political and religion beliefs, or property and social status. Within the Police reform
training, the Ministry of the Interior has set a priority task to train members of Ministry in issues
regarding human freedoms and rights. The training “Human Rights and Police” is implemented
through three-day seminars for employees in the police departments within the Ministry of the
Interior. The Ministry, with the assistance provided by the OSCE and Helsinki Committee for the
Protection of Human Rights, since 2002, has trained 4150 Police and criminal Police members,
which constitutes 47,50% of the total number of Police officers.
For the successful implementation of the training, the Ministry uses specialised manuals prepared by
both the Ministry and the OSCE, as well as those prepared within the Council of Europe’s project
“Human Rights and Police 1997/2000”. In the framework of “Human Rights and Police” training,
encompassed are issues of Non-Discriminatory Policing and Democratic Execution of Police Duties.
The seminars cover also the following educational topics:
− Introduction in human rights;
− Treatment of general human rights issues and police conduct;
− Deprivation of freedom (arrest) and detention;
− Use of force;
− Matters that must be taken in consideration prior to interrogation;
− Fair trial and presumption of innocence;
− Non-discriminatory policing;
− Arbitrary intrusion in private life;
− Democratic implementation of Police duties;
− Policing in a multiethnic society and
− Police ethics.
Issues related to human rights are included in the curriculum of the Police Academy through the
educational topics and as a separate subject within the higher education. The Human Rights and
Police training has been implemented on four levels through the process of basic and specialised

232/453

training, management training and through a separate subject, in co-operation with experts from the
Ministry of the Interior, Police Academy, OSCE and other institutions in Macedonia.
The Ministry of the Interior has also been implementing expert training of its police officers based on
the Pre-service and In-service Training Programme (No. 192-37872&1 from 24.11.1998) that is still in
force. As a result of amendments to many laws and by-laws regulating the operations of Police
stations and departments, a need emerged for a new Programme on Additional Professional Training
and Specialisation of Police employees. Senior officers have selected thematic units subject to the
Programme's implementation, based on contents that they believe are current and important in their
work.
The new Programme, after its reviewing and inclusion of the relevant suggestions by the Workgroup
for Police Reforms within the Ministry of the Interior, was adopted in December 2004 and submitted
for implementation in the Ministry’s organisational units.
The Programme aims to provide curricula for a continuous and expert training of police members in
Police Stations and Police Departments for the purpose of the successful implementation of duties
within the Bureau for Public Security. The Programme encompasses provisions and thematic
contents with regard to Police conduct (laws and by-laws), with emphasis in practical application of
legal authorisation (Police tactics). Furthermore, the Programme includes special physical training
concerning motor function capabilities as well as combined elements in wrestling sports and skills
adapted for the Police (self-defence, karate, judo, boxing, and other sports).
Non-Discriminatory Policing and Democratic Execution of Police Duties are special topics within the
additional training for all Police members.
The establishment of multiethnic Police forces has been a step forward in raising the awareness of
Police regarding non-discriminatory conduct and differences among citizens. The challenge,
necessity and inevitability of operating in multiethnic environment has made multiethnic Police units,
through every-day communication with colleagues and citizens, understand the sensibility of nondiscrimination and the necessity of equal treatment of citizens while enforcing police authorities.
Co-operation between Police and citizens has been a commitment of the Ministry of the Interior,
which resulted from the strategic goal of the Republic of Macedonia to approximate to European
standards in all areas, including security.
The Ministry of the Interior, in accordance with its legal authorities and in co-operation with
international organisations, following the successful implementation of the Principal Plan for Return of
the Security Forces in the Crisis Regions, the return of the majority of internally displaced persons
and the return of security forces after the establishment of interim Police stations with multiethnic
patrols, has carried out large-scale and intensive activities in mutual confidence building and
partnership between the Police and local population.
As a result of discussions and identification of Macedonia's needs, numerous recommendations
regarding communication, partnership, recommendations for media, etc. have been adopted and
later on used in conferences in the former crisis regions: Kumanovo, Skopje, Tetovo and Gostivar.
The concept is being carried out through Citizens’ Advisory Groups, which held regular meetings on
local level, municipality, area, village, etc, among official representatives (mayors, civil society, nongovernmental organisations, local media, religious communities, local population, local offices of the
ministries’ or local institutions), OSCE field offices' representatives and local Police representatives.
These meetings are a long-term formal forum where issues and problems of mutual interest are
discussed, thus agreeing on measures for resolution of those problems and looking for local solutions
to local problems, which is an achievement of the whole community, regardless of political or ethnic
affiliation.

233/453

In addition, Advisory Groups as a simple form of co-operation with local population should enable the
Police to carry out all of their duties, thus promoting it as a service that, depending on citizens'
expectations and needs, builds a more secure environment, i.e. a service open, transparent and
accountable to citizens.
At the meetings, the Police have elaborated on the amendments to the Criminal Code; the action on
voluntary hand over and collection of weapons; as well as human rights issues and Police conduct in
relation to human rights.
Given the new approach of Police conduct, Citizens' Advisory Groups have been envisioned as a
partnership concept that shall strengthen relations between citizens and Police, as well as improve
communication, exchange of information and the overall quality of living.
Once the concept of the Advisory groups has been accepted, the Ministry of the Interior has
appointed 32 community policing officers. These officers are from the Internal Affairs Sectors in
Skopje, Kumanovo, Tetovo, Gostivar, Ohrid, Veles and from Internal Affairs Sections in Struga and
Debar, who were provided with modular training by the Ministry and the OSCE's Police Development
Department.
The training encompassed three modules (chapters), carried out as formal training in a classroom,
while the fourth part of the training was carried out through a one-week professional specialisation in
selected Police stations in the Netherlands.
The implementation of these measures began after 15.09.2002, and the groups' effective operations
started in the second quarter of 2003, when Citizens’ Advisory Groups in Skopje, Tetovo, Gostivar,
Kumanovo, Ohrid, Veles, Struga and Debar were established by local representatives, community
policing officers and representatives of the Ministry on central and local level, in co-operation with
OSCE field teams.
Having in mind that the aforementioned areas were former crisis regions, most of the discussions at
the beginning of Advisory Groups‘ operations have been related to the need of communication and
co-operation between the Police and local population, aimed at resolving problems related to interethnic distrust.
During the initial meetings, discussions have mostly been focused on security issues and certain
problems of local population related to Police enforcement measures (such as arrest without warrant,
cases of abuse of persons detained for interrogation in Police stations, etc.). At the same time, local
citizens have requested employment in the Police in order to build mutual confidence and enable the
Police patrol in all areas. Even though the co-operation between Police and local population was still
not satisfactory in the first half of 2003, citizens have expressed support to Police actions against
notorious criminals and criminal groups, which was also subject of discussion at Citizen Advisory
Groups' meetings in 2004.
Discussions at such meetings do not carry the burden of post-crisis problems anymore, but are rather
focused on actual local problems and current events. Hence, the Police have provided information on
legal provisions related to the organisation of the early presidential elections and measures they have
undertaken. With regard to current problems, participants at meetings proposed solutions and
security measures that need to be undertaken in the regions. The Police have presented statistics on
crime rates and information on the most common types of burglaries and robberies in the area, and
exchanged opinions with local population on how they may contribute to the prevention or resolution
of such crimes.
9. Please describe how coordination between municipal councils and the local heads of police
is carried out. Are there any problems of coordination in practice?
The Ministry of the Interior is organised on a territorial principle, which means that it carries out its
operations of law enforcement through 12 Internal Affairs Sectors operating as regional units of the

234/453

Ministry. The Internal Affairs Sector IS on a territorial basis and is a territorial service for direct
enforcement of police operations. The Government upon the proposal of the Minister of the Interior
determines the seat and territory of each Sector. The Internal Affairs Sector has been defined as an
operational organisation of the Ministry and is vertically connected to it, while the sectors co-operate
on a horizontal level and are organised on the basis of the region’s size, population, number of
criminal offences and misdemeanours, and other criteria. The Sectors are managed by Heads.
In accordance with the Law on Local Self-Government (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 05/02), the implementation of the decision on appointments of local Heads shall
begin following the local elections in March 2005.
Pursuant to Article 36 of this Law, the Council appoints a Head that administers the Ministry’s local
branch. In accordance with Articles 20-a and 20-b of the Law Amending the Law on Internal Affairs
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/02), the local head of police is elected by
Municipal Councils which fall under the jurisdiction of the Ministry’s local branch, from a list
containing at least three candidates proposed by the Minister. At least one of the candidates must
belong to the community that represents the majority population in the municipalities.
If the Councils of respective municipalities do not select any of the candidates within 15 days from
the day of the proposal, the Minister shall propose a second list that contains at least three new
candidates among whom at least one must be from the majority community in the municipalities.
If after the second procedure a candidate is not elected, within 15 days from the submission of the list
of candidates, the Minister, in consultation with the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, shall
appoint the local head of police either from the candidates on the two previously proposed lists or
from three other candidates proposed by the Councils of interested municipalities.
The Minister shall retain his/her authority for the dismissal of the local head of police in accordance
with the Law.
The Local Police Head shall inform interested municipalities on a regular basis and upon their
request about issues related to public security and road traffic safety.
The municipal councils and local police heads shall co-operate through contacts and meetings on
issues concerning the security situation of the region under the respective jurisdiction, public peace
and order, traffic, and other current problems related to infrastructure and utilities.
Practical experiences demonstrate certain coordination problems between municipal councils and
local police heads, especially during security forces’ attempt to return to crisis regions after the
security crisis in 2001, and in the course of the implementation of ”new approach” concepts of
confidence building between the police and local population.
With the continuous development of the concept of co-operation between the police and citizens in
confidence building, in defining local problems and in reaching joint solutions for them, citizens’
advisory groups have a key role in raising awareness on the need of co-operation. In this manner,
some of the problems have already been resolved.
10. What percentage of the police force has received further training over the last 5 years? Is
such training obligatory? What is the average amount of training and where and by whom is it
offered?
The on-going training of the employees in the Ministry of the Interior is carried out on several levels
and in several different forms. The training objective is to create a profile of police capability and
culture, as well as a high level of initiative, professionalism and speciality in executing the police duty.
The Police Code of Ethics adopted in 2003 establishes that the police training, in accordance with its
objective and competences, is based upon the principles of democracy, rule of law and respect of

235/453

human freedoms and rights, as well as principles of fighting racism and xenophobia (Articles 26-30).
The basic training of the police officer is open and transparent to the society, at the same time
accompanied by regular training within the service. If there is a need, a special training in security
management (management in training), is provided.
The Police Academy of the Republic of Macedonia is the only institutional form of police education.
The Law on the Police Academy (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No 40/03)
regulates the training of personnel for the Ministry and other government bodies, as well as for other
organisations, bodies and legal entities that operate in the field of security – articles 2 and 3 of the
Law. Hence, the Academy provides training for the following:
−
−
−
−

Acquiring a four year university degree;
Acquiring a one year vocational degree of a specialist;
Acquiring a two-year master’s degree;
Continued education of persons with an already acquired degree in other institutions:
elementary police education and training; special education and training; and education and
training in security management.
− Acquiring a Ph.D. degree.
The Police Academy carries out its activities on two educational levels: university education and
continuous education. University education is divided in graduate (four-year studies) and postgraduate (vocational and academic studies). In addition, the Academy provides continued education
of persons with already acquired degree by providing elementary police education and training,
special education and training, and education and training in security management.
The elementary police education is a two-year academic programme, including six months of
practical field training, while the length of special and management courses depends on their
programmes. The Police Academy provides courses in basic police training from 6 months to 1 year
with the following contents:
− Police duty in democratic society and legal framework;
− Police conduct and legal framework;
− Criminalistics and criminology;
− Defence techniques (self-defence) with basic physical training and skill testing;
− General education (Macedonian language and orthography; foreign language, information
technology, telecommunications and first aid);
− Weapons handling; shooting and bivouacking;
− Practical drills and field training;
− Current issues in police conduct improvement.
The target group of the foregoing training are persons with a secondary education degree (not older
than 25).
The subsequent course is Basic Training of Border Police for a period of three months that can be
divided in the following curricula:
− Basic police training;
− Criminology;
− Police conduct and defence police techniques.
The target group of the foregoing training are persons with a secondary education degree and
already employed in the Army of the Republic of Macedonia.
The third course is Police Border Management Training covering basic training in police, legal,
criminology and management areas. The lectures at this course are given by senior officers from
regional border police centres, and target groups are members of the army’s border brigade.

236/453

The fourth course is a one-week training of Instructors for the police reception on the ground.
At the time being the Police Academy conducts training in the framework of the police’s continued
education, with courses in basic training (for a period of 12 months of which 9 months of training
takes place at the premises of the Police Academy and the rest is a field training), attended by 355
police officers from the Ministry of the Interior.
1. Following the signing of the Ohrid Framework Agreement and within the thorough reforms in the
Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry has been required to organise training for the current staff as a
main target group. The training is carried out through seminars in “Human Rights and Police” and
“Police Conduct in Democratic Society”. OSCE and the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights as
partners in training have offered assistance.
The literature used for the training is part of the Council of Europe project “Human Rights and Police
1997/2000”, and “Human Rights and Police after 2000” (Instructors' Manual; Torture Prevention
Committee; Discussion Tools; Reference Handbook; Police Handbook; Video tape); as well as
literature prepared by the Ministry of the Interior, OSCE and the Helsinki Committee (Police and
Human Rights – Police Training Handbook).
As of October 2002 to the present, 4200 police and criminal police members have been trained at
three-day seminars, which comprise 48% of the total number of police officers. These three-day
seminars are still being conducted as an additional training for the police and all the members of the
police force will pass this training.
2. OSCE is also a partner in the police training “Identification of Illegal Narcotics” conducted for 2.687
police officers (33,9%). The training continues and the target groups are the police and the criminal
police.
3. From 2001 to 2004, the Ministry of the Interior and OSCE have carried out three-month courses,
while currently they are conducting one-year courses with an emphasis on the establishment of
multiethnic police. A number of 1.812 police officers (22,8%) have been trained with a mixed ethnic
composition.
4. With regard to the Border Police, 821 officers (54% of the total number of Border Police
employees) have been trained at the Police Academy on three-month seminars.
5. The six-month course at the Police Academy on training 100 inspectors (from different ethnic
communities) has finished.
6. Pursuant to Article 18 of the Code of Police Ethics, the police has been organised in accordance
with principles of Community Policing, which provides for the establishment of relations between the
police and the public. This, in turn, facilitates the police’s co-operation with other bodies, such as
local-self government units, non-governmental organisations and citizens. The United States
International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP) and the OSCE Mission
have offered assistance in establishing and developing of the foregoing mode of police work and
conduct. A number of 110 police members (senior staff) have self-trained themselves to operate in
communities, as well as the Bicycle Police Team comprising 10 police officers. The self-training
course is consisted of 6 Modules: Why Changes Are Necessary; Implementation of the New Police
Conduct in Co-operation with the Community; Contribution and Participation of the Community;
Building Partnerships; Resolving Problems; and Progress.
Since 2002, the Ministry of the Interior and OSCE have trained 3.000 police officers (37,8% of the
total number) on one-day seminars on: police and community co-operation; what that co-operation
means; problem resolution and partnership with local communities; and reactive, proactive and
traditional execution of police duties.

237/453

The Ministry and OSCE have also realised a special training in executing police duties in
communities on two-day seminars for 180 senior staff of the Ministry, which is 1,7% of the total
number of employees.
Thirty two police members have received special training in policing within local communities. The
seminar covered the following topics: Analysing the need for changes; developing skills for
communication with the local population; and developing partnership techniques.
The U.S. ICITAP team and Ministry’s coordinators have carried out a Pilot Project on the Police Work
with the Community in the Kavadarci Department of Internal Affairs by training 25 instructors (police
officers as a target group) and a Bicycle Police Team in Kavadarci DIA comprising 4 police officers.
7. In co-operation with OSCE and the Helsinki Committee, the Ministry has also carried out two
seminars on human rights for 25 senior officials of the Ministry and regional offices.
8. The Ministry has been actively co-operating with non-governmental organisations, both domestic
and international, by organising workshops on topics related to police conduct and misconduct,
domestic violence, multiethnic society and police. Members of both the police and criminal police
have attended these workshops.
9. The Ombudsman has also been part of instructor’s training (a total of 30 instructors), organised by
the Ministry and OSCE for the implementation of the Code of Police Ethics—the citizens’ complaints
and the role of the Ombudsman and the police.
10. Many materials that had already been part of seminars, have been published and are at the
disposal of police officers. Thus, six thousand printed copies of Set of Regulations Related to Human
Rights have been published, including laws, rulebooks, legal provisions, etc. Financial support has
been provided from the OSCE and the Canadian Agency for Development.
11. In co-operation with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the nongovernmental organisation Information Centre for Civil Society, and with funding provided by the
Dutch Organisation Pax Christi, the Ministry has published 10.000 copies in Macedonian and 1.500
in Albanian of the Pocket Handbook of Police Conduct Pursuant to Domestic and International
Human Rights Standards on Law Enforcement, that have been disseminated to all Ministry
employees and are part of the literature used for additional and continued police training.
12. The Council of Europe in co-operation with the Police Academy has organised training for senior
staff in the Ministry and the Police Academy on Police Management, which was passed by 12 senior
officers.
13. Since 2005 all members of police will undergo continued additional annual training (preparations
are currently underway) On-job Training, which will cover topics in police work and new legislation.
Instructors will be selected from the ranks of Ministry's senior officials, judges, public prosecutors,
PROXIMA, and from other areas. The instructors shall be especially trained to carry out the training.
14. The Training Programme is presently being prepared for all police members with regard to
specific situations in public order and peace when it has been violated to a larger extent. It shall start
at the beginning of 2005 and all police members are a target group.
15. In 2004 the Ministry sent two high police officials to Sweden at the Centre of Peace Operations
Education, to be trained in peace operations and peace support operations with a UN mandate and
led by NATO, EU and OSCE.
16. In 2004 the complete police personnel have been trained at a one-day additional training by
senior staff in each police station on the contents and responsibilities arising from the Rules on
Conduct and Inter-Personal Relations of Employees with Special Tasks and Authorities at the
Ministry of the Interior.

238/453

17. Training and education of the Special Task Unit (STU) and the Special Unit for Rapid Deployment
(SURD).
The training of the Special Task Unit is being conducted on the basis of the Rulebook on the
Conditions and Procedures of Deployment of the Special Task Unit. The Rulebook specifies the
conditions and procedures of the Unit’s operations, rights and duties of employees, deployment in the
course of duty, and termination of Unit’s operations. The expert training of the Unit’s members is
carried out in accordance with an annual programme, adopted pursuant to Article 5 of the Rulebook

while all members of SURD have been trained in Human Rights and the Police.
18. As a result of the Ministry’s co-operation with the non-governmental sector in 2004 – the Friedrich
Ebert Foundation, Macedonia Office, and the Building Peace and Democracy Initiative within the
project Partners in Peace and Prevention – the Ministry has promoted the concept of conflict
containment and early warning by notifying local authorities and senior police staff. A survey was also
conducted of all members of the project to acquire feedback. Fifty members of the police were part of

239/453

the project. The project’s objective was also to obtain feedback on the new decentralisation process
that shall generate a number of changes in the Republic of Macedonia. It was also intended to raise
the level of local authorities’ responsibility, including the police.
19. In 2004 the Ministry, in co-operation with the non-governmental sector (the Citizens’ Association Centre for Open Communication), has organised workshops on The Police in Multiethnic
Environment, with an emphasis on the challenge, necessity and inevitability of the police's work in
multiethnic environment. A total of 50 police members have attended these workshops.
20. From 1999 to 2001, the Ministry in co-operation with the Open Society Institute Foundation (OSI)
has carried out seminars on sexual abuse of women and children, targeting 150 police and criminal
police members.
21. In 2001 the Ministry in co-operation with UNICEF has carried out a seminar for 70 police officers,
mainly targeting police and criminal police departments, with the topic Training in Juvenile
Delinquency, Children’s Rights and Abuse of Children.
22. In 2003 the Ministry in co-operation with OSI-Macedonia held two seminars for 45 administration
personnel of the Internal Affairs Sector in Skopje on domestic violence. Target group were members
of police and criminal police.
23. In 2004, as a result of the co-operation between OSI and the Ministry, two seminars were held
covering topics of sexual abuse of children and women and domestic violence, for 240 police officers
in the Police Unit (PU) and Criminal Police Department (CPD).
Pursuant to the Collective Agreement of the Ministry of the Interior, Chapter 5 and articles 91-92, the
Ministry's employees have a right and duty to attend professional training, and thus additional training
and specialisation has been a strategic goal. The police training and education is a continuous
process, and the foregoing percentages are changeable depending on the number of police officers
presently under training.
11. Please detail the inspection and internal control systems to ensure fairness, transparency
and accountability in the security forces, at all levels, particularly at the central level and
among senior officers.
In order to secure equity, transparency and accountability of security forces on all levels, and
especially on the central level among the senior civil servants, the Ministry of the Interior is
implementing systems of inspections and internal control. The Ministry implements these systems in
order to adhere to constitutional principles, laws and by-laws that regulate the operations of the
Ministry, as well as to apply the single working methodology for the respect and protection of human
rights of all people regardless of their skin colour, gender, ethnic, racial, religious or political
affiliation.
Chapter IV of the Code of Police Ethics (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 03/04)
Police and Criminal Justice Authorities, Article 16, prescribes that police members of all levels are
personally responsible and accountable for their actions, errors or omissions, as well as for orders
received by superiors and given to subordinates. Article 19 of the same Chapter prescribes that the
Police inform the public on their activities in an impartial manner, pursuant to principles of
confidentiality of data (with regard to protection of personal integrity of citizens, respect of the
principle of presumption of innocence, and for criminal procedure purposes). Hence, professional
procedures for relations with the media have been established.
Chapter VIII of the Code, “Rights of Employees in the Police”, Article 34 imposes that disciplinary
decisions against police members may always be disputed in a court of law, while Article 35
prescribes that Members of police subject to groundless accusations regarding their legal authorities
and duties are entitled to legal assistance through the Ministry, free of charge.

240/453

Chapter X of the Code “Police Responsibility and Control”, Article 60 prescribes that the Police shall
be responsible before the state, citizens and their representatives, through external control of their
operations, and Article 61 stipulates that state control over the police has been divided between the
legislative, executive and judicial authorities. Article 62 of the Code imposes that for the purpose of
developing relations between the police and the public, accountability mechanisms based on
communication and mutual understanding between the police and the public need to be promoted.
Police members are responsible for their actions before the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia. In
the case where police members violate constitutionally guaranteed rights, citizens may invoke the
protection of these rights before the Ombudsman.
Article 100 of the Rulebook on Performing Duties of the Ministry of the Interior (“Official Gazette of
the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 12/98 and 15/03) prescribes that pursuant to a prior approved plan,
organisational units of the Ministry are subject to supervision and inspection.
Chapter V of the Rules on Conduct and Inter-Personal Relations prescribes special duties and
authorisations that superiors are given to perform control to their subordinates.
Departing from the aforementioned principles and organisational establishment of the Ministry of the
Interior that operates under principles of hierarchy and subordination, higher organisational units of
the Ministry may inspect the operations of the lower units. Inspections consist of examining official
records or other written material regarding the enforcement of official duties and application of
authorities that restrict human rights. The inspections are carried out with a direct examination of
locations where security forces perform their regular duties in maintaining public order and peace on
local level, as well as in other cases if necessary.
By the application of the aforementioned principles, the Police Department, the Criminal Police
Department and the Border Police Department through their organisational forms by way of regular
and extraordinary controls and supervision, perform inspections in services of regional organisational
units of the Ministry, as well as on central level among the senior civil servants. In addition, the Police
Department on central level performs inspection on the operations of the Special Task Unit, the
Special Rapid Deployment Unit, and Special Police Units in cases when these units have been
engaged in restoring public order and peace disturbed to a larger extent, and in other cases when the
scope and complexity of tasks demand their engagement.
For the purpose of performing control of the legal, professional and efficient execution of operations
and tasks in the Ministry, pursuant to Article 37 of the Rulebook on Execution of Operations of the
Sector for Internal Control and Professional Standards of the Ministry, the Minister may order the
Sector to perform supervision and control, i.e. a central or local level inspections of the senior civil
servants. The inspector prepares a final report for the executed supervision and control, submitted to
the Head of Sector. The Head of Sector reviews and approves the final report, after which it is
submitted to the Minister.
In accordance with the Rulebook, the Sector for Internal Control and Professional Standards
conducts investigations and inspections, upon received information or citizens' complaints, regarding
illegal and unprofessional conduct of employees in the Ministry of the Interior. The Sector may
subject the Ministry's employees to medical and other examinations for the purpose of determining
alcohol or/and narcotic drugs in their body after informing them about the examination reasons and
with the Minister's approval. The Sector may also subject them to lining up for the purpose of
identification.
If in the course of investigation (inspection) on illegal and unprofessional conduct of an employee in
the Ministry certain violations with criminal elements are detected, the Sector shall inform the
competent public prosecutor and the Criminal Police Department. The Sector for Internal Control and
Professional Standards shall inform the Minister of the Interior about every investigation (inspection)
that has detected a criminal offence, violation of the working discipline or unprofessional conduct of
an employee in the Ministry. In addition, if the investigation (inspection) determines grounds for
initiating a dismissal procedure due to a violation of the work discipline, the Sector, pursuant to the

241/453

Law on Labour Relations and the Collective Agreement of the Ministry of the Interior, shall propose a
continuation of the investigation (inspection) before the Dismissal Committee.
Minor cases of work discipline violation, such as violation of work duties carried out by employees
with a status of authorised officials, may be subject to an initiation of a dismissal procedure, pursuant
to Article 133 of the Collective Agreement of the Ministry of the Interior (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 8/98, 12/00 and 3/04) while more severe cases have been regulated in
paragraph 2 of the same article. Disciplinary responsibility of employees with a status of civil servants
in the Ministry has been prescribed with the Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic
of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00, 112/00, 34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, and17/04).
Depending on the employee's level of responsibility, the conditions under which he/she has violated
the work duties, his/her conduct, and the violation’s weight and consequences, the Minister may
withdraw the dismissal and impose a fine that cannot be higher than 15% of the employee's monthly
salary in a period of 1 to 6 months.
In cases when the Dismissal Committee, following investigations, proposes to the Minister to adopt a
dismissal decision, until the decision on dismissal becomes effective the employee is removed from
the post and from the Ministry if: his/her presence directly endanger the life and health of other
employees and persons; he/she destroys valuable objects; his/her presence in the Ministry is
detrimental to the Ministry’s operations; and if criminal procedures for a deed perpetrated at work or
related to work have been initiated against the employee.
In accordance with the provisions of the Law on Labour Relations (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 80/93, 14/95, 53/97, 21/98, 3/01, 50/01, 25/03 and 40/03) and the Collective
Agreement of the Ministry of the Interior, the dissatisfied party (employee) may lodge a complaint to
the second instance Labour Relations Commission within the Government of the Republic of
Macedonia not later than 8 days from the receipt of the decision on the sanction. If the employee is
not satisfied with the final decision of the competent body (the Commission), or if the Commission
does not pass a decision within 15 days from the day of the complaint’s submission, pursuant to
Article 147 of the Law on Labour Relations, the employee may seek protection of his/her rights
before the competent court of law.
From 01.01.2002 to 31.12.2002, 53 procedures for determining responsibility due to working
discipline violations have been conducted against 53 employees. Out of these, upon the Dismissal
Commission’s proposal, decisions on dismissal have been adopted for 9 cases; another 41 cases
have been resolved with fines, and in three cases the procedure has been ceased due to lack of
evidence.
From 01.01.2002 to 31.12.2003, 274 procedures for determining responsibility due to working
discipline violations have been conducted against 280 employees. Out of these, upon the Dismissal
Commission’s proposal, decisions on dismissal have been adopted for 94 cases; another 156 cases
have been resolved with fines, and in 30 cases the procedure has been ceased due to lack of
evidence. At the same time, 121 criminal charges have been pressed against the employees in the
Ministry of the Interior to the competent Public Prosecutor, due to reasonable doubt for committed
criminal offence.
From 01.01.2004 to 01.11.2004, due to determined cases of professional misconduct of employees
in the Ministry of the Interior (abuse or illegal and unprofessional conduct), 245 procedures for
determining professional misconduct have been filed against 260 employees. Upon the Dismissal
Commission’s proposal, 35 employees have been fired, 198 have been fined and in 27 cases the
procedure has been ceased due to lack of evidence. At the same time, the Sector has issued
proposals for pressing criminal charges to the competent Public Prosecutor against 38 employees of
the Ministry of the Interior, due to a reasonable doubt that they have committed a criminal act.
On principles of hierarchy and accountability of the Ministry of the Interior see 24_G_3 and on
systems of administrative and judicial control of the Ministry of Interior see 24_G_4.

12. What action has been taken in practice by the Professional Standards Unit (PSU) in
dealing with police misconduct at all levels, providing for appropriate recourse and sanction?
What results have been achieved (number of cases, sanctions applied etc.)?
Sector for Internal Control and Professional Standards, in accordance with the Rulebook on
Operations of the Sector for Internal Control and Professional Standards, conducts investigations,
and performs supervision and control in the Ministry of the Interior.
Investigation is defined as any procedure of the Sector for Internal Control and Professional
Standards related to detecting and documenting illegal and unprofessional conduct of employees in
the Ministry.
Supervision and control are defined as any procedure of the Sector undertaken for the purpose of
control of legality and the efficient execution of duties and tasks by organisational units in the
Ministry.
The Sector for Internal Control and Professional Standards conducts investigations on the basis of
data, information and suspicion presented by the employees in the Ministry either on their own
initiative or from citizen's complaints, or upon the order of the Minister, that relate to illegal and
unprofessional conduct of the employees in the Ministry.
Citizen’s complaints that relate to illegal and unprofessional conduct of employees in the Ministry are
lodged in a written or oral form.
For every lodged complaint a report on received complaint is created, which contains the petitioner’s
first and last name, date and place of birth, place of residence and address, telephone number and
other information necessary to provide further contact with the petitioner. The citizen’s behaviour and
appearance shall be especially described. If there is conceivable suspicion that he/she is under the
influence of alcohol or narcotic drugs, such information shall also be noted.
In cases when complaints are related to human rights violation by a Ministry's employee, or in cases
of corruption, excessive use of force or firearms, or other serious cases of illegal and unprofessional
conduct, the Sector for Internal Control and Professional Standards:
− Shall review all relevant data, facts, information and reports;
− Shall interrogate the petitioner and the witnesses;
− Shall interrogate the employees in the Ministry that might have a certain perception with
regard to the complaint;
− Shall provide photographs, medical findings and evidence;
− Shall interrogate the employee subject to investigation, and shall write the clarification by
hand in form of official note or written clarification;
− Shall take on experts from specific areas for providing expert assistance and opinion, if
necessary.
The Sector for Internal Control and Professional Standards keeps records, documents and
determines facts utilising adequate prescribed operational and technical means and methods. If
needed, and if approved by the Minister, the Sector may subject the Ministry’s employees to medical
and other examinations for the purpose of detecting alcohol or narcotic drugs.
Depending on the form and severity of the illegal and unprofessional conduct, the investigation timeframe may be 30 or 90 days, but not longer than six months. The Sector’s inspector prepares a final
report on the investigation and its results, and submits it to the Head of Sector for review and
approval, after which the final investigation report is submitted to the Minister.
The investigation report, apart from giving data on the petitioner, gives reference to the allegations
from the complaint; to the undertaken operational and tactical measures; to operational and technical
means and methods; as well as to adopted conclusions with a proposal for measures.

243/453

In the course of carrying out its competences, i.e. during the investigation process, the Sector shall
act in an objective, unbiased, legal and equitable manner, by adhering to the reputation and dignity of
every employee in the Ministry of the Interior, and every citizen of the Republic of Macedonia,
respectively.
The data, information or suspicion on the Sector’s disposal, as well as their source, are official secret
and subject to the regulations on data secrecy protection.
In cases where it has been determined that the employee has carried out a minor violation of the
working discipline, in accordance with Article 75 of the Collective Agreement of the Ministry of the
Interior (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 8/98, 12/00, and 3/04) the Sector puts
forward a proposal to the employee’s direct superior to pronounce a measure - to reduce his/her
salary for the current month.
In cases where the investigation determines violation of working discipline or non-compliance with
the duties, in accordance with Article 143, paragraph 5 and 6 of the Collective Agreement of the
Ministry of the Interior, the Sector puts forward a proposed measure to the employee’s direct superior
for initiating a continuation of the investigation before the Commission for Dismissal, i.e. for initiating
a procedure on determining the responsibility of professional misconduct.
After deliberating, the Commission determines the worker’s responsibility and prepares a written
proposal to the Minister for the purpose of adopting an adequate solution. If the Commission finds the
worker not responsible or if the conditions for adopting a decision on termination of his/her
employment have not been met, in accordance with Article 148, paragraph 2 of the Collective
Agreement, the Commission proposes to the Minister to decline the proposal, i.e. to terminate the
procedure. Should the Minister disagree with the proposal, he/she may return the subject to
reconsideration, or adopt a different decision in accordance with Article 149, paragraph 1 of the
Collective Agreement. The worker is entitled to lodge a complaint to the second-instance body,
and/or file a suit before the competent court.
If it has been determined that the worker has committed a serious violation of the working discipline,
depending on the level or the worker’s responsibility; on the conditions under which the violation has
been carried out; on his/her conduct; on the severity of the violation and the consequences arising
from it; in accordance with Article 148 of the Collective Agreement, the Commission for Dismissal
proposes to the Minister to adopt a decision for employment termination. Until the decision on the
termination of employment becomes final, the employee may be removed from his/her post and from
the Ministry if his/her presence endangers the workers’ or other persons’ life or health; if he/she
damages properties of higher value; if his/her presence has a harmful impact on the Ministry’s
operations, or in any other case when charges have been pressed against a worker for a criminal
offence carried out at work or one related to work.
If the Sector for Internal Control and Professional Standards, after completing the investigation,
determines that there is a case with elements of criminal offence, in accordance with Article 3 of the
Rulebook on Conducting Activities of the Sector for Internal Control and Professional Standards, it
informs the competent public prosecutor and the Criminal Police Department. In addition, according
to Article 142, paragraph 6 of the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02 and 74/04) on the basis of the gathered evidence and facts, the
Sector prepares criminal charges against the worker that has committed a criminal offence and files it
to the competent public prosecutor together with the evidences and writs on the already undertaken
measures and activities.
From 01.01.2002 to 31.12.2002, a total number of 230 complaints were lodged to the Ministry of the
Interior by citizens, state bodies and institutions, citizens’ associations and other organisations. The
Sector for Internal Control and Professional Standards conducted analyses, which demonstrated the
following: in 65 complaints the petitioners complained on the Ministry’s failure to act upon measures
under its competences; in 35 complaints the allegations referred to authorised officials’ failure to
undertake measures and official activities; in 28 complaints the allegations referred to abuse of

244/453

official position and authority; in 26 complaints allegations were made against unjustified or excessive
use of force or coercion means by authorised officials; in 13 complaints allegations were made
against improper and unprofessional conduct of Ministry’s employees; and in four cases the
petitioners complained about Accident Investigation Minutes.
For the purpose of verification of allegations in lodged complaints, the Sector for Internal Control and
Professional Standards, apart from acting upon matters within its competence, forwarded 55
complaints to the Police Department; 44 to the Criminal Police Department; and 16 to other
organisational units within the Ministry of the Interior.
From verifications made by the Sector or other organisational units of the Ministry of the Interior it
was determined that in 7 such cases the allegations were founded, and in 5 they were partly
founded. During the same period of time, due to established cases of illegal and unprofessional
conduct, 53 procedures for determining professional misconduct were filed against 53 employees in
the Ministry of the Interior.
From total of 53 cases, upon the Dismissal Commission’s proposal, decisions on dismissal were
delivered for 9 cases; another 41 cases were resolved with fines, and in three cases the procedure
was terminated due to lack of evidence.
From 01.01.2003 to 31.12.2003, a total number of 770 complaints were lodged to the Ministry of the
Interior by citizens, state bodies and institutions, citizens’ associations and other organisations, 359
of which were lodged by citizens; 120 were anonymous complaints; 63 were lodged by legal persons;
88 were official notes and other submissions by employees of the Ministry of the Interior, 23 were
official information; and 39 were letters received by non-governmental and international organisations
for the protection of human rights (Amnesty International, the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights,
Associations of Roma, etc).
At the same time, 14 criminal charges by citizens, 20 requests by the Public Prosecutor, 20 requests
by the Ombudsman and 10 complaints submitted through lawyers were filed to the Sector for Internal
Control and Professional Standards.
Acting upon the lodged complaints, the Sector for Internal Control and Professional Standards in the
aforementioned period conducted 526 investigations and filed the same number of reports, as well as
144 answers to the petitioners. 15 answers were submitted to the Ombudsman; four to Amnesty
International, nine to legal entities, 15 to state institutions, four to the Helsinki Committee for Human
Rights, and 93 were submitted to citizens.
At the same time, due to determined cases of illegal and unprofessional conduct of employees in the
Ministry of the Interior, 274 procedures for determining professional misconduct were filed against
280 employees.
Upon the Dismissal Commission’s proposal, out of the total number of such procedures, decisions on
dismissal were adopted for 94 cases; another 156 cases were resolved with fines, and in 30 cases
the procedure was ceased due to lack of evidence.
At the same time, 121 criminal charges were pressed against the employees in the Ministry of the
Interior to the competent Public Prosecutor, due to a reasonable doubt on committed criminal
offence.
From 01.01.2004 to 01.09.2004, 938 complaints, submissions, etc. were filed to the Sector for
Internal Control and Professional Standards, out of which 545 complaints were lodged by citizens. At
the same time, 81 written anonymous charges by citizens, 48 records of oral complaints and 20
official notes for anonymous complaints made by telephone (received on 199 telephone line installed
at the 24 hours Operational Centre) were submitted to the Sector for Internal Control and
Professional Standards.

245/453

In addition, 37 official notes on professional misconduct of authorised officials were submitted by
Sectors and Departments for Internal Affairs; six complaints were submitted by the international
organisation Amnesty International; 15 complaints were submitted by the Helsinki Committee for
Human Rights; 25 requests were submitted by the National Ombudsman; eight requests by the
Basic Public Prosecutor’s Office; four requests were submitted by courts, 18 requests were submitted
by lawyers; five requests by the State Commission for Prevention of Corruption; and 130 appeals,
complaints and requests were submitted by legal and natural persons.
Acting upon the submitted complaints, anonymous charges, requests, complaints and appeals, the
Sector for Internal Control and Professional Standards carried out 433 investigations, determining
that in 10 cases the complaints were founded; 77 cases lacked evidence or it was decided that the
investigation should continue; and 193 complaints and anonymous charges, requests, complaints
and appeals were unfounded.
In the period from 01.01.2004 to 01.11.2004, due to determined cases of professional misconduct of
employees in the Ministry of the Interior, 245 procedures for determining professional misconduct
were filed against 260 employees. Upon the proposal of the Dismissal Commission; 35 cases were
resolved by termination of employment; 198 cases were resolved by decisions for fines; and 27
cases were adjourned due to lack of evidence. At the same time, the Sector issued proposals for
pressing criminal charges to the competent Public Prosecutor against 38 employees of the Ministry of
the Interior, due to reasonable doubt that they have committed a criminal offence.

G. HUMAN RIGHTS – HORIZONTAL ISSUES
1. Please provide succinct information on your constitutional order, your legislation or other
rules governing the area of human rights, and their compatibility with the relevant
international conventions.
Like most European democracies, the Republic of Macedonia has opted for constitutionalism. The
provisions pertaining to individual rights and freedoms in the Constitution of the Republic of
Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and
84/03) are very similar to those in the Constitutions of other European countries. The Constitutional
provisions in this segment have been inspired by the international and regional human rights
instruments. Rights and freedoms proclaimed in the Constitution have been rightfully considered its
greatest quality and an evidence of the degree of democratisation achieved in the Republic of
Macedonia. Promotion, enhancement and protection of basic human rights and freedoms are among
the highest political commitments of the Republic of Macedonia. On a national level, this commitment
entails consistency in the implementation of policies accepted regionally and globally, which have
been transposed into international human rights instruments. Article 118 of the Constitution sets forth
that once the international instruments are approved in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia,
their provisions become part of the domestic law and may not be changed by national laws.
The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia was adopted on 17.11.1991. In the very beginning of
its preparation, it was subject to assessments in the segment of human rights and minority rights by
the EU Arbitration Committee composed of presidents of nine constitutional courts and former
presidents of member-countries of the European Union. The Committee was chaired by Mr. Robert
Badinter. The intention was to verify the level of Constitutional regulation and protection of human
and minority rights, as a pre-condition for the recognition of the country’s independence. According to
the Committee’s arguments, the Republic of Macedonia successfully passed the evaluation.
Macedonia and Slovenia were pointed in the Committee’s Report (published 11.01.1992) as the only
countries among the former Yugoslav Republics that meet the conditions required for their
recognition as independent states.

246/453

Article 8 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia includes, among the fundamental values of
the Constitutional order, the basic freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen, recognised in
international law and determined with the Constitution, as well as the respect of the generally
accepted international legal norms.
Rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and by the ratified
international conventions have been incorporated into the domestic legislation and are enjoyed by all
persons under the jurisdiction of the Republic of Macedonia. Their exercise is conducted directly, on
the basis of the Constitution. Conditions and manners of their exercise may be prescribed by a law
only if explicit constitutional authority exists thereto and only within such authority.
In Chapter II governing the Basic Rights and Freedoms, the Constitution of the Republic of
Macedonia includes civil and political rights, as well as economic, social and cultural rights. In the
system and the substance of fundamental freedoms and rights, the Constitution corresponds fully
with the solutions incorporated into the ratified international human rights conventions.
In the segment of civil and political rights, the Constitution guarantees the following:
− The principle of equality of citizens before the law and the right to equal legal protection has
been stipulated in Article 9 of the Constitution. It includes the anti-discriminatory clause under
which citizens of the Republic of Macedonia are equal in their freedoms and rights, regardless
of their gender, race, colour of skin, ethnic or social background, political or religious
conviction, property or social status.
−

Right to life has been guaranteed with Article 10 of the Constitution. It determines the
inviolability of human life and prohibits the imposition of death penalty. The right to life may
not be restricted even under state of war or emergency in the Republic of Macedonia. No one
shall be deprived of the right to life on the basis of a court decision for having committed a
serious punishable act. This constitutional provision is fully aligned with the provisions on
abolition of the death penalty contained in the Protocol No. 6 to the Convention for the
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (of 28.04.1983).
The right to life, however, is not absolute in any country, and this includes the Republic of
Macedonia. Namely, a number of exceptions exist in relation to the general prohibition of
deliberate deprivation of life. Thus, the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms allows for deprivation of life in cases when the use of lethal force by
authorised person is absolutely necessary: in defence of any person from unlawful violence;
in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained; or in
an action lawfully taken for the purpose of suppressing a riot or insurrection. Similar
stipulations concerning the deprivation of one's right to life exist in the Republic of Macedonia.
These instances are enumerated in the Law on Internal Affairs (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 19/95, 55/97, 38/02, 33/03 and 19/04).
In accordance with the opinions of the European Commission on Human Rights, there are
certain restrictions in the Republic of Macedonia of the right to terminate pregnancy, while not
violating the right of a pregnant woman to private life, as guaranteed by Article 8 of the
Convention.

−

Prohibition of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, slavery or forced
labour, have been incorporated in Article 11 of the Constitution. It guarantees the irrevocability
of the physical and moral integrity of a person. The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia
regards the physical and moral integrity as inviolable categories, in the same way as life and
freedom. For that purpose, the Constitution forbids any form of torture, inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment, as well as any form of forced labour. Under the Constitution of the
Republic of Macedonia, the physical and moral integrity of a person must be respected under
all circumstances, both by the law enforcement officials and by individual citizens. The
Constitution protects every person from any form of ill-treatment, whether free or in detention.

247/453

Citizens have also been protected against any form of mistreatment during peaceful rallies, if
not applying means of force.
These Constitutional provisions prohibiting torture are identical with the provisions prohibiting
torture in the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
Consequently, the Republic of Macedonia has fully accepted the European Convention for the
Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment adopted in
November 1987 by the Council of Europe.
−

Right to liberty and security of person has been included in Article 12 of the Constitution. Its
provisions guarantee the inviolability of human freedom and determine the cases and
conditions under which liberty of a person accused for a criminal offence may be restricted.
The Constitution treats the right to liberty as an irrevocable right, that is a right that may not be
arbitrarily restricted. Under the Constitution, this right can be restricted only by a court
decision and in a procedure determined by law. Anyone who is arrested shall be brought
before a judge immediately, and within a maximum of 24 hours. The judge shall decide on the
legality of the deprivation of liberty. A person unlawfully or unjustifiably deprived of liberty has
a right to legal redress and other rights determined by law.

−

Although the right to a fair trial has not been explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, it has
been guaranteed in a number of its provisions pertaining to the presumption of innocence of a
person indicted for an offence (Article 13, paragraph 1); to the right to legal redress in case of
unlawful conviction (Article 13, paragraph 2); to the right to a counsel of his own choosing and
other rights of a person under suspicion that he/she has committed a criminal offence (Article
12). The prohibition of double jeopardy has been determined in Article 14, paragraph 4 of the
Constitution. No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again in criminal proceedings for
an offence for which he/she has already been finally acquitted or convicted in accordance with
the law.
The key components of the concept of a fair trial have been elaborated in detail in laws
governing civil and criminal procedure which guarantee an adequate and fair opportunity to a
person to present his/her arguments and evidence at a public hearing with a view to
adversarial argument before an independent and impartial court.

−

The principle of punishment only pursuant to law has been incorporated in Article 14,
paragraph 1 which explicitly determines the principle of legality as a basic principle in
punishment of perpetrators of criminal offences and in Article 52, paragraph 4 which forbids
the retroactive effect of laws. No one may be punished for an offence which has not be
declared an offence punishable by law prior to its being committed, and for which no
punishment had been proscribed.
The right to respect of private and family life and inviolability of home has been guaranteed by
several articles of the Constitution. Article 25 provides general guarantees for the respect of
privacy of a person’s personal and family life and his/her dignity and reputation. A number of
specific aspects of privacy have been given special constitutional protection. The freedom and
privacy of correspondence and other forms of communication have been guaranteed in Article
17. It allows only for derogation of privacy of correspondence. In order to allow for introduction
of certain special investigative measures required for the fight against organised crime, this
Article of the Constitution has been amended. Pursuant to this Amendment to the
Constitution, only a court decision may, under terms and by procedure prescribed by law,
authorise non-application of the principle of inviolability of correspondence and other forms of
communication, in cases where it is indispensable to prevent or reveal criminal acts, to carry
out a criminal investigation or where required in the interests of security and defence of the
Republic. Article 26 guarantees the inviolability of the home. The right to the inviolability of the
home may be restricted only by a court decision when a detection or prevention of criminal
offences or protection of the health of citizens is concerned. For the realisation of these goals,
the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, Article 18, guarantees the security and
confidentiality of personal data.

−

248/453

−

Article 16 of the Constitution guarantees the freedom of conviction, conscience, thought and
public expression of thought, speech, public address and public information. Freedom of
religious confession has been guaranteed by Article 19 of the Constitution. The Constitution
guarantees the freedom of public expression of thought, while putting this right in relation to
the freedom of conviction and conscience. Furthermore, the Constitution guarantees the
freedom of speech and public address as concrete forms of the exercise of right to
expression.
As a basic instrument of democracy, the right to expression may not be restricted by any
superior interests of the society or of the ruling elites. In this regard, the Constitution of the
Republic of Macedonia is a step beyond the European Convention, as the latter restricts this
right by the duties and responsibilities that it involves, which may often be interpreted rather
broadly.

−

The right to peaceful assembly and association has been covered by the guarantees for
freedom of political association and activity of citizens (Article 20), the right to assemble
peacefully and to express public protest without prior announcement or a special licence
(Article 21), as well as by the guarantee of the right to establish trade unions and the right to
strike (Articles 37 and 38). The right to peaceful assembly entails a right of citizens to
assemble peacefully and to express public protest without a prior announcement or special
authorisation by the responsible state bodies. This right may only be restricted in case of a
state of emergency or war in the Republic of Macedonia.

−

The right to participation in public affairs, the right to vote and the right to equal access to
public offices have been guaranteed in Article 2; Article 8, paragraph 1, subparagraph 5 and
Articles 22 and 23 of the Constitution. The right to vote in the Republic of Macedonia includes
all the characteristics of the right to vote in other democratic countries: it is a general and
equal right which is exercised directly and by secret ballot.
The freedom of movement and freedom to choose one’s place of residence have been
guaranteed by Article 27 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, which also
determines the restrictions to this right. This constitutional provision corresponds with Article
12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

−

In the segment of economic, social and cultural rights, the Constitution guarantees the following:
−

−

The right to ownership of property and the right to inheritance, which have been guaranteed
by Article 30; Article 31 provides for a possibility for aliens to acquire the right to property
under conditions determined by law. The right to ownership of property entails a right of every
natural or legal person to freely dispose of his/her property. No person may be deprived of
his/her property, except in the public interest and under conditions determined by law. These
provisions comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the
Constitution goes a step beyond the Convention, as it includes a provision under which a
compensation for a seized property may not be lower than its market value.
The Constitution also guarantees the right to work, as well as the rights deriving from
employment (Article 32), which have been further elaborated in law and collective
agreements. As regards the European Social Charter, the Constitution of the Republic of
Macedonia fully incorporates the elements of the right to work stipulated in this document.
Hence, from the normative aspect, there is no discrepancy between these two documents
when the right to work is in question.
The aforementioned substance of the right to equal conditions for work in the European
Social Charter have also been stipulated in the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and
the new labour legislation. With regard to this right, there is a legal conformity between the
Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and the European Social Charter. However,
problems exist on a practical level. Part of the employees may not exercise this right in all its

249/453

elements as in transitional environment, labour has been significantly undervalued in
comparison with the capital.
−

The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia guarantees the right to protection at work. This
right has been elaborated in detail in the labour legislation, with all elements of this right
included in the European Social Charter (Article 3). Numerous regulations exist on the safety
and protection at work, similarly as the numerous measures stipulated for the control over the
application of these regulations. In practice, however, there have been numerous examples of
violation of these regulations and measures, and hence violations of the right to protection at
work.
Pursuant to the Constitution, every citizen of the Republic of Macedonia has a right to
adequate remuneration. The wording right to appropriate remuneration is more neutral in
relation to the one used in the European Social Charter – a right to a fair remuneration. Unlike
the Constitution, the European Social Charter regulates in more details the substance of the
right to a fair remuneration. Namely, remuneration has been defined as sufficient earning for a
decent standard of living for the worker and his/her family; workers have been recognised the
right to an increased rate of remuneration for overtime work; men and women workers have
been recognised the right to equal pay for work of equal value; and all workers have been
recognised the right to a reasonable period of notice for termination of employment.
In practice, the right to a fair remuneration has been distorted for large number of employees
as their remunerations are insufficient for a decent standard of living for themselves and their
families.

−

−
−
−

−

The right to social protection and social insurance of citizens, and the special right to social
protection enjoyed by special categories of citizens, have been guaranteed by Articles 35 and
36. The right to social protection entails a right of specific category of citizens to social welfare
benefits in cases of unemployment or low wages or pensions. Funds for this kind of social
protection are provided by the state, in a manner determined by law or by a collective
agreement. This right becomes particularly emphasised in environment of high unemployment
and low remunerations for large number of workers.
The Constitution also guarantees the right to health insurance (Article 39) and the right to a
healthy environment (Article 43);
The right to marry and found a family, as well as the particular protection of family as
guaranteed by Articles 40 and 41 of the Constitution;
Rights of children have been incorporated in Article 42 of the Constitution and Article 40,
paragraph 4 which stipulates particular care for parentless children and children without
parental care;
The right to education and related rights and freedoms have been guaranteed in Articles 44,
45 and 46, whereas freedom of scholarly, artistic and other creative work has been stipulated
in Article 47;

The status and rights of members of communities have been initially determined in the Preamble,
and further set forth in Articles 7, 8, 9, 48, 56, 69, 77, 78, 86, 104 and 114 of the Constitution. On
more details concerning the rights and status of members of communities, please refer to the answer
to question I_J_2 and I_J_3.
Exercise of human rights in practice requires more critical judgment than the one concerning their
legislative regulation, as the practical exercise of human rights is a much more difficult task than their
legislative proclamation.
The Republic Of Macedonia, ever since its independence, has been carrying out a continuous legal
reform aimed at the protection and implementation of rights and freedoms guaranteed by the
Constitution, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the International Convention on Elimination of All Forms of

250/453

Racial Discrimination; the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or
Degrading Treatment or Punishment; European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; European Convention for the Protection of Human
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities,
and other international human rights instruments.
Numerous laws have been adopted for this purpose, including the Criminal Code (“Official Gazette of
the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 37/96, 80/99, 4/02. 43/03 and 19/04), Law on Criminal Procedure
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02 and 74/04), Law on Execution of
Sanctions (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 3/97, 23/99 and 74/04), Law on
Courts (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/03), Law on the
Public Prosecutor’s Office (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04), Law on the
Judicial Council of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
80/92, 50/99 and 43/03), Bar Law (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 59/02), Law
on the Ombudsman (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 60/03), Law on Family
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 80/92, 09/96,38/04 and 83/04- consolidated
text), Law on Social Care (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 50/97, 16/00, 17/03
and 65/04), Law on Local Self-Government (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
5/02), Law on Political Parties (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 76/04), Law on
Religious Communities and Groups (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 35/97),
Broadcasting Law (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” Nos. 20/97 and 70/03), Law on
Public Gatherings (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 55/95) etc. International
standards have been incorporated in all these laws.
An integral part of the legal reform has been the analysis of the harmonisation of the domestic
legislation with international standards. In that respect, ratification of the conventions for the Republic
of Macedonia has been not only a formal obligation and a goal in itself, but also an initiation of a
continuous process of implementation of international standards at a national level. This entails an
existence of a compatible and developed domestic legislation. The analysis of the compatibility of
legal regulation commences during the ratification procedure of a specific international document. At
this stage, possible incompatibilities are detected and solutions and measures for their overcoming
are considered.
The best example of this is the comprehensive analysis of the domestic legislation conducted in
1996, prior to the ratification of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms (for more details see I_G_2).
Apart from the ratification procedure, the harmonisation is also conducted during the procedure of
adoption of the laws, as early as the stage of the preliminary draft text, and at all stages of drafting.
Particularly helpful in this regard has been the long-time practice of consultations and expertise
established with the Council of Europe, dating back to the period prior to the formal accession of
Macedonia to the Organisation. The process of harmonisation includes also the regular review of the
existing laws that is conducted by the competent institutions with a view to their updating.
Macedonia also initiates a review of specific laws or a group of related laws on the basis of the
conclusions and recommendations of particular bodies i.e. controlling mechanisms established by
international conventions, which have pointed to such need in the course of the state reports on the
implementation of the obligations under the conventions (for more details see I_G_4).
The Judgments of the European Court of Human Rights also serves as a basis for harmonisation of
the domestic legislation (for more details see I_G_2).
Protection of human rights has been guaranteed in Article 50 of the Constitution of the Republic of
Macedonia, according to which: Every citizen may invoke the protection of freedoms and rights
determined by the Constitution before the regular courts and before the Constitutional Court of the
Republic of Macedonia, in a procedure based upon the principles of priority and urgency.

251/453

The criminal and legal protection of the freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen is among the
most efficient forms of protection in case of violation of human freedoms and rights. The Criminal
Code, under a separate chapter Crimes Against Freedoms and Rights of Individuals and Citizens,
stipulates the following criminal offences: violation of the equality of citizens (Article 137), violation of
the right to use own language and alphabet (Article 138); coercion (Article 139); illegal deprivation of
freedom (Article 140); kidnapping (Article 141); torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment (Article 142); endangering security (Article 144), violation of the inviolability
of the home (Article 145); unlawful search (Article 146); violation of the confidentiality of
correspondence and other parcels (Article 147); unlawful publication of personal writings (Article
148); abuse of personal data (Article 149); prevention of access to a public information system
(Article 149-a); unauthorised disclosure of a secret (Article 150); unauthorised wiretapping and audio
recording (Article 151); unauthorised recording (Article 152); violation of the right to a legal remedy
(Article 153); prevention of publication and distribution of published materials (Article 154); prevention
or obstruction of a public gathering (Article 155); violation of the right to strike (Article 156); violation
of the copyright and related rights (Article 157).
Besides before regular courts, citizens may also exercise direct protection of freedom and rights
before the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia. Namely, pursuant to Article 110,
paragraph 1, subparagraph 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, the Constitutional
Court protects the freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen relating to the freedom of
conviction; conscience; thought and public expression of thought; political association and activity;
and the prohibition of discrimination of citizens on the grounds of gender, race, religious, ethnic,
social or political affiliation.

This instrument is known as a Constitutional Complaint and thus far, the Constitutional Court has
decided upon nearly eighty petitions for human rights violations.
When deciding on the compliance of laws with the Constitution, i.e. on the compliance of by-laws with
the Constitution and laws, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia has, in a number of
instances, abolished specific provisions of laws and other regulations which have constituted
violation of rights and freedoms as guaranteed by the Constitution.
For the protection of constitutional and legal rights of citizens in case they have been violated by the
state administrative bodies and other bodies and organisations with public mandates, the
Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia establishes the institution of the Ombudsman.
2. Provide a list of human rights conventions and related protocols ratified by the Republic of
Macedonia along with the date of signature and ratification. Include details of any
reservations which have been made to those treaties and any declarations recognising the
right of individuals to petition committees established by the conventions. In addition, please
specify what national legislation and provisions have been adopted to ensure compliance
with the obligations flowing from these conventions. How are these implemented and
monitored?
Basic human rights and freedoms, recognised in the international law and determined by the
Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), constitute a fundamental value of the constitutional order of
the Republic of Macedonia. In line with the commitment to respecting and promoting human rights
and freedoms as a basis for the development of democracy in the country, Macedonia is a party to
numerous international human rights instruments of the United Nations and the Council of Europe,
including the controlling mechanisms established for the purpose of implementation of their
provisions.
Table I_Annex_03 includes a list of international human rights treaties to which the Republic of
Macedonia is a party. Macedonia has inherited the majority of the United Nations instruments by way
of succession procedure from the former Federation (SFRY), on the basis of Article 5 of the

252/453

Constitutional Law on the Implementation of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 52/91 and 04/92). This was regulated by a Government
Decision of 20 September 1993 (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 57/93). The
reservations made by the SFRY to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in relation
to Articles 12 and 21, were withdrawn.
Among the conventions acceded to since the independence, the Republic of Macedonia has made
reservation to the right guaranteed with Article 2 of the Protocol No. 1 to the Convention for the
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Pursuant to Article 45 of the Constitution of
the Republic of Macedonia, the right of parents to provide education and teaching for their children in
accordance with their religious and philosophical convictions could not be realised through a system
of private primary education. Citizens, pursuant to the Constitution, have a right to establish private
schools at all levels of education, with the exception of primary education, in accordance with law.
In relation to the European Convention on the Adoption of Children, Macedonia has made
reservation to Article 7 (1) pertaining to the age of the adopter, as the Convention prescribes that the
age of the adopter shall neither be less than 21 nor more than 35 years of age. Pursuant to the latest
changes in the Law on Family (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04), adopter in
the Republic of Macedonia may be a person at the age of 18 to 45 years.
Macedonia has recognised the right of individual petition before the competent United Nations bodies
on alleged violations of rights as guaranteed by international conventions. In that sense, the Republic
of Macedonia has, by a declaration, recognised the competence of the following:
−

−

−

−

The Human Rights Committee - to receive and review complaints by individuals claiming to
have been subject to violations of rights as guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights, which has been taken over by succession from the former SFRY;
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women - to decide on individual
complaints submitted on the basis of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, ratified by the Republic of
Macedonia on 17.10.2003;
The Committee on the Elimination of the Racial Discrimination - to receive and consider
communications by individuals claiming to have suffered violations of rights as guaranteed by
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which has been taken
over by succession from the former SFRY;
The Committee against Torture - to review individual complaints submitted on the basis of the
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
Punishment, which has been taken over by succession from the former SFRY.

During the ratification of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms, the Republic of Macedonia submitted Declaration recognising the
jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights, pursuant to Article 34 of the Convention.
In the legal system of the Republic of Macedonia, the relation between the domestic and the
international law is a constitutional issue and has been regulated in line with the monistic theory.
Pursuant to Article 118 of the Constitution, international treaties ratified in accordance with the
Constitution are a part of the domestic legal order and may not be changed by law. Consequently,
within the hierarchical structure of legal norms, international treaties stand above the domestic
legislation.
The ratification procedure of an international document is preceded by a review of the compatibility of
the legal regulation which points to the legal implications. In this sense, prior to the 1996 ratification
procedure of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the
Government undertook a comprehensive analysis of the compatibility of the domestic legislation with
the provisions therein. Additional relevant basis for reviewing the Macedonian legislation and for its
approximation with the internationally accepted standards is the case law of the European Court of

253/453

Human Rights. In the procedures in cases against Macedonia conducted thus far in the Strasbourg
Court, there have been no violations established that would point to the need of change of certain
legal provisions or practice.
The Government has supplemented the preventive action in the area of human rights by continuous
consideration of the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. A number of amendments to
several domestic laws in recent years have been a result of the Court’s interpretations in cases
against other High Contracting Parties. As part of the criminal law reform, and in order to ensure
unimpeded compliance with the decisions of international bodies for human rights protection, a
possibility was introduced for re-opening court procedures in cases of violation of international
obligations by applying extraordinary legal remedies. Namely, pursuant to Article 392 of the Law
Amending the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
44/02), the extra-legal remedy reopening of the proceedings has been introduced, following a
pronounced judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, relating to the violation of human
rights as guaranteed in Article 6, paragraph 1 of the European Convention. Similarly, the
Government, through the Public Prosecutor’s Office, may submit an extraordinary legal remedy
request for protection of legality for violation of obligations under international treaties.
An integral part of the process of harmonisation of the domestic legislation has been the long-time
practice of expertise and consultations established with the Council of Europe.
In addition, the Republic of Macedonia has been implementing in the domestic legislation the
recommendations of the competent bodies, i.e. of the monitoring mechanisms established with the
international conventions given in the reports on the country’s implementation of the obligations
under the conventions. In that respect, the legal framework for gender equality in the field of political
participation has been improved; as part of the criminal legislation reform, the institute of alternative
measures of punishment has been introduced; domestic violence has been incriminated; criminal and
legal protection against discrimination has been improved; the National Committee on Children’s
Rights has been established which prepares the National Plan on Children’s Rights; and a reform of
the system of juvenile justice is underway (for more details see I_G_4).
As elaborated above, the Government has played an important role in the implementation and the
monitoring of the obligations under international conventions. However, bearing in mind the direct
application of international agreements in the domestic legal system, the judiciary has been awarded
key role. The constitutional concept of the rule of law, therefore, insists on the independent position
of courts before which, by applying ordinary procedural and legal means in a fair procedure, the
protection of basic rights and freedoms has been exercised as well as control over political
authorities through law. The unbreakable link has been emphasised between the remedies for
protection of a right and the right itself. Effective remedies of protection of rights and freedoms have
taken the precedence over declarative commitments. Apart from the regular courts, an important role
in the protection of human rights has been awarded to the Constitutional Court of the Republic of
Macedonia, the Ombudsman, the Standing Inquiry Committee for Protection of Freedoms and Rights
of Citizens within the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia.
3. What is the rank of these conventions in your domestic legal system?
International human rights conventions are ratified by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia in
accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), and as such they are part of the domestic
legal order and may not be changed by law (Article 118 of the Constitution of the Republic of
Macedonia).
International treaties are paramount to domestic laws. This has been regulated by the Constitution of
the Republic of Macedonia in a way that it prohibits the alteration of international treaties by domestic
laws.

254/453

International treaties in Macedonian legal order are sources of law, hence individuals can cite
provisions of international treaties, and courts and administrative bodies are compelled to directly
implement them (Article 98 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia).
Moreover, human rights instruments enjoy even higher legal power than other international treaties.
This is also reiterated in Article 8, paragraph 1, subparagraph 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of
Macedonia, which determines that one of the fundamental values of the constitutional order of the
Republic of Macedonia is the respect of the basic freedoms and rights of the individual and the
citizen, recognised in international law and set forth in the Constitution.

4. What steps have been taken to co-operate with UN bodies dealing with human rights
issues, including visits by UN special mechanisms (such as special rapporteurs), reporting to
Treaty bodies and responding to Treaty body recommendations?
a)
Co-operation with UN bodies:
The design and implementation of the policy of promotion and protection of human rights and
freedoms in the Republic of Macedonia is a transparent process, both towards the domestic and the
international public. Accordingly, the state demonstrates a high degree of preparedness and
openness for co-operation with international organisations, working on human rights related issues.
In fact, the situation with the exercise of human rights and freedoms in the Republic of Macedonia
has been continually analysed and monitored from the moment the country gained independence,
not only through the regular mechanisms of different international organisations, but also through the
numerous extraordinary mechanisms and special mandates. The openness for cooperation with the
international community has proven to be the right policy, in light of the fact that, in general terms it
has contributed to realistic consideration of the advantages and weaknesses of the situation of
exercise of human rights in the Republic of Macedonia and has significantly influenced the setting of
priorities and criteria for action, aimed towards their harmonisation with the European and universal
standards in this field.
The policy of co-operation with the UN bodies has always been transparent, continuous and
comprehensive. This applies both to the cooperation under special procedures – whether thematic or
by country, of the Human Rights Committee (as the most relevant decision-making body in this area,
globally), and to the co-operation with the treaty bodies, as key mechanisms for the implementation
of international treaties for protection of human rights.
b)
Visits by UN special mechanisms:
b1) Special rapporteur for the former Yugoslavia of the UN Human Rights Commission
Starting from 1992, the Republic of Macedonia cooperated with the Special Rapporteur of the UN
Human Rights Commission for the former Yugoslavia - a special mechanism established under the
Resolution 1992 /S-1/1, as a reaction to the large scale violations of human rights and numerous
grave breaches of the International Humanitarian Law in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia. The
situation in the Republic of Macedonia did not provide for any grounds for establishment of this
special procedure, but as a part of the territory of the former Yugoslavia, it was covered by this
mandate, as well. Over the following five years, while Macedonia was within the mandate of the
Special Rapporteur, the Government regularly cooperated with the successive holders of that
mandate (Mazowiecki and Rehn), until 1997, when the State was taken out of the Resolution of the
Human Rights Commission. The cooperation with the Commission continued through the Technical
Cooperation Project, concluded between the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and the High
Commissioner for Human Rights.
b2) High Commissioner for Human Rights

255/453

The situation with the respect of human rights in the Republic of Macedonia was again in the focus in
the period between 1999 and 2002, during the Kosovo refugee crisis, which affected the region, and
in the context of the 2001 crisis in Macedonia. Considering that these were situations in which the
activities of all special mechanisms for protection of human rights within the UN system were
intensified, in light of the increased risk of large-scale violations, the interest for international
presence in the State grew significantly. Macedonia has once again proven and confirmed its
cooperativeness with the international community and preparedness to actively participate in the
establishment and strengthening of the peace in the State and in the Region.
In this respect, in the spring of 1999, the Republic of Macedonia has supported the Interim Special
Mission of the UNHCR Office, the purpose of which was independent verification of the allegations of
serious violations of human rights, which, according to the claims, took place in Kosovo, FRY. The
then-High Commissioner for Human Rights, M. Robinson, sent a mission to the Region, and from 24.05.1999 was personally present in the Republic of Macedonia.
In relation with the 2001 developments in the Republic of Macedonia, the UN High Commissioner on
Human Rights, M. Robinson joined the initiatives and activities of the international community to
consolidate the situation, and sent her Special Envoy (H. Amneus) to the Republic of Macedonia (1720.09.2001) to review the possibilities to help the Government in the given circumstances. This
occasion was used to revise and finalise the previously agreed Project on Technical Cooperation in
the area of Human Rights between the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and the Office of
the High Commissioner (initiated in 1996), which contains: 1) introduction of topics in the area of
human rights in the curricula for primary and secondary education and training of teaching staff; 2)
strengthening the civil society; 3) establishment of a National Committee on Human Rights and
development of a National Action Plan; 4) strengthening the Government’s capacity to prepare the
reports of the Republic of Macedonia under UN Conventions in the area of human rights. Several
Project segments are currently in the stage of implementation.
b3) Special thematic rapporteurs (visits)
The Republic of Macedonia supports and cooperates with the thematic rapporteurs of the UN
Commission for Human Rights, positively responding to the expressed interest to visit the country,
and carefully taking into consideration their recommendations and suggestions towards improved
protection of human rights. Furthermore, in consistency with its transparent policy in this field, and
following the international trend, in the course of this year’s 60th Session of the Human Rights
Committee, the Republic of Macedonia, extended an standing invitation to all special thematic
procedures (later accompanied by a written invitation). By this, the Republic of Macedonia has
become one of the fifty Member-States of the UN that have already sent open invitations to the
thematic procedures.
Thus far, there has been direct cooperation with the following thematic rapporteurs of the UN, who
have expressed their interest in visiting the Republic of Macedonia:
−

−

In 1999, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions visited
Republic of Macedonia as a part of the Special Mission of the High Commissioner for Human
Rights for the Region. The purpose of the mission was from the territory of the Republic of
Macedonia to monitor the large-scale violations of human rights in Kosovo, through interviews
with the Kosovo refugees. Macedonia facilitated and assisted the realisation of this mission, in
line with its commitment to peaceful and political solution for the problem.
In January 2003, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Human Rights
Defenders H. Jilani, visited the Republic of Macedonia and presented the visit report before
the Human Rights Commission in the course of this year’s session (15.03-23.04.2004). In this
area, a visible progress has been achieved in terms of the legislation, especially by starting
the procedure for enacting the Law on Free Access to Information of Public Interest (passed
the first reading in the Assembly), as well as in terms of the political climate in which the
human rights defenders work in the Republic of Macedonia.

256/453

b4) Special thematic procedures (correspondence)
The correspondence with the special thematic rapporteurs is a significant aspect of the cooperation
and is of special interest in terms of acquiring an objective picture about the exercise of the human
rights. Consequently, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia carefully reviews all cases
communicated by individual thematic rapporteurs, containing allegations on violation of rights of
individuals by the state, and regularly submits the relevant information and positions regarding such
cases. In the recent years, several special rapporteurs have addressed the Government with such
requests:
−

The recent UN Human Rights Commission Special Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance, A.
Amor monitored the situation with the exercise of the freedom of thought and expression,
conscience and religion in Macedonia. On the basis of petitions received by concerned
parties, in 1997 he requested information from the Government about the opportunities for
alternative community service of the conscription military service, within the context of the
right to conscientious objection to military service, as a legitimate right and an international
standard. The Government presented the situation at the time regarding the exercise of the
conscientious objection to military service and later initiated amendments to the Law on
Defence (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 42/01, 05/03), which was
harmonised with this international standard.
That same year, the Special Rapporteur A. Amor, requested information on the allegations
about banning the entry of the Serbian clergy into Macedonia. He received an exhaustive
Report about the specific cases, about the solutions provided in the Law on Religious
Communities and Religious Groups (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
35/97) as well as about the essential issues in the relation between the Macedonian Orthodox
Church and the Serbian Orthodox Church.
Last year, this Special Rapporteur requested the Government to present its views regarding
the arrest of Zoran Vraniškovski, former Bishop Jovan, as well as regarding several other
incidents of which he was informed. The competent institutions, this time again, timely
informed the Special Rapporteur about the activities undertaken regarding the case.
In line with its commitments, the Government will cooperate with the new Special Rapporteur
on Religious Intolerance, A. Jahangir.

−

−

In 2000, the Special Rapporteur Against Torture, N. Rodley requested information on alleged
exceeding of authorities by the police. The reply of the Government was detailed and
contained the requested information about all mentioned cases.
In late 2003, the UN Human Rights Commission Special Rapporteur on Promotion and
Protection of Freedom of Thought and Expression, the Special Rapporteur on extra judicial,
summary and arbitrary executions and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on
Human Rights Defenders, sent an urgent joint appeal to the Government of the Republic of
Macedonia in relation to the information they had received about the threats against the life of
the journalist Zoran Božinovski and the life of his two daughters. The Government informed
them about the case and about the measures undertaken to ensure the freedom of thought
and expression, the right to life and security of the person, as well as the other rights under
the mandate of these three special rapporteurs.

c)
Treaty Bodies – submission of reports
The cooperation with the UN bodies, established under international human rights treaties, for
implementation of their provisions, is exceptionally important and serious obligation for every State,
which has undertaken such obligation by ratifying the respective Convention.

257/453

The Republic of Macedonia is a party to six out of seven fundamental UN Conventions in the area of
human rights (for more details see I_G_2). The accession to the six conventions was done by
forwarding a notification on the succession with regard to the former Yugoslav Federation. The
Seventh Convention, on the Right on Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, is considered
by the competent institutions.
In line with the obligation to submit initial reports, and thereafter periodical reports on the legal,
administrative and other measures undertaken to implement the rights guaranteed by the ratified
treaties, the Republic of Macedonia has, thus far, submitted initial reports on the implementation of
five of such conventions. Four initial reports have been reviewed by the respective Committees. One
of them remains to be considered. The preparation of the periodic reports is in progress.
Republic of Macedonia is in delay with responding to certain reporting obligations under UN human
rights conventions and the Government is aware of that. However, the reasons for the delay are not
owed to the lack of will for cooperation or of the political will for dialogue with the respective
Committees. In fact, the delay is a result of the objective circumstances on one hand, but also of
subjective, mainly technical deficiencies, on the other. The internal and external political events and
processes taking place in the State, from the moment it gained its independence until the present
time, owing to which the human rights situation in Macedonia has been analysed and monitored by
numerous extraordinary mechanisms of all international organisations, in a longer period, should in
particular be taken into consideration in this context. This, at the same time, required exceptional and
extraordinary involvement of the available resources of the state institutions.
On the other hand, the regular reporting is a serious and complex process, which requires highly,
qualified and trained personnel, as well as excellent inter-ministerial coordination. From the
institutional viewpoint, and based on the hitherto practice of preparing the reports, the main body in
charge of activities for the fulfilment of this obligation is the Unit for Human Rights, at the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, where the process commences, is coordinated and completed, where the Reports
are consolidated and finalised. This Unit also prepares and defends the Reports in the dialogue with
the committees. Having in mind the difficulties in ensuring continuity of the work, in maintaining the
capacity, quality and quantity at a satisfactory level, or to overcome the material and financial
difficulties, as one of the possible solutions, the Government has proposed that the Project for
Technical Cooperation with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights foresee an activity to
strengthen the capacity of the government services participating in the preparation of the reports,
especially the Unit for Human Rights at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In cooperation with the Office
of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Skopje, the negotiations on implementation of part of
their activities are under way.
d)
Implementation of Recommendations by the Committees
The Republic of Macedonia seriously approaches the implementation of the Recommendations and
the Conclusions in the findings of the Committees, made on the basis of the reviewed Reports and
the dialogue with the Government. It considers them to be valuable guidelines towards improvement
of the legislation or the practice in the respective areas, as well as towards general advancement of
human rights protection, as a whole.
The situation with regard to submitted and reviewed Reports on each of the Conventions separately,
as well as with regard to part of the implemented Committees’ Recommendations is as follows:
1. The Initial, the Second and the Third Periodical Report under the International Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination reviewed before the Committee against Racial
Discrimination in 1997.
On the basis of the Committee Recommendations, the Republic of Macedonia issued a
Declaration, pursuant to Article 14 of the Convention (for more details see I_G_2) by which it
recognised the jurisdiction of the Committee to receive and review petitions by individuals, under

258/453

the jurisdiction of the State, who claim to be victims of violation of the rights guaranteed by the
Convention.
In the framework of the legislative reform, the criminal law protection against discrimination has
been improved in general. In this respect, the amendments to the Criminal Code of the Republic
of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 37/96, 80/99, 04/02, 43/03
and 19/04), of March 2004, with regard to protection from discrimination, have helped achieve the
following:
−

−

−
−

In respect of the criminal offences Violation of equality of citizens (Article 137) and Violation of
the right to use the language and alphabet (Article 138) criminal liability of legal persons has
been introduced for committing crimes referred to under point 1 of these incriminations.
The criminal offence Endangering the Security (Article 144) introduces a new Paragraph,
which enhances the criminal law protection against actions of discrimination, committed
through the IT system.
A new incrimination has been introduced– Crime against Humanity.
A new Article 407-a has been introduced –concerning the criminal offence – Approval or
Justification of a Genocide, Crimes against Humanity or War Crimes, which provides a
qualified form of the offence, committed through IT system.

2. The Initial Report under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was reviewed
before the Human Rights Committee in 1998. Some of the Recommendations implemented in the
meantime are related to the promotion of the gender equality in the field of the political life. Thus
as part of the legislative activity for improvement of the gender equality, in 2002, in the Law on
Election on Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of
the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 42/02, 50/02 and 46/04) , Paragraph 3 of Article 37 was
adopted, which provides that in the lists of nominated candidates each gender must be
represented by at least 30%.
In addition, an important segment in the reform of the criminal legislation is the incrimination of the
Domestic Violence. The Article 122 Sub-paragraph 19 of the Law Amending the Law on Criminal
Code (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 19/04), adopted in March 2004 provides a
definition of this incrimination.
The following Articles sanction perpetration of family violence related crimes: Article 123 Murder, Article 125 - Momentary Murder, Article 130 – Bodily Injury, Article 131 – Severe Bodily
Injury, Article 139 – Coercion, Article 140 - Unlawful deprival of liberty, Article 144 – Endangering
Security, Article 191 – Intermediation in Prostitution and Article 188 – Sexual Assault Against a
Child.
3. The Initial Report under the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading
Treatment or Punishment was reviewed before the Committee for Prevention of Torture in 1999.
The progress made in the respect and implementation of the prohibition of torture and related
rights and freedoms will be in greater details elaborated in a separate question, especially within
the context of the activities and cooperation with the Committee for Prevention of Torture of the
Council of Europe (for more details see I_H_11 and I_H_12).
4. The Initial Report under the Convention on the Rights of the Child was reviewed before the
Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2000. As a result of the recommendations of the
Committee on the Rights of the Child, but in conformity, also, with the obligations defined at the
World Summit for Children, in 2001 a National Committee was established with a mandate to
develop, and then to ensure the implementation of the National Action Plan for Protection of the
Rights of the Child in the Republic of Macedonia. The Action Plan being a strategic State
Document will provide the guidelines for implementation of the planned governmental activities in
the forthcoming ten-year period containing the legal and the administrative measures, which
should be undertaken to promote the position of the children below the age of 18, in all areas of

259/453

their life. In this respect, the Plan will cover the areas such as education, healthcare, social
security, legal protection, entertainment and living culture. The finalisation of the first Preliminary
Draft of the National Action Plan is under way.
In the reform of the criminal legislation, the Government took account of the recommendations of
the Committee of the Rights of the Child and the UN Minimum Standards on the Administration of
Juvenile Justice (Beijing Rules), UN Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency
(Riyadh Guidelines) and the UN Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty.
In this respect, the Law Amending the Criminal Code (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 19/04) of March 2004 introduced alternative methods of sanctioning.
In addition to the aforementioned, the Government implements activities related to drafting of a
Law on Juvenile Justice. Drafting of the Law was preceded by empirical analysis of the problems
of children at risk and efficiency of measures undertaken in connection with juveniles. This will be
in greater detail elaborated in a separate Question on the Rights of the Child, which will also
comprise other areas listed in the recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child
(for more details see I_I_41).
5. The Initial and the Second Combined Report under UN Convention on Discrimination against
Women was submitted to the respective Committee in May 2004, and it is planned that it will be
reviewed at the session of the Committee in July 2005.
6. Macedonia has still not submitted the Initial Report under the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The drafting of this Report is under way.

5. What steps have been taken to ratify and implement into domestic law the Rome Statute on
the International Criminal Court?
Strongly committed to developing International Criminal Law, as supranational law and to the
functioning of the international criminal justice system, since the very outset, the Republic of
Macedonia has supported the idea for establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC),
signing the ICC Statute and making the necessary preparations for its ratification. An analysis of the
Constitution and of the substantive and procedural criminal law has been made, while the Law on
Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02 and 74/04)
has been amended, by introducing provisions on enforcement of sentences of the International
Criminal Court.
On 30.01.2002, the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia adopted the Law Ratifying the Statute of
the International Criminal Court (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 20/02). Hence,
the Republic of Macedonia assumed the general obligations for full cooperation with the ICC in terms
of implementation of investigations and prosecution for crimes under the ICC competence, as set
forth in Chapter 9- International Cooperation and Judicial Assistance- of the ICC Statute.
In accordance with Article 87 paragraph 1 (a) of the ICC Statue, the Ministry of Justice is the body to
which ICC requests and other communication is transmitted, considering that the judicial assistance
is related to submission of evidence, data and information and hearing of witnesses.
The Law Amending the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
No. 74/04) introduces novelties in Article 505, envisaging that judgements of international courts shall
be executed in accordance with the treaty establishing that particular court and ratified in accordance
with the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. The criminal law Chamber of the basic court,
competent in terms of territorial jurisdiction, adopts a judgement confirming its authenticity and
enforceable character and determining the manner of execution of the sanction and other measures.
Namely, domestic courts may approve the request of the foreign body requesting execution of a
criminal law judgement of a foreign or an international court, if this is so determined by an

260/453

international treaty or on basis of reciprocity and if the sanction is also pronounced by the domestic
courts in accordance with the Criminal Code of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 37/96, 80/99, 04/02, 43/03 and 19/04) .
Aimed at implementing the provisions of the Statute in the domestic legislation, under the
amendments to the Criminal Code new criminal offences have been introduced: Article 403-a
sanctions Crimes against Humanity for which at least 10 year or life imprisonment is prescribed;
Article 416 - a), b) and c), is related to Organising Group and Inciting to Perpetration of Genocide and
War Crimes; Command and Other Superiors’ Liability; and Liability of Subordinates for the Crime
Committed under Orders of Superiors; there are also novelties introduced in respect of Crimes
Against the Judiciary regarding Presentation of False Evidence (Article 366-a) and Unduly Influence
on Witnesses (368-a).
6. Is there an Ombudsman with general competence in the field of human rights, the rights of
women and protection of minorities? If so, provide a description of the relevant legislation, as
well as statistics on the total number of cases received by him in recent years, the number of
recommendations he has made, and the number of his recommendations which have been
implemented by the relevant authorities.
In accordance with Article 50, paragraph 1 and 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01and 84/03), every
citizen can invoke the protection of freedoms and rights before the courts and the Constitutional
Court of the Republic of Macedonia, in a procedure based upon the principles of priority and urgency.
The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia also introduces the institution of Ombudsman. In
accordance with Article 77 of the Constitution, the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia elects the
Ombudsman whose authority is to protect the constitutional and legal rights of citizens when those
rights are violated by state administration and by other bodies and organisations with public
mandates. The Law on the Ombudsman (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 7/97)
laid down the conditions on his/her election and dismissal, as well as his/her competence and
conduct.
As a result of the signing of the Framework Agreement, which expanded the scope and protection of
rights of members of ethnic communities, the Constitutional Amendments replacing or amending
several articles from the original text of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia regulate the
special rights of the ethnic communities.
As a result of the constitutional changes, the Law on the Ombudsman has also been subject to
amendments. The new Law on the Ombudsman (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
60/03) strengthened the role and importance of this institution, expanded its competences, and
brought it closer to the citizens by establishing offices in six other cities in the Republic of Macedonia.
The new Law on the Ombudsman provides novelties pertaining to the election of the Ombudsman.
Pursuant to the Law, the budget of the Ombudsman is adopted as a separate part of the overall
budget by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia. The Ombudsman may also establish offices
in the form of regional organisational units. Furthermore, the Ombudsman is obliged to undertake
activities to protect the principle of non-discrimination and equitable representation of the
communities in public bodies on all levels as well as in other areas of public life, at the same time
having at dispose adequate resources and personnel that shall enable his/her service and execution
of authorities.
According to the provisions of the Law on the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman shall be elected by the
Assembly with majority vote of the total number of the members of the Assembly, within which there
must be a majority of the votes of the total number of representatives who belong to communities not
in the majority in the population of the Republic of Macedonia.
Another novelty in the law is that the Ombudsman has been defined as a body protecting the citizens'
constitutional and legal rights that have been violated by state administrative bodies or other bodies

261/453

and organisations with public mandates. The Ombudsman pays special attention to the protection of
the principle of non-discrimination, and equitable representation of the members of communities in
public administrative bodies, local-self government units and public institutions and services.
Pursuant to the provision in Article 29 of the Law on the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman may execute
his/her competence by visiting and inspecting the public administrative bodies and other bodies and
organisations with public mandates, as well as in government bodies, self-government units and
public institutions and services.
It is important to note that Amendment 12 stipulates establishment of a Committee on InterCommunity Relations comprised of 19 members elected by the Assembly of the Republic of
Macedonia, of whom 7 members each are from the ranks of the Macedonians and Albanians
Representatives in the Assembly, and one member each from among the Turks, Vlachs, Romas,
Serbs and Bosniaks. If any of the communities do not have elected representatives in the Assembly,
the Ombudsman shall appoint the relevant representatives of those communities as members of the
Committee, in consultation with the respective communities.
With regard to protection of citizens' rights, the Ombudsman, apart from protecting the citizens'
constitutional and legal rights when they have been violated by state administrative bodies and other
bodies and organisations with public mandates, also acts upon complaints lodged by members of
communities who claim their specific rights guaranteed by the Constitution and other laws in the
Republic of Macedonia have been violated.
Hence, the Ombudsman also acts upon cases when members of communities claim their rights have
been violated with regard to expressing their ethnic and religious affiliation; the use of languages and
alphabets before state administration and local self-government bodies; the education rights
(elementary, secondary and higher); electoral rights; rights pertaining to execution of the census in
the Republic of Macedonia; rights pertaining to police procedures (granting citizenships, issuing
personal IDs, issuing travel documents, the abuse of competences of official persons); discrimination,
unequal treatment and disrespect due to affiliation to any of the communities, or other violations of
rights.
According to the Law, the Ombudsman is independent, autonomous, professional and qualified in
performing his authority, and he/she performs operations under his/her competence in accordance
with the Constitution and the Law on the Ombudsman, as well as in accordance with international
legal acts on human freedoms and rights.
The Ombudsman does not make final and binding decisions. It is a controlling mechanism that
monitors the operations of state administrative bodies and organisations with public mandates
regarding the implementation of the Constitution and laws when the citizen exercises his/her right.
Should the Ombudsman determine violation and unlawfulness, he/she tenders his/her proposals and
instructions on remedies.
Apart from providing assistance to citizens in order to exercise their constitutional and legal rights,
the Ombudsman’s interventions assist both public organisations and state bodies in improving their
operations for the more successful implementation of citizens’ rights.
It is important to note that Article 8 of the Law on the Ombudsman stipulates that the Ombudsman’s
position is incompatible with the performance of other public offices, profession or membership in a
political party.
The procedure before the Ombudsman is initiated by lodging applications that may be submitted
personally at the Ombudsman’s Office; by mail; orally followed by minutes at the Ombudsman's
Office; or by phone, fax or electronic mail. The Ombudsman may also initiate a procedure upon
his/her own initiative; however the consent of the citizen whose legal and constitutional rights have
been violated is required for the continuation of the procedure. At the same time, the Ombudsman
must adhere to the principle of privacy and secrecy of the petitioner's data.

262/453

The Ombudsman may undertake a number of activities stipulated in the Law on the Ombudsman.
He/she may request explanations, information or evidence from bodies and organisations on the
allegations in the submission; enter the official premises and perform direct inspection into the
subjects and operations under the competence of the body; interrogate an elected or appointed
person, an official person or any other person that could provide concrete data on the procedure;
request opinions from academic and expert institutions; and may request modification of the
submission from the petitioner.
If the Ombudsman ascertains that citizens’ constitutional and legal rights have been violated
pursuant to the provision of Article 32 of the Law on the Ombudsman, he/she may give
recommendations, proposals, opinions and instructions on the remedies for the established
violations; may propose a renewed procedure in accordance with the law; may initiate a disciplinary
procedure against an official or competent person; and may file a request to the competent public
prosecutor for initiating a procedure for determining criminal liability.
Pursuant to Article 33 of the Law on the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman may request an interim delay
of the enforcement of an administrative act until a second-instance body adopts a decision or until
the competent court rules on the matter.
The competent bodies to which these requests have been filed are obligated to immediately, and not
later than three days from the day of reception of the request, adopt the decision on the interim delay
of the administrative act to the Ombudsman.
If the body or organisation does not inform the Ombudsman on the implementation of his/her
proposals and recommendations, or if it partly accepts them, the Ombudsman may directly inform the
higher body, the competent ministry, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia; may inform the
Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia with a special report, or may publish the case.
In 2001, out of 1107 received complaints, the Ombudsman found a violation of constitutional and
legal rights of citizens in 318 cases, on which he/she submitted opinions, recommendations or
suggestions. State administrative bodies complied with 186 and acted upon the instructions and
recommendations given by the Ombudsman.
In 2002, a total of 1878 complaints were filed to the Ombudsman’s Office, in 552 of which it was
determined that constitutional and legal rights of citizens have been violated. The competent bodies
were therefore given recommendations, opinions or suggestions on how to act in order to remove the
irregularities and unlawfulness from their operations. In 329 cases public administrative bodies
accepted the Ombudsman’s interventions.
In 2003, the Ombudsman received a total of 2605 complaints, and in the course of acting upon the
matters, the Ombudsman established a violation in 550 cases. In 356 of those cases the
Ombudsman’s interventions were respected by relevant bodies, and hence the petitioners’
constitutional and legal rights were exercised.
In the course of 2004, by 31.09.2004, the Ombudsman’s Office received a total of 1542 submissions,
and in the course of acting upon the matters, the Ombudsman determined a violation of rights in 196
cases, for which adequate proposals were submitted and competent bodies have complied with 89 of
them.
Although there has been an increase of applications every year, the violations found have been
almost identical. However, there has been a positive trend and attitude on compliance with the
decisions of the Ombudsman and a greater accountability on the part of the public administration.
It is important to note that Article 36 of the Law on the Ombudsman stipulates that the Ombudsman
shall report to the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia at least once a year on the level of
respect, promotion, and protection of the constitutional and legal rights of citizens, as well as on the

263/453

adherence to the principles of non-discrimination and equitable representation of members of
communities. The Ombudsman’s report must be published in the media.
The Ombudsman may also initiate a procedure for assessing the constitutionality of laws and
constitutionality and legality of other regulations if, in line of his duty, he/she appraises that they are
not in compliance with the Constitution.

7. Which resources and personnel are available to enable the Ombudsman to carry out his
office? Is his budget voted separately?
Pursuant to the Law on the Ombudsman (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 60/03),
the organisation and operation have been regulated with the Rules of Procedure of the Ombudsman
and the Rulebook on Organisation and Systematisation of Posts.
The internal organisation has been systematised so that operations are carried out in three
organisational units: Analytical Unit; Records, Documentation and Information Technology Unit; and
Administrative, Technical and Financial Issues Unit.
In addition, a special Department for Children’s Rights Protection has been operating within the
institution in the last four years, and hence special attention has been given to the protection of
children's rights.
Executives in the Analytical Unit that act and decide upon complaints have been divided into five
groups with several areas of competence. The Ombudsman and his/her deputies aided by three
advisers (graduate lawyers) are in charge of the groups. It has been assessed that this organisation
and manner of operation provides for qualified, efficient and continuous execution of functions in
Ombudsman’s competence and monitoring of conditions in different areas.

265/453

By 01.09.2004, the Ombudsman has been carrying out all his/her constitutional and legal
competences with 32 executive officers, 17 of which have been performing operations related to
investigations following complaints in various areas; three officers have been performing information
technology, records and documentation operations; and 12 have been in charge of administrative
and technical matters. Out of 32 employees, 19 are female and 13 are male. Five of them are
managerial civil servants, 13 are expert civil servants, five are expert-administrative civil servants; 10
are employees without a status of civil servant, of which five are officials.
According to ethnic affiliation, two are Albanians, two are Serbs, one is Vlach and 27 are
Macedonians. After all the posts have been filled, by the end of 2004 and in 2005 the total number of
employees is expected to be 69, of which 45 Macedonians, 17 Albanians, 1 Turk, 2 Roma, 1 Vlach, 2
Serbs and 1 Bosniak.
Given the increased inflow of complaints, especially in the second half of 2003, and the expanded
competence, authorities and organisational system under the new law, there is a need of additional
premises, staff, technical and other equipment, both in the Skopje office and in the new decentralised
offices.
Preparatory activities to be carried out this year have already been planned. When staffing, pursuant
to constitutionally and legally determined principles, special attention shall be paid to the equitable
representation of ethic communities' members in this institution, which fall under direct constitutional
and legal competence of the Ombudsman.
On 01.09.2004, a senior associate on financial matters was appointed, and on 15.10.2004, six state
advisors, four clerks and two drivers were employed in the six regional offices.
Following the completion of training at the Ombudsman's office, the appointed state advisors have
started working in the regional Ombudsman offices in six cities throughout Macedonia on 01.11.2004.
The six new deputies of the Ombudsman are expected to be appointed by the Assembly very soon.
Pursuant to Article 48 of the new Law on the Ombudsman, the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia
provides funds for Ombudsman’s operations. The Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia votes
separately on the part of the Budget provided for the Ombudsman.
The Budget of 2004 has provided funds for additional premises in Skopje and for premises of the six
decentralised offices, as well as funds for employment of 37 additional employees. The Organisation
for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Canadian Embassy Development Department
and the Embassy of Italy have provided funds for procurement of computers and office equipment,
and seven vehicles, six of which have been intended for the new regional offices. Other donations
are expected for renovation and adaptation of premises, procurement of software, material and
educational aid to employees, organisation of seminars, etc.
8. Is access to all official documents granted to the Ombudsman? Is he entitled to suspend
the execution of an administrative act if he determines that the act may result in irreparable
prejudice to the rights of a person? If so, how is this implemented in practice? Does the
Ombudsman have the right to contest the conformity of laws with the Constitution and, if so,
how is this implemented in practice?
The Ombudsman is obliged to obtain all essential facts and evidence while investigating allegations
of received complaints or when initiating a procedure. Pursuant to Article 27 of the Law on the
Ombudsman (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 60/03) state administrative bodies,
other bodies or organisations with public mandates or local-self government units and public
institutions are required to cooperate with the Ombudsman and upon his/her demand provide all
evidence, data and information without regard to their confidentiality. On the other hand, the
Ombudsman is obliged to keep a state and official secret in a manner and under conditions

266/453

prescribed by law or other regulation. Experiences hitherto show that the Ombudsman has been
practising his/her legal duties unhindered.
The Ombudsman may request an interim delay of the enforcement of an administrative act until a
second-instance body adopts a decision or until the competent court rules on the matter, if he/she
assesses that such enforcement shall create irreparable damages to the right of interested persons
(Article 33 of the Law on the Ombudsman).
In the period from 01.01.2002 to 30.09.2004, according to data from Annual Reports of the
Ombudsman’s Office, the Ombudsman filed 21 requests for interim delay of the enforcement of
administrative acts. One of these requests has not been abided by and therefore the Ombudsman
(since all legal preconditions were fulfilled) pressed charges against an official and responsible
person in the administrative body to which a request had been filed.
Article 30 of the Law on the Ombudsman specifies that the Ombudsman may submit a proposal to
the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia to review the constitutionality and legality of
laws and other regulations or by-laws. From 01.01.2002 to 30.09.2004, the Ombudsman, either upon
his/her initiative or acting upon complaints, submitted 5 initiatives to the Constitutional Court of the
Republic of Macedonia to review the constitutionality of certain regulations. The Court has accepted
two of them and has revoked the disputed regulations.
9. Are there decentralised offices of the Ombudsman?
The Law on the Ombudsman (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 60/03) that
entered into force on 01.10.2003, prescribes the establishment of six new offices organised as
decentralised organisational units of the Ombudsman with a view to an improved execution of duties
under the Ombudsman's competence (Article 44). The Law stipulates that such offices shall be
opened in the cities of Tetovo, Kichevo, Štip, Strumica, Kumanovo and Bitola. The six offices shall be
administered by Ombudsman’s deputies elected by the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia upon
the Ombudsman’s proposal.
The proposal of electing six new Ombudsman deputies is expected to enter parliamentary procedure
as soon as possible, thus the offices and their functioning will be complete. The civil servants
following the training at the Ombudsman’s Office have already started working in the decentralised
offices on 01.11.2004. The offices have been equipped with full office and IT equipment. Thus, all
prerequisites for successful operations have been created.

H. CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS
10. Please provide an overview of legislation or case law relevant to the right to life. Also
provide an overview of national legislation, case law and custom/practice relating to the death
penalty.
The right to life as a fundamental human right has been guaranteed with Article 10 of the Constitution
of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92,
31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), according to which: The human right to life is inviolable. This article
stipulates unconditional protection of human life from all possible threats, and not only from
intentional deprivation of life. The fundamental character of right to life has also been reiterated in
Article 54 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, which stipulates the cases in which
citizens’ freedoms and rights may be restricted, emphasising that such restriction shall not apply to
the right to life.

267/453

The legal protection of life has been laid down in the Criminal Code of the Republic of Macedonia
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 37/96, 80/99, 04/02, 43/03 and 19/04), which
provides for several incriminations whose object is the protection of human life. These criminal acts
have been systematised in a separate Chapter under the title Crimes against Life and Body. The
crimes in this chapter have been divided in several groups:
−
−
−
−
−

Criminal acts of life deprivation: murder (Article 123), murder with noble motives (Article 124),
instant murder (Article 125), murder from negligence (Article 126), murder of a child at birth
(Article 127), instigation to suicide and helping in suicide (Article 128);
Criminal acts related to deprivation of future life (embryo): unlawful interruption of a pregnancy
(Article 129);
Criminal acts related to body injuries: body injury (Article 130) and a grave body injury (Article
131);
Criminal acts related to endangering: participation in a brawl (Article 132), threatening with a
dangerous instrument during a brawl or a quarrel (Article 133) and exposure to danger (Article
133); and
Criminal acts related to deserting: deserting a feeble person (Article 135) and not giving help
(Article 136).

Article 6 of the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights and Article 2 of the European
Convention on Human Rights prohibit the arbitrary deprivation of life. The protection from arbitrary
deprivation of life and particularly the prevention of life deprivations resulting from the use of lethal
force in the line of duty by police and security forces’ members has been laid down in the
Macedonian legislation with legal provisions on the conditions of official use of firearms. In
accordance with Article 35 of the Law on Internal Affairs (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos.19/95, 15/97, 38/02, 33/03 and 19/04), an authorised official person of the Ministry
of the Interior shall use firearms, if by using other means of coercion he/she cannot: a) protect the life
of citizens; b) reject direct life-threatening attack on himself/herself; c) reject attack on a facility or
person secured; and d) prevent the escape of a person caught in the act of committing a crime for
which the sentence of at least 5-years imprisonment is provided, as well as to prevent the escape of
a person arrested or a person for whom an arrest warrant has been issued for committing such a
crime.
Authorised officers who officially perform duties under direct command of their superior may use
means of coercion or firearms only if ordered by him/her (Article 36). Before the use of coercion
means or firearms, the authorised officer shall be obliged to warn, in a loud voice, the person for
whom he/she shall use coercion means, i.e. firearms.
The grounds and justification for the use of force or firearms in each and every case is directly
assessed by his/her superior. If the means of coercion or firearms are used within authorised limits
and in compliance with the Law, the responsibility of the authorised official person who used them
shall be excluded as well as the responsibility of the person in charge who ordered use of force and
firearms, including the person who, upon the call of the Ministry or the authorised official person
extended assistance in the execution of official activities.
The manner of using firearms and coercion means are laid down in detail in the Guidelines on the
Use of Force and Firearms, brought upon by the Minister of the Interior.
Provisions on the use of firearms and coercion means are also stipulated in Article 185 of the Law on
Execution of Sanctions (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 03/97, 23/99 and
74/04), according to which: A member of security forces during official duty shall use firearms only if
he/she cannot act differently: а) in order to protect human life; b) in order to reject a direct lifethreatening attack; c) in order to reject an attack on the facilities he/she guards; d) in order to prevent
the escape of a convicted person from a penitentiary institution, and to prevent the escape of a
convicted person while escorted in the event the convict has been convicted of a criminal act for
which sentence of at least 15 years or more has been presribed.

268/453

Firearms shall only be used upon the institution director’s order or upon an order of the official person
in charge of the security service, and only if by use of other coercion means, he/she cannot execute
the official duty. When using firearms, the member of security forces is obligated to be cautious and
not endanger lives of other persons.
A report shall be created on the use of coercion means and firearms, and the Directorate for
Execution of Sanctions shall be informed in writing on the justification of the use of coercion means.
The legal protection of right to life is also secured by providing for a right of compensation of
damages in case the death has been caused purposely or by negligence. This right shall be
implemented in accordance with the rules of civil law, contained in the Law on Obligations (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 18/01, 04/02 and 05/03).
Capital punishment in the Republic of Macedonia has been abolished. Article 10, paragraph 2 of the
1991 Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia reads: The death penalty shall not be imposed on
any grounds whatsoever in the Republic of Macedonia.
The Republic of Macedonia has ratified the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights. In the beginning of 1997, the Republic of Macedonia also ratified the
European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the
Protocol No. 6 on the abolition of the death penalty. In 2004, the Assembly of the Republic of
Macedonia passed a Law on Ratification of the Protocol No.13 to the European Convention for the
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, with regard to the abolition of death penalty
in all circumstances.
The Republic of Macedonia as one of the legal successors of the former SFRY acceded to the
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in 1993 (ratified by the
former SFRY on 21.06.1950) and the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to
War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity (ratified by the former SFRY on 11.11.1970).
On the basis of statistical data in 2000, criminal acts against life and body comprise 11,1% of the
total number of convicted persons. In 2001 and 2002, this number was 8,9% and in 2003 it was 9%.
11. What strategies are in place to ensure the respect for fundamental rights? Please refer
particularly to measures which relate to human dignity, the right to life, the right to integrity of
the person, the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
According to provisions of the Constitution (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) and respective laws, the Republic of Macedonia has a
comprehensive system of human rights protection.
The development and promotion of human rights is one of the most important issues in international
politics, through which the International Community determines its political stance toward a particular
State. This is important as the human rights situation in the Republic of Macedonia is subject to
continuous interest of the International Community. Hence, the adequate treatment of human rights
issues on national level has been a strategic goal of the Republic of Macedonia.
Human rights issues, especially from the viewpoint of the International Law, are treated by the Unit
of Council of Europe and Human Rights within the Multilateral Sector at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, through:
−

−

Monitoring of the political dimension of human rights through participation in international
meetings and specialised bodies (committees, commissions) that tackle the human rights
issues (most of all within Council of Europe, OSCE, UN, CEI and the Stability Pact);
Monitoring, analysis and cooperation with international monitoring on the human rights
situation in the Republic of Macedonia;

269/453

−

−
−

Monitoring the development of International Law on Human Rights and active participation in
the work of International Bodies that prepare the novelties in the area; producing analyses on
the conformity of domestic legislation with relevant international documents;
Inter-ministerial coordination in producing Reports and other duties arising from International
Human Rights Conventions as well as preparing and presenting the defence;
Producing general information on the human rights situation in the Republic of Macedonia, as
well as on particular human rights cases that provoke the interest of the International
Community.

As of 1997, a special Human Rights Unit within the Ministry of Justice has been operating. Its authorities
are to: initiate proposals for signing and ratifying procedures of international legal instruments by
analysing the legislation that needs to be changed with the ratification; participate in preparing the initial,
regular and periodic Reports on the ratified international instruments within its competence; initiate the
creation of studies and Reports as basis for proposing respective changes in the domestic legislation; and
prepare Opinions on individual cases before International Bodies.
In 1997 the Government has also founded a Unit of Gender Equality Promotion. This Department
coordinates national, regional and international activities that aim to promote the gender equality.
At the same time, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia has adopted or is preparing several
national programmes intended to promote and improve the state of human rights in several areas,
among which the most important are:
1. One segment of the Project for Technical Co-operation between the Government of the
Republic of Macedonia and the UN High Commissioner of Human Rights is the foundation of
a Human Rights National Committee as well as the preparation of a National Human Rights
Action Plan. The project is to be realised in the near future.
2. The Government also implements the part of the foregoing Project in the field of education, by
incorporating human rights topics into curricula of elementary and secondary education and
by providing training for teachers.
In that respect:
− A Partnership Strategic Group has been established, comprising representatives of relevant
Ministries, the civil society and International Organisations that are already implementing
projects in human rights education intended for integration and harmonisation of all
programmes into one.
− On 29 and 30 January 2004, a National Consultation on Human Rights Education was held in
Skopje. This consultation concluded the activities taken in the period of 2002-2004. The
participants at the Consultation (representatives of governmental and non-governmental
organisations, independent experts, representatives of international non-governmental
organisations and direct participants into the education process) have agreed to apply certain
changes in the legislation (mostly in the laws regulating primary and secondary education)
and to institute a national body (a national committee for human rights education) that will
draft the National Human Rights Education Action Plan.
1. In 2002 the Government of the Republic of Macedonia adopted a National Plan for Gender
Equality pursuant to Constitutional provisions on equality of citizens regardless of gender and
special protection of maternity, children and juveniles; and pursuant to principles of the UN
Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights
instruments and especially the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination
Against Women (CEDAW), the Declaration on the Right to Development, the Beijing Declaration
and the Platform for Action.

The National Plan on the Fight against Trafficking in Children is currently being prepared.
3. The National Youth Strategy of the Republic of Macedonia is a comprehensive policy
document of the needs and the problems of the youth in Macedonia aged 15 to 30 and it relates
to the implementation of the following strategic goals:
− Social development through quality education system for the youth;
− Economic development through employment of young people;
− Participation of the youth into the society;
− Quality of living, quality of health and prevention.
− Development of local youth work.
The process of drafting of the National Youth Strategy of the Republic of Macedonia was divided
in two parts: preparatory and consultative process.
The first part consisted of a “Basic Study on Youth Trends" determining the problem of the
youngsters in the last ten years. The study was a basis for the creation of the strategy.
In 2004 within the consultative process several fora and a large number of local debates were
held, hence incorporating a large number of young people that had not been part of youth nongovernmental sector programmes. In the course of consultations experiences of countries with
highly developed models of dealing with youth issues have been used.
The National Strategy envisages the following measures and activities for the realisation of its
strategic goals:
− Improvement of the legislation regarding activities and programmes of the Ministries of
education, science, justice, culture, health, local self-government, finance and defence in
order to:

272/453

•
•

−

Include a youth dimension into those programmes and activities;
Incorporate the youth and their organisations into the creation and implementation of
these programmes.
Institutional development through the creation of mechanisms for the incorporation of youth
organisations into the process of decision-making.

The National Youth Strategy was recently adopted by the Government.
4. The National Action Plan for the Children in the Republic of Macedonia has envisaged the
following:
− To define Macedonia’s policy with regard to the children’s rights for the next ten years;
− To establish standards providing protection and improvement of conditions for an equal
access to the basic rights of every child, as a part of the child's correct development and part
of human dignity.
− To place children and their best interest on top of all priorities;
− To encompass all children and to eliminate all forms of discrimination against children and
their rights;
− To reduce the differences among children; to pay equal attention to each child, especially to
children coming from poor families or some ethnic communities, or children with special
needs;
− To reduce poverty, which has been the main obstacle in the acquisition of basic rights as,
guaranteed by the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Poverty may be reduced by
investing into children as envisaged by the Poverty Reduction Strategy - A Child's Eye View of
the World and the Millennium Goals,
− To provide access to education to every child, i.e. all male and female children should be
entitled to compulsory, free of charge and proper-quality elementary education;
− To create conditions for an equal access of children to secondary education;
− To provide children with special needs with all necessary conditions and opportunities so that
they may exercise their rights without being discriminated against;
− To protect children against all forms of abuse and violence;
− To provide all children with adequate standard of living necessary for normal growth and
development;
− To provide children with healthy environment and with healthy food and drinking water;
− To provide every child with the highest possible level of health care and, above all, to provide
them with protection against the HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases;
− To hear children's opinion on all issues that concern their rights and interests and to include
them in decision-making on issues related to the protection of their rights.
The National Action Plan unites all tasks and goals that the Republic of Macedonia needs to
undertake in order to provide children, without exceptions, a full implementation of guaranteed
rights based upon the principles of equality, accessibility, quality and efficiency.
For the purpose of implementing the National Action Plan’s goals, the following guidelines and
priorities are determined:
− Full incorporation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child provisions that address the
children's rights and interests as well as its implementation into policies and practices of all
individuals, institutions and the state as a whole. This requires the adoption of new laws and
amendments to existing ones.
− Establishing respective mechanisms and modes of coordination of entities involved in the
enforcement of the legal regulation;
− Securing all possible sources of funds and setting priorities in allocation of budgetary funds for
the exercise of children’s rights, with an emphasis on children living in poverty or in a difficult
economic situation;

Education of the general public on children’s rights, and education of children on the concept
of human rights and freedoms with an intention to train and prepare them to differentiate
between rights and duties and to acquire skills in self-protection against various kinds of
violations and abuses;
Incorporation of all children into the education process, especially children from rural areas
and homeless children, with state support including measures of encouragement that would
give the children incentives to attend education institutions;
Waiving health fees in health services, medicines, and orthopaedic instruments for all children
aged 18 and below in order to secure the highest level of health care to every child;
Creating a strong legal system for juveniles by adopting a separate Law on Juvenile Justice
and by amending other laws, in order to: protect children from risk groups; bring alternative
instead of penal measures for delinquent children; and undertake measures on rehabilitation
and re-socialisation of children that had broken the law;
Adopting respective legal solutions and change of practices with regard to protection of
children from all forms of abuses, violence and exploitation;
Promotion of cooperation between government and other institutions with regard to the
exercise of children’s rights, and in particular establishment of a special department in one of
the Ministries that shall unite, coordinate and assist all relevant institutions and shall create a
database of all aspects of children’s lives.
Promotion of co-operation between Government institutions and non-governmental
organisations and a greater engagement of the non-governmental sector into matters under
state competence.

The National Action Plan for the Children in the Republic of Macedonia shall be adopted during
the first half of 2005.
5. The National Strategy for Levelling the Rights of the Persons with Disabilities in the Republic
of Macedonia is a Government document adopted in 2001 consisting of thorough analyses and
recommendations for adopting respective decisions on protection, education, rehabilitation,
training and employment of the persons with disabilities. These recommendations in particular
refer to:
− Prevention, early detection, early diagnosis and treatment;
− Pre-school education, primary education, secondary education and higher education for all
persons with special needs and if possible;
− Training and employment;
− Family and social life;
− Health care;
− Social protection;
− Rehabilitation;
− Availability of services and accessories;
− Securing incomes and social security;
− Housing and providing conditions (in families, day care centres, small capacity dispensary
services or apartments intended for small groups and persons with disabilities) for all persons
with disabilities in need;
− Recreation and sports;
− Religion; and
− Raising public awareness.
6. The National Strategy on the Roma addresses the specific needs and problems of this ethnic
community. The motive for creating such a document, dedicated exclusively to the Roma, has
been determined by the necessity to put together a comprehensive and consistent policy

274/453

identifying the crucial subjects and problems and offering a concrete Working Programme for the
implementation of the declared policy.
In the beginning of October 2004, the Republic of Macedonia prepared the Draft-Strategy for the
Roma, which was offered for public discussion. The Government on its session on 31.01.2005
adopted the Strategy. The priority areas encompassed by the Strategy are the following: housing,
employment, education, health, social care, culture, media, the Roma women and their special
needs, and political participation. General objectives of the National Strategy for the Roma in
Macedonia are:
−

Realisation of a greater integration of the Roma into the mainstream of the Macedonian
society;
− Poverty reduction in the Roma as the most marginalised group;
− Realisation of a long-term development of the Roma community in every aspect;
− Securing the full participation of the Macedonian state into the implementation of the priority
resolves of the Strategy;
− Establishing normative and institutional prerequisites for the realisation of European Union
standards.
In the past several years, the Republic of Macedonia has initiated a critical review of the existing
legal regulations in order to put a modern legal basis in place for the legislation and practice
concerning police authorities.
The Law Amending the Law on Criminal Procedure of September 2004 (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 74/04) constitutes a serious legislative effort to define comprehensively
the investigative police measures. Particular attention has been dedicated to the conduct with
persons detained and apprehended in police station. They may only be apprehended in specially
designed and equipped police stations; specially trained officers for reception shall be responsible for
these persons, who shall not be involved in police investigation, but shall rather take care of the rights
and interests of persons apprehended in police. Additional novelties have been incorporated in
provisions stipulating efficient access to legal representative, notification of the family, medical
examination, information on the rights, special detailed files and for other mechanisms aimed at
prevention of abuses of suspects.
In order to reduce the occurrences of arbitrariness and discrimination, major changes are under
preparation in the Law on Internal Affairs (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.19/95,
15/97, 38/02, 33/03 and 19/04), Law on Communication Interception (in parliamentary procedure) and
other laws in this field, in terms of ensuring detailed regulation of police authorities. Changes in the
national legislation and practice in the aforementioned sense is consistent implementation of the
European standards incorporated in the various Council of Europe Recommendations, including the
concrete Recommendations resulted from the visits of the Council of Europe’s Committee for
Prevention of Torture.
In 2004, the Code of Police Ethics (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 03/04) was
adopted, which determines the mode of conduct, operation and goals of police; relations between the
police and the judicial bodies; police interventions; responsibilities and control of police and other
issues relevant for the enhancement of the democratic role of police in a legal state (for more details
see 24_Annex_05). Besides the efforts at the normative level, significant measures have been
undertaken for enhancement of the internal control within the Ministry of the Interior and for provision
of training of police in the human rights sphere.
Important segment in the overall strategy of the Ministry has been the preventive aspect. It has been
implemented through additional and continuing education of the members of the Ministry in the
protection and respect of human rights and freedoms. The training has been continuously carried out
with the current police officers. It will also be part in the future education and police training at the
Police Academy. An integral part of the education has been the instruction in the international and
national instruments addressing human dignity, right to life, right to personal integrity, prohibition of
torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

275/453

The Government of the Republic of Macedonia is actively co-operating with the European Committee
Against Torture (CPT). The Committee has hitherto had three regular visits to the Republic of
Macedonia in 1998, 2001 and 2002 and three extraordinary in 2001, 2002 and 2004. The
Government of the Republic of Macedonia has requested publication of all Reports and Comments of
the Committee, except for the report based on the Committee’s last visit in July 2004, which has been
submitted to the Government at the end of November. The Government has thus demonstrated its
strong commitment to address the issues identified by the CPT.
On 10.02.2003, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia reviewed and adopted the Information
on the CPT's Report on Macedonia of July 2002 and the preliminary remarks on the visit in November
2002, in order to realise one of the key Recommendations of the Committee, which establishes that
the national authorities must give a formal statement aimed at law enforcement officers saying that
abuse of detainees is contrary to fundamental freedoms and rights, and shall not be tolerated. At the
same time, several Conclusions have been adopted with regard to the improvement of the
government’s co-operation with the CPT as well as the conclusion asserting that the harassment of
detainees by law enforcement officers is contrary to the basic principles and values upon which the
democratic society rests, that such phenomena shall not be tolerated and that the offenders shall be
subjects to rigorous punishment determined by law.
The main Recommendations of the Committee refer to two key issues: managing impunity and
protection measures against harassment.
The Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Justice have undertaken several activities in order to
overcome the detected problems.
The European Partnership Action Programme, in the part related to human rights, has given
emphasis on the implementation of the Recommendations contained in the Reports of the CPT’s
visits to the Republic of Macedonia, and before all the Recommendations on managing impunity and
protection measures against harassment. Another key activity is a continuous training in all
institutions involved in the implementation of the foregoing convention.
The main activities with regard to the impunity are the following: submitting annual Reports to the
Government on Detected Cases of Exceeding of Authorities; submitting Annual Reports to the
Government on the Disciplinary and Criminal Procedures Undertaken; improvement of the cooperation with the public prosecutor’s office and the courts of law for the resolution of such cases;
strengthening of the capacities of the Professional Standards Unit at the Ministry of the Interior for
detection and investigation of irregularities; improvement of the procedures for detection and
investigation of irregularities and their implementation.
The Implementation of the Convention, with regard to protection measures against harassment,
envisages the following: improvement of procedures for arrest and detention in police stations and
prisons; keeping records on cases of violated procedures during arrest and detention; undertaking
measures for the resolution of such cases; full respect of persons deprived of freedom; and training
of police officers to comply with legal rights of detainees during a 24 hour detention.
12. Please provide information on specific national legislative as well as administrative
measures designed to prevent the occurrence of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment in state institutions, prisons or police stations etc. In this respect, what measures
are in place providing for the inspections of detention centres or police stations? Is legal
redress foreseen for victims?
The prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment is
provided in Article 11 of the Constitution (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91,
01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), according to which: The human right to physical and moral dignity is
irrevocable. Any form of torture, or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is prohibited.
Article 54, paragraph 4 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia rules out any restrictions to
this right.
The Republic оf Macedonia has signed and ratified the following international instruments: of the UN
Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“Official

276/453

Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 9/91); the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture
and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment – Council of Europe (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 23/97); and the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedom – Council of Europe (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No. 11/97).
The Criminal Code (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 37/96, 80/99, 42/2002, 43/2003
and 19/2004) in Chapter 15 titled “Crimes against Freedoms and Rights of Individuals and Citizens”
contains a new Article 142, which reads:
An authorised official, a person induced by an official person, or a person who upon a consent by

physical or mental pain in order to punish a person for a crime that he/she has perpetrated or
been accused of, or with the intention to intimidate or force a person give up a right, or causes
such pain due to any form of discrimination, shall be punished with imprisonment of one to five
years.

Article 15 of the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
15/97, 44/02 and 74/04) determines unconditional exclusion of all illegally obtained evidence,
prescribing that evidence collected in an illegal mode by a violation of freedoms and rights as
determined by the Constitution, laws and ratified international treaties, as well as evidence arising
thereafter, may not be used in court. The Law on Criminal Procedure also determines the modes of
interrogation of the accused; prescribing that in the course of interrogation his/her personality must
be fully respected. At the same time the Law prohibits the use of force, threats or similar means used
to obtain his/her confession. Article 251, Paragraph 2 explicitly prohibits the use of medical
interventions and means against the accused or the witness that would influence their will upon
giving statements. If these prohibitions are violated, the statement of the accused or the witness may
not be subject to court decision i.e. it is an essential violation of the provisions of the criminal
procedure against which an appeal may be filed.
Article 195, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Law on Criminal Procedure prescribes that representatives of
the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
Punishment of the Council of Europe (CPT) have a right to visit detainees and communicate with
them without surveillance and upon an approval of the investigative judge, who is obliged to issue
such approval. According to paragraph 5 of the same Article, Red Cross representatives are entitled
to visit detainees and communicate with them without surveillance and upon the judge’s approval.
Article 20, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 5 of the Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04) determines that the public prosecutor is obliged to
observe the consistent implementation of judgements passed for punishable acts and the protection
of persons who have been detained.
At the same time, Article 39 of the Law on Movement and Residence of Aliens (“Official Gazette of
the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/92, 26/93 and 45/02) - regulating the modes of enforcement
security measures of expelling an alien, determines that an alien may not be forcibly expelled from
the Republic of Macedonia into another country if such expulsion would result in torture or inhuman
treatment.
The prohibition of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment has an absolute
character and therefore the violation of this prohibition may not be justified by an execution of a
superior’s order. In that respect Article 6 of the Law on Internal Affairs (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 19/95, 55/97, 38/2002, 33/2003 and 19/2004) prescribes that an
employee of the Ministry of the Interior is obliged to execute the orders of the Minister or of a person
delegated by the Minister related to execution of the Ministry’s operations, unless such execution of
orders is a criminal offence. The Rulebook on Modes of Executing the Duty of a Guard in Prisons
contains the same provision. Pursuant to the Law on Defence (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 42/01 and 05/03) the orders of a superior warrant officer shall not be executed if
their execution is a criminal offence.
The Criminal Code of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
No. 37/96, 80/99, 04/02, 43/03 and 19/04) prescribes that a subordinate shall not be punished for a
criminal act if it has been perpetrated upon the superior’s order in the line of duty, unless the order
has been aimed at perpetrating a war crime or any other severe crime or if the subordinate had been
aware that the execution would lead to a criminal offence.
The legislation of the Republic of Macedonia explicitly determines the conditions under which the
police and security services may apply coercion methods. Pursuant to Article 34 of the Law on
Internal Affairs, the authorised official person may use coercion methods for the purpose of: а)
restoring law and order after a large-scale disorder; b) overpowering a person disturbing the public
peace and order or a person upon arrest; c) rejecting an attack from another person or a defending a
guarded facility; d) forcible removal of persons from a certain place, or a person not obeying orders of
an official person. Authorised official persons carrying out official duties under direct supervision of a
superior may use coercion means only upon the superior’s order. If the means of coercion or firearms

278/453

are used within authorised limits, the responsibility of the authorised official person who used them
shall be excluded as well as the responsibility of the person in charge who ordered such use.
Any case of use of firearms by an authorised officer shall be investigated and assessed by the Sector
of Internal Control and Professional Standards. The manner of using firearms and coercion means by
police officers has been regulated by an Instruction adopted by the Minister of the Interior.
Pursuant to Article 65 of the Law on Internal Affairs, acting in violation of rules and regulations of the
Ministry or performing activities that are criminal offences (crimes against freedoms and rights of
individuals and citizens, severe crimes against life and body), is a violation of the working discipline,
which in accordance with the Law on Internal Affairs is an obstacle to employment in the Ministry. In
the event of a more severe violation of the working discipline, the employee may be temporarily
removed from the office, and he/she may be dismissed. Severer cases of working discipline violation
due to which the employee has been removed from office, the dismissal period and cases when such
right is not exercised are regulated by an act of the Minister.
The Law on Execution of Sanctions (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 3/97,
23/99, 74/04) in Article 184 paragraph 1 and Article 185 determines the limits to using force. The
conditions under which a convicted person may be subject to coercion means are: when it is
necessary to prevent his/her escape from prison or during arrest, in case of physical attacks, inflicting
injury, self-injuring, inflicting material damages, or when overpowering convicted persons upon the
order of an official person. The Law also defines the means of coercion: separation from a crowd,
handcuffing, use of truncheons, water cannons and chemical substances.
Article 19, paragraph 4 explicitly forbids collective punishment of convicted persons as well as use of
coercion means as punishment.
The mode of using force and firearms are laid down in detail in the Guidelines on the Use of Firearms
and Means of Coercion. A Report shall be created on the use of coercion means stating the reasons
for such use. The Report is submitted to the Ministry of Justice - Directorate of Execution of
Sanctions authorised to assess the justification of the use of force. If the means of coercion are used
pursuant to the Law, the responsibility of the authorised official who used them or ordered such use
is excluded. However, if it is determined that in the course of the use of coercion means authorities
have been exceeded, the official shall be subject to a disciplinary measure.
With regard to the disciplinary responsibility of the members of security service and the prison
personnel, in general, the Law on the Execution of Sanctions (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 03/97, 23/99 and 74/04) points to the general labour regulations, i.e. Law on
Labour Relations (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 80/93, 3/94, 14/95, 53/97,
59/97, 21/98, 25/00, 34/00, 50,01, 25/03 40/03 and 80/03-consolidated text) and Law on
Organisation and Operation of State Administrative Bodies (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 58/00 and 44/02). These Laws stipulate disciplinary responsibility of an employee
for violation of working duties or other violations of working discipline, when these have been his/her
fault, and in particular when he/she has performed the duties in a negligent manner, if he/she has not
abided by laws and other regulations and rules of conduct during working hours or in relation with
his/her work.
Heads of diplomatic and consular missions may visit foreign citizens that have been detained
following an approval of the investigative judge in the Republic of Macedonia. These visits may not
be supervised.
The treatment of persons serving a sentence has been regulated by the Law on Execution of
Sanctions, which contains an explicit provision in Article 12, Paragraph 2 prohibiting torture, inhuman
or degrading treatment or punishment of prisoners. The principle of humaneness in execution of
criminal sanctions has been stipulated in several provisions of the law.
Special provisions have regulated the disciplinary punishment of convicted persons in the Law on
Execution of Sanctions prescribing the types of disciplinary punishments, conditions on applying such
punishments and modes of execution.

279/453

The convicted person who seriously endangers the security of the institution or endangers the
security of other persons may be subject to solitary confinement if other disciplinary measures have
proved unsuccessful. The Director of the Directorate orders the placing in solitary confinement for
Execution of Sanctions. The convicted person may appeal against this decision to the Minister of
Justice within three days. The appeal does not postpone the execution of the decision. The
procedure on deciding upon the appeal is urgent.
The Law on Execution of Sanctions contains special provisions that regulate the conduct of
authorised officials toward convicted persons. Article 159 determines that officials persons in the line
of duty must treat convicted persons with respect, tolerance, seriousness and with a necessary
firmness and equity in order to encourage their self-esteem and a sense of personal responsibility.
Official persons must carry out their duties honourably and impartially, in good faith, regardless of
position, gender, race, ethnicity, religious confession or political convictions of the convicted persons.
In addition, the Law on Execution of Sanctions contains special provisions pertaining to the protection
of rights of prisoners by the use of legal remedies. Article 163 stipulates that they are entitled to file
complaints and other submissions to protect their rights related to their position and treatment in the
institution and are entitled to discretion rights.
Information and training of police officers with regard to prohibition of torture is part of their education
and training system. The Program has been prepared in the context of the legislation in force in the
Republic of Macedonia and is implemented at all levels of police education in order to stimulate the
development of civilised, well-mannered and humane relations between the police and citizens. The
Police Academy puts special emphasis in their curricula on the humane aspects of treating citizens,
and respecting their dignity.
With regard to training of institutional personnel, it is important to note that the Ministry of Justice and
the Directorate for Execution of Sanctions regularly organise courses and seminars for the purpose
of a successful, efficient and lawful execution of the operations at confinement institutions. The
Ministry of Justice carries out this activity in cooperation with the Association of Penology of the
Republic of Macedonia. In addition, in cooperation with the OSCE, a pilot project has been created
for the establishment of a training centre as an organised form of training and education of
employees in confinement institutions, using expert knowledge and experiences of foreign experts in
the field.
Given that a medical treatment may also endanger the individual's physical integrity, Article 50 of the
Law on Healthcare stipulates: surgical and other interventions may only be undertaken with a prior
consent of the ill person, or the parent or the custodian if he/she is a juvenile or disabled.
If in the course or after the treatment permanent consequences occur (disability), the patient or
his/her family have a right to request inquiry regarding the health care he/she has received. In
accordance with Article 55 of the Law, the beneficiary of healthcare has a right to request
compensations to damages pursuant to regulations on obligations if they have been inflicted due to
errors or inadequate treatment. The State Sanitary and Health Inspectorate carries out inspection
supervision in mental health institutions. The inspectors are professional doctors bound by both
medical deontology and the Code of Civil Servants.
The Law on Healthcare offers possibilities not only for legal remedies but also for expert supervision
of the work of professional healthcare workers. The Strategy on Promotion of Mental Health and the
Law on Mental Health are expected to improve the protection and exercise of rights in this field.
The Criminal Code criminalises the unconscientious treatment of ill persons. In addition, the Code
criminalises the deeds not providing medical assistance; and quackery.
An important novelty is Article 20 of the Law on Execution of Sanctions determining that the prisoners
may not be subject to medical or other experiments that degrade their physical, mental and moral
integrity and that the convicted persons' consent to participate does not exclude the responsibility of
the person who had approved the experiments.

280/453

The Law on Criminal Procedure in Article 251 stipulates that a person may be subject to physical
examination without his/her consent if such examination is necessary for the establishment of facts
important for the criminal procedure. Physical examination of other persons may be performed
without their consent only if it has to be determined whether certain marks or consequences of a
criminal act can be found on their bodies. Medical interventions or use of means to influence the will
of accused persons or witnesses upon giving statements are prohibited.
The Law on Scientific and Research Activities (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia, Nos.
13/96 and 29/02) stipulates the principle of inviolability of human integrity, the protection of
personality and human dignity and the principle of ethics as main principles in the execution of
scientific researches. The Code of Medical Deontology (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 24/95) adopted by the Chamber of Medical Doctors of Macedonia contains detailed
provisions on bio-medical researches.
The conditions on taking, exchanging, transporting and transplanting parts of human body for the
purpose of medical treatment have been regulated by a special Law. The unauthorised
transplantation of parts of the human body is a crime pursuant to Article 210 of the Criminal Code.
Victims of torture and other forms of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment may exercise
their rights pursuant to Article 50 of the Constitution according to which every citizen may invoke the
protection of freedoms and rights set forth in the Constitution, before the courts of law in a procedure
based upon principles of priority and urgency.
In cases when torture and other forms of inhuman treatment have elements of a criminal offence,
victims of crimes may file criminal charges to the public prosecutor, while acts subject to private
lawsuit may be filed to the court of law. In cases of criminal acts subject to prosecution ex officio, if
the public prosecutor drops the charges, the victim has a right to take over the prosecution as a
subsidiary prosecutor. If as a result of a criminal act the person has been damaged, he/she has a
right to file a damages claim, and if he/she is referred to a lawsuit the case shall be resolved in a civil
suit in accordance with general provisions on indemnity.
In cases of torture or other forms of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment by authorised
official, the protection may be sought from the Ombudsman, Articles 24, 31, 32 from the Law on the
Ombudsman (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 60/03), who in accordance with
the Constitution protects the freedoms and rights of citizens when they are violated by an act or
activity of state administrative bodies or bodies and organisations with public mandates. If the
Ombudsman detects violation, he/she may propose an initiation of a disciplinary measure against the
official, or may file a request to the public prosecutor on initiation of criminal proceedings against that
person.
13. Is there any independent body which oversees the conditions in such institutions? Give
details on disciplinary and criminal sanctions for State agents accused of ill treatment or
torture during the exercise of their duties.
Pursuant to the Law on the Ombudsman (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No 60/03),
the Ombudsman is an independent and autonomous body authorised to monitor the respect and
protection of constitutional and legal rights of persons in institutions and organisations where their
freedom of movement has been restricted. This especially refers to apprehended, detained and
imprisoned persons serving a sentence or a correctional measure in penitentiary or correctional
institution (Articles 31, paragraphs 1 and 2).
The Ombudsman may carry out visits and inspections anytime without prior announcement or
approval; he/she may talk to persons placed in these institutions or organisations without the
presence of official persons; and he/she may receive submissions from persons deprived of liberty in
a closed envelope and send them answers that may not be inspected by official persons (Article 31,
paragraphs 3 and 4).

281/453

In practice, the Ombudsman has not been facing obstacles in carrying out such authorities. In
accordance with its own Working Programme and legal authorities, the Ombudsman has visited such
organisations or institutions at least once a year, for which he/she submits an annual report to the
Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia.
In addition, pursuant to Article 195, paragraph 3 and 4, the Law Amending the Law on Criminal
Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 74/04), detained persons may be
visited by members of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) as well as members of the International Committee of the
Red Cross. Upon the CPT’s request, the investigative judge is obliged to approve them a visit and
communication with detained persons. These visits may not be supervised. Foreign citizens that
have been detained following an approval of the investigative judge may be visited by heads of
diplomatic and consular missions in the Republic of Macedonia.
Concerning the issue on whether disciplinary and penal measures have been undertaken for
misconduct or torture by official persons to persons confined in organisations or institutions, from
01.01.2002 to 30.09.2004, the Ombudsman filed 4 criminal charges against officials from the Ministry
of the Interior and one proposal for initiation of disciplinary measures.
Namely, performing his/her duties in the protection of human rights, and implementing his/her legal
authorities pursuant to Article 32 of the Law, the Ombudsman has filed a proposal on initiation of
proceedings against one official of the Ministry of the Interior for determining his/her disciplinary
responsibility due to exceeding the limit of authorisation. The Ombudsman has been notified that
charges have been pressed to the competent public prosecutor against this individual. At the same
time the Ombudsman has filed three indictments against nine officials of the Ministry of the Interior
due to a reasonable doubt that they had committed crimes of torture pursuant to Article 142, violence
pursuant to Article 386 and abuse of official duty pursuant to Article 143 of the Criminal Code of the
Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” Nos. 37/96, 80/99, 04/02,
43/03 and 19/04). One person has been found guilty by the Basic Court II in Skopje; two persons are
under investigation before the Basic Court II in Skopje; five are in criminal proceedings before the
Basic Court in Kumanovo; and a pre-trial procedure against one person has been conducted by the
Basic Public Prosecutor of Prilep.
The Directorate for Execution of Sanctions, according to data received from penitentiary institutions
in the Republic of Macedonia and from the Educational and Correctional Institute in Tetovo, has not
reported disciplinary measures in the course of 2001, 2002, and 2003 against employees for abuse
of powers pertaining to inhuman treatment or torture of convicted or detained persons. An exception
is the disciplinary measure currently underway against three employees in the Penitentiary
Institution-Idrizovo for determining their responsibility in their line of duty due to exceeding authorities
for the use of truncheons.
It is important to note that the reports hitherto published by the European Committee for the
Prevention of Torture have not detected forms of physical abuses of detainees by the prison staff.
14. In the fields of medicine and biology, do precise rules exist which indicate what is and
what is not permitted? Are these rules subject to a permanent monitoring process, in
particular with regard to the right to integrity of the person?
Pursuant to Article 11, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), human physical
and moral integrity is irrevocable. Article 39 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia
guarantees every citizen the right to health care.
Pursuant to the Law on Health Care (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 38/91,
46/93, 55/95, 17/97-consolidated text and 10/04) surgical and other medical interventions are
undertaken only upon written consent of the hospitalised person, or his/her parent or custodian if
he/she is a juvenile or has been deprived of civil capacity. If the sick person or his/her parent or

282/453

custodian does not agree with the suggested surgical or other intervention, the competent physician
is obliged to inform him/her about the consequences that might arise due to his/her refusal of medical
or other intervention. In addition, the physician may request a written statement or may write an
official note.
Patients are obliged to adhere to internal rules of the health organisation and guidelines given by
health workers. Otherwise, the health institution may refuse to provide health treatment, except in
cases of emergency treatments, communicable disease subject to mandatory reporting, mental
illness, or if the sick person is a juvenile.
The Ministry of Health is authorised to supervise the professional conduct.
Special rules exist in the field of taking, exchange, transport and transplantation of human body parts
for medicinal purposes, prescribed by the Law on Conditions for Taking, Exchange, Transport and
Transplantation of Human Body Parts for Medicinal Purposes (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 30/95).
The Law determines that individuals, while still living, and if adult and sane, may donate any parts of
their body for medical purposes, if it does not seriously endanger their health. As an exception, bone
marrow donors may also be juveniles, and their biological parents may only give the consent.
The transplantations of human body parts, pursuant to the Law may be carried out only by written
consent of the recipient, after he/she has been informed about the potential risks to his/her health. If
the recipient is a juvenile or a mentally ill person or is not in a condition to express his/her will due to
his/her condition, written consent on transplantation is given by his parent or custodian. The written
consent of the donor and the recipient is valid only if given voluntarily and after the nature and
purpose of donating and transplantation, the involved risks and the success probability have been
explicated.
The Law also determines that no monetary or property compensations may be requested for the
donation of organs, including services or any other benefits.
The Law on Conditions for Taking, Exchange, Transfer and Transplantation of Parts of Human Body
for Medical Treatment is in line with the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of
the Human Being with Regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine: Convention on Human
Rights and Biomedicine of Oviedo, 04.04.1997, entered into force on 01.12.1999, that the Republic of
Macedonia signed on 04.04.1997, although it still has not been ratified.
The Republic of Macedonia signed on 15.03.2002 (though still not ratified) also the Additional
Protocol to the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine, on Transplantation of Organs and
Tissues of Human Origin. This Protocol regulates in more detailed manner not only the medicinal, but
also ethical and other aspects of transplantation of human organs. The Law on Conditions for Taking,
Exchange, Transfer and Transplantation of Parts of Human Body for Medical Treatment complies
with the principles of this Protocol (although the latter has been more recent than the Law and has
not still entered into force), in particular in setting forth that the transplantation shall be done only for
the purpose of medical treatment, in stipulating the mandatory consent of the donor and in prohibiting
that transplantation yields financial gain.
Solutions included in the Law are also in line with the Guiding Principles on Human Organ
Transplantation (World Health Organisation, 1991), in particular Principles Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and
9.
The Ministry of Health performs control over the implementation of the Law.
Legal protection from non-compliance with provisions of the Law Regarding Conditions on Taking,
Exchange, Transport and Transplantation of Human Body Parts for Medicinal Purposes has been
regulated by Article 210 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 37/96, 80/99, 4/02, 43/03 and 19/04), which stipulates that a person
who takes a part from the body of another for the purpose of transplantation, or who transplants a
part of the body even though the taking or the transplantation is contrary to the medical profession or
science, shall be punished with imprisonment of three months to five years. The same punishment

283/453

shall be applied to a person who, with the intention of transplantation, takes a part of the human body
intended for transplantation before death has been determined in a prescribed manner.
Simultaneously, the Criminal Code prescribes a fine or imprisonment of up to three years for a
person who takes a part of the body of another or who transplants a part of the body, without consent
from the donor or the recipient, or of their legal representative. The same punishment also applies to
a person who contrary to the law, for compensation, sells or mediates in the giving of parts of the
body of living or deceased persons for the purpose of transplantation.
The prohibition of conducting medical or other experiments also applies to convicted persons.
Namely, Article 20 of the Law on Execution of Sanctions (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 03/97, 23/99 and 74/04) prescribes that convicted persons are entitled to health
care. Convicted persons may not be subject to medical or other experiments that degrade their
physical, mental or moral integrity.
Regarding medicine, Article 64 of the Law on Drugs, Additional Medicines and Medical Instruments
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 21/98) determines that clinical drug testing may
be conducted in accordance with ethical principles laid down in the Helsinki Declaration on the
Protection of Patients’ Rights. Clinical testing may only be conducted by an authorised health
institution that is obliged to acquire written consent of persons subject to drug testing prior to the
testing and to obtain written proof that the persons had been informed about the purpose of the
testing and the possible risks to their health. Drug inspectors that are authorised to halt a clinical
testing of a drug in the event that the testing had begun prior to the fulfilment of the stipulated
conditions carry out the control of implementation of the Law.
Penal protection has been provided by misdemeanour provisions that prescribe a fine of 80.000150.000 MKD to the legal entity, or 10.000-30.000 MKD to the responsible person in the legal entity
performing clinical testing contrary to ethical principles. Same applies if he/she starts clinical testing
of a drug without written consent of persons subject to testing. Apart from a fine, the responsible
person in the legal entity shall be punished with a provisional ban on performing operations from
three months to one year.
In relation to the protection of personality and integrity, worth mentioning is that the Republic of
Macedonia on 12.01.1998 signed (though has not ratified yet) the Additional Protocol to the
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the
Application of Biology and Medicine, on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Beings, of Paris,
12.01.1998, that entered into force on 01.03.2001.
15. Has the Republic of Macedonia established specialised services specifically designed to
combat trafficking in human beings? If so, what are the institutional context, the composition,
the functions and the powers of these services?
In 2002, the National Programme for Fight Against Trafficking in Human Beings and Illegal Migration
in the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 10/2002) was
adopted, providing for legislative and preventive actions; help and support for victims of trafficking in
human beings; return and reintegration of victims; international cooperation and coordination in
enforcing laws; staff education, coordination of actions and informative advertising influence on the
public opinion on trafficking in human beings. It also determines the carriers of these activities. The
carriers of activities are determined in accordance with the legally established competencies of the
Law on Organization and Operation of State Administrative Bodies (“Official Gazette of the Republic
of Macedonia”, Nos. 58/00 and 44/02).
In accordance with the National Programme and the competencies of state administrative bodies
determined by law, most of the provided activities are within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the
Interior of the Republic of Macedonia, i.e. the organisation units in this Ministry authorised to fight
against trafficking in human beings, smuggling of migrants and illegal migration (for more details see
24_E_2).

284/453

A specialised Section for Trafficking in Human Beings and Other Violent Crime is established under
the Sector for Violent Crime - responsible body for the prevention, detection, documenting and
processing criminal offences in trafficking in human beings and illegal migration. The Sector is within
the Ministry of the Interior’s Department for Organised Crime.
This Section acts upon criminal offences in the field of trafficking in human beings, i.e. undertakes
measures and actions to discover the perpetrators of such criminal activity. It also coordinates the
work among the Sectors within Ministry of the Interior, which operate on local level. The authorised
officers, within their duties, collect operative information upon which they undertake adequate legal
actions against perpetrators of crimes, i.e. file criminal charges to the Basic Public Prosecutor, who
will thereafter process the act before the competent courts.
The Ministry of the Interior is also responsible for the establishment of appropriate databases of the
perpetrators of this kind of criminal offences and databases of the victims of trafficking in human
beings, as well as databases for the identified illegal migrants.
If it is established that a case involves victims of trafficking in human beings, they will be
accommodated in the Transit Centre for Aliens, opened in March 2001. There are standard operative
procedures for processing victims in the Transit Centre, regulating the relations of the Ministry of the
Interior, the International Organisation for Migrations and NGOs involved in the work of the Centre.
In addition to the Section for Trafficking in Human Beings, in the field of fighting trafficking in human
beings within the Ministry of the Interior there are a total of 20 operative workers treating this issue.
In April 2003, a Unit for Fighting Trafficking in Human Beings with jurisdiction over the entire territory
of the Republic of Macedonia was established within the Ministry upon an Order by the Minister of
the Interior. This unit consists of officers with different ethnic background and has a total of 45 staff. It
contains 32 people from the Special Task Unit and the Police Department, and 13 members of the
Department of Organised Crime.
On 12.02.2002, within the Ministry of the Interior, with a Decision brought by the Minister, a
Commission for Deciding Upon Requests for Approval of Residence on the Grounds of Employment
as Dancers, Waitresses etc. in Night Clubs and Other Catering Facilities was established. This is a
Multi-Sector Commission and was formed in order to establish stricter control of employment in
catering facilities on the quoted grounds, and also to prevent any possible attempts at corruption in
the competent sectors in the Ministry.
Within the Border Police Department, established in May 2004, in the Sector for Support of Border
Operations – the Section for Illegal Immigration has four operative inspectors.
In accordance with the National Programme for Fight of Trafficking in Human Beings and Illegal
Migration in the Republic of Macedonia, the carrier of the legislative activity is the Ministry of Justice,
working on preparing amendments to criminal legislation. The Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of
Labour and Social Policy and the Ministry of Health are responsible for amending, i.e. making the
penal provisions more stringent in the field of market, sanitary and labour inspection and modification
of the legal regulations with respect to the special conditions for employing foreign citizens, as well as
the conditions for granting approval for temporary residence for employment.
The following are responsible for international cooperation and coordination in enforcing legal acts:
the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Their activities
include concluding of bilateral and multilateral agreements with states to and from which people are
subject to trafficking in human beings, promoting communication and cooperation among public
prosecutor’s offices and the police services in the states of Southeast Europe; for the purpose of
efficient criminal prosecution and closing channels for trafficking in human beings, exchanging data
on criminal groups and individuals with other countries; and cooperation with the appropriate
government and non-governmental organisations.

285/453

In 2001, by the way of a Decision of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, the National
Commission on Fight Against Trafficking in Human Beings and Illegal Migration (“Official the of
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 18/01) was formed, involving representatives from the Ministry of the
Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, Ministry
of Health and the Ministry of Finance – Customs Administration. Within this Commission a
Subsection for Fighting Trafficking in Children was formed in January 2004.
The National Commission on Fighting Trafficking in Human Beings and Illegal Migration is a
coordinative body responsible for monitoring and analysing the situation of trafficking in human
beings and illegal migration and coordination of the activities of the competent institutions in the
Republic of Macedonia which actively work on solving the problems in this field, as well as to adopt
strategic determinations.
In order to establish an appropriate method of cooperation and a constructive approach in the joint
action of national authorities, international organisations and the NGO sector in fighting trafficking in
human beings and illegal migration in the Republic of Macedonia, the National Commission has
adopted a Decision establishing a Secretariat of the National Commission. The Secretariat works
within the jurisdiction of the National Commission and it is a technical and logistical body with an
operative function in the process of implementation of the National Programme on Fighting
Trafficking in Human Beings and Illegal Migration.
On the Organisation and mode of work of the Secretariat for more details see 24_E_2.
16. Please provide information on any legislative measures designed to protect and uphold
respect for private and family life, home and communications. In which circumstances can
these rights be infringed upon?
Everyone enjoys protection of privacy directly invoking Article 8 of the European Human Rights
Convention and Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified
international treaties, which according to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) are part of the
domestic legal order and are directly applicable by courts and the state administration. As different
from the European Human Rights Convention that summarises protection of privacy in one provision,
the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia guarantees privacy in several provisions of the
Chapter on Basic Human Rights and Freedoms. The provisions on respect for privacy of the personal
and family life of the individual and his/her dignity and reputation contained in Article 25 of the
Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia provide for a wide framework for protection of privacy.
Several very important aspects of privacy are protected by specific constitutional provisions related
to the freedom and confidentially of correspondence and other forms of communication (Article 17 of
the Republic of Macedonia); security and privacy of personal information (Article 18 of the
Constitution) and inviolability of the home (Article 26 of the Constitution of the Republic of
Macedonia).
As designed, these provisions reaffirm the positive obligation of the state to establish legislation that
would not prevent individuals in the choice of (private) lifestyle, i.e. legislation that would ensure that
relevant family ties are feasible; that would make available effective legal remedies for those who
consider that their right to respect for privacy of personal and family life has been violated; and that
would facilitate access to information related to facts of the concerned person’s previous life and to
decisions that directly affect him/her; and that would ensure control of information, which could affect
someone else’s life.
In the context of protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms, Article 18 of the Constitution
of the Republic of Macedonia guarantees security and privacy of personal information. The same
Article guarantees citizens protection from violation of the personal integrity, deriving from the
registering of personal information through data processing.

286/453

Aimed at ensuring privacy and confidentiality of personal information, which are subject to collection,
processing, storing, using and exchange in the form of automated or hand kept databases, the
Republic of Macedonia adopted a Law on Personal Data Protection in 1994 (amended in 2002).
The said Law regulated rights and obligations of persons handling the databases and data securing;
the rights, limitations and court protection of rights of persons to whom the data are related; the
manner of establishing and maintaining the databases; transferring data outside the Republic of
Macedonia; and the manner of supervising the legality of collecting, processing, storage, use and
transfer of personal data in the Republic of Macedonia.
However, the harmonisation of the national legislation with the Directive 95/46/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 24.10.1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data imposed the need for adopting a
new Law on Personal Data Protection, that has been recently enacted (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 07/05). In respect of the legal solutions offered in the new Law on
Personal Data Protection for more details see I_H_39.
Reaffirming fundamental human rights and freedoms, the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia
in Article 26 guarantees the inviolability of the home. The right to inviolability of the home may by
restricted only by a court decision in cases of detection or prevention of criminal offences or
protection of people’s health. (Article 26, paragraph 2). The Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02 and 74/04) defines the cases in which the
right, i.e., principle of inviolability of the home may be infringed upon. According to the Law on
Criminal Procedure a search of the home or other facilities of the accused or of other person may be
conducted if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the search will result in apprehension of the
accused or that traces of the criminal offence shall be found or objects of importance for the criminal
proceedings (Article 198). According to the provisions of the Law on Criminal Procedure, the search
is ordered by the court in a written, elaborated order, which explicitly designates the place and the
person to be searched, as well as the objects, which are searched for or confiscated from the person
(Article 199, paragraph 1). The search warrant is shown before the search to the person who
personally or whose home will be searched. Before the search, the person to whom the search
warrant refers will be asked voluntarily to turn in the person or give away objects which are searched
for. (Article 199, paragraph 2) However, the search may be conducted without prior presentation of a
search warrant and without previous request for turning over the person or objects if an armed
resistance is presumed or when suspecting that a severe crime is conducted by a group or
organisation it is considered necessary to conduct the search suddenly or if the search is to be
performed in public premises. (Article 199, paragraph 3).
The householder or the holder of other premises will be summoned to be present at the search, and
if he/she is absent his/her authorised representative will be summoned or some of his/her adult
members of the family or neighbours (Article 200, paragraph 3). During the search of premises or
persons, two adult citizens will be present as witnesses. The search of a female is performed only by
a female officer, and the witnesses are also female. Before the start of the search, the witnesses will
be warned to pay attention to the performance of the search and they will be reminded of their right,
before signing the minutes for the search to write in their objections if they consider that the contents
of the minutes are incorrect (Article 200, paragraph 3).
The Law on Criminal Procedure sets forth the possibility that the search is conducted without the
presence of witnesses if their presence is not possible immediately to be provided and there is a
danger of delay. The reasons for a search without the presence of witnesses must be written in the
minutes (Article 200, paragraph 4).
The search of premises and persons is to be performed carefully without disturbing the order of the
residence (Article 200, paragraph 7). During the performance of the search, only those objects and
identity cards i.e. documents will be temporarily confiscated which are in connection with the aim of
the search in that particular case (Article 200, paragraph 8).
In accordance with the provisions of the Law on Criminal Procedure, authorised officials of the
Ministry of the Interior may, without a search warrant, enter a home or other premises if the person

287/453

who, according to the court order is to be detained or forcefully apprehended, is there. The court
order allows only entry into the home, not search.
Authorised officials of the police may, without a search warrant, and without the presence of
witnesses, perform a search of a person while enforcing a court order for apprehension or while
depriving a person from freedom if it is suspected that the person possesses arms or tools for attack
or if it is suspected that he/she will throw away, hide or destroy the objects which are to be
confiscated from him/her as evidence in the criminal procedure (Article 202, paragraph 2).
If during the search of premises and persons, objects are found which have no connection with the
crime for which the search is intended, but which point to another crime to be prosecuted ex officio,
the objects will be confiscated and a receipt for the confiscation will be immediately issued. The
public prosecutor will be immediately informed in order a criminal procedure be initiated. These
objects will be immediately returned if the public prosecutor finds that there are no grounds for
institution of a criminal procedure and there is no other lawful ground according to which those
objects should be confiscated (Article 200, paragraph 9).
The Law on Criminal Procedure prescribes the obligation that for each search of residences or
persons minutes be made. The minutes are signed by the official conducting the search, the person
at whose home or on whom the search is conducted and the persons whose presence is compulsory
(Article 201, paragraph 1). The objects and documents, which have been confiscated will be included
and notified correctly in the minutes. (Article 201, paragraph 2)
After the adoption of Amendment XIX of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia passed by the
Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia on 26.12.2003 (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 84/03) Article 17 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia was amended.
Hence, the issue of protection and freedom and inviolability of correspondence and all other forms of
communication are now differently regulated. Namely, until the latest constitutional amendment, the
law and practice in the Republic of Macedonia were not adequate since there was an unrealistic
constitutional solution, which prohibited all forms of eavesdropping and wiretapping and similar
methods of infringing upon privacy by the state. The said constitutional Amendment ensured the
grounds for precise legal regulation of the use of telephone tapping and other special investigative
measures in the fight against organised crime and strict judicial control of such measures.
The right to inviolability of correspondence and all other forms of communication may be limited only
based on a court decision, under conditions and in a procedure set forth in law, and if necessary for
prevention or detection of crimes, for purposes of instituting criminal procedures or when this is
required by the interests of the security and defence of the Republic of Macedonia.
In order to precisely regulate the conditions and procedure for communication interception, the
manner of implementing, storage and utilisation of acquired information and data, as well as the
manner of establishing control of the legality of communication interception, the Ministry of the
Interior has drafted a Law on Communication Interception, which is now in the parliamentary
procedure. The Draft Law incorporates the principle that no one shall intercept communication
without an order of the competent court, unless such acquired information is intended for or if there is
consent on the part of the person or persons involved in the communication. The Draft Law sanctions
actions that might violate the privacy of communications stipulating that the production, offering for
sale, sale and keeping of communication interception devices must be subject of an approval to be
applied for at the Ministry of the Interior.
Furthermore, the Law defines the character of the data collected under authorised communication
interception and registers kept in this respect, envisaging that such data have confidential character
and are under a special protection regime, prescribed by the Minister of the Interior, i.e. the Minster
of Defence, who adopted relevant Rulebooks, by the Minster of Justice, who adopts Court Rules of
Procedure and by the Public Prosecutor who issues Guidelines, each within the respective scope of
their competencies.

288/453

In accordance with the proposed legal provisions, the court may order communication interception
regarding a specific person when there are grounds to suspect that the person has committed a
crime for which a prison sentence of at least four years is prescribed, or if it is a matter of a crime for
which a five year prison sentence is prescribed and in respect of which there are grounds to suspect
that it has been committed or is being committed by an organised group, gang, or other crime
association. The communication interception order is issued for gathering information and evidence
necessary for the successful processing of the case in a criminal procedure, which could not be
gathered otherwise.
The competent Public Prosecutor lodges the request for communication interception to the court,
upon the Public Prosecutor’s own initiative or upon a proposal by an authorised official of the Minister
of the Interior. Furthermore, the Law explicitly designates information that the request must contain,
envisaging inter alia, that if it is necessary to enter the residence or other premises, vehicles, in order
to install, maintain, use or eliminate communication interception devices, the request must contain
specific reference to this, defining at the same time the period in which the measure will be applied.
If, based on the facts and circumstances described in the request, the investigative judge considers
that the legally prescribed conditions are met, the judge is obliged to issue a communication
interception order within 24 hours at the latest from the submission of the request. As an exception,
based on additional and elaborated written proposal for urgent adoption of the interception order, the
investigative judge shall issue a communication interception order within three hours from the
submission of the request.
If the investigative judge does not approve the request for communication interception, the competent
public prosecutor has the right to file an appeal to the criminal chamber of the competent court, within
24 hours at the latest from receiving information on non-approval of the request. The criminal
chamber will deliver a decision within 24 hours from the submission of the appeal.
However, the investigative judge will reject the request for communication interception if it is related
to the communication of the defence lawyer of the person whose communication is object of
interception, or if it is related to the communication at the official premises of the President of the
Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, then of the President of the Republic of Macedonia, the
Prime Minister of the Republic of Macedonia, or the communications at the official premises of the
members of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia.
In accordance with the proposed legal solutions, the duration of the communication interception may
not be longer than 30 days from the day of issuance of the order for communication interception.
However, a possibility is provided that this period is prolonged for another 90 days, in which regard a
request is lodged which shall contain explanation on the reasons for continuation of the
communication interception.
The Draft Law on Communication Interception contains exhaustive list of the data that the order for
communication interception must contain, and explicitly stipulates that the interception shall cease
when the expected information shall have been acquired even before the period that the court has
allowed communication interception has expired. In case it is necessary to enter the home, or other
premises or vehicles to install, maintain, use or eliminate communication surveillance devices the
order shall contain precise data on the period in which this shall be done.
In cases when the investigative judge shall issue an order for communication interception, the order
is forwarded to the competent public prosecutor who further forwards it to the Minister of the Interior.
Subsequently, the Minister adopts a ruling designating the authorised official who shall be in charge
of the implementation of relevant activities and of the communication interception devices which are
explicitly defined in the order.
When the communications are intercepted through a telecommunication system, the authorised
official designated as being in charge of the implementation of activities and of the interception
devices, is obliged to accordingly inform the telecommunication service provider. At the same time,

289/453

the responsible person of the telecommunication services provider is obliged to implement the
measures and procedures referred to in the court order, and to keep as business secret all data
contained in the court order for communication interception, based on which the activities and
procedures are applied at the telecommunication services provider.
The Law on Communication Interception prescribes the obligations of the authorised official to apply
the measures and devices referred to in the court communication interception order, by ensuring the
authenticity, entirety and security of data collected upon communication interception. In order to
accomplish the assigned task, the authorised official, by using technical means, is obliged to ensure
secure registration and storage of data collected upon communication interception. Data are
registered in their original form and are handled in accordance with a specially established regime.
The Draft Law prescribes the obligation that all data, lists and other materials, gathered upon
implementing the court communication interception order are submitted to the competent court within
the period determined in the order and that they are kept in a special folder, sealed by the judge who
has ordered communication interception. The conditions and procedure for opening the folder of
documents are also precisely defined, if the evidence gathered upon communication interception is to
be used in criminal procedures before court.
The proposed legal solutions place the investigative judge under the obligation to forward all
information acquired on the basis of the implementation of the issued order to the competent public
prosecutor who is to asses whether there are legal grounds for submission of request for institution of
an investigation.
If the public prosecutor does not submit a request for institution of an investigation within 30 days
from the day of forwarding of the information acquired upon communication interception, the court
shall adopt a decision for their destruction. The decision for destruction of the information may be
also adopted in cases when it shall be considered that the collected information is of no significance
for the proceedings, but based on a previously acquired opinion of the competent public prosecutor.
After a decision on the institution of an investigation has been adopted, the court shall summon the
person whose communication has been intercepted to appear before the court within 8 days in order
that the person is introduced with the material deriving from the interception of his/her
communications. However, the Draft Law envisages certain limitations. i.e., the accused shall not be
presented material from the folder of communication interception documents until the parts which
according to the public prosecutor could threaten the further investigation, or which could threaten in
any way the persons who have been involved in the implementation of activities and measures for
communication interception or which could threaten the interests of other person who are not
involved in the activities, are made illegible.
The basic objective that data and information acquired upon communication interception are used in
the interest and for purposes of criminal proceedings, is realised on the basis of the provisions
according to which the court may decide on the admissibility of data acquired upon communication
interception as evidence in criminal proceedings, against which the parties have the right to appeal to
the criminal chamber at the competent court, within 24 hours from the day of forwarding of the
decision. After a legally valid court decision has been adopted following criminal law proceedings,
within 15 days, the court shall adopt a decision on destruction of data. Data destruction is conducted
by a committee composed of a judge, public prosecutor, and a person authorised by the Minister of
the Interior.
The Draft Law prescribes the right to indemnity for persons whose communication has been
intercepted contrary to the provisions of the said Law. The indemnity claim is decided upon by the
court, which has adopted the communication interception order, in a summary procedure, which may
not last longer than three months. The damaged party who is not satisfied with the decision of the
court has the right to appeal to a higher instance court, within 8 days from the receipt of the court
decision. Citizens who have suffered damages owing to publishing the collected data and information
before the court has adopted a decision on the admissibility of the information as evidence in criminal

290/453

proceedings or owing to the fact that destroyed data has been published are also entitled to
indemnity. The compensation funds are paid from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia.
The Draft Law prescribes special conditions and a procedure for communication interception for
purposes of protecting the country’s security and defence, which are defined in a separate Chapter of
the Law. The Court may order interception of communication of a person regarding whom there are
reasonable grounds to suspect that prepares to commit a crime against the state, against the armed
forces or against humanity and international law.
In addition to the cases referred to above, the court may order communication interception in cases
of preparation, incitement to, organising or participation in an armed attack against the Republic of
Macedonia or in disabling the security system to perform its functions, if there is no other way of
acquiring information on such activities in order to prevent the preparation of the crime, armed attack
or disabling the security system. In the said cases, the bodies competent to lodge a request for
communication interception order are the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Defence.
The Draft Law designates the Supreme Court as the competent court to decide on the approval of
the request for communication interception, prescribing the possibility for lodging an appeal to the
Supreme Court by the entity lodging the request if the judge does not approve the request. The
decision regarding the appeal is deliberated by a three judge chamber of the Supreme Court, and the
judge who has participated in the adoption of the decision regarding the communication interception
request may not be one of those judges. This facilitates full implementation of the principle of judicial
control and protection.
The judge of the Supreme Court shall determine the necessary duration of the communication
interception measure in the order, approving the request for communication interception. However,
the interception measure may not be applied longer than three months. After the end of this period,
and based on an elaborated proposal, the judge may order that communication interception is
continued up to a year at the most, counting as well the period of the first order.
In accordance with the principle of protection of privacy, data on the person collected on the basis of
communication interception order are kept at the Ministry of the Interior, i.e. at the Ministry of
Defence under a special regime, up to a year at most, following the period designated in the court
order. Afterwards all data and materials in connection with the implementation of the court decision
are destroyed under the supervision of the judge who has adopted the order, in which respect
minutes are prepared which only register the number of the court order.
The Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, establishing a committee of five members, supervises
the implementation of the measures by the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence. The
President of the said Committee is from the ranks of the Assembly opposition party, which at the last
parliamentary elections has won the most seats (among the opposition parties), two members of the
Committee are from political parties in power, and two members are from other opposition parties
having seats at the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia.
Based on its consideration regarding the implemented communication interception measures and the
supervision of the legality of the measures applied by the Ministry of the Interior and by the Ministry
of Defence, the Committee prepares an annual report submitted to the Assembly of the Republic of
Macedonia within two months after the end of the current year.
Criminal law protection of privacy is envisaged in the Criminal Code of the Republic of Macedonia
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 37/96, 80/99, 04/02, 43/03 and 19/04) which
contains incriminations of the following criminal offences: violation of the inviolability of the home
(Article 145); illegal search (Article 146); violations of confidentially of letters and other parcels
(Article 417); unauthorised publication of personal notes (Article 148); abuse of personal data (Article
149); preventing access to public information system (Article 149-a); unauthorised disclosure of a
secret (Article 150); unauthorised wiretapping and audio recording (Article 151); unauthorised
recording (152).

17. Elaborate how the right to marry and the right to found a family is protected within your
legislation.
The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) establishes that the state provides for particular care and
protection of the family (Article 40 paragraph 1). Also, the Constitution establishes that the legal
relations in the marriage, the family and cohabitation, are regulated by law (Article 40, paragraph 2).
The right of the person to freely decide on procreation of children is regulated in Article 41 of the
Constitution, together with the provision that the Republic of Macedonia, aiming at harmonised
economic and social development, implements a humane population policy.
Regarding the relationship between the parents and the children, the Constitution in Article 40,
paragraph 3, stipulates that the parents have the right and obligation to provide for sustenance and
upbringing of their children, while the children have the duty to provide care to the old and powerless
parents. Moreover, the Republic of Macedonia provides for special protection of parentless children
and children without parental care (Article 40, paragraph 4), and it especially safeguards the
maternity, children and minors (Article 42, paragraph 1).
The Law on Family (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 80/92, 09/96, 38/04 and
83/04 – consolidated text) regulates the marriage, the family and the family relations.
The law regulates the legal prerequisites for entering into marriage. The marriage is defined as a
union of cohabitation of a man and a woman, concluded by their own freely expressed will before a
certified registrar. The marital union is based on the equality of the man and the woman, mutual
respect and support.
The Law on Family recognises the civil marriage, contracted before the competent administrative
body, while the marriage contracted according to religions customs does not have a legal effect.
However, the marital partners can perform a religious ceremony along the civil one.
A marital union can be contracted by persons of full age. A minor after the age of 16 may establish
marital union only if the competent court issues a consent through a non-litigation procedure. The
Court establishes whether the minor has reached physical and emotional maturity necessary to
exercise the rights and the obligations entered into by contract of marriage. The Court brings the
decision upon a previously obtained opinion of a healthcare institution and rendered professional
assistance in a Social Work Centre.
The Law on Family prohibits entering into a marriage union of persons within a certain degree of a
blood relationship, or in-law relationship (father-in-law and daughter-in-law, son-in-law and mother-inlaw, step-father and step-daughter, step-mother and step-son) regardless of the fact whether the
marriage on the basis of which the relationship originated had ceased to exist. The court can, in a
non-litigation procedure, and due to justified reasons, permit in-law relatives to conclude a marriage.
The Law on Family prohibits bigamy – a new marriage can not be concluded before a previously
concluded marriage is terminated.
A valid marriage can not be contracted by persons with permanent mental disorder, persons who are
not capable of judgement, and persons with severe and most severe intellectual disabilities. The
persons categorised as persons with moderate intellectual disability or people with mild intellectual
disability, as well as persons suffering from severe congenital diseases in the family, can enter into a
marriage after previously obtained opinion about the genetic structure from a competent institution
which deals with treatment of such conditions or with genetic researches.
The marital partners decide consensually on the choice of the family name they will have after the
marriage is contracted, on the joint place of residence and on the joint housekeeping.

292/453

Each of the marital partners is independent in the choice of the employment and profession. In order
to satisfy the needs of their family, the partners take care jointly, each according to their abilities and
capabilities.
The marriage is terminated by: the death of one of the marital partners; by declaring the missing
marital partner dead; by annulment of marriage; and by divorce.
The divorce procedure takes place before the basic courts. The Social Work Centre conducts the
reconciliation procedure if the parties have joint minor children, and then submits an opinion and
proposal to the court to which parent to award the custody of children for their future care, custody
and upbringing. The Law on Family arranges the extra-marital union of a man and wife, under the
condition that it lasted for at least a year, and it considers it as equal to the marital union in terms of
the right to alimony support and property relations regarding the property earned during the life of the
union.
Pursuant to the Law on Family, the family is defined as a cohabitation of parents and children and
other relatives, if they live within a same household. The family is created by giving birth to children
or by adoption. The family relations are based on equal rights, mutual respect, mutual support and
sustenance, as well as protection of interests of the minor children.
The State provides for protection of the marriage and family from dysfunctional relationships, as well
as from marital or domestic violence. In addition, the law prescribes that the state creates and
provides for scientific, economic and social conditions for family planning and for free and
responsible parenthood, while the parents have the duty to provide optimal conditions for healthy
growing and development of their child in the family and in the society.
The parenthood is established with the giving birth or adoption, while the parents have equal rights
and duties towards their children (parental rights). The relationships between the parents and the
children are based on the rights and duties of the parents to take care about the nursing, custody,
upbringing and education of their children and development of their working skills and habits. The
parental right is exercised by both parents, in accordance with the needs and interests of the children
and the interests of the society. The parents have the right and duty to represent their minor children.
18. Elaborate on the legislative structures in place to ensure protection of the right to freedom
of thought, conscience and religion.
a) Please give details and explain any limitations to this freedom which are permitted.
b) Please give information on the measures taken to prevent discrimination against religious
minorities in the Republic of Macedonia.
c) What is the constitutional status of religions in your country? Is there any state religion? Is
there a legislative framework for conscientious objection? If so, please provide details.
a)
The freedom of thought, conscience and confession of faith is guaranteed by the Constitution of the
Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01
and 84/03).
Namely, pursuant to Article 9 of the Constitution citizens of the Republic of Macedonia are equal in their
freedoms and rights, regardless of their gender, race, skin colour, ethnic or social origin, political or
religious conviction, property or social status, and they are equal before the Constitution and law.
In addition, Article 16, paragraph 1 the Constitution guarantees the freedom of conviction, conscience,
thought and public expression of thought.
Article 19, paragraph 1 and 2 of the Constitution contains special guarantee of the freedom of religious
confession, as well as the right to express one’s faith freely and publicly, individually or with others.
The right to freedom of conscience, thought, public expression of thoughts and religious confessions,
including other rights, pursuant to Article 54 of the Constitution cannot be subject to restriction and

293/453

discrimination on grounds of gender, race, skin colour, language, religion, ethnic or social origin, property
or social status. Restrictions to freedoms and rights cannot be applied to freedom of conviction, thought,
conscience, public expression of thoughts or religious confessions.
Simultaneously, these rights enjoy direct constitutional and court protection pursuant to Article 110,
Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 3 of the Constitution determining the competence of the Constitutional Court,
according to which the Constitutional Court protects the freedoms and rights of the individual and the
citizen relating to the freedom of conviction, conscience, thought and public expression of thought.
Constitutionally guaranteed rights and restrictions to religious confession have been incorporated into the
Law on Religious Communities and Religious Groups (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
No. 35/97) as specified below.
Pursuant to Article 4, Paragraph 4 of the Law, the expression of religious confession or affiliation to a
religious community or group does not release citizens from responsibilities that they have before the
Constitution, laws and other regulations.
In accordance with Article 6 of the Law, religious gatherings, religious rituals, religious press, religious
instruction, religious schools and other forms of expression of faith cannot be used for political aims, for
inciting religious, ethnic or other intolerance or for other activities prohibited by law.
Pursuant to Article 8, Paragraph 2 of the Law, one religious confession is entitled to one religious
community.
Pursuant to Article 12 of the Law, the name of the religious group should significantly differ from names of
already registered religious communities or groups. The name must indicate the fact that it is a religious
group and the religious confession it represents. The name of the religious community or group must not
contain the words Republic of Macedonia, names of other countries, names of state or public bodies and
institutions or other marks.
Pursuant to Article 16, Paragraph 2 of the Law, citizens must not be coerced to or prevented from giving
contributions for religious or humanitarian purposes. According to Paragraph 3, religious communities or
groups may not determine duties to believers for such contributions.
Pursuant to Article 18 of the Law, the practice of religious ceremonies cannot disturb public order and
peace and religious feelings and other freedoms and rights of citizens not belonging to the religious
community or group.
Pursuant to Article 20 of the Law, religious ceremonies (baptism, circumcision, etc.) for juveniles may only
be practised upon the parents’ or custodians' consent, and if the juvenile is over 10 years of age he/she
must give consent as well. These ceremonies must only be held if necessary hygienic, health or other
pre-conditions have been met.
Religious gatherings, ceremonies, press, instruction, schools and other forms of expression of the faith
may not be used for political goals, for inciting religious, ethnic or other intolerance and for other activities
prohibited by law. The organisation of religious gatherings and attendance of religious manifestations,
pursuant to Article 21 of the Law may be prohibited by the internal affairs body in cases when measures
have been undertaken for the protection of citizens’ health, public order and peace, safety and larger
properties. This prohibition shall last until such circumstances have ended.
The constitutionally guaranteed right of citizens to establish private educational institutions at all education
levels with the exception of primary education (Article 45 of the Constitution) is, among others, also
specified through the Law on Religious Communities and Religious Groups, which determines that
religious communities and groups have a right to establish religious schools and student dormitories at all
education levels, except in the primary education. Prior consent from the competent body on issues of
religious communities and groups is obligatory for the establishment of such institutions. Religious
schools may be attended by persons with completed mandatory primary education or persons whose

294/453

obligation to attend mandatory primary education has ended as prescribed by law. An instructor in a
religious school may only be a citizen of the Republic of Macedonia. By derogation, a foreign citizen may
also teach at religious schools, with a certificate obtained from the competent body on issues of religious
communities and groups (Articles 24, 25, 26 and 27).
b)
The Law on Religious Communities and Religious Groups contains provisions prohibiting discrimination
against religious minorities in the Republic of Macedonia.
Pursuant to Article 2 of the Law, religious communities or religious groups are free to practise religious
activities and religious ceremonies. The Law contains explicit prohibition of any type of coercion or
obstruction upon citizens to become members of a religious community or group. Furthermore, citizens
must not be coerced to participate or not participate in religious ceremonies or other types of expression
of faith, and they cannot be deprived of constitutional and legal rights due to religious convictions,
affiliation to a religious community or a religious group, performing or participating in religious ceremonies
and other ways of expression of faith (Article 4).
Pursuant to Article 7 of the Law, religious communities or religious groups may establish religious schools
as well as social and humanitarian institutions and within their operations they may use media and
publish printed material (Article 15).
Religious communities and religious groups exercise their right to practise religious ceremonies and other
activities in churches, mosques and other temples, as well as in backyards part of these facilities, or in
cemeteries and other premises in possession of the religious community or religious group (Article 18,
paragraph 1).
Article 4, Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Law on Execution of Sanctions (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 3/97, 23/99 and 74/04) proscribes discrimination against persons subject to sanctions
on the basis of their race, skin colour, gender, language, faith, political and other convictions, ethnic or
social origin, property and social status or any other status of the person subject to sanctions. Religious
feelings, personal conviction and moral norms of persons subject to sanctions must be respected.
With regard to satisfying religious needs to convicted persons, the Law on Execution of Sanctions
determines that convicted persons are entitled to satisfy their religious feelings and needs in accordance
with conditions and capacities of the institution (Article 139).
Pursuant to the Criminal Code (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 37/96, 80/99, 4/02,
43/03 and 19/04), a person who unlawfully obstructs the practice of religious ceremonies shall be
punished with a fine or sentenced to imprisonment of up to one year (Article 399).
The Macedonian Radio and Television, as a public enterprise established by law, also gives contribution
to the non-discrimination of religious communities and religious minorities in the Republic of Macedonia
by directly broadcasting religious solemn rites on the occasion of religious holidays such as Easter,
Christmas, Ramadan, Eid, Yom Kippur, etc.
c)
The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia guarantees that the Macedonian Orthodox Church, as well
as the Islamic Religious Community in Macedonia, the Catholic Church, the Evangelical-Methodist
Church, the Jewish Community and other religious communities and groups are separate from the State
and equal before the law (Article 19).
This Constitutional provision clearly indicates a separation of religious communities from the State, and
excludes a possibility of a state religion that would be favoured.
Religious communities in the Republic of Macedonia have established relations and co-operation, due to
their long tradition of mutual respect and co-operation.

295/453

The state conveys its responsibilities toward the religious communities and religious groups in an
institutional way through the Commission for Relations with Religious Communities and Groups as an
independent public administrative body. A director appointed by the Government of the Republic of
Macedonia chairs the Commission. The Commission has been established and its competences have
been determined by the Law on Organisation and Operation of State Administrative Bodies (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 58/00, 44/02). The Commission's competences relate to
issues regarding the legal position of religious communities and groups and the relations between
religious communities and groups and the State.
The Law on Holidays in the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
21/98) determines that citizens are entitled to celebrate religious holidays and proclaims them nonworking days. Believers of the Christian faith celebrate the first day of Christmas and the second day of
Easter and they are non-working days; the believers of the Islamic faith celebrate the first day of
Ramadan and the first day of Kurban Bairam; and the believers of the Jewish faith celebrate the first day
of Yom Kippur. In non-working days believers of the respective faith have the right to remuneration.
Conscientious objection has been regulated by the Law on Defence (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 42/01 and 05/03). Namely, the right to exercise freedom of consciousness is closely
related to the right to conscientious objection. Thus, in terms of fulfilling the constitutional duty of a
compulsory conscript service (Article 28 of the Constitution) the Law on Defence (Article 8) allows
alternative conscript service through unarmed service in the Army of the Republic of Macedonia
exclusively due to religious reasons. In that case, the duration of the service is 10 months instead of the
regular 6 months. The Law also determines the procedures for the alternative conscript service.
The right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia in
Article 16, which encompasses freedom of personal conviction, conscience, thought and public
expression of thought (Paragraph 1).
The right to freedom of thought is guaranteed by the Constitution without any restrictions whatsoever and
together with the freedom of personal conviction, conscience, public expression of thought and religious
confession it has been raised on the level of a fundamental human right that cannot be restricted even in
exceptional circumstances (war or state of emergency). In addition, these freedoms and rights enjoy
direct court protection by the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia.
Violation of provisions of the Law on Religious Communities and Groups is subject to respective legal
sanctions. Apart from misdemeanours for which the Law prescribes fines (Article 29), depending on each
case the deed may also be treated as a criminal act. Namely, the Criminal Code contains a provision
(Article 137) according to which a person who, based on a difference in gender, race, colour of skin,
ethnic and social origin, political and religious belief, wealth and social position, the language or other
personal characteristics or circumstances, takes away or limits the rights of humans and citizens,
determined by the Constitution, by law or by ratified international covenant, or who based on all these
differences gives citizens favours that contravene the Constitution, a law or a ratified international
covenant, shall be punished with imprisonment of three months to three years. If an official person while
performing his/her duty commits the crime, he/she shall be punished with imprisonment of six months to
five years.
With the foregoing provisions, the Republic of Macedonia has accepted international instruments,
universal and regional, such as the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, European Convention on
the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the respective Protocols.

19. Are the freedoms of assembly and association assured?
a) Provide statistics regarding the number of non-governmental organisations and
associations or foundations active in your country?
b) What is the legal status of non-governmental organisations and associations or
foundations, including as regards financing, taxes, and restrictions on membership or on
activities?
c) Which, if any, justifications are permitted as regards possible restrictions placed on the
exercise of these freedoms? Which body may impose such restrictions?
d) Is the right to join or not to join trade unions legislated for?
e) How is the freedom of association (trade-unions, professional associations) applied in the
public administration in general, and in the Army, the Police and the Judiciary in particular?
The Constitution (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” No 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and
84/03) regulates the citizens' rights to assemble peacefully and to express public protest without prior
announcement or a special approval. This right may only be restricted in case of a state of
emergency or war (Article 21 of the Constitution).
The citizens’ right to assemble peacefully for the purpose of expressing their opinion and public protest
has been regulated by the Law on Public Gathering (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
55/95).
Freedom of association is also one of the fundamental and essential rights of citizens determined by the
Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. Article 20 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia
guarantees the freedom of association of citizens to exercise and protect their political, economic, social,
cultural and other rights and convictions.
In order to exercise this right, citizens may freely establish associations of citizens and political parties,
join them or resign from them. Only in certain cases the Constitution restricts the establishment of
associations of citizens and political parties. However, the Constitution determines that programmes and
activities of associations of citizens and political parties may not be aimed at the violent destruction of the
constitutional order of the Republic, or at encouragement or incitement to military aggression or ethnic,
racial or religious hatred or intolerance. In addition, the Constitution explicitly prohibits military or
paramilitary associations, which do not belong to the Armed Forces of the Republic of Macedonia (Article
20 of the Constitution).
By these provisions, the Constitution expresses the protection of freedom of association from the
aforementioned abuse.
In June 1998 the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia passed the Law on Associations of Citizens
and Foundations (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 31/98) that regulates the mode,
conditions, and procedures for the establishment, registration, operations and cessation of associations of
citizens and foundations .
a)
According to the provisions in the Law on Associations of Citizens and Foundations, there are three types
of Registers: Register of Association of Citizens and Foundations, Register of Associations of Foreigners
and Register of Foreign Organisations.
Registers are kept at basic courts, and on the basis of data entered into the Registers, the Basic Court
Skopje I in Skopje keeps a Single Register of all registered associations of citizens and foundations in the
State.
As of the entry into force of the Law on Associations of Citizens and Foundations, 3.100 associations
of citizens and foundations have been registered (according to data obtained from the Basic Court
Skopje I in Skopje).

297/453

The Registers and the Single Register of registered associations of citizens and foundations are public
documents.
b)
The non-governmental activities in the Republic of Macedonia, based upon the Constitutional concept,
are carried out in accordance with the Law on Associations of Citizens and Foundations, adopted in
1998.
The Law on Associations of Citizens and Foundations enables citizens to freely associate in citizens’
associations or to establish foundations for the purpose of accomplishing economic, social, cultural,
scientific, professional, technical, humanitarian, educational, sport and other rights, interests and
convictions.
This Law regulates questions related to associations of citizens and questions related to foundations in
separate chapters.
An association of citizens may be founded by at least five adults who must be citizens of the Republic of
Macedonia. The association of citizens at the founding assembly brings a founding decision, programme,
statute, and elects its bodies.
A member of association of citizens may be every citizen who voluntarily joins it, whereas foreign citizens
may become its members if the association's statute allows such possibility.
A foundation, according to the Law, is a property mass acting as a legal person that has been provided
by one or more founders (donors), for accomplishing certain statutory goals. Its founders may not use the
foundation’s property and assets for private purposes.
Associations of citizens and foundations may acquire monetary assets, objects and property rights from
membership fees, donations, contributions, gifts, etc. All assets belong to associations of citizens and
foundations, and each member has a right to inspect the use of assets and revenues.
Non-governmental organisations may also acquire assets from the budget of the Republic of Macedonia.
Assets from the budget are obtained on the basis of a Law and on the basis of the Decision on the
Criteria and Procedure for Distribution of Financial Assets to Associations of Citizens and Foundations
from the budget of the Republic of Macedonia, adopted by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia
in 2000.
Non-profit foreign and international non-governmental organisations, foundations, confederations and
their branch-offices may be established on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia. Other organisations
that are solely financed by bilateral and multilateral agreements for the purpose of their incorporation into
the development processes of the Republic of Macedonia may also be founded on the territory of the
Republic of Macedonia.
The activity of foreign organisations must not contravene neither the Constitution nor the laws in the
Republic of Macedonia nor international agreements that the Republic of Macedonia has signed or to
which it has acceded.
Associations of citizens and foundations may associate into confederations or into other forms of
associations for a joint promotion of their operations and activities. They may co-operate, join or
interconnect with international organisations if it does not contravene the Constitution and laws.
Article 13 of the Law on Associations of Citizens and Foundations stipulates that an association of
citizens and foundation has a right to tax and duty relieves in accordance with a law.
The level and utilisation of donations and tax relieves have been regulated by adequate financial and
customs laws. This may also be regulated in the act on delegation of public authorisation awarded by a
public authority.

298/453

c)
Operations of associations of citizens and foundations may be terminated if they undertake political
activities or use their property and assets for the accomplishment of political parties’ objectives. Moreover,
their activities may be prohibited if they undertake actions aimed at the violent overthrowing of the
constitutional order of the Republic, incite or call for military aggression and incite ethnic, racial or religious
hatred and intolerance (Articles 3 and 4 of the Law).
Everybody may initiate a termination of an association of citizens and a foundation if he/she has a wellfounded suspicion that they perform activities contravening the Constitution and the laws.
A decision for termination of an association of citizens and a foundation is adopted by the basic court that
has territorial jurisdiction according to the seat of the association of citizens and the foundation. The
procedure before the basic court is initiated upon the proposal of the basic public prosecutor.
Association of citizens and foundations may appeal to the appellate court against the decision of the
basic court on their termination. Also, the public prosecutor may demand protection of legality against the
final decision.
d)
The right of workers to organise in trade unions is a constitutional category. The Constitution of the
Republic of Macedonia in Article 37 stipulates that in order to exercise their economic and social rights,
citizens have the right to establish trade unions. Unions may constitute confederations and become
members of international trade union organisations.
The law may restrict the conditions for the exercise of the right to trade union organisation in the armed
forces, the police and administrative bodies.
The trade union organisation has been regulated in a separate chapter of the Law on Labour Relations
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 80/93, 03/94, 14/95, 53/97, 59/97, 21/98, 25/00,
34/00, 50/01, 25/03, 40/03 and 80/03 - consolidated text). Article 84 of this Law regulates the labourers’
rights to constitute trade unions for the purpose of exercising their economic and social rights with regard
to their employment, determined by law and the Collective Agreement. Workers are free to become
members or accede to trade unions.
e)
The Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00, 112/00, 34/01,
103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04 and 69/04) that regulates the status, rights, duties and
responsibilities of civil servants, regulates the question of trade union organisation under a separate
article. Pursuant to Article 26 of this Law, civil servants may constitute trade unions and may become their
members under conditions and modes determined by law, in order to exercise their economic and social
rights. According to the Law, the civil servant, apart from appealing to other bodies, may also appeal to
the trade union for protection in exercising his/her rights related to his/her employment.
Apart from the Constitution, the Law on Labour Relations, and the Law on Civil Servants, the trade union
organisation in the Republic of Macedonia is regulated by statutes and special programmes adopted
individually by trade unions.
Laws or by-laws have not restricted the right to trade union organisation in the public sector. The
employees in the public sector may freely, by their own conviction, join or resign from a trade union
organisation in the area of their employment.
The conditions for trade union organisation in the Republic of Macedonia have been laid down in the Law
on Defence (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 42/01, 05/03) and the Law on Army
Service (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 62/02, 98/02, 25/03 and 71/03). An
independent trade union for the employees of the defence has been organised within the Army. This
trade union has concluded an Agreement on Regulation of the Rights, Duties and Responsibilities related

299/453

to employment with the Minister of Defence. Pursuant to Article 49 of the Law on Defence, trade union
organisation within the Army during war or state of emergency is prohibited.
Members of police are organised in the Macedonian Police Union. All employees in the police may freely
become members of the union.
The employees in the judiciary are organised in the Union of Workers in the Administration, Justice and
Associations of Citizens of the Republic of Macedonia. A statute adopted by the members’ assembly has
regulated the organisation, establishment and operation of the trade union.
The hitherto experiences from the implementation of the Constitution and the Law on Labour Relations,
as far as trade union organisation is concerned, have not detected serious impediments in unions'
operations and activities.
There are special laws in selected fields that provide for the establishment of professional associations of
citizens in a certain profession, such as: health, notary, attorney, veterinary, agriculture, etc.
In the aforementioned legislative acts and provisions the Republic of Macedonia has accepted the
international instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations, the
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of the Council of Europe, as
well as other international legal documents.
20. Right to asylum (see also specific section on asylum in Chapter 24 – Justice and Home
Affairs): Give details on how the right to asylum is being respected, particularly with respect
to the rules of the Geneva Convention and Protocol relating to the status of refugees.
In order to establish a legal and institutional framework for development of the Macedonian asylum
system that would be compatible to the system in the European Union, the Republic of Macedonia, in
January 1994 ratified the 1951 Geneva Convention Related to the Status of Refugees and the 1967
Geneva Protocol Related to the Status of Refugees. Hence, the Republic of Macedonia fully accepts
the obligations deriving from these fundamental international agreements that regulate the asylum
policy.
These obligations are implemented in the Law on Asylum and Temporary Protection (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 49/03) that entered into force on 25.07.2004. It contains
the fundamental provisions set forth in the abovementioned international agreements, thereby
determining the definition, status, rights and obligations, as well as the procedure for the recognition
of the right to asylum of refugees. More precisely, this Law regulates the conditions and procedure
for granting and revoking the asylum status to an asylum seeker or a stateless person requiring
asylum in the Republic of Macedonia, as well as the rights and duties of the asylum seekers and
persons whose right to asylum has been recognised in the Republic of Macedonia. Thus, Article 2 of
the Law on Asylum and Temporary Protection stipulates the right to asylum and persons to whom
such right pertains, thereby explicitly asserting that definitions contained in this Article are in
conformity with the 1951 Geneva Convention Related to the Status of Refugees and the 1967
Geneva Protocol Related to the Status of Refugees, as well as with the 1950 Convention on the
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the 1984 Convention against Torture
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. In addition, Article 7 of the same
Law contains the “principle of non-refoulement” which is one of the fundamental elements stipulated
in Article 33 of the 1951 Geneva Convention Related to the Status of Refugees.
The main characteristics of the Law on Asylum and Temporary Protection that have been
harmonised with the relevant provisions contained in the 1951 Geneva Convention Related to the
Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Related to the Status of Refugees are:
−
−

Principle of manifestly unfounded application;
Principle of safe country of origin;

300/453

−
−
−

−
−

Principle of safe third country or first country of asylum;
Subsidiary protection;
Shared responsibility between the ministry of the interior (a procedure for recognition of the
right to asylum) and the ministry of labour and social policy (activities related to
accommodation, alimentation, assistance and integration of recognised refugees);
Normal and accelerated procedure;
Three phases of decision-making (the ministry of the interior – section for asylum, the second
instance commission for administrative procedure in the field of judiciary, internal affairs, state
administration, local self-government and religion within the government of the Republic of
Macedonia in second instance and the supreme court in cases of submitted lawsuit against
the commission decision).

For the purpose of completing the legislative framework and determining the procedure on
recognition of the right to asylum, a bylaw to the Law on Asylum was adopted in 2004 regulating all
types of forms and identification documents used and issued in the course of procedure following the
filed request for recognition of the right to asylum. These legal acts have been adopted pursuant to
envisaged priorities on issues of asylum set forth in the National Action Plan on Asylum and
Migration adopted on 09.12.2002 (for more details see I_Annex_01) and prepared by a state team
comprising of representatives both from the country and from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and
Bulgaria.
Prior to the adoption of the National Action Plan, Macedonia had been conducting serious activities in
order to develop an institutional framework for the creation of a Macedonian asylum system in
conformity with European standards. Thus, at the end of 1998 a regional unit (the Asylum Section)
competent to carry out procedures upon submitted requests for the recognition of the right to asylum
was established within the Ministry of the Interior. The subsequent year the Ministry of the Interior
established a shelter centre for asylum seekers. The Republic of Macedonia also cooperates with the
EU on establishing a national asylum system compatible to that of the EU, and much of the
cooperation is conveyed through the CARDS projects.
Implementation activities of the CARDS-2002 Project started at the end of 2003 and are in their final
phase. These activities have been realised in two phases:
−
−

Construction of a new shelter centre for asylum seekers within the competence of the Ministry
of Labour and Social Policy; and
Technical assistance and training for the development and implementation of the National
Action Plan on Migration and Asylum.

On the respect of the right to asylum, as well as on statistical data’s for the number of asylum
seekers and persons whose asylum right has been recognised, for more details see 24_F_1 through
24_F_11.
21. Are there measures in place to prevent a person from being removed, expelled or
extradited to a State where there is a serious risk that s/he would be subjected to the death
penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment? Which bodies are
responsible for fact-finding in such cases and do they have an adequate institutional
framework to facilitate effective action?
Pursuant to Article 29 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic
of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) aliens in the Republic of Macedonia enjoy
freedoms and rights guaranteed by the Constitution, under conditions determined by law and international
agreements. The Republic of Macedonia guarantees the right to asylum to foreign nationals and stateless
persons who have been expelled because of their democratic and political conviction and activity. An
alien may only be extradited pursuant to a ratified international treaty and upon the principle of reciprocity.

301/453

An alien may not be extradited for a political criminal offence. Acts of terrorism are not considered as
political criminal offences. Pursuant to Article 39 of the Law on Movement and Residence of Aliens
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/92, 36/92, 66/92, 26/93 and 49/03) an alien
may not be expelled from the Republic of Macedonia if his/her life would be in danger due to racial,
religious or ethnic affiliation, political convictions or if he/she would be exposed to mistreatment or
inhuman conduct.
Article 3 of the European Convention on Extradition with the Protocols (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 32/99) specifies that extradition may not be approved for acts that fall within the category
of political criminal offences or offences related with such criminal offences. The extradition may not be
approved for prosecution of persons for their racial affiliation, religion, ethnicity or political convictions.
Article 11 of the European Convention on Extradition with the Protocols specifies that extradition may be
approved only if the requesting state guarantees that the death penalty shall not be executed and that it
shall be exchanged with another penalty.
Pursuant to the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97,
44/02 and 74/04), the criminal chamber of the competent court assesses whether the documentation
submitted by a foreign state through the Ministry of Justice fulfils the legal prerequisites for the extradition,
and adopts a decision. The competent court submits the decision to the Ministry of Justice of the Republic
of Macedonia. The Minister of Justice shall not allow extradition of an alien that has been granted asylum
in the Republic of Macedonia or if he/she has been accused of political or a war criminal offence. In
addition, the Minister of Justice shall not allow extradition of an alien if there are serious grounds for
suspicion that he/she may be exposed to torture and other form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment
or be subject to death penalty.
The Government of the Republic of Macedonia upon the proposal of the Minister of Justice and following
the detection of the foregoing facts may decide not to allow extradition, if it deems that especially justified
interests of the state exist.
Obligations arising from the Convention against the Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman and
Degrading Treatment or Punishment from 1984, ratified by the Republic of Macedonia, and especially
Article 3 (the principle of non-refoulement) of the Convention are fully applied to the Law on Asylum and
Temporary Protection that entered into force in August 2003.
According to Article 7 of this Law, an asylum seeker, recognised refugee or a person under humanitarian
protection may not be extradited or forcibly expelled to a country where he/she may be subject to torture,
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. These persons in accordance with article 30 of the Law
on Asylum and Temporary Protection are guaranteed the right to asylum for humanitarian protection and
have concrete rights and duties.
The Section of Asylum within the Ministry of the Interior is competent to determine the actual situation of
those cases (Article 12 of the Law on Asylum and Temporary Protection). Currently in the Republic of
Macedonia there are 809 persons whose rights to asylum due to humanitarian reasons have been
recognized by the Department in 2003 and 2004, as it has determined in the course of the procedure that
they would be subject to inhuman and degrading treatment upon their return to Kosovo – Serbia and
Montenegro.
The prohibition of expulsion (the principle of non-refoulement) in the sense of Article 4 of the
aforementioned Convention has an absolute effect. Namely, pursuant to the Law on Asylum and
Temporary Protection this prohibition also refers to foreign citizens who are not entitled to the asylum
right, i.e. who are subject to exclusion of this right pursuant to Article 6 of the Law.

302/453

22. What steps have been taken to prevent discrimination based on membership of a national
minority, ethnic or social origin, sex, race, colour, genetic features, language, religion or
belief, political or any other opinion, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation? Has
the Republic of Macedonia established specialised services to combat discrimination? If so,
which legislative framework, institutional context, composition, functions and powers pertain
to these services?
The Republic of Macedonia continuously undertakes activities against discrimination and promotes
equality through the constitutional principles of non-discrimination, implementation of legislative
measures, through establishment of an adequate institutional framework, as well as by strengthening
of the implementation mechanisms.
The principle of non-discrimination is fully incorporated in the legal order of the Republic of
Macedonia.
The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) in its general provisions defines the fundamental human
freedoms and rights, recognised in international law and established by the Constitution as the most
relevant constitutional and legal values, i.e., as fundamental values of the constitutional order of the
Republic of Macedonia.
Furthermore, fundamental human rights and freedoms have a central place in the normative part of
the Constitution. Namely, the provisions establishing the fundamental freedoms and rights in the
Constitutions precede the provisions on the organization of the state authority.
In this respect Article 9 of the Constitution should be especially underlined, according to which
citizens of the Republic of Macedonia are equal in their freedoms and rights, irrespectively of gender,
race, skin colour, ethnic and social origin, political and religious conviction, financial and social status.
This Article establishes, as well, that citizens are equal before the Constitution and law.
In terms of fulfilment of the rights and freedoms, the Constitution is not declarative. Instead it contains
all prerogatives, which provide for their efficient exercise and their full legal protection. Namely, the
Constitution establishes a consistent system of protection, which provides for their implementation it
prevents all possible abuses of these rights and freedoms by third persons and by the state authority
itself. Furthermore, specifying the cases in which rights and freedoms of citizens may be restricted,
the Constitution prescribes that such restrictions may not discriminate on the basis of gender, race,
skin colour, language, religion, national or social background, property or social status.
Within the context of mechanisms available to the Macedonian citizen for protection of their rights
and freedoms, it is important to mention the possibility of access by the citizens of the Republic of
Macedonia to the European mechanisms, such as the European Court of Human Rights. Namely, the
Republic of Macedonia, as a party to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
and Fundamental Freedoms, as of the ratification of this European Convention has put into practice
the right of the citizens to lodge an individual application to the European Court of Human Rights
when they consider that by the acts and activities of the bodies of state authority, including the
domestic courts, some of their freedoms and rights guaranteed under the Convention have been
violated.
After conclusion of the Framework Agreement of 2001, the 1991 Constitution of the Republic of
Macedonia was amended aiming at strengthening of the safeguards for protection of minorities. Thus
in addition to the principle of non-discrimination, the principle of equitable representation of
communities, as an active principle has been envisaged (for more details see I_J_2 and I_J_3).
The legislative framework for prevention of discrimination and promotion of full and effective equality
consists of the criminal, civil and the administrative legislation:

303/453

−

The Criminal Code (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 37/96, 80/99, 4/02.
43/03 and 19/04)
In the Chapter on Criminal Offences against Human Rights and Freedoms, Article 137

affiliation, material or social status, language or another personal feature or circumstance, or
the rights by which, on the basis of these differences the citizens are granted benefits in
contravention to the Constitution, law or ratified international agreement.
Article 319 of the Criminal Code, in the Chapter on Criminal Offences against the State,
establishes that a person will be sanctioned for incitement of ethnic, racial and religious
hatred, discord and intolerance, if by force, maltreatment, threatening the safety, derision of
the national, ethnic or religious symbols, by desecrating monuments, graves, or in another
way causes or incites to national, racial or religious hatred, discord or intolerance.
Article 417 of the Criminal Code in the Chapter on Crimes against Humanity and International
Law prescribes that the person who, on the basis of race, skin colour, nationality or ethnic
origin violates the basic human rights and freedoms recognized by the International
Community is perpetrating discrimination.

−

well, have the right to higher education under conditions established by law and ratified
international treaties.
−

Law on Associations of Citizens and Foundations (“Official Gazette of the Republic of

racial or religious hatred or intolerance.

−

Law on Political Parties (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 76/04)
In its general provisions it establishes that the platform, statute and the activity of a political
party may not be directed towards violent overthrow of the constitutional order of the Republic
of Macedonia, incitement to or calling to military aggression, flaring up ethnic, racial or
religious hatred or intolerance.
The Law proscribes an obligation for political parties, in their activity, to ensure the application
of the principle of gender equality in the access to positions within the political party. The Law
prohibits any discrimination on the basis of membership or non-membership in a political
party.

−

305/453

Article 9 of the Labour Relations Law prohibits the employer to place under unequal legal
treatment the job applicant or the employee because of their race, skin colour, gender, age,
health status or disability, religious, political or other belief, membership in trade unions,
ethnic or social background, family status, property or other personal circumstances.
This Law establishes that women and men must be provided equal opportunities and equal
treatment with regard to employment, advancement, employment insurance, working
conditions, working hours and cancellation of employment contracts.
Article 77 of the said Law places the employer under an obligation to pay equal salary to the
employees for equal work with equal requirements, regardless of the gender.
The provisions of the employment contracts and the provisions of the collective agreements,
which are in contravention to these provisions, are null and void.

Law on Election of Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 42/02, 50/02 and 46/04)
It specifies that in the proposed list of candidates each gender will be represented by at least
30%.

The Law on Local Elections (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 46/96,
48/96, 56/96, 12/03, 35/04, 42/04, 45/04, 52/04 and 60/04)
It prescribes that in the proposed list of candidates for members of the Council of the
Municipality and the City of Skopje, each gender will be represented by at least 30% in both
the upper and the lower half of the list.

−

Law on Culture (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 31/98, 49/03 and
66/2003 – consolidated text)
Article 3 of the Law establishes that everyone may participate in culture, as individual, local or
national interest, with a profit or non-profit purpose, in adherence to the law. Based on this, it
can be concluded that the access to cultural values is related to the exercise of cultural rights
of all citizens in the Republic of Macedonia.
The Article 4 of the Law establishes that everyone has the right, irrespectively of the age,
education, religious, ethnic or other affiliation, to create freely, non-professionally or
professionally, as well as right to education for the field of culture.
Within the meaning of this Law, the term “culture” involves participate artists, independent
artists, public and private institutions, other legal and natural persons, whereby the term
”artist” means and marks any natural person who creates a copyright work in the field of
artistic creation or performs copyright work, or folklore work, irrespective of their education,
legal status, registration, ethnicity, other type of affiliation, etc.

Law on Employment of Persons with Disabilities (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 44/00 and 16/04)
It prescribes skill development of the disabled person for practical work for certain jobs, in
conformity with the needs of the employer and the person with disability. The employer sends
the employed disabled person to vocational training, if the person is not skilled to perform the
appropriate tasks. The finances needed for vocational training are provided from a special
fund, earmarked for this purpose. Pursuant to the Law on Social Care (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 50/97, 16/00, 17/03 and 65/04) persons with disabilities have
the right to non-institutional and institutional social welfare. Persons with disabilities, pursuant

306/453

to this Law, may exercise the right to social welfare. These two legal acts indicate the fact that
in the Republic of Macedonia there is no discrimination on the basis of disability, and they are
also measures for prevention of such type of discrimination.

Law on Civil Servants (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia, Nos. 59/00, 112/00,
34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04 and 69/04).
Equal access to jobs and competence-based selection are the two fundamental principles for
employment of civil servants, as envisaged in the Law on Civil Servants.

With regard to education, the Ministry of Education and Science has envisaged a programme in the
elementary schools by which children attain knowledge on tolerance, non-discrimination and the
democratic values.
Thus, in primary education, for pupils in grades from 1 to 8, there are programmes introduced
preparing pupils for life in modern civil society. For the pupils from the primary education, a pilot
project entitled “Basics of Civil Society” is implemented, which deals with elements from the field of
human rights. In the higher grades of the primary education, in the Macedonian language courses,
there are contents on the topic “The World and Us” from the UN Charter. Furthermore, within the
project “Civil Education – A Road towards the Civil Society“„ there are programmes “Basics of
Democracy” in the pre-school education and in the first four grades and “We the People – project
Citizen” in the higher grades of the primary education. In this context, it should be added that the new
concept of primary education provides that a cycle of contents within the course “Civil Culture” is
implemented in the higher forms. In the field of the secondary education, it is important to mention
the existence of the curricula implemented in all secondary schools as a result of the project for
introduction of civil education in the secondary vocational schools in 1999/2000.
Within the context of gender equality, as of 2000 onwards the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy in
cooperation with the local self-government and the Association of Women’s Organizations in the
Republic of Macedonia established eight committees on gender equality within eight municipal
councils in the State and facilitated the preparation of a local action plan on gender equality in the
municipality of Veles. The gender equality committees implement their activities in cooperation with
the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy and the local NGOs.
In March 2000 the Macedonian Women’s Lobby was established, under activities related to the
Stability Pact Initiative Working Table on Gender Equality. The same year, with the support of the
Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, a National Office of the Macedonian Women’s Lobby was
opened, which provides logistical support for the implementation of the programme activities.
Again, in the context of the gender equality, in March 2003 a Club of Women – Members of the
Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia was established. The coordinator of these activities was the
Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, in cooperation with the NGO Association of Women’s
Organizations of the Republic of Macedonia.
The Constitution provides for several forms of constitutional and legal protection of the rights and
freedoms of the citizen, which directly or indirectly guarantee their exercise. In the first two forms the
protection is rendered through a procedure based on the principles of expediency and priority in the
decision-making.
1. Courts in the Republic of Macedonia:
Pursuant to the Law on Courts, the courts protect the rights and freedoms of the citizens, as well
as the rights of other legal entities if, pursuant to the Constitution, that is outside of the scope of
jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court. The jurisdiction of courts also comprises the protection of
citizens from the individual illegal acts of the state bodies and of other public institutions. The
regular courts have a general jurisdiction for protection of human rights.

307/453

2. Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia:
Article 108 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia establishes that the Constitutional
Court is an body of the Republic, protecting constitutionality and legality.
Pursuant to Article 110 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, the Constitutional Court,
inter alia, protects the rights and freedoms of citizens with regard to the freedom of conviction,
conscience, thought and public expression of thought, political association and action and
prohibition of discrimination of citizens on the basis of gender, race, ethnic, social and political
affiliation.
The Constitutional Court exercises its jurisdiction in two ways: through constitutional review, i.e.,
assessment of general legal acts, and through specific procedure, i.e., through specific protection
of certain rights and freedoms provided by the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia.
3. Ombudsman:
The Amendment XI of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia provides for an obligation to
pay particular attention to the protection of principles of non-discrimination and equitable
representation of the communities in the public bodies at all levels, and in the other areas of
public life.
This Constitutional Amendment was transposed into the Law on Ombudsman (“Official Gazette of
the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 60/2003) which establishes a new competence according to
which the Ombudsman undertakes actions and measures to protect the principle of nondiscrimination of the members of ethnic communities and their appropriate and equitable
representation in the state bodies, bodies of the units of local self-government and in the public
institutions and services.
In the practical functioning of the Ombudsman, starting in 2003 special records are maintained
through which the number of submitters of petitions can be sorted according to their ethnic
affiliation, according to the type of violated rights, and the institution for several years has a
special Department for Protection of Children, which annually receives about 40 cases. This
Department, aiming at improvement and promotion of children’s rights, in the period from 2001 to
30.09.2004 has submitted to the Government amendments to certain laws (Law on Protection of
Children, Law on Health Insurance, Criminal Code, Law on Local Self-Government, Law on
Social Protection, Law on Prohibition of Smoking, Law on Catering Industry, Law on Trade, etc.)
that were approved.
In relation to the principle of non-discrimination on any grounds, in the period between
01.01.2002 and 30.09.2004 approximately 50 to 60 applications were registered (out of which
approximately 40 are related to issues concerning rights of the child, and other forms of
discrimination), which amounts to 2,5% to 2,7% of the total number of applications submitted to
the Ombudsman.

4. Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, Permanent Survey Committee for Protection of
Freedoms and Rights of Citizens:
The Standing Inquiry Committee for Protection of Freedoms and Rights of Citizens has the
purpose of ensuring the freedoms and the rights of citizens in case of their inability to exercise the
rights in the practice, or of violation of the rights by the competent state bodies. Its establishment
enables institution of procedures to establish the responsibility of public officials.

5. Government of the Republic of Macedonia and state administrative bodies:

308/453

The institutional mechanisms for safeguarding the principle of non-discrimination operating within
the Government are established at two levels:
−

−

General-monitoring and promotion of human rights protection, through implementation of the
international standards and enhancement of the implementation mechanisms. At this level,
within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there is a Unit on the Council of Europe, while at the
Ministry of Justice a Unit for Human Rights, Legal Analysis and Comparative Law was
established.
Ministerial level: The Ministries, within the competences established under the Law on
Organisation and Operation of State Administrative Bodies, are responsible for enforcement
of the laws from their respective areas, which contain anti-discriminatory clauses. Therefore,
various sectors and units in the Ministries and other state bodies, in accordance with their
scope of work, propose and undertake measures to prevent discrimination.

Thus, within the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy - Labour Sector, by a decision of the
Government of the Republic of Macedonia in January 1997 a Unit for Promotion of Gender
Equality was established. The basic function of the Unit is to exert a positive influence on the
improvement of the position of women and promote gender equality in conformity with the
international conventions that the Republic of Macedonia has ratified, ensuring the women full
enjoyment of human rights. Also, the Unit initiates and coordinates activities in the area of gender
equality at the level of governmental institutions, with a clear purpose and strategy to overcome
the problems, which the women in the Republic of Macedonia face. At the same time the Unit
cooperates, participates, supports and coordinates many activities initiated by the nongovernmental organisations. Upon an initiative of the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy (the
Gender Equality Unit) contact persons in the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning, contact persons have
been designated primarily employed at the human rights sectors, who, among other tasks, have
the obligation to monitor the activities from the perspective of gender equality and to inform the
Unit about certain proposals and solutions in the area of gender equality.
Cooperation with non-governmental organisations and international cooperation
The Government of the Republic of Macedonia, aware that the principle of non-discrimination in itself
is not sufficient to protect the citizens from discrimination, or to provide for full and effective equality
through normative regulation of the field, continuously undertakes a number of measures through
implementation of many activities, such as: media campaigns, organisation of national and
international seminars and workshops, open panels, researches, trainings, etc.
In this context, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, closely and continuously cooperates
with the non-governmental organisations, political parties, other institutions in the State, as well as
with the international organisations.
23. Please provide details on legislative measures which ensure equality between men and
women, commenting particularly on equality in areas such as employment, work and pay.
In the Chapter on fundamental human rights and freedoms, the Constitution of the Republic of
Macedonia (“Official Gazette of Republic of Macedonia” Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03)
determines that citizens of the Republic of Macedonia are equal in their rights and freedoms,
regardless of gender, race, colour of skin, ethnic and social origin, political and religious beliefs,
property and social status (Article 9). The same Article guarantees equality of citizens before the
Constitution and law. By introducing gender equality provisions in the substantive provisions of the
Constitution the Republic of Macedonia has expressed its political will to rank itself among
democratic states that base their state order on full recognition and promotion of gender equality, as
one of key prerequisites for sustainable development.

309/453

The Law on Labour Relations (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 80/93, 3/94,
14/95, 53/97, 59/97, 21/98, 25/00, 34/00, 50,01, 25/03 40/03 and 80/03-consolidated text) prohibits
direct and indirect discrimination regarding:
−
−
−
−
−
−
−
−
−
−
−
−
−
−

Conditions for employment, including the selection criteria and conditions for a specific job, in
any branch of economic activities and at all levels of personnel hierarchy;
Promotion;
Access to all types and levels of vocational training, re-training and additional training;
All rights arising from and related to employment, including equality of pay;
Termination of an employment contract;
Rights of members and work of employees’ or employers’ associations or any other
professional organization, including the membership privileges;
Insurance at work;
Working hours;
Health status, i.e. disability;
Religious, political or other belief;
Ethnic or social origin;
Family status;
Property status;
Other personal circumstances.

The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia guarantees everyone the right to work, to free choice
of employment, guaranteeing also that every job is open to all under equal conditions (Article 32).
In accordance with the above said the Law on Labour Relations contains provisions, which, inter alia,
prohibit unequal treatment (placing a person in an unequal legal position) based on the gender of
persons seeking employment. (Article 9). The same Article guarantees that men and women must be
provided equal opportunities and treatment in employment, promotion, insurance at work, conditions
for work, working hours, and in termination of employment contracts.
The Law on Labour Relations does not contain provisions, which explicitly prohibit referring to the
gender of persons seeking jobs in the vacancy announcement.
Furthermore, the Law does not contain provisions prohibiting posing any pregnancy related questions
to women when applying for any job.
As already stated, according to the Law on Labour Relations, personal circumstances, which could
be related to gender or pregnancy of women seeking jobs must not be considered an obstacle to
employment.
The definition of indirect and direct discrimination has not been introduced in this area of legislation
(Directive 2002/73/EEC).
The provisions of the Law on Labour Relations prescribe protection of women employees (during
pregnancy, as well) from underground work, strenuous physical labour or health damaging work,
especially from work in night shifts.
Pregnant women may not be dismissed from work in the course of pregnancy or maternity leave.
Maternity leave, according to the Law, lasts nine consecutive months, while in cases of a birth of
twins, triplets, etc., the maternity leave lasts twelve months. Maternity leave for adopted children is of
the same duration. These rights are exercised under equal conditions by both parents, who have the
right to be returned to the formerly held or to appropriate positions.

310/453

In cases of a legal action on grounds of employment related discrimination, the burden of proof is on
the employee who has instituted the dispute. If the dispute has been resolved in favour of the
employee, the costs for the legal action and other rights are determined following regulations on
regular court proceedings.
Equal access to jobs and competence-based selection are the two fundamental principles for
employment of civil servants, as envisaged in the Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00, 112/00, 34/2001, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03,
17/04 and 69/04).
In respect of compensation for work, the Law on Labour Relations places employers under the
obligation to disburse equal pay for work of equal value of the employees regardless of their gender
(Article 77). The same principle is further transposed and elaborated in collective agreements, which
must not be in collision with the law.
Any differences in this respect are related exclusively to differences between jobs performed mainly
by women and those mainly performed by men.
24. Give an overview of possible incentives which exist for both the public and private sectors
to refrain from discriminatory employment practices.
Equal access to jobs and competence-based selection are the two fundamental principles for
employment of civil servants, as envisaged in the Law on Civil Servants (Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia, Nos. 59/00, 112/00, 34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04
and 69/04).
The principle of equitable representation of citizens belonging to the communities in the state bodies
and other public institutions at all levels is one of the basic values of the Constitutional order of the
Republic of Macedonia. The Law on Civil Servants elaborates this principle in detail, while the criteria
of expertise and competence are fully observed in employment of persons belonging to the
communities in the Republic of Macedonia.
Aimed at creating preconditions for equal job opportunities, the legislation and the practice of the
Employment Agency of the Republic of Macedonia, i.e. the active employment policy measures
provide incentives for employment of targeted groups of persons having difficulties in employment
under the usual labour market conditions.
Law on Employment of Persons with Disabilities (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
Nos. 44/00 and 16/04) and the Rulebook on the Criteria for and Mode of Allocation of Finances from
the Special Fund Creating Conditions for Employment and Work of Persons With Disabilities (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 34/04) envisage that employers who shall employ
unemployed disabled persons, in accordance with the provisions of the said Law, are entitled to grant
allocations from the Special Fund. The grant allocations from the Special Fund are given in the
following cases:
−

−

Grant allocation in the amount of 20 average monthly salaries paid in the Republic of
Macedonia in the month prior to the long term employment of disabled persons i.e. for
employment of person with sight, hearing, voice and speech impairments, physically disabled
persons, persons with slight psychosocial impairments, persons with combined impairments
and persons with psychosis conditions who owing to the extend of their disability have specific
requirements in respect of work; or grant allocation in the amount of 30 average monthly
salaries paid in the Republic of Macedonia in the month prior to employment of a blind person
with sight impairment of over 97% or of a person of more than 90% physical disability.
Under the Law on Employment of Disabled Persons, employers have the right to grant
allocations from the Special Fund, in the amount of up to 30 average monthly salaries paid a
month before the application has been lodged, for purposes of adjusting the work place for

311/453

−

disabled persons; then for purposes of procuring equipment required for employment and
work of disabled persons the employer is entitled to grant allocation in the amount of up to 50
average monthly salaries paid in the Republic of Macedonia for the month prior to the lodging
of application, according to the number of newly employed disabled persons; and for
purposes of completion and adjustment of the facilities to employment and work of disabled
persons depending on the technical-technological process, employers have the right to grant
allocations in the amount of 50 average monthly salaries paid in the Republic of Macedonia
for the month prior to the lodging of the application, according to the number of newly
employed disabled persons.
Furthermore, the Law on Employment of Disabled Persons envisages training for disabled
persons for practical work at certain jobs according to the needs of the employer and the
disabled person. The Employment Agency assigns disabled persons to training for
employment purposes, while employed disabled person who are lacking relevant the
employer sends job training for training. The job training may be organized at the employer’s
facilities or with another employer, following special programmes and under conditions and in
a manner set forth by the Rulebook on Job Training of Disabled Persons.

The employer lodges the application for grant allocation from the Special Fund to the Management
Board of the Employment Agency of the Republic of Macedonia, through the Employment Centre
covering the specific territory employer.
The application is supported with: documents of the court registration of the company, ruling on
fulfilment of hygiene-technical and fire job safety conditions, solvency certificate, a certificate that the
company is not under bankruptcy proceedings, a certificate issued by the Union of Associations for
the Protection of Disabled Persons of Macedonia that the conditions set forth in the Law on
Employment of Disabled Persons have been fulfilled, monthly calculation of paid salary, calculated
and paid personal income tax and salary based contributions for the nine months before the
application has been lodged, as well as signed and certified copy of the employment contract.
One of the commitments under the employment policy to be pursued in the forthcoming period is
encouraging integration of persons with less favourable position at the labour market, such as those
who have left school early, unskilled labour, persons with diminished capacities, ethnic minorities etc.
The following proactive measures will be undertaken in this respect: promoting contracts for public
works under infrastructure upgrading projects and specific targeting of local authorities’ resources to
implementing projects of public interest; support for new forms of flexible employment, especially for
persons with special needs and other active measures to facilitate conditions for employment of
persons in underprivileged position in terms of job opportunities.
Furthermore, the Employment Agency implements active measures to encourage employment, which
are to reduce negative unemployment trends, having on the other hand a positive impact on increase
of employability of specific target groups. Some of these measures are aimed at encouraging
employment of young people, matching the labour market demands with jobs in demand through
various education programmes. In light of the importance of education and expert proficiency vis-àvis the labour market requirements, in the context of improving the general business climate, there
will be a focus on improving the quality and efficiency of the education and training systems.
The Roma in the Republic of Macedonia are one of the target groups of measures for their
empowering at the labour market. In order to contribute to full emancipation and integration of Roma
in society, the Republic of Macedonia is one of states involved in the international project “Decade of
Roma Inclusion 2005-2015”. The goals of the Decade are to plan; design and implement actions in a
ten-year period that would help improve conditions for development and full integration of Roma in all
fields. In this respect, there is a National Strategy on the Roma that was approved by the
Government on 31.01.2005, as well as an Action Plan of the Decade of Roma Inclusion. Considering
that one of the key segments of advancing the emancipation and integration of Roma is to improve
their economic status, which primarily implies their employment, the Employment Agency is involved
in the Decade related activities.

312/453

Under the Programme and in the context of its regular tasks the Employment Agency focuses its
activities on successful preparation of Roma for employment and their larger scale coverage by the
pro-active employment measures. Hence, a series of measures are undertaken to upgrade the level
of informing Roma about their rights and obligations as employed and as unemployed, through job
counselling clubs. The purpose of these activities is to empower the Roma for their more successful
participation in the labour market, promoting their active approach towards job seeking and
employment. Considering the low skills structure of this population, it is necessary to involve them in
all types of vocational training. The Employment Agency also works on facilitating their access to
training programmes, re-training and advanced training.
One of the measures for job opportunities advancement is engagement of Roma on public works, in
which regard in addition to pecuniary compensation for the performed job, there will be also training
in order that they acquire certain knowledge and skills to enhance their competitiveness at the labour
market.
Unemployed persons - social assistance beneficiaries are offered the opportunity of receiving the
assistance in the form of single payment or in instalments, encouraging thus development of small,
family businesses and contributing towards resolution of unemployment problems through selfemployment.
In addition, the Employment Agency will design and implement other pro-active measures to alleviate
the problem of unemployment among the Roma, by their successful inclusion in the labour market.
25. Elaborate on the legislative structures in place to ensure effective access to legal aid,
commenting on the scope and resources of the legal aid service.
In accordance with the legal system of the Republic of Macedonia, every citizen is entitled to free access
to a court and may represent himself/herself in civil cases or may defend himself/herself in criminal cases
if charges have been raised against him/her.
Article 53 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 1/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) determines that the Bar is an autonomous
and independent public service providing legal assistance and carrying out public mandates in
accordance with the Law.
The Bar Law (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 59/02) regulates the provision of
legal assistance by the bar to natural and legal persons in exercise and protection of their rights and
law-based interests in proceedings before courts, state bodies and other legal entities;
implementation of public competence determined by law; organisation of the bar; terms of
performance, termination and rest of the bar activity; as well as lawyers’ rights and duties.
An exception to the foregoing is stipulated in the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.15/97, 44/02 and 74/04) where in certain criminal proceedings the
defendant must be appointed a defence attorney. Thus, if the defendant does not appoint a defence
attorney, the state shall provide legal assistance while the Court pays expenses.
On the Answer to this Question pertaining to the part on free legal aid, for more details see I_D_15.
26. What is the average length of time a person may be detained without being brought before
a competent legal authority? What is the average length of time between the lawful arrest and
detention of a person and his trial? (See also the section on the judiciary.)
Although arrests are usually conducted by police, the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of
the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02 and 74/04) empowers any person to deprive of liberty
a person caught while perpetrating a criminal offence prosecutable ex officio. A person shall be
regarded caught while perpetrating a criminal offence when seen while perpetrating the offence or

313/453

has been caught in circumstances which indicate that he/she has just committed the offence. In such
case, the citizen is obliged to immediately hand over to police or court the person deprived of liberty,
or notify them thereof.
The police officer, by rule, has to provide a court order prior to arrest. Article 12, paragraph 2 of the
Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
52/91, 1/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) strongly favours existence of court order so as to allow that a
person be deprived of liberty. The Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia similarly insists
on this condition in a number of its decisions. In that sense, no person may be deprived of liberty if
legal guarantees have not been respected consistently. The court order is regarded as one of the
most important such guarantees. In that way, it has been left to the judiciary to make an unbiased
assessment of the facts which indicate to whether a person has violated the law. Arrest without court
order is regarded as an exception to this rule. The court may issue an order for forced apprehension,
i.e. arrest if: a decision for detention has been adopted; if the regularly summoned defendant has
failed to appear and has not provided justification for absence or if no orderly delivery has been
possible of the summons, while the circumstances of the case clearly indicates that the defendant
has been avoiding to receive the summons; or when a court warrant has been issued. The order
shall be enforced by the Ministry of the Interior. The person arrested by a court order shall be without
delays brought before the competent investigative judge without delays.
In case when the deprivation of liberty has been done under an issued warrant for person escaped
from serving a prison sentence, the person shall be handed over to the penitentiary, i.e. the institution
for serving criminal and misdemeanour sanctions.
Pursuant to Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and Article 188 of the Law on
Criminal Procedure, the police may only by derogation deprive a person of liberty without a court
order in cases when the person has been caught while perpetrating the offence (in flagranti) or in
case of danger of delay (that has to be proved before court), if concurrently some of the reasons for
arrest have been met.
The Law on Criminal Procedure specifically defines situations when the suspected may be put in
custody in police station, over a maximum of 24 hours. Authorised officers of the Ministry of the
Interior may place the person in police custody only when necessary in order to determine his/her
identity, verify an alibi, collect necessary data for the procedure, and if simultaneously conditions for
detention have been met. In all other cases, the suspect must be immediately brought before an
investigative judge who shall decide on the lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty and shall order
his/her release if no conditions for arrest exist (Article 188 of the Law on Criminal Procedure).
The detention may not exceed 24 hours from the moment the person has been detained. After this
time, the detainee shall be either acquitted or brought before an investigative judge.
The person shall be detained in specialised police stations. The official person of the Ministry keeps
records for every detainee, entering the following data: day and time of detention; reasons for
deprivation of liberty; reasons for detention; the time when he/she has been legally advised; marks of
visible injuries; illness; mental derangement; time when his/her family, attorney, doctor, and
diplomatic-consular offices have been notified; data on interrogation; whether he/she has been
transferred to another police station; acquittal or bringing before the court; and other relevant data.
When the detained person has been brought before an investigative judge, the judge shall ex officio
examine the legality of detention for which he/she adopts a decision. If the detained person has not
been brought before an investigative judge, he/she may request examination of the legality of
detention within 30 days, for which the investigative judge adopts a decision. An appeal against the
decision may be filed within 48 hours, and a decision on the appeal shall be adopted within three
days.

314/453

The Law on Criminal Procedure in Article 185 stipulates that only the investigative judge of a
competent court may order detention. In this manner, any other body apart from the court has been
excluded from the possibility to decide upon detention.
The investigative judge may order a short-term detention of 48 hours of the detainee upon the
proposal of the public prosecutor if there is reasonable doubt that the detainee has performed a
crime and when the legal terms for detention have been met. This short-term detention is
pronounced if the public prosecutor has not initiated an investigation or pressed charges against the
person. If within 48 hours the public prosecutor does not request detention, the accused person shall
be acquitted.
The investigative judge may order a 24-hour detention for the detainee upon the proposal of the
public prosecutor if there is reasonable doubt that the person has committed a crime and legal bases
for detention are met (the detainee hides; his/her identity cannot be determined; there is danger of
escape; there is danger of destruction of evidence for the crime; and danger of hindering the
investigation by influencing witnesses, aides or abettors), when detention is necessary to determine
his/her identity or verify his/her alibi. The investigative judge may only extend this detention for
another 24 hours. An appeal against the detention decision may be filed within 5 hours, and within
three hours upon the receipt, the competent bodies shall adopt a decision on the appeal (Article 186а of the Law on Criminal Procedure).
The time of the detention must be reduced to the shortest necessary duration. All bodies involved in
criminal proceedings and those that provide legal assistance are obliged to act with particular
urgency if the defendant is in detention. Throughout the proceedings, the detention shall be cancelled
as soon as the reasons cease to exist on the basis of which it has been ordered.
Detention by a investigative judge’s order or detention ordered by a Chamber for the first time during
an investigation may last up to 30 days from the day of deprivation of liberty. Any deprivation of
liberty shall count to the duration of detention.
Upon an elaborated proposal by investigative judge or public prosecutor, the trial Chamber of the
first-instance court may extend the duration of detention by up to 60 days. If a crime is in question
punishable by a prison sentence of at least 5 years, after the expiration of the 60 days period, the
Chamber of the immediately superior court may extend the detention by up to 90 days, upon an
elaborated proposal by an investigative judge.
The overall duration of the detention in the course of investigation, including the deprivation of liberty
prior to the detention decision, may not be longer than 180 days. After the expiry of this term, the
detainee shall be immediately acquitted. (For less serious offences for which summary proceedings
are prescribed, detention may last only until necessary to conduct certain investigative actions, but
no longer than 8 days.)
The latest Amendments to the Law on Criminal Procedure introduced absolute time frames for
duration of detention, after charges have been brought and until the completion of the main hearing.
Namely, detention may last up to a year for criminal offences punishable by a prison sentence of up
to 15 years, and up to two years for offences punishable with life imprisonment.
For more details please refer to answer to question No. 12, Chapter I Political Criteria, D Judicial
System.
27. To what extent is victim support provided?
In accordance with Article 50 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of
the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 1/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), every citizen may invoke the
protection of freedoms and rights, as stipulated by the Constitution, before the courts of law and the
Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia, in a procedure based upon the principles of
priority and urgency.

315/453

Victims of crimes may exercise their right to protection by filing criminal charges to the public
prosecutor. As regards offences subject to private suits, victims may file them to a court of law. If the
public prosecutor drops the charges of a criminal offence subject to prosecution ex officio, the victim
i.e. the injured party has a right to take over the prosecution as a subsidiary prosecutor. If, as a result
of a criminal offence the person has been damaged, he/she has a right to file a damages claim, and if
he/she is referred to a lawsuit, the case shall be resolved in a civil suit in accordance with general
provisions on indemnity.
According to Article 96 of the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02 and 74/04), resulting from a criminal act may be litigated in criminal
procedure upon the proposal of authorised person, only if such litigation is not prolonged. may refer
to indemnities, return of objects or cancellation of a legal action. In case of insurance, such claims
may be filed to an insurance company. The proposal may be submitted not later than the end of the
principal process before the basic court. The claimant is obliged to define his/her claim and submit
evidence. Authorised persons may renounce the proposal and may exercise their right through a civil
suit before the end of the principal process.
In case the defendant has been found guilty, the court brings a full or partial ruling on the property
claim, and if the evidence presented is incomplete the court shall rule only on the counts of
accusation, while the amount of the claim or the rest of the amount shall be subject to additional
ruling. In case the defendant has been found not guilty or if the charges have been dropped, the
court shall refer the injured party to claim his/her property claims in litigation. (Article 101)
The Criminal Code (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 37/96, 80/99, 4/02,
43/03,and 19/04) also contains provisions regarding the protection of the injured party. Namely,
pursuant to Article 99, the injured party that has been referred to a litigation with regard to his/her
property claims may demand that this be settled from the confiscated value, if he/she starts a
litigation within six months from the day the ruling has been effective and if he/she demands
indemnity from confiscated value within three months from the day the ruling has been effective. The
injured party that has not petitioned a property claim may request indemnities from confiscated value
if, in order to determine his/her claims, he/she has filed a lawsuit within three months from the day
he/she learned about the ruling on confiscation; and not later than two years from the day the ruling
on confiscation has been effective provided that within three months from the day the ruling
determining his/her claims has been effective, he or she demands indemnities from the confiscated
value.
The indemnification shall be determined on the basis of the indemnification rules laid down in the
Law on Obligations (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 18/01, 4/02, and 05/03).
The indemnification includes a compensation of all damages (both material and non-material) that
the injured person has suffered. In case of death, body injury or health damages a financial
compensation shall be determined in a form of rent covering treatment costs, losses due to working
inability, losses due to missed or reduced promotion chances, etc. In addition, the Law on Obligations
also prescribes indemnities for non-material damages. Pursuant to Article 189 of the Law on
Obligations in case of sufferings due to physical pain, mental pain resulting from decreased life
activities, disfigurement, defamation, violation of freedom or rights, death of a relative and fear
suffered thereafter, the court shall rule in favour of equitable financial benefit (without regard to the
material indemnification or its absence) if the intensity of pain and fear and their duration justifies it. In
case of death of a person or in case of severe disability, the court may award his/her family members
(spouse, children and parents) equitable indemnification for their mental pains (Article 190).
The court determines the following to be special cases of liability: liability for terrorist acts, public
demonstrations or public events; liability for corruption by civil servants in the line of duty; and liability
for damages due to violent criminal acts perpetrated by an unidentified offender. In all such cases the
state shall indemnify damages (Articles 166, 167 and 168).

316/453

Furthermore, the Law on Criminal Procedure has been amended by a new Chapter XIX-a, "The
Protection of Witnesses, Collaborators of Justice and Victims”. Namely, the public prosecutor, the
investigative judge and the Chamber president shall undertake activities for securing efficient
protection of witnesses, collaborators of justice, and victims in the course of the procedure, if they
appear as witnesses, and if there is clear and present danger of their exposure to intimidation,
threats to life, health or physical integrity or if their protection is required. The protection is carried out
in a special mode of interrogation and participation into the procedure. In such cases witnesses shall
only be heard in the presence of the public prosecutor and the investigative judge, or the Chamber
president and in a location that guarantees the protection of witness's identity. In addition, other
communication and telecommunication devices may be used upon the witness's consent. Transcripts
from the minutes containing the witness’s testimonies without his/her signature shall be submitted to
the defendant and his/her attorney, who may pose questions to the witness in writing through the
court.
Protection may also be carried out through employing the Programme for the Protection of
Witnesses. A request to participate into the Programme is filed to the Public Prosecutor of the
Republic of Macedonia, and submitted by the competent public prosecutor, investigative judge or the
Chamber president. If circumstances allow such participation, the Public Prosecutor of the Republic
of Macedonia submits a proposal to a competent body to adopt a decision on participation in the
Programme.
In line with the objective for protection of victims of illegal trafficking in human beings a Shelter based
in Skopje has been established within the Ministry of the Interior. It sheltered 131 women in the
course of 2003, all from Eastern European Countries (56 Romanian, 51 Moldovan, 14 Bulgarian, 9
Ukrainian and 1 Belarusian). Two percent of all are persons involved in juvenile prostitution.
As far as activities reflecting regional co-operation on the issue, it is important to note that in June
2004, Ministers of the Interior and representatives of countries in Southeast Europe signed a
Declaration on Prosecuting Perpetrators of Criminal Acts of Human Trafficking and the Protection of
the victims (witnesses).
28. What guarantees are in place to ensure a public hearing? Give details of the
circumstances in which limitations may be placed on the public pronouncement of
judgements and the extent to which this occurs.
Publicity in the court proceedings and the mixed composition of the court essentially contribute to the
external and internal control of hearings, and indirectly to the promotion of the defendant’s right to
defence.
Pursuant to Article 102 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 1/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), debates before courts and the
pronouncing of verdicts are public. The public may be excluded only in cases determined by law. The
principle of publicity refers to debates before courts in general, and it is equally applied in criminal
and civil proceedings. Article 103 of the Constitution sets forth that court tries cases in chamber,
while a law prescribes when a case is tried by a single judge. Lay judges also participate in hearings,
when so stipulated by law. Similarly as judges, lay judges may not be taken accountable for opinions
or decisions made when rendering judgement.
Trial parties and their representatives (attorneys) and third parties not directly interested in the
outcome of criminal proceedings (general public) have a right to attend the main hearing and the
pronouncing of the verdict. The principle of publicity is contained in Article 279 of the Law on Criminal
Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.15/97, 44/02 and 74/04) according
to which the main hearing is public. The main hearing may only be attended by adults. The Law
determines cases when the public or a part of the public may be excluded from the main hearing: a)
for the protection of secrecy; b) for keeping public order; c) for the protection of morality; d) for the
protection of personal matters of the defendant, witness or the injured party; and e) for the protection
of the interest of a juvenile. The court may exclude the public anytime from the opening until the

317/453

completion of the main hearing ex officio or upon the proposal of the parties, but only after they have
been heard. (Article 280)
The exclusion does not refer to the parties, the injured, or their representatives and attorney, but to
third parties participating in the main hearing. The Chamber may allow the attendance of certain
official persons at hearings in which the public has been excluded, and upon the request of the
defendant the Chamber may allow the attendance of their spouses or partners and their close
relatives (first-degree blood relatives, foster-parent, foster-child, brother, sister or custodian). The
Chamber President shall warn the persons attending the main hearing at which the public has been
excluded that they are obliged to keep matters from the hearing in confidence and shall notify them
that revealing such secrets is a criminal offence. (Article 281)
The decision on exclusion of the public is adopted by the Chamber which must explicate and publish
such decision. This decision may only be challenged in the appeal against the verdict. (Article 282)
The main hearing may only be attended by adults. If a witness younger than 14 years of age is
heard, the Chamber may decide to exclude the public during his/her hearing. The juvenile attending
the main hearing as a witness or as an injured party shall be removed from the courtroom as soon as
his/her presence is deemed not necessary. (Article 316)
The publicity of the main hearing entails a public announcement of the verdict. Pursuant to Article
337, the verdict is pronounced and published on behalf of citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, and
pursuant to Article 344, the Chamber President in the presence of the parties, their legal
representatives, plenipotentiaries and attorneys shall publicly read the verdict and give a brief
explication. The public announcement shall also be delivered when the party, legal representative,
plenipotentiary or the defence attorney are absent. In that case the announcement is carried out
before the present public. If the public has been excluded from the main hearing, the announcement
of the verdict shall be carried out at a public sitting. The Chamber shall decide whether to exclude the
public during the announcement of the reasons for the verdict. This only refers to cases when public
has been excluded from the main hearing.
The Law on Criminal Procedure in the part regulating the procedure on juveniles includes several
provisions relating to the public, i.e. the exclusion of the public in proceedings against juveniles.
Pursuant to Article 467 of the Law, in a proceeding against a juvenile the public shall always be
excluded. The Chamber may allow the attendance at the main hearing of persons engaged in
education of juveniles or in suppression of juvenile crime, as well as academics. In the course of the
main hearing the Judicial Council may decide to exclude all persons except for the public prosecutor,
the defender and the representative of the guardian institution. During the exhibit of certain evidence
or parties’ speech, the Chamber may order a removal of the juvenile from the sitting.
The Law also prescribes certain restrictions regarding the publication of the verdict and information of
the public on the proceeding against the juvenile. For instance, without the court’s approval the
proceeding against a juvenile or a verdict passed must not be published. Only the approved part of
the proceeding or verdict may be published; however, the juvenile’s name or other data revealing
his/her identity must be excluded. Decisions and other information regarding the juvenile may not be
submitted through their exposure on the court's information board.
With regard to the civil procedure, pursuant to the Law on Litigation Procedure (“Official Gazette of
the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 33/98, 44/02) public trial is also one of the fundamental principles.
In the course of the civil procedure, the public may be excluded by the force of law in statutory
disputes (paternal, maternal and marriage disputes).
The court may exclude the public by a decision if the interests of keeping an official, business or
personal secret require privacy; if interests of public order or moral reasons require privacy; and if
measures on securing the order as stipulated in the Law on Litigation Procedure (Articles 291-295)
do not provide an unimpeded debate.

318/453

Within the project of monitoring the implementation of international standards on fair trials in domestic
courts and assessment of the courts’ functioning in the Republic of Macedonia, the Coalition of
citizens’ associations “All for Fair Trial” prepared a final report in September 2004 based on
monitored trials from July 2003 until July 2004. The report states that 643 criminal cases and 720 civil
cases have been observed. With regard to the implementation of the principle of public trial, it has
been determined that only in five criminal cases the public has been partially or fully excluded by a
court’s decision (in one of the cases the public has been partially excluded for lack of space in the
courtroom; in another the public has been excluded for reasons of privacy of the defendant, witness
or the plaintiff; and in three cases the public has been excluded for reasons of protecting a juvenile’s
interests). As far as civil cases are concerned in 696 out of 720 monitored trials (or 96,7%) the main
hearing has been public, and only in 24 cases or 3,3% the public has been excluded. All of the 24
cases were related to a divorce.
The aforementioned provisions are in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention for the
Protection of Human Rights and Freedoms.
29. Is the presumption of innocence a central part of your criminal justice system and, if so,
how is it applied in practice?
The presumption of innocence is stipulated in Article 13 of the Constitution (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 1/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) and Article 2, paragraph 1 of the
Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02 and
74/04). Pursuant to these provisions, a person indicted for an offence shall be presumed innocent
until his/her guilt is established by a final court decision. The second paragraph, Article 2 of the Law
establishes the in dubio pro reo principle as one of the significant consequences of the application of
the principle of presumption of innocence. Namely, in cases of doubt, the existence or non-existence
of facts that constitute the character of a criminal offence or upon which an application depends of
certain provision of the Criminal Code, is established by the court in a manner favourable for the
defendant.
It follows from the principle of presumption of innocence that the burden of proof rests on the
prosecution. The defendant is freed from the obligation to prove his/her innocence; he/she has a right
to remain silent and not respond to allegations. A defendant may not be forced to testify against
him/herself, his/her immediate family or to admit his/her guilt. Extorting a confession is forbidden and
punishable (Article 10 of the Law on Criminal Procedure) and a court decision may not be based
upon statements extorted under force, threat or other similar means (Article 210, paragraph 7). In line
with the principle of presumption of innocence is the provision of Article 1 of the Law on Criminal
Procedure under which prior to a final court judgment, rights and freedoms of a defendant and of
other persons may be restricted only to a necessary extent and under conditions prescribed by law.
In addition, Article 11 of the Law on Criminal Procedure determines that a person who has been
illegally deprived of liberty, detained or convicted, is entitled to compensation of damages from the
budget, to rehabilitation and to other rights established by law.
The Law stipulates another procedural consequence of the principle of presumption of innocence.
Namely, Article 342 sets forth that the court shall pronounce a judgment acquitting the defendant
unless it has been proved that he/she has committed the offence for which accused (acquittal due to
lack of evidence).
The Constitutional and legal provisions which regulate the presumption of innocence are in
compliance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on the Civil
and Political Rights.

319/453

30. Regarding the rights of defence, please provide information on how the following rights
are guaranteed in legislative and practical terms. (Please comment on the allocation of
resources and the institutional framework in place to facilitate the exercise of these rights.)
a) The right of the defendant to be informed promptly in a language which s/he understands of
the nature and cause of the accusation against him/her;
b) The defendant’s right to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his/her
defence;
c) The right to defend oneself in person or through legal assistance of one’s own choosing;
d) The right to examine, or have examined, witnesses against him/her and to obtain the
attendance and examination of witnesses on his/her behalf under the same conditions as
witnesses against him/her;
e) The right to have the free assistance of an interpreter if s/he cannot understand or speak
the language used in the court.
In reforming the criminal procedure, particular attention has been dedicated to the defendant’s rights
to fair trial with the rights and practice stipulated in the European Convention on Human Rights. The
rights to defence mentioned here, the list of which is not exhaustive, reflect only a number of aspects
of the fair trial concept in criminal proceedings guaranteed to the defendant as minimum rights, in
order to give him/her a fair possibility to defend from state charges.
a)
The Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.15/97, 44/02
and 74/04) contains several provisions that regulate the right of the defendant to be informed in the
language he/she understands on the accusations against him/her. Article 3 determines that the
person summoned, apprehended or deprived of freedom must immediately be informed in a
language he/she understands on the reasons for summoning, apprehension or deprivation of
freedom and on any other charges against him/her, as well as on his/her rights. The person must not
be compelled to give a statement. Article 4 of the Law on Criminal Procedures determining the
minimum rights to which every defendant is entitled stipulates the right of the defendant to be
informed immediately in a language he/she understands and in detail on the charges and evidence
against him/her. If the court violates the provisions on the language use in the course of the
procedure it makes an essential violation which can be basis for disputing the verdict (Article 355).
These general provisions have been further elaborated. In the first interrogation of the defendant in
investigation (Article 210), the body conducting the interrogation is obliged to notify the defendant of
the charges against him/her or of the grounds of suspicion existing against him/her. The same
obligation has been stipulated for cases when prior to the adoption of decision for conducting
investigation, the investigative judge shall interrogate the person against whom investigation is
requested (Article 152). Pursuant to Article 254, the bill of indictment includes detailed information on
the offence he/she has been charged with, its legal qualification, evidence it has been based upon,
etc. Somewhat more summarised information shall be contained in the summons (Article 176), the
decision for detention (Article 185) and the decision to conduct investigation (Articles 151 and 152).
However, significantly less detailed information is prescribed for summary proceedings for less
serious criminal offences, especially given that the indictment proposal (Article 421) includes only a
brief description of the criminal offence, and the defendant has not been previously heard so as to
inform him/her within the meaning of Article 210, paragraph 2.
b)
The defendant's right to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his/her defence has
been regulated in Article 4, paragraph 2 and subparagraph 2 of the Law on Criminal Procedure as
one of the minimum rights of the defendant in the criminal procedure.
The defendant is given enough time to prepare for the main hearing. Pursuant to Article 273,
paragraph 3 of the Law on Criminal Procedure the summons to the defendant must be submitted in
such a way that between the day of submitting the summons and the day of the main hearing the
defendant is given adequate time to prepare his/her defence, or at least 8 days. In the event of

320/453

summary proceedings (for crimes punishable with imprisonment of up to three years or a fine) this
period is at least three days.
The court may suspend the main hearing to allow time for the preparation of the defence if the
plaintiff changes the indictment, or modifies it with new charges on crimes carried out or detected in
the course of the main hearing.
As regards the time given for submitting appeals, the Law prescribes 15 days (in summary
proceedings it is 8 days) from the day of submission of the verdict’s transcript.
One of the conditions for the defence preparation is the right to inspection into the procedural
documents. Pursuant to Article 69 of the Law, the defendant has a right to review procedural
documents and subjects serving as evidence from the moment of the indictment, i.e. from the time
the investigative judge before adopting a decision on opening an investigation performs the required
investigation actions. The same right applies to the defendant, but only after he/she has been
examined (Article 124).
Pursuant to Article 166 of the Law on Criminal Procedure, if before the completed investigation the
investigative judge finds that it is in the interest of the defence to introduce the defendant and his/her
attorney to important evidence collected during the investigation, he/she shall inform them within
certain period of time that they are entitled to have access to the material and records referring to the
evidence and that they may give proposals for presentation of new evidence.
The Law on Criminal Procedure does not contain provisions on the basis of which the public
prosecution would be obliged to reveal evidence in favour of the defence; however, the obligation for
objectivity must be taken into consideration (the obligation to pay equal attention to facts charging the
defendant and those in his/her favour, as stipulated in Article 14 of the Law on Criminal Procedure).
c)
Article 4 of the Law on Criminal Procedure, within the minimum rights prescribed to every defendant
also stipulates the right of the defendant to defend him/herself in person or through legal assistance
of his/her choosing. If the defendant cannot pay for an attorney, he/she is entitled to receive free
defence in the interest of justice.
The defendant’s presence is one of the prerequisites for the main hearing.
Article 292, paragraph 3 of the Law on Criminal Procedure determines the conditions when the
defendant may be tried in his/her absence, i.e. if the defendant is a fugitive or not available to the
state agencies and there are particularly significant reasons to be prosecuted although absent. In the
event the defendant is tried in his/her absence the Law guarantees him/her the right to a defence
attorney (pursuant to Article 66 of the Law on Criminal Procedure the defendant tried in absence
must have an attorney at the time the decision on a trial in his/her absence is adopted), as well as the
option to reopen the procedure in case the defendant and his/her attorney submit a request for
reopening of the procedure within the period of one year as of the day the convict has learnt of the
verdict pronounced in his absence (Article 398 of the Law on Criminal Procedure).
The defendant is present at the main hearing from the beginning until the closure, and his/her
presence is active. The defendant has a right to propose the determination of new facts and present
new evidence until the closure of the main hearing, as well as to examine the co-defendants,
witnesses and experts. An exception to this rule is the option to temporarily remove the defendant
from the main hearing if he/she disturbs the order in the courtroom (Article 287).
The defendant may also be removed if other defendants or witnesses refuse to give a statement in
his/her presence or if circumstances imply that his/her presence prevents the other defendants to tell
the truth. The latter is carried out under the condition that the defence attorney is present and the
defendant has been informed about the content of their statements.

321/453

As regards summary proceedings, if the defendant does not appear at the main hearing and if he/she
has been properly summoned or the summons could not be delivered due to change of address or
residence, the court may decide to hold the main hearing in his/her absence only if his/her presence
is not necessary and if he/she has been examined.
Juveniles must not be tried in their absence.
The right to an attorney is a constitutionally guaranteed right. Pursuant to Article 12 of the
Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, the person summoned or detained has a right to an
attorney in the police station or in court procedures.
This right has been implemented in Article 3, paragraph 2 of the Law on Criminal Procedure
according to which the suspect or the defendant must first be clearly advised on his/her right to
remain silent, his/her right to consult a lawyer and to acquire an attorney of his/her choosing during
the examination. Pursuant to Article 63 of the Law on Criminal Procedure, the suspect in the
preliminary proceedings, i.e. the defendant before the first examination must be advised that he/she
has a right to an attorney of his/her choosing and that the attorney may attend his/her examination.
The defendant may defend him/herself alone and is free to choose and appoint an attorney. This
right is not absolute as the defendant may only appoint a lawyer as an attorney, and Article 66 of the
Law on Criminal Procedure stipulates the cases of mandatory defence. Hence, if the defendant is
hearing or visually impaired, or incapable of defending himself/herself, or in case of a criminal
procedure against him/her for a crime punishable with a life sentence, he/she must be represented
by a defence attorney from the first hearing. In the event the defendant has been sentenced to
detention, he/she shall have a defence attorney while detained. Following the indictment for a crime
punishable with ten or more years of imprisonment, the defendant must have an attorney at the time
of delivery of the bill of indictment against him/her. The defendant tried in absence must have an
attorney upon the decision on his/her trial in absence.
If, in cases of mandatory defence the defendant has not appointed an attorney, the President of the
Court shall appoint an ex officio attorney for the rest of the proceedings until the verdict comes into
effect. The defendant shall be informed on the appointment of an ex officio attorney along with the
issuance of the indictment.
Except cases of mandatory defence, the Law on Criminal Procedure stipulates a right to free legal
assistance in cases when the defendant cannot pay the defence costs. When conditions of
mandatory defence have not been met (Article 67), and the procedure is underway for crimes
punishable with over one year imprisonment, the defendant may be appointed a defence attorney
upon his/her request, provided that his/her property status would not allow him/her to cover defence
costs.
As regards defence costs, even when the defendant has been found guilty he/she is exempted from
costs when the attorney has been appointed by the court (for reasons of lack of funds of the
defendant). Same applies in cases when the payment of such costs would raise the issue of the
ability to support him/herself or his/her family (Article 93).
The defendant may have the advice of defence attorney during the course of the entire proceedings.
A defendant who has been detained may exchange letters and talk with the defence attorney freely
and without supervision (Article 70). Only by derogation, this right may be subject to supervision in
the course of the proceedings if the detention has been determined due to a risk of influence over the
evidence (Article 184, paragraph 2). Such an order may only be given by the investigative judge, who
is sole authorised to review the written correspondence and to be present during conversation.
d)
The right of the defendant to examine the witnesses is one of the minimum rights the defendant has
been guaranteed pursuant to Article 4 of the Law on Criminal Procedure. The defendant is entitled to
this right both in the course of the investigation and the main hearing. Namely, the defendant and

322/453

his/her attorney may attend the examination of witnesses and have them examined by the
investigative judge. Upon the judge's approval they may also directly examine witnesses. The
defendant and the attorney have a right to request that their remarks be recorded in the minutes as
far as the implementation of certain investigative actions is concerned, and they may request
presentation of particular evidence.
Witnesses at main hearings are examined in the defendant’s presence, and when the Chamber
President closes the examination of a particular witness or expert the Chamber members may
directly examine the witness. Upon the Chamber President’s approval, the defendant and his/her
attorney may directly examine witnesses and experts. The President may prohibit the examination or
the response to an already posed question if such question is inappropriate (i.e. a suggestive
question which implies the answer or a capricious question which takes as a starting point that the
defendant has confessed something that he/she has actually not – Article 211) or if it does not refer
to the subject. In that case the parties may request the Chamber's deliberation on the issue.
In practice, the Court dominates the examination of witnesses which arises from its obligation to
determine all the relevant facts in the line of duty. Namely, pursuant to Article 14 of the Law on
Criminal Procedure, courts and state bodies are obliged to truthfully and fully determine facts relevant
for bringing a decision. They are bound to pay equal attention and determine both facts on behalf of
the defendant and facts against him/her. However, parties until the closure of the main hearing may
propose a presentation of new facts and collect new evidence.
Consequently, the defence may propose the examination of new witnesses, yet the court is the
deciding factor on whether the examination of the proposed witnesses would contribute to the
establishment of truth. Otherwise the court may refuse to examine them. This authorisation of the
court is somewhat restricted by its obligation to always note the reasons on why it has refused the
parties’ proposals and the reasons on why it has decided not to directly examine the witness or
expert whose statement has been read without the parties’ consent.
Following the completion of the examination of every witness or expert, the Chamber President shall
ask the parties if they have remarks. As far as probative proceedings, after their closure the Chamber
President shall ask the parties if they have proposals on their modification.
The Law on Criminal Procedure stipulates that all evidence relevant to rightful decision-making must
be presented before the court (the principle of directness). This principle has been reinforced by the
obligation to directly examine a person if proving a fact is based on his/her witnessing. The
examination may not be replaced by the reading of minutes of a previous hearing. The Law also
determines the cases excluding the principle of directness, i.e. the approval to read minutes
containing witnesses’ statements. Namely, pursuant to Article 325 of the Law, minutes of witnesses'
statements may be read upon the Chamber's decision only if the examined persons have died, have
suffered mental illnesses or cannot be traced, or if their presence before the court is deemed
impossible or hindered due to age, disease or other important reasons and if witnesses and experts
refuse to give statements without legal grounds.
e)
Pursuant to Article 3, paragraph 1 of the Law on Criminal Procedure, the person summoned,
apprehended or detained must immediately be informed in a language he/she understands on the
reasons of summoning, apprehending or detaining and on any indictments against him/her, as well
as on his/her rights. He/she may not be extorted a statement. Any accused person has a right to be
informed immediately in a language he/she understands on the indictments and evidence against
him/her (Article 4). Pursuant to Article 6 of the Law on Criminal Procedure, official language in the
course of criminal proceedings is the Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet. A language
spoken by at least 20% of the citizens may also be used in the proceedings, pursuant to the Law.
In accordance with Article 7 of the Law on Criminal Procedure, the defendant, the injured party, the
plaintiff, witnesses and other persons participating in the procedure and speaking a language other
than Macedonian, have a right to use their language and alphabet in the course of preliminary

323/453

investigation proceedings and the main hearing, as well as in procedures concerning appeals. The
Court shall provide oral interpreting as well as translations of documents and other written material.
In addition the court shall provide translated written material of importance to the procedure or the
defence.
Other parties and witnesses in the court procedure have a right to free interpreting if they do not
understand or speak the language in which the procedure is conducted.
The person shall be given legal advice on his/her right to interpreting, which shall be noted in the
minutes.
The translation or interpreting is carried out by a court authorised interpreter.
Pursuant to Article 8 of the Law on Criminal Procedure, indictments, appeals and other documents
are submitted to the court in the language in which the procedure is conducted. Citizens who speak
an official language other than Macedonian may submit their submissions in the language they speak
and in its alphabet. The court shall translate the submissions and present them to other parties in the
procedure. Same applies to other persons who do not speak or understand Macedonian and its
Cyrillic alphabet. The defendant that does not understand the language in which the procedure is
conducted is given translations into the language he/she has used in the course of the procedure.
Foreign citizens deprived of freedom or in detention may submit their submission in their language,
and in other cases under conditions of reciprocity.
Pursuant to Article 9 of the Law on Criminal Procedure, indictments, appeals and other submissions
are submitted to the court in the language in which the procedure is conducted. Citizens who speak
an official language other than Macedonian shall receive summons, rulings and other written
correspondence into their language. A defendant in detention, in prison or confined in a health
institution under compulsory psychiatric treatment shall receive translations of submissions into the
language he/she has used in the procedure. The defendant shall also receive a translation of the
verdict in the language he/she has used in the course of the procedure.
All expenses regarding the right to translator shall be covered by the budget.
The aforementioned provisions are in accordance with the International Covenant for Civil and
Political Rights and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Freedoms.
With respect to determining funds and an institutional framework enabling the exercise of the
aforementioned rights, it is important to note that the Law on Criminal Procedure, Chapter IX, also
regulates the issues of costs of the criminal procedure.
Namely, criminal procedure costs are costs generated from the beginning of its initiation until its
closure, and costs for the undertaken investigative actions prior to the investigation. These costs
comprise costs for translators, interpreters as well as awards and disbursements for the defendant. In
proceedings for crimes prosecuted ex officio costs are paid in advance by the body carrying out the
procedure and are charged afterwards from the persons obliged to recompense those costs, as
prescribed by the Law. The translation costs occurring from the implementation of provisions
referring to the right to a free assistance of an interpreter will not be charged to persons who
according to the provisions of the Law are obliged to compensate costs.
When the court finds the defendant guilty the verdict shall note that he/she is obliged to recompense
the costs of the criminal procedure. The decision determining payment of costs may exempt the
defendant from his/her duty to recompense fully or partially the costs of the procedure if payment of
such costs would raise the issue of the ability to support him/herself or his/her family.

324/453

When the proceedings are suspended; the court finds the defendant not guilty or the charges have
been dropped, the verdict shall state that the costs of the criminal procedure are to be covered by
budgetary funds.
In accordance with the Law on Court Budget (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
60/03) judicial budget costs comprise ordinary and capital costs. Costs of the proceedings are
covered by ordinary costs.
31. Provide information about the elaboration and implementation of legislation regarding the
following legal concepts:
a) The principle that a person cannot be prosecuted for something that was not a criminal
offence in national or international law at the time when it took place;
b) Non-application of a heavier sentence than was applicable at the time the criminal offence
was committed;
c) Proportionality of the severity of the penalty to the criminal offence.
a)
The principle of legality is defined as a constitutional principle in the legal system of the Republic of
Macedonia. Pursuant to Article 14, paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 1/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), а person
may not be punished for an offence which had not been declared an offence punishable by law, or by
other acts, prior to it being committed, and for which no punishment had been prescribed. The
principle of legality has been more precisely formulated in the definition of criminal offences and
prescription of criminal sanctions. According to Article 1 of the Criminal Code (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 37/96, 80/99, 4/02, 43/03 and 19/04), a person may not be sentenced
to a punishment or some other penal action for an act, which prior to its being committed, had not
been determined by law to be a crime and for which no punishment had been prescribed by law.
The same principle is also regulated by the Law on Misdemeanours (Official Gazette of the Republic
of Macedonia, Nos. 15/97, 35/97). The Law (Article 3) prescribes that a person may not be punished
for misdemeanour for an act which, prior to its being committed, had not been determined by law as
a misdemeanour and for which no punishment had been prescribed by law.
b)
One of the most important legal consequences from the principle of legality is the prohibition of
retroactivity of laws prescribing punishable acts and punishments. The Constitution of the Republic of
Macedonia clearly determines in Article 52, paragraph 4 that laws and other regulations may not
have a retroactive effect, except in cases when it is more favourable for the citizens. In the Criminal
Code this constitutional provision has been specified as a rule of validity of legal norms determining
criminal offences and criminal sanctions. Article 3 of the Criminal Code prescribes that the offender
may be punished with the law that had been applicable at the time when the offence had been
committed. If the law has been changed once or several times after the crime had been committed,
the law which is more lenient to the offender may be applied. If a new alternative, security or
correctional measure has been prescribed, it may be pronounced only if it is compatible with an
earlier prescribed measure and if it is not less favourable for the offender.
The criteria for assessment of the stringency or lenience of consecutively adopted laws have neither
been normatively defined by the Constitution nor by the Criminal Code, and are resolved in the
framework of judicial practice in every single case. In practice, Macedonian judiciary has accepted
that the law resulting in a more favourable outcome for the offender is more lenient.
c)
The proportionality of the punishment’s stringency to the criminal offence has been incorporated into
Article 2 of the Criminal Code. Pursuant to this Article, the protection of freedoms and rights of
citizens and other fundamental values as well as the use of criminal and legal coercion when it is
necessary for the prevention of activities detrimental to society are a basis for determining criminal
offences and prescribing sanctions.

325/453

Article 4 of the Criminal Code prescribes types of criminal sanctions applied to offenders
(punishments, alternative, security or correctional measures), and Article 5 prescribes the limitations
in execution of sanctions. Namely, the offender may be deprived of certain rights at the time of the
sanction’s execution only to the extent appropriate with the nature and content of the sanction and
only if it secures the respect of the offender’s personality and his/her personal dignity.
In order to ensure proportionality of the seriousness of punishment with the offence, the Criminal
Code includes provisions for meting out of the punishment within the determined framework (Articles
39-47). They stipulate that when determining the punishment, the court shall take into consideration
the criminal liability of the perpetrator, seriousness of the offence and the intended purpose of
punishment. The court is obliged to take into account all the mitigating and aggravating
circumstances. Relevant for the proportionality of the punishment and the offence are also the
provisions for alleviating the punishment when the offence has been committed under particularly
mitigating circumstances; acquittal of punishment for the purpose of eliminating the detrimental
consequences of the criminal offence etc.
The foregoing constitutional and legal provisions are in compliance with the European Convention on
the Protection of Human Rights and Freedoms.
32. Please provide details on how the right not to be tried or punished twice in criminal
proceedings for the same criminal offence is interpreted in your domestic law.
Prohibition of double trial or punishment is an internationally established principle aimed at
preventing that the same person is tried or punished twice for the same criminal offence (ne bis in
idem). The Republic of Macedonia has been bound to this principle under the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights, which in Article 14, paragraph 7 provides that no one shall be liable to be
tried or punished for an offence for which he/she has already been finally convicted or acquitted in
accordance with the law. The Republic of Macedonia has undertaken similar obligation by the
ratification of the Protocol No. 7 to the European Convention on Human Rights, which, like the
Covenant, is a part of the internal legal order and is directly applicable in courts.
In the Republic of Macedonia, the prohibition of trying or punishing twice the same persons for the
same offences is a constitutional principle, stipulated in Article 14, paragraph 2 of the Constitution
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03). Under
this provision, no person shall be tried in a court of law for an offence for which he/she already been
tried and for which a final court decision has already been made. The Law on Criminal Procedure
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.15/97, 44/03 and 74/04) in Article 5 contains
almost the same wording which, within the meaning of the Covenant, explicitly prohibits both trying
and punishing twice the same person for the same offence.
The prohibition of trying and punishing twice for the same offence yields a number of legal
consequences. Like all European countries, the Republic of Macedonia acknowledges the principle
that after the regular legal remedies (appeals) have been exhausted, or after the time frame for their
submission has expired, the verdict shall be considered final and shall attain the quality of res
judicata. However, extra-legal remedies are allowed against a final verdict. Pursuant to the
Amendments to the Law on Criminal Procedure of 1997, extra-legal remedies may only be filed on
behalf of the defendant, although this absolute prohibition for final court decisions to be challenged to
the detriment of the defendant does not arise from the aforementioned international instruments.
Nevertheless, re-opening of procedure is allowed (only on behalf of the convict) if it has been proved
that the verdict had been found on a false statement, if new facts or evidence have been presented
and in other cases determined by law (Article 388 and 389). Extra-ordinary mitigation of punishment
is allowed when circumstances appear that were not present when the verdict was pronounced or the
court had no knowledge of their existence, and they would have obviously led to a less serious
verdict (Articles 399 - 402). A defendant who has been sentenced to imprisonment by a final verdict
may file a request for extra-ordinary renewal of deliberation of the verdict due to specific violations of
the Law (Articles 411 - 415 o). Against the final court decisions and against the preceding court

326/453

proceedings, the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia may file a request for the protection
of legality, in case the Law has been violated (Articles 403-410). The renewal of the procedure and
the request for the protection of legality may now be also used for re-opening of procedure in cases
of violation of the European Convention on Human Rights or another international treaty ratified in
accordance with the Constitution.
In the domestic legal practice, certain ambiguities arose from the constitutional wording used in the
provision prohibiting renewed trial or punishment of an already convicted person. This has been
particularly due to the fact that the wording used therein mentions punishable acts, which means that,
besides criminal offences, it also includes misdemeanours and thus involves in the delicate
relationship between the misdemeanour and criminal procedure. Namely, even thus far it has not
been a matter of dispute that in cases when a single offence has been incriminated both as
misdemeanour and as criminal offence, only criminal proceedings shall be instituted; in case
misdemeanour procedure has already been initiated, it shall be suspended. More perplexing has
been the issue whether a person already convicted for a misdemeanour may be tried and punished
in criminal proceedings. The court practice so far, pursuant to Article 47 of the Criminal Code,
provided that in such cases, the sentence pronounced for misdemeanour shall be counted within the
punishment pronounced in the criminal proceedings. However, the more recent court practice started
to interpret in a more restrictive manner and in favour of the citizen this constitutional provision, i.e. to
reject the possibility to try in criminal proceedings a person already convicted for misdemeanour.
33. How is the right to vote regulated? Do women and members of ethnic minorities have
equal voting rights? Please indicate what measures have been taken to follow-up on the most
recent OSCE/ODIHR election reports and analyses of election laws relating to the local,
presidential, and parliamentary elections.
The right to vote is provided for and guaranteed by Article 22, paragraph 1, of the Constitution the
Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No 52/91, 01/92, 31/98,
91/01 and 84/03), which specifies that every citizen on reaching 18 years of age acquires the right to
vote.
The right to vote is equal, universal and direct, and is exercised at free elections by secret ballot
(Article 22, paragraph 2).
Equality as a principle of the right to vote implies that the vote of each citizen has equal value,
meaning that every citizen, regardless of ethnicity or gender (male or female) has an equal right to
vote.
The direct aspect of the right to vote rules out any possibility of the exercise of this right by proxy, as
it is strictly linked to the person who votes.
A logical extension of the right to vote is the right explicitly provided for by Article 23 of the
Constitution, that every citizen has the right to take part in the performance of public affairs, meaning
that public office is accessible to every citizen.
Voting legislation in the Republic of Macedonia consists of the following laws:
−
−
−
−

The Law on the Voters’ List (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 42/02 and
35/04);
The Law on the Election of Representatives to the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 42/02, 50/02 and 46/04);
The Law on Electoral Units for the Election of Representatives to the Assembly of the
Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 43/02);
The Law on the Election of the President of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of
the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 20/94, 48/99 and 11/04); and

327/453

−

The Law on Local Elections (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 46/96,
48/96, 56/96, 12/03, 35/04, 42/04, 45/04-consolidated text, 52/04 and 60/04).

After the adoption of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, in November
2001, taking into consideration the reports of the OSCE and ODIHR concerning elections, and
following the analysis of the laws on local, presidential and parliamentary elections, voting legislation
was amended with the aim of creating a legal basis for the running of fair and democratic elections.
The main shortcomings of the Law on the Election of Representatives to the Assembly of the
Republic of Macedonia were identified and a new Law on the Election of Representatives to the
Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia was drawn up; it was enacted with the consensus of all
parliamentary political parties on 14.06.2002. The Law simplified the running of elections in a single
round through the introduction of a proportional electoral model involving six electoral units, based on
the election of a list of candidates through proportional representation. Judges were appointed,
among others, as members of the election bodies to augment the independence of decision-making
in the electoral process. A higher level of professionalism was introduced in the exercise of the
Representatives’ office. Voting reliability was increased with the introduction of mandatory signatures
(or fingerprints), the use of a special spray and also by strengthening the security of the buildings
used for voting. A 30 percent representation on the lists of candidates was guaranteed for both
genders. The use of the different languages of the various communities was provided for. All
internally displaced persons were given the opportunity to exercise their right to vote. The Law also
stipulated the establishment of a Secretariat to support the work of the State Electoral Commission,
which certainly increased the operational effectiveness of the electoral bodies.
With regard to the protection of the right to vote, modifications have been made to the earlier law,
specifying that any submitter of a list of candidates has the right to make an objection before the
State Electoral Commission regarding the process of voting, counting and determining the result of
the vote, and also to lodge a complaint against the decision of the latter before the Supreme Court of
the Republic of Macedonia. Every voter and every submitter of a list of candidates, provided that he
or she discovers irregularities in the election process, can make an objection before the Regional
Electoral Commission, and a complaint against the decision of the latter can be lodged before the
competent appellate court. The procedures for the protection of the right to vote have been simplified
by these changes which are essentially in line with the observations and comments of the
OSCE/ODIHR.
An important part of the continuous development of the electoral administration should include more
public education and information for voters to prevent practices such as “group voting” and “voting by
proxy” (or “family voting”), which depart from the principle of individual voting, violate voting
confidentiality and contribute to the “devaluation” of the status of women. To overcome this situation,
the geographic areas (including specific polling stations) where constant problems were encountered
in several successive elections should be identified and appropriate measures taken, including the
replacement of election officials whose work has proved unsatisfactory. The OSCE/ODIHR
recommended that, if possible, “supervisors” be appointed in these polling stations to improve the
way in which elections are run.
The most recent elections for the election of Representatives to the Assembly of the Republic of
Macedonia took place on 15.09.2002.
According to the final OSCE/ODIHR report, the new election laws passed in June 2002 efficiently
addressed some shortcomings noticed earlier and generally safeguarded the necessary legal basis
for elections. The parliamentary elections of 15.09.2002 were held in accordance with the guidelines
of the OSCE and international standards concerning democratic elections.
As far as the running of elections is concerned, the Law on the Election of the President of the
Republic of Macedonia is linked to the Law on the Election of Representatives to the Assembly of the
Republic of Macedonia. In the period prior to the running of presidential elections, having analysed
the existing Law on the Election of the President of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of

328/453

the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 20/94 and 48/99), representatives from the international
community gave their opinion stating that only slight changes in the election laws were needed in
order to hold successful presidential elections. Following the sudden tragic death of the President of
the Republic of Macedonia, it was necessary to amend the Law on the Election of the President of
the Republic of Macedonia so as to address the question of the cessation of the term of office of the
President of the Republic of Macedonia during his or her mandate.
In reference to this, Article 81, paragraph 7, of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia
prescribes that if the term of office of the President of the Republic terminates for any reason, the
election of a new President should take place within 40 days of the day of termination. Article 82 of
the Constitution states that in case of death, resignation, permanent inability to perform his or her
duties, or in case of termination of the mandate in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution,
the office of the President of the Republic is carried out by the President of the Assembly until a new
President is elected. Paragraph 2 of the same article specifies that the decisions on the applicability
of the conditions for the cessation of office of the President of the Republic are the official duty of the
Constitutional Court.
Taking into consideration these constitutional provisions, modifications were made by the Law
Amending the Law on the Election of President of the Republic of Macedonia, enacted in March 2004
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 11/04), regarding the scheduling and holding of
elections. It specified that the bodies responsible for the running of elections were the State Electoral
Commission, the municipal electoral commissions and electoral boards. The content of the ballot
paper and the languages in which the ballot papers for the election of the President were to be
printed were determined in accordance with Amendment V of the Constitution.
This provision does not deal with the consequences of the rule concerning ballot papers in cases
where there are no election candidates from some of the communities. As a result, in the second
round of the elections, the names of the two remaining candidates were printed only in Macedonian,
as pointed out by the OSCE.
The question of the election of a President in case of termination of the incumbent’s term of office
was also addressed, and the deadlines for conducting all the election procedures prescribed by the
Constitution (Article 81) were specified, in particular the periods concerning the scheduling of
elections, the procedures for collecting signatures for candidates running for president, the
submission of lists of candidates, the duration of the election campaign (Articles 10a to 10c of the
Law on the Election of the President of the Republic of Macedonia). In addition to this, the protection
of a citizen’s right to vote was brought into harmony with the Law on the Election of Representatives
to the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia.
The latest (early) elections for the election of the President of the Republic of Macedonia took place
on 14 April (first round) and 28 April 2004 (second round). The OSCE/ODIHR report assessed that
they were held in accordance with the election recommendations of the OSCE.
The 2000 local elections were held in the Republic of Macedonia in accordance with the 1996 Law on
Local Elections. With regard to the running of early elections for the election of mayors, in 2003 the
section of the Law on Local Elections referring to election bodies was amended in order to specify
the competencies of the State Electoral Commission, to implement Amendment V as regards the use
of the languages printed on ballot papers for the election of mayors and council members, to improve
police protection of buildings used for voting, and to ensure greater voting reliability with the
introduction of mandatory signatures (or fingerprints) and the use of a spray. More specific provisions
connected to the protection of the right to vote were introduced as well.
In accordance with the recommendations of the OSCE/ODIHR concerning the forthcoming local
elections to be run in March 2005, the Law on Local Elections was amended with regard to the
following: the scheduling and holding of elections, the bodies responsible for the running of elections,
a 30 percent representation of both genders on the lists of candidates for council members in both
the upper and lower halves of the list, the use of the languages of community members, election

329/453

campaigns and the financing of local elections, the protection of the right to vote, as well as election
monitoring. These provisions are harmonised with the Law on the Election of Representatives to the
Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, which, according to the OSCE recommendations,
represents the groundwork for the development of a comprehensive election code.
Bearing in mind the most recent recommendations of the OSCE concerning presidential elections
with regard to the implementation of Amendment V to the Constitution, the section of the Law on
Local Elections as regards the use of the languages of community members in the election process
during local elections was amended.
The amendments address the elements given below.
In the units of local self-government where at least 20 percent of the citizens speak an official
language other than Macedonian, the forms used for taking minutes are printed in the official
language and alphabet used by at least 20 percent of the citizens in that unit of local selfgovernment, in addition to the Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet (Article 16).
In the work of electoral commissions and electoral boards in the units of local self-government where
at least 20 percent of the citizens speak an official language other than Macedonian, the language
and alphabet used by at least 20 percent of the citizens in that unit of local self-government are in
official use, in addition to the Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet (Article 18).
Those submitting lists in the units of local self-government where at least 20 percent of the citizens
speak an official language other than Macedonian, submit the lists of candidates, including the lists
for a mayor, in the official language and alphabet used by the citizens of that unit of local selfgovernment (Article 25).
In the units of local self-government where at least 20 percent of the citizens speak an official
language other than Macedonian, the announcement of the lists of candidates, including the lists for
a mayor, is made in the official language and alphabet used by the citizens in that unit of local selfgovernment, in addition to the Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet (Article 31).
The polling stations where irregularities and violations of election laws have been recorded over
several election cycles and where the work of the members of election bodies has been assessed as
unsatisfactory, were identified by the State Electoral Commission. These facts will be taken into
consideration while forming bodies for the forthcoming local elections at all levels, and none of these
persons will be a part of the administration running the elections.
The provision in the Law on Local Elections concerning the transfer of the procedures for ruling on
possible complaints and objections about violations to the election process at local level is in
harmony with the recommendations given in the reports of the OSCE/ODIHR monitoring missions
and is in accordance with the current process of decentralisation. This means that the municipal
electoral commissions are responsible for making decisions in all such cases in the first instance.
On two occasions in 2004, during the organisation of the extraordinary presidential election and the
referendum, the State Electoral Commission conducted a comprehensive campaign to instruct
voters, in particular women and less well-educated voters, and all members of the electoral boards
(15.000 persons). The same course of action is planned for the forthcoming local elections (March
2005).
Concerning the participation of judges in the electoral administration, particularly regarding the
judges of the Supreme Court who are members of the State Electoral Commission, the Government
of the Republic of Macedonia will propose an amendment to Article 13 of the Law on the Election of
Representatives to the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia in order to eliminate the influence of
political parties in their appointment, upon consent of the opposition.
To prevent possible manipulation with the votes of citizens of the Republic of Macedonia who are
included in the voters’ lists but who have moved out of the country and have officially registered

330/453

places of residence in foreign countries, supplementary amendments are planned to the Law on the
Voters’ List, in addition to the existing legal guarantees. Through these amendments, this category of
voters would be differentiated from those citizens who have permanent residences in the Republic of
Macedonia.
As described above, the changes recommended by the OSCE/ODIHR concerning election legislation
have either been included into the appropriate laws and implemented in practice, or their
implementation is under way.
34. Freedom of expression:
a) Provide information concerning the elaboration and implementation of legislation regarding
the promotion of the freedom of expression and information in general and, specifically,
freedom and pluralism of the media. Please detail measures designed to prevent interference
with these freedoms.
b) Describe the media landscape (written press and audiovisual sector). How are the
audiovisual media financed? Is there a supervisory body for the (audiovisual) media and, if
so, how does it function? Have recommendations of experts from the Council of Europe and
OSCE been taken into consideration when drafting legislation in the field of media? Is the
media legislation aligned to European standards?
c) How is libel law organised, and what types of penalties are used? What is the general trend
of court decisions in the area of freedom of expression (including the number of libel suits
and other cases involving representatives of the news media)?
d) Please indicate how laws on telecommunications have been, or will be, amended to take
account of international recommendations.
a)
The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
52/91, 1/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), in Article 16, guarantees the right to freedom of expression as
a complex right composed of the following components: freedom of conviction, conscience, thought
and public expression of thought (Article 16, paragraph 1); freedom of speech, public address, public
information and establishment of institutions for public information (Article 16, paragraph 2); free
access to information, freedom of reception and transmission of information (Article 16, paragraph 3);
right to a reply in the mass media (Article 16, paragraph 4); right to a correction in the mass media
(Article 16, paragraph 5) and right to protect a source of information in the mass media (Article 16,
paragraph 6). Furthermore, Article 16, paragraph 7 prohibits censorship.
The right to freedom of thought is guaranteed by the Constitution without any restrictions whatsoever,
and together with the freedom of personal conviction, conscience, public expression of thought and
religious confession, it has been raised to the level of a fundamental human right that cannot be
restricted even under exceptional circumstances (state of war or state of emergency). In addition,
these freedoms and rights enjoy judicial protection, as well as direct constitutional protection by the
Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia.
The Criminal Code (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” Nos. 37/96, 80/99, 04/02, 43/03
and 19/04) prohibits any form of coercion in general and hence any form of coercion in order to
change certain position or conviction of a person. Political or religious conviction may not be grounds
for restriction or deprivation of the constitutionally guaranteed rights. Breach of this proscription
constitutes a criminal offence (Article 137 of the Criminal Code – violation of the equality of citizens
which, among other, sanctions any deprivation or restriction of rights as guaranteed with the
Constitution, the laws or international treaties, as well as any privileges granted to citizens on the
basis of their political or religious convictions).
Freedom of expression and public information, freedom to establish public information institutions, as
well as the freedom of access to information (access to information in international documents has
been part of the right to freedom of expression) besides being regulated in the highest legal act – the
Constitution, are regulated with a number of laws such as: the Broadcasting Law (“Official Gazette of
the Republic of Macedonia” Nos. 20/97 , 70/03), the Law on Public Information (“Official Gazette of

331/453

the SFRY”, No. 84/90), the Telecommunications Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia,
Nos. 33/96, 17/98, 22/98 – consolidated text, 28/00, 04/02, 37/04). With a view to a comprehensive
implementation of this right in all segments of society, as it refers not only to the media, but to all
citizens, as well, articles pertaining to this right exist also in the Law on Organisation and Operation
of the State Administrative Bodies (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 58/00 and
44/02), Law on Internal Affairs (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 19/95, 55/97,
38/02, 33/03 and 19/04), and the Law on Health Insurance (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 25/00, 34/00, 96/00, 50/01, 11/02 and 31/03). In addition, the Assembly passed the
first reading and approved the Proposal to adopt the Law on Free Access to Public Information on its
session of 26.01.2005, which also includes provisions regulating this area.
Constitutional provisions have been further elaborated in the Broadcasting Law. Namely, Article 4,
paragraph 1 of this Law guarantees that by the broadcasting activities, freedom shall be provided of
public expression of thought, freedom of speech, public address and public information. Paragraph 2
of the same Article provides that by the broadcasting activity, free access to information shall be
provided, as well as freedom of reception and transmission of information, right to a reply and to a
correction and right to protect sources of information.
Furthermore, in Article 8, the following principles are cited upon which the broadcasting activity is
based: openness to free competition and information on various political ideas, cultural and other
tendencies and opinions (subparagraph 2); independence and autonomy of broadcasting
organisations with no right of state bodies to influence the concept and content of their programmes
(subparagraph 5); prevention of monopoly in the influence of individuals or groups within
broadcasting organisations (subparagraph 6); prohibition of censorship in broadcasting
(subparagraph 9).
Article 31, which regulates the goals that are to be achieved with broadcasting programmes, cites,
among others, the following: respect of freedoms and rights of persons and citizens, their dignity and
reputation (subparagraph 1); free promotion of thought and convictions and provision of
comprehensive and objective information to listeners and viewers (subparagraph 2).
The Law also stipulates other measures aimed at the protection of the freedom of expression and
information dissemination. For instance, Article 32 sets forth that a programme may not serve onesidedly for the purposes of a political party or certain interests. Article 33 stipulates that the
programmes should encourage, among other, the free opinion-making on particular events and
issues. Article 34 highlights that state bodies and bodies of the local self-government units, as well as
their representatives may not influence the process of radio and TV production or their operation.
The Law also elaborates on the right to a reply and correction (Article 62 and 63), and the access to
information and protection of sources of information (Article 64).
Special measures for protection of media pluralism have been stipulated in the provisions on the
restriction of media concentration. Namely, Article 10 of the Broadcasting Law stipulates that a
natural or legal person may be a founder of only one commercial broadcasting company and a cofounder of only one more commercial broadcasting company, with a maximum of 25% share in its
total capital. A foreign natural or legal person may co-found a commercial broadcasting company with
a maximum of 25% share in its total capital. More foreign natural or legal persons, being co-founders
in a commercial broadcasting company, may own a maximum of 49% in its total capital. Provisions of
Article 17 provide a follow-up and pursuant to it only one concession for radio i.e. television may be
issued to a single commercial broadcasting company for the territory of the Republic of Macedonia.
Two concessions may be awarded for broadcasting on a local level, one for radio and another for
television. However, they may be issued for different, non-neighbouring regions. In addition, a
broadcasting organisation may not be founded i.e. co-founded by a political party, religious
association or group, a public-office holder or a political party official (Article 11, paragraph 2).
Furthermore, an additional restriction of concentration is provided by full exclusion of the possibility
for associating the spheres of broadcasting and the press. A natural or legal person operating in the

332/453

sphere of the press may not found an organisation or operate in broadcasting. Similarly, a
broadcasting organisation may not found a press organisation or operate in the sphere of the press
(Article 11, paragraph 1).
There are ongoing activities in the Republic of Macedonia for the adoption of a new Broadcasting
Law. The Government and the Ministry of Transport and Communications, which are competent to
propose and define the broadcasting law, established in late August 2004 a working group which
included all entities involved in the broadcasting sphere. The new law is expected to be adopted in
spring 2005. The text also includes provisions guaranteeing and elaborating on the issues pertaining
to the protection of freedom of expression and the dissemination of information. The text has been
aligned with the European standards.
The following laws also include provisions aimed at ensuring the free access to information by
citizens, as well as enabling them to be acquainted with developments in various institutions. The
state administrative bodies, pursuant to the Law on Organisation and Operation of the State
Administrative Bodies adopted in 2000, are obliged to ensure efficient and legal exercise of citizens’
constitutional rights and to inform the public on their operation. Article 10 of the Law stipulates the
following manners of involvement of the public in the preparation of laws within the state bodies’
competence: by public announcements on the type, content and timeframe for the adoption of the
respective law or other regulation; organisation of public forums and provision of opinions by
stakeholders (citizens’ associations, legal persons etc.).
The Ministry of the Interior, under the Law on Internal Affairs is also obliged to inform the public on its
operation. The Law provides for restricted access only to information classified as state, business or
official secret, as determined by law.
Access to information in specific bodies is ensured through citizens’ participation in governing boards
of public institutions, in particular when they bear broader significance for citizens, as is the case, for
instance, with the Health Insurance Fund. Pursuant to the Law on Health Insurance, the Fund’s
Members include representatives of the insurers.
With regard to the freedom of expression or more specifically the access to information, particularly
important is the existence of a law governing the access to public information. On the Session held
on 26.01.2005 the Assembly passed the first reading and approved the Proposal to adopt the Law on
Free Access to Public Information. It incorporates most of the recommendations of the Council of
Europe, the OSCE as well as of non-governmental organisations active in issues of freedom of
expression and access to information. These recommendations specify cases when exception may
be made to the principle of free access to information. This has been regulated with Article 5 of the
Draft-Law under which possessors of information may reject a request for access to information if it
relates to: 1) data which has, under the law regulating classified information, been defined as a
secret data for the purpose of protection of defence and security of the state; 2) data which has been
defined as a business secret pursuant to law; 3) personal data whose disclosure would entail breach
of protection of personal data pursuant to the law regulating protection of such data etc. The DraftText also stipulates the margin of appreciation doctrine, i.e. it stipulates that possessors of
information may not refuse to give information, unless the consequences upon the interest which is
being protected exceed the public interest for their disclosure. The text includes provisions defining
the obligations of possessors of information. According to these norms, the possessor of information
is obliged to provide information on the organisation, authorities and expenditure of operation, on the
services it renders to citizens, and on its activities, to prepare and issue bulletins and to publish its
decisions and measures by which it affects citizens’ lives and businesses in official publications and
web pages. The text also regulates the procedure for the exercise of the right to free access to
information. Establishment is also envisaged of a State Commission on protection of that right.
b)
Currently, there are 12 daily newspapers published in the Republic of Macedonia, 20 weekly
newspapers, 10 bi-weekly and 20 monthly magazines. In addition, 21 periodicals and 21 children
magazines are published. In the sphere of the daily press, worth mentioning is the 14 million EUR

333/453

investment of the German concern WAC which now owns the majority capital share in the three daily
newspapers with largest circulation - Dnevnik, Utrinski vesnik and Vest. The investment was followed
by a complete reshaping of the accounting and financial control in the three companies that used to
publish the three dailies, which are now serviced by the Media Print Macedonia. In early February
2004, the Vreme daily was started, which, in less then a year now, has become, widely read paper in
the country. One of the dailies, Večer, that existed before 1990’s and which used to have the largest
circulation at that time has now been re-started. Bearing in mind the commitment to develop a
multiethnic Macedonian society, 2 out of the 12 dailies are published in Albanian – Fakti and Koha
Ditore, as well as one weekly in Albanian - Lobi.
Considerable number of monthly magazines is issued by the non-governmental sector. Majority of
these are specialised in a particular area.
Macedonian broadcasting industry has been organised according to the European dual broadcasting
model. There is a public broadcasting service and a commercial sector. At national level, the function
of the public broadcasting service is performed by the Macedonian Radio and Television which
broadcasts three TV channels and three radio channels. At local level, there are 29 local public
broadcasting enterprises.
The total number of commercial broadcasters is 137. At national level there are eight commercial
broadcasting companies, including five TV and three radio stations (Kanal 55, Antena 5 and Radio
Ros). Until mid 2004, there had been only two private televisions. Then, by a Government Decision,
national concessions were issued to another three TV stations - Kanal 5, Telma and ALSAT. The
latter has for now been broadcasting only in the western part of Macedonia. It is a TV station
broadcasting programme in Albanian. On the local level, there are 129 electronic media - 54 TV and
75 radio stations.
Commercial broadcasters have been funded by commercials and sponsorship, whereas the public
broadcasting service collects most of its funds through the broadcasting fees, though it is also
partially funded through commercials and sponsorship. Resources collected from the broadcasting
fees paid by citizens, besides being used to fund the public broadcasting service are also used for
financing of projects of public interest.
The Broadcasting Council was set up with the 1997 Broadcasting Law as a body with supervisory
authority over the broadcasting media. The body has been organised in line with the principles
governing the broadcasting regulatory authorities; however, its capacity, under the existing law, is
incomplete. Namely, on the key issues (award and revoke of licences, allocation of funds aimed at
support of radio and TV production), the Council determines proposals, whereas the final decision is
made by the Government. The body follows the model of a collegial body composed of nine
competent persons and experts in various fields. Members to the Council are appointed by the
Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and their term of office is guaranteed, i.e. they may not be
dismissed before their term has expired.
The Council of Europe experts have been consulted on the drafting of the existing as well as on the
new Broadcasting Law. The recommendations provided by international experts have been taken
into consideration with the purpose of approximation with the European standards in this area. One
of their major remarks regarding the 1997 Law referred to the incomplete capacity of the
Broadcasting Council. This weakness of the existing Law has been fully overcome in the working
version of the draft-text of the new Broadcasting Law. Pursuant to its provisions, the Broadcasting
Council shall be given full capacity. This means that it should decide autonomously on awarding or
revoking licences. (The existing Law stipulates awarding of concessions.) As regards the
appointment of the Broadcasting Council Members, the Proposal to Adopt a new Law stipulates a
system of authorised proposers, for instance: the President of the State, the Assembly’s Committee
on Appointment, etc. Such a system shall contribute to depolitisation and democratisation of the
appointment of the Council Members. The text includes a number of other provisions in which
European standards have been almost fully applied, in particular in terms of the functions and duties

334/453

of the public broadcasting service, protection of minors, protection of media pluralism, commercials
and sponsorship, jurisdiction, etc.
Recommendations of the Council of Europe and OSCE experts have been taken into consideration
when interventions were made in the working version of the Law on Free Access to Public
Information which is a crucial law when the exercise of the freedom of expression is in question and
of the right to access to information. More specifically, on the basis of the recommendations of these
organisations and the recommendations of international non-governmental organisation Article 19, a
Draft-Law on Free Access to Public Information has been prepared. The Assembly passed the first
reading of the Law on its session held on 26.01.2005 and approved the proposal to adopt the Law on
Free Access to Public Information. Meanwhile, round table discussions have been underway,
organised by the non-governmental sector, including in particular the Transparency Macedonia. This
organisation has actively participated in the drafting of the Law, while taking into account all
recommendations of the international organisations. Domestic and foreign experts in the field have
attended the discussions, as well as public institutions representatives, the media, etc. The intention
was to raise the awareness on the substance and to point to weaknesses in order to further specify
its provisions and to ensure its full implementation after its adoption. Under the Law, the
Broadcasting Council shall be obliged to adopt a strategy on the development of the media which
entails standards aligned with the European. Not all will be able to attain such criteria and to adapt to
the new environment; thus market shall be left to those with the highest quality.
Hence, given that the remarks of the international organisations have been taken into consideration
in the working version of the new Broadcasting Law, as well as in the Draft Law on Free Access to
Public Information, which is in parliamentary procedure, one can say that all interventions in the laws
have been made in line with the recommendations of international organisations in order to
incorporate in them the European standards. As a conclusion, the existing working versions of the
draft-laws have been harmonised with the European standards.
c)
In line with the basic approach that the exercise of freedom of expression may not be at the expense
of freedoms and rights of other persons, the Criminal Code sanctions as criminal offences the
following conducts: libel, insult, disclosure of personal or family circumstances, derogation as general
criminal acts and their specified forms, i.e. the same deeds when committed through the media. The
Law Amending the Criminal Code was adopted in the beginning of 2004 (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 19/04). The purpose of the amendments was to align the domestic
legislation with the European standards.
Article 172 of the Code refers to the criminal act of libel. Paragraph 1 stipulates that a person, who
asserts an untrue fact in relation to another person which is damaging for that person’s honour or
reputation, shall be punished with a fine or with imprisonment of up to six months. If such act is
committed through the media or at a public gathering, its perpetrator shall be punished with a fine or
with imprisonment of up to one year (Article 172, paragraph 2). If the untrue fact which has been
expressed or disseminated is of such importance that it has resulted in severe consequences for the
injured party, its perpetrator shall be punished with imprisonment of three months to three years
(Article 172, paragraph 3). Pursuant to Article 172, paragraph 4, the defendant shall not be punished
if he/she proves the truth of his/her statement or if he/she proves that he/she had reasonable
grounds to believe in the truthfulness of what he/she stated. (This provision has been included in the
Criminal Code upon a recommendation of the Council of Europe and has also been acknowledged in
numerous rulings of the European Court of Human Rights). Article 173 refers to the criminal act of
insult. Pursuant to this Article, a person who shall insult another person shall be punished with a fine
or imprisonment of up to three months (Article 173, paragraph 1). If such offence has been
committed through the media or at a public gathering, its perpetrator shall be punished with a fine or
imprisonment of up to six months (Article 173, paragraph 2).
However, recognising the fact that freedom of expression is a necessary aspect of fulfilment of one’s
potential, the Criminal Code provides for exemption from incrimination of insulting statements in
scientific, literary or artistic work, in serious critique, in line of duty, journalist work, political or other

335/453

societal office, in protection of the freedom of public expression of thought or of other rights and in
protection of public or other justified interests, if it follows from the manner of expression or from
some other circumstances of the act, that it has no significance of insult or has not resulted in
considerable damage to honour and reputation of personality (Article 176, paragraph 1). Similarly,
the Criminal Code stipulates that a person found guilty of such an act shall be released from
conviction if he/she has apologised to the injured party or has revoked before the court what he/she
had stated or disseminated. Prosecution of the aforementioned criminal offences is undertaken upon
a private suit. (This provision has also been included in the Code upon a recommendation by the
Council of Europe).
A prominent feature of the amendments to the Code relating to these criminal acts is the
individualisation of the sentences. Namely, with the recent changes introduced in 2004, fines are
imposed in daily rates, the number of which may be at least 5 and at most 360. (Determination of
fines has been regulated in Article 38 of the Code). Pursuant to the Code, court shall decide on the
number of daily rates in accordance with the general rules governing the determination of sentences.
The court determines the amount of the daily rate by taking into consideration the personal and
financial circumstances of the perpetrator. In doing so, as a rule, it takes as its starting point the
average net income which the perpetrator has, or could have earned, as well as his/her family or
other obligations and his/her financial status at the time of the court decision. The law determines
that a daily rate shall be fixed at a minimum of the equivalent of one EUR in MKD and at a maximum
of the equivalent of five thousand EUR in MKD. When determining the amount of the daily rate, the
court may request notification from banks, financial or other institutions which are obliged to supply
such data.
As a conclusion, sentences of imprisonment for libel and insult are generally between 3 months to 3
years.
A sentence of imprisonment of a journalist was pronounced in 2002. Namely, a sentence of 3 months
imprisonment was pronounced to a journalist for a criminal offence libel committed against a political
representative. However, upon an appeal, the Skopje Appellate Court returned the proceedings to
the first instance court i.e. the Skopje I Basic Court. The reason for such a ruling of the Appellate
Court, as was stated in its explanation, was the fact that the first instance court, when deciding on the
verdict, failed to take into consideration the essence of the reasons for the deed.
Following are data on the number of lawsuits involving media employees: in 2001, 38 private libel
lawsuits were registered against journalists out of the total number of 63; in 2002 - 46 libel lawsuits
against journalists out of the total of 105; in 2003 - 41 private libel and insult lawsuits against
journalists out of the total of 78. These are figures from the Macedonian Judges Association,
presented at the Conference on Freedom of Expression, Libel and Insult held in late 2003 (The
Conference was organised by the Journalists Association and the Council of Europe). On the general
tendency in the country, it could be concluded that from the total number of libel and insult lawsuits,
the majority is always filed against journalists.
Data on the reported, accused and convicted perpetrators of criminal offences are prepared by the
State Statistical Office of the Republic of Macedonia in its annual statistical reviews. However, these
reviews do not contain figures on the break-down by profession or for journalists. The latest statistical
data (for 2002) was issued in 2003. According to these data, out of the total 315 persons accused for
criminal offences against reputation and honour, 114 were for libel, 199 were for insult and 2 for other
acts. Out of all, 124 were found guilty, in 137 cases the proceedings were adjourned, 37 were
acquitted and in 17 cases the charges were dropped (Figures from the Statistical Review No.
2.4.3.11/449, Reported, Accused and Convicted Perpetrators of Criminal Offences in 2002, issued in
September 2003 by the State Statistical Office.)
The 2001 Statistical data demonstrates that a total of 288 persons were accused of criminal offences
against honour and reputation, 97 of which were for libel, 188 for insult and 3 for other offences. Out
of these 288 persons, 124 were found guilty, in 117 cases the proceedings were adjourned, 37 were
acquitted and in 9 cases the charges were dropped.

336/453

It follows from these data that among persons accused of criminal offences against reputation and
honour, the number of those accused of insult is larger. Furthermore, with regard to persons who
were found not guilty, the majority pertain to those cases in which the proceedings were adjourned,
followed by those who were acquitted and finally those for whom the charges have been dropped.
The Broadcasting Law includes a number of libel-related provisions. Namely, Article 8, paragraph 1,
subparagraph 12 sets forth that one of the principles of broadcasting is the protection of privacy and
dignity of persons. Besides, Article 31, paragraph 2, subparagraph 2, which refers to the content of
broadcasting programmes, stipulates that in broadcasting programmes, respect should be ensured of
freedom and rights of persons and citizens, their dignity and reputation.
In provisions governing the right to reply and correction (Articles 62 and 63), the Law provides for the
exercise of this right by a person for whom a libel has been publicised. For a broadcasting company
which shall not publicise a reply or a correction, a fine has been prescribed in the amount of 30.000
to 100.000 MKD (Article 86, paragraph 1, subparagraphs 7 and 8), while the official in charge in the
broadcasting company shall be fined with 5.000 to 30.000 MKD. If the broadcasting organisation
refuses to broadcast a reply, the court may pronounce a security measure ban on broadcasting
activity for a period of three months to one year (Article 86, paragraph 3).
d)
The existing Telecommunications Law provides that restriction of the freedom of expression may only
be allowed in cases when messages that call for violent destruction of the constitutional order, incite
military aggression or stir national, racial or religious intolerance are transmitted (Article 9).
The new Law on Electronic Communications (currently in procedure) provides that a right to
expression through electronic communication networks may be forbidden in case there is a direct or
serious threat for the public order, health, human lives or public security.
In both cases this implies all networks and means of electronic communication in general rather than
broadcasting alone.
The freedom of reception in the Republic of Macedonia has been guaranteed and no legal
impediments exist as to procurement of receivers that operate in frequency bands allocated for public
usage, including procurement and installation of satellite antennae or receivers.
Cable operators are entitled under the existing Broadcasting Law to retransmission of foreign
programmes, upon a prior consent by the Broadcasting Council. The Council may prohibit
retransmission of specific broadcasting services in cases they call to violent destruction of the
constitutional order, incite inter-ethnic, religious or racial intolerance, contain pornographic elements
or influence adversely the development of young generations.
The new Law on Electronic Communications provides for full liberalisation of the services provided
through networks, i.e. the cable retransmission, instead by a concession (as has been stipulated by
the existing regulations), shall be allowed simply upon notification. The new Broadcasting Law
stipulates that programmes that are retransmitted through cable shall only be registered in the
Broadcasting Council.
With regard to Internet services, under the new Law on Electronic Communications, a licence will be
required that shall be issued by a new regulatory body in the area of electronic communications.
Content of these services is not subject to legal regulation, i.e. should be subject to self-regulation.

337/453

35. Is the right of ownership recognised by the Constitution? Is there any limitation for certain
categories of persons (e.g. foreigners, EU citizens) or for certain types of property (e.g.
agricultural land)? How is the right to property assured? What are the justifications permitted
for any possible restrictions placed on the exercise of this right and which body or bodies
may impose such restrictions?
Pursuant to Article 30 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic
of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 1/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), right to ownership of property and right of
inheritance are guaranteed; ownership of property creates rights and duties and should serve the wellbeing of both the individual and the community; and a person may not be deprived of his/her property or
of the rights deriving from it, except in cases concerning the public interest determined by law. This article
also determines that if property is expropriated or restricted, rightful compensation not lower than its
market value is guaranteed.
The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia also prescribes that aliens in the Republic of
Macedonia may acquire the right to ownership of property under conditions determined by law
(Article 31). This means that foreign nationals may acquire this right in accordance with a separate
law.
Some real estate may not be subject to right to ownership of property, such as amenities in common use.
Namely, pursuant to Article 56 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, all natural resources of
the Republic of Macedonia, the flora and fauna, amenities in common use, as well as the objects and
buildings of particular cultural and historical value determined by law, are amenities of common interest
for the Republic and enjoy particular protection. The Law also regulates the mode and conditions under
which specific items of general interest for the Republic can be ceded for use.
Hence, according to the Law on Property and Other Real Rights (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 18/01) objects in common use (streets, roads, bridges, squares, parks) are objects
in state ownership and may be used by all natural and legal persons (Article 16, paragraph 4).
Pursuant to Article 16, paragraph 1 of the Law on Property and Other Real Rights, all natural
resources, the flora and fauna, amenities in common use, construction land, forests and agricultural
land, pastures and waters, and amenities and objects of a particular cultural and historic importance
determined by law are amenities of common interest to the Republic.
Amenities that in accordance with the Constitution or particular laws have been declared to be
amenities of common interest to the Republic may be subject to the right to state ownership i.e.
natural and legal persons (Article 16, paragraph 2), whereas forms of ownership of construction,
agricultural and forest land, and pastures and waters are regulated by special provisions (Article 16.
paragraph 3).
Pursuant to the Law on Public Roads (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 26/96,
40/99, 96/00, 29/02 and 68/04), public roads are amenities in common use and in state ownership
(Article 2, paragraph 1 and 2)
According to Article 2 of the Law on Waters (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 04/98
and 19/00), waters, watercourses and lakes as amenities of common interest of the Republic of
Macedonia enjoy particular protection determined by this Law and are in state ownership.
Water in watercourses and lakes may be subject to concession (license) for a limited period of time to a
domestic or foreign legal and natural person and in a mode and conditions determined by law.
As regards the aforementioned real estate, foreign natural and legal persons have equal legal status
with domestic persons as both categories have been excluded from the possibility to acquire the right
to ownership.

338/453

Article 2 of the Law on Property and Other Real Rights prescribes that all domestic and foreign natural
and legal persons, including the state and local self-government units may acquire the right to ownership
of property under conditions and modes determined by this and other laws. Articles 6 and 7 of this Law
prescribe that legal protection of ownership of property is guaranteed, while the acquisition, protection
and termination of the ownership right and other real rights are determined by law.
In addition, a separate Chapter 4 of this Law titled Real Rights of Aliens regulates particular conditions
under which foreign nationals may acquire the right to ownership of property in the Republic of
Macedonia. Hence, Article 242 of this Law determines that foreign natural and legal persons may acquire
the right to ownership of movables in the same mode as domestic persons. However, with regard to
acquiring real estate, the Law determines that foreign natural and legal persons may acquire this right
through inheritance under conditions of reciprocity in the same mode as citizens of the Republic of
Macedonia, unless otherwise determined by an international treaty. Concerning the latter, a difference
has been made between natural and legal persons. Specifically, foreign natural persons may acquire the
right to real estate ownership through inheritance, whereas foreign legal persons may acquire this right
only on the basis of a will.
Article 244 stipulates that foreign natural person under conditions of reciprocity may acquire the right to
ownership of a dwelling or residential buildings in the Republic of Macedonia in the same mode as a
citizen of the Republic of Macedonia. With regard to business premises, foreign natural persons may
acquire the right to ownership of property and the right to long-term lease under conditions of reciprocity
and if not otherwise determined by law. In addition, foreign legal persons may acquire the right to
ownership of property and the right to long-term lease of dwellings and businesses in the Republic of
Macedonia under conditions of reciprocity, unless otherwise determined by law.
As far as acquiring the right to construction land ownership, this Law does not offer such possibility to
foreign natural and legal persons except the right to acquire long-term lease of construction land for the
purpose of erecting business buildings and premises, and residential buildings and dwellings on the
territory of the Republic of Macedonia, provided that the Minister of Justice gives consent following
consultations and prior opinions by the Minister of Environment and Physical Planning and the Minister of
Finance. Likewise, foreign natural and legal persons may acquire the right to long-term lease of
agricultural land in the Republic of Macedonia if the Minister of Justice gives consent following opinions
obtained from the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management and the Minister of Finance.
The right to acquisition of ownership by foreign states for their diplomatic and consular offices, as well as
by organisations and specialised agencies of the United Nations and the Council of Europe, has been
regulated by special provisions, according to which they may acquire the right to ownership of buildings
and dwellings, or to erect such buildings on construction land.
The right to ownership of construction land has been regulated by the Law on Construction Land (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 53/01 and 97/01) and Law on Privatisation and Lease of
State Owned Construction Land (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 04/05). Article 6 of
Law on Construction Land prescribes that construction land may be in ownership of the Republic of
Macedonia and domestic natural and legal persons, under conditions determined by this and other laws.
Foreign natural and legal persons may only acquire the right to concession of construction land and the
right to a long-term lease, under modes and conditions determined by this and other laws (Articles 14 and
19).
The Decree on the Mode and Procedure of Transfer, Lease and the Level of Special Costs of Procedures
for Transfer and Lease of Construction Land in Ownership of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 79/01, 103/01, 38/02, 53/01 and 95/04) regulates the mode
and procedure of transfer and lease of construction land. A separate provision of this Decree determines
that mixed companies (registered legal persons with mixed capital, both foreign and domestic) may
purchase construction land in the Republic of Macedonia by direct agreement for the purpose of
constructing administrative, business, industrial and other business facilities; public sports and
recreational facilities; residential districts; residential collective buildings and complexes and residential
individual dwellings, upon the proposal of a legal person of mixed ownership registered in the Trade

339/453

Register of the Republic of Macedonia, in accordance with an investment programme adopted by the
Minister of Transport and Communication.
With regard to agricultural land, right to ownership of property is only given to domestic natural and legal
persons. Foreign natural and legal persons may use agricultural land on the basis of concession granted
by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and pursuant to the Law on Agricultural Land (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 25/98, 18/99 and 02/04), which has been regulated in Article
16 of the Law.
Pursuant to the Law on Forests (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 47/97, 07/00 and
89/04), forests in the sense of this law are of common interest to the Republic and enjoy special
protection. Forests are in private and state ownership. State forests may not be subject to sale.
Pursuant to the Law on the Protection of Cultural Heritage (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 20/04 and 71/04), subject to ownership rights may be immovable or movable cultural
heritage and it may be in the ownership of the Republic of Macedonia, the local self-government units
and other legal and natural persons. Cultural heritage in state ownership of particular importance may not
be transferred. With certain exceptions stipulated in the Law, cultural heritage in state ownership of
particular importance may be subject to concession.
In addition, the Law on Protection of Nature (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
67/04) prescribes that only domestic legal and natural persons may acquire ownership of real estate
in protected areas of nature. Furthermore, the Law stipulates that categories of protected areas in the
sense of the Law are: strictly protected natural reserve, national park, monument of nature, natural
park, protected areas and multipurpose areas.
Pursuant to the Law on Mineral Raw Materials (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
18/99 and 29/02), concession for detailed geological researches and for exploitation of minerals may
be granted to domestic and foreign legal and natural person registered for performing such activities
and in compliance with stipulations prescribed by this and other laws.
In accordance with Article 13 of the Law on Denationalisation (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 20/98, 31/00, 43/00-consolidated text and 42/03), a right to file a denationalisation
request has a citizen of the Republic of Macedonia on the day of this law’s entry into force. Hence,
persons who, upon the entry into force of the Law on Denationalisation (07.05.1998) were foreign
citizens (natural persons) are not entitled to file a denationalisation request or to a return of
nationalised property.
Pursuant to Article 10 of the Broadcasting Law (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
20/97 and 70/03), a foreign natural and legal person may be co-founder of a commercial
broadcasting company with maximum of 25% share in its total capital. In addition, the share owned
by more foreign natural and legal persons, as co-founders in a single commercial broadcasting
company may constitute a maximum of 49% in its overall capital.
As part of the envisaged changes to the Draft-Broadcasting Law, levelling is envisaged of the
conditions under which foreign natural and legal persons may establish or participate in the
ownership of broadcasters in the Republic of Macedonia. For changes in the ownership structure, if
the participation exceeds the threshold of 10%, the broadcasting organisation is obliged to request
approval from the Broadcasting Council. Thresholds have also been determined on the basis of
which the Broadcasting Council shall decide in procedure for approval of ownership structure
changes. The text of the new Broadcasting Law also includes provisions on transparency of the
ownership structure. Broadcasters shall be obliged to submit to the Broadcasting Council, on an
annual basis, the information on their operation in the previous year, and which refer to the changes
in the ownership structure, company’s status changes, changes in the managing bodies and sources
of funding.

As regards the restriction of acquired right to ownership of property in the Republic of Macedonia,
pursuant to the Constitution ownership may be expropriated or restricted only in cases concerning
public interest determined by law.
Restriction to acquiring right to ownership by way of expropriation; restriction to construction rights
deriving from ownership rights; as well determining public interest, have all been determined by the
Law on Expropriation (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 33/95, 20/98, 40/99 and
31/03) and by other laws.
The Procedure for expropriation of property has been regulated by the Law on Expropriation.
Expropriation procedures are also stipulated in other laws.
Article 2 of the Law on Expropriation lists facilities of public interest that may be subject to restriction
of ownership or expropriation.
The expropriation procedure is strictly formal, two-sided and contradictory and may only be initiated
under conditions determined by law, i.e. upon the proposal of authorised person and user of the
expropriation with the involvement of two parties that have conflicting interests – the authorised
person (user of expropriation) and the owner of the real estate subject to expropriation.
This procedure performed out by an expropriation body (the state administrative body competent for
property issues) within the Ministry of Finance and is finalised by an act on adoption or rejection of
the expropriation proposal, unless the expropriation user and the real estate owner agree on the
compensation beforehand. This means they are given a chance to reach an agreement on the
expropriation and compensation before the property is confiscated.
Apart from the administrative procedure, court protection has been provided for the process of
expropriation and restriction of ownership, i.e. for the determination of equitable market-value
compensation for the real estate subject to expropriation.
Pursuant to Article 50 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia every citizen may invoke the
protection of freedoms and rights determined by the Constitution before the regular courts and before
the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia. This right also pertains to the right to
ownership of property.
36. What are the administrative procedures which are necessary for the transfer of property?
How long does it take to complete the procedure for a transfer of property? Which body is
responsible for maintaining an urban and land cadastre and property register? Please provide
information on the existing cadastre and land registry, and your plans for its modernisation.
The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
52/91, 1/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) guarantees the right to property and the right to inheritance. No
person may be deprived or restricted of property and the rights deriving therein, except in cases of
public interest determined by law.
In case of expropriation or in case of restriction to property, rightful compensation not lower than its
market value is guaranteed.
A foreign person in the Republic of Macedonia may acquire the right to property under conditions
determined by law.
Pursuant to provisions in Article 148 of the Law on Property and Other Real Rights (“Official Gazette
of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 18/2001), the right to property of a real estate on the basis of a
legal act is acquired by registering in the Real Estate Cadastre or in another adequate way
determined by law.

341/453

The establishment, registration and maintenance of the Real Estate Cadastre are regulated in a
mode and procedure determined by law.
The legal effect of the registration occurs following the receipt of the request or the document by the
body keeping the public book.
Pursuant to provisions in Article 1 of the Law on Land Surveying, Cadastre and Real Estate Rights
Registration (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 27/86 and 17/91), the surveying,
cadastre and the real estate rights registration are carried out in modes prescribed by this Law, and
pursuant to provisions in Article 8, paragraph 1 of the same Law, the Real Estate Cadastre is a public
book in which the registration of data is carried out ex officio or upon the parties’ request.
In accordance with Article 57 of the same Law, the registration into the Real Estate Cadastre is
carried out by entry and note.
The registration into the Real Estate Cadastre is performed on the basis of:
− Documents compiled in legally prescribed form;
− Final court decisions; and
− A law or decision of a state body.
The administrative procedures in the course of the procedure on acquiring the right to property (and
other real rights), are generally regulated in the Law on General Administrative Procedure, Article 1 in
line with Article 2 and 3 (“Official Gazette of SFRY”, Nos. 47/86 - consolidated text and “Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 44/02), which has been taken over from the former
Yugoslav law after Macedonia’s independence, on the basis of the Constitutional Law on
Implementation of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91 and 4/92).
The transfer of the right to property (and other real rights) into the Real Estate Cadastre as a public
book has been conditioned by a prior implementation of the following administrative procedures:
1. Establishment of a public book - Real Estate Cadastre for the area covering the application for
the transfer of the right. The establishment is carried out by implementing a procedure of first
entry of real estate rights for the area of the cadastre unit that covers the application. This
procedure is conveyed in a systematised way and in procedures determined by the Rulebook
on the Modes and Procedure of Exposing Data on Real Estate and Modes of Real Estate
Rights Registration (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 05/88 and 42/95)
and is finalised by the announcement of a decision on establishing a Real Estate Cadastre as
a public book for a respective cadastre municipality in the Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia.
2. Establishing documents for transfer of property rights in a form and content prescribed by law
(containing data’s of the public book for the registration of real estate rights, i.e. from the
Property List as property evidence), or existence of a private document whose form and
content has been confirmed (solemnised) by a publicly authorised person - a notary, pursuant
to the Law on Notaries (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/96, 25/98
and 06/02).
3. Evidence for paid tax in the sense of Article 37 of the Law on Property Tax (“Official Gazette
of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 61/04).
4. Paid administrative fees pursuant to the Law on Administrative Fees (Chapter 5, Tariff No. 56)
– (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 17/93, 20/96, 07/98, 13/01, 24/03,
19/04 and 61/04).
The administrative procedures for the transfer of property rights are implemented in Accordance with
the Rulebook on Maintenance of Land Surveying and Real Estate Cadastre (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 62/95) and the Rulebook on the Maintenance and Surveying of the

342/453

Land Registry (“Official Gazette of the SRM”, Nos. 06/75 and 09/75) depending on whether the area
to which the application refers has been encompassed by a Real Estate Cadastre (public book) or by
records on the land, i.e. a Land Registry.
The time-frame for the administrative procedure after the receipt of the application for the transfer of
the property right into the Real Estate Cadastre, or the application for the transfer of the land user
into the land registry, has been regulated by the provision in Article 218, paragraph 1 of the Law on
General Administrative Procedure and is one month if all applications have been properly completed
and submitted. In other cases, the competent body that performs the procedure is obliged to adopt a
decision and submit it to the requesting party not later than two months.
The realistic time-frame for a completion of the administrative procedure in the course of the property
rights transfer is not longer than 7-15 days in most local offices, while on the area of the City of
Skopje it is longer than two months.
The State Geodetic Institute with its 30 centralised local offices including the Skopje City Office is
competent for the keeping of the so-called City Cadastre (referring to the area of any city, including
the City of Skopje) as well as for the Land Registry and the Real Estate Cadastre. This issue has
also been regulated by the provisions in Article 35 of the Law on Organisation and Operation of the
State Administrative Bodies (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 58/00 and 44/02),
and by the Rulebook on Internal Organisation and Operation of the State Geodetic Institute No. 013483/5 from 05.07.2004, as an internal act adopted by the official person administering the body
pursuant to his/her authorities, as determined in Article 5, paragraph 2 of the Law, following the
consent obtained from the Civil Servants Agency pursuant to its authorities determined by this Law.
The Real Estate Cadastre is a public book. It is a fundamental and legally regulated system of
registering the total factual, spatial, economic, and property and legal components of the real estate
status (land, buildings and special parts of buildings). As such it is a basis for the creation of the
spatial information system.
The Cadastre is based upon principles of legality, constitutionality and publicity and, as such, it is
vital for the provision of legal security in the real estate trade.
Basis for its creation and establishment is a prior cadastre survey of the spatial and actual status of
the real estate and other collected data on the real estate (surface, modes of land use and its
economic power), while as regards buildings and parts of buildings, basis are data for their size
(number of stories, surface), construction material and other data as well as data on potential
owners. The collecting and editing of data is carried out by plans, according to administrative areas
and cadastre municipalities and is implemented according to methodologies and procedures
determined by legal and technical standards. The collected and edited data on real estate are
presented before citizens and other legal persons in a public procedure which also determines the
facts on real estate rights. Following the completion of the procedure is the registration (first entry) of
real estate rights. Data determined in the course of the procedure are recorded on magnetic tapes for
further use. The procedure ends with a decision on establishment of a Real Estate Cadastre-Public
Book, published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia. The decision specifies a term
when the basic public book for the concrete cadastre territorial unit shall be opened for use. The
property list is the final product of this procedure. The List is evidence for further transactions in the
real estate.
The procedure lasts from several months to a few years (two or three), depending on the size of the
area.
The Real Estate Cadastre comprises: cadastral plans (maps); cadastral operate; and the collection of
documents.
Cadastral maps are created in an analogue (graphical) form, and since 1997 they have been also
produced in digital form. The analogue plans (maps) are transformed into digital.

343/453

By 2010 it is expected that all cadastre plans will be in a digital database and available in electronic
form.
The cadastral Operate is a systematised attributed database on real estate, memorised on magnet
tapes in e-form with an automatic on-line search engine. For the time being, they are only available
for use of the local cadastral offices. The central memory base unit in the State Geodetic Institute is
available on-line only to the Central Registry.
The transfer of the changes in public books from local offices to the central memory unit into the
central device of the State Geodetic Institute is carried out once a week by a back-up technology.
The project “e-cadastre” which is in its initial phase envisions the establishment of Internet/Intranet
accession to the database by the end of 2010.
The collection of documents is a collection of legal documents containing originals or verified copies
of documents that determine a certain real estate right. The documents are in paper form. According
to the development project, the transfer of data into a digital form shall be available to users by the
end of 2010.
The Real Estate Cadastre as a public book of real estate covers around 45% of the state’s territory.
As of October 2003 a new Project on Cadastre and Registration of Real Estate is being prepared
under the leadership of the World Bank. The Project shall provide:
−

37. Denationalisation: What is the percentage of properties returned to persons dispossessed
by the Communist regime? (Please provide precise statistics of nationalised property:
houses, agricultural land, forests, etc., total claims received by the authorities, claims
processed and completed, claims accepted and rejected, indication of competent authorities
in this process, etc.) When is the denationalisation process estimated to be completed by the
Government?
The denationalisation process has been regulated by the Law on Denationalisation (“Official Gazette
of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 20/98, 31/00, 43/00-consolidated text and 42/03). On the basis
of Article 70 of the Law Amending the Law on Denationalisation (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 31/00), the Legislative Committee of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, in
May 2000, established the consolidated text of the Law on Denationalisation (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 43/00-consolidated text).
The Law determines the conditions and procedure for restitution of property and the type, conditions
and procedure for awarding compensation for property confiscated on behalf of the state since 2
August 1944 (denationalisation).
Pursuant to the Law on Denationalisation, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia adopted a
Decree on the Implementation of the Denationalisation Procedure and a Decree on the Manner and
Procedure of Establishing the Value of Property Subject to Denationalisation (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 43/00).
The practical application of the Law on Denationalisation started in September 2000. According to
the records of the authorised committees, since then and until September 2004, a total of 19.185
denationalisation claims were received.
So far, the competent denationalisation committees passed 8.066 rulings (42%). This number
includes 5.041 rulings (62,5%) endorsing the claims; 903 rulings (11%) partially endorsing the claims;
1.916 rulings (24%) rejecting the claims; and 206 claims (2,5%) for which the procedure has been
suspended.
Final are 5.141 rulings (63,7%).
Out of the total number of rulings endorsing or partially endorsing the claims, property was restored
by 2.714 rulings (45,65%), of an area and category as follows:
− Housing premises – 36.163 m2;
− Business premises – 120.421 m2;
− Agricultural land – 596.555.646 m2;
− Building land – 1.066.149 m2; and
− Forest land – 17.247.796 m2.
The total number of rulings endorsing or partially endorsing the claims also includes 3.230 rulings
(54,35%) by which compensation was determined in the form of bonds, for property that cannot be
restituted.
Three series of bonds have been issued thus far for the final rulings upon claims lodged by 31
December 2003. The total value of the issued bonds is 89.100.000 EUR.
The registration of bonds on behalf of the claimants within the body competent for their registering
and servicing (Central Securities Depositary) is done, ex officio, by the competent denationalisation
committees.
Pursuant to the Law, the Minister of Finance decides upon denationalisation claims. For that
purpose, he/she may establish one or more committees (denationalisation bodies). In that sense, 13
first-instance denationalisation committees have been established in regions and areas.

345/453

Parties in the denationalisation procedure are the claimants (former owners of the confiscated
property or their heirs) and the Public Attorney’s Office of the Republic of Macedonia, as a
representative of the state interests.
Against a first-instance ruling, a dissatisfied party is entitled to file a complaint before the secondinstance body (Committee within the Government of the Republic of Macedonia deciding in second
instance in administrative denationalisation matters).
Against a second-instance ruling, a dissatisfied party is entitled to initiate an administrative dispute
before the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia.
Subject of enforcement is a final ruling for denationalisation.
Pursuant to the Law on Denationalisation, denationalisation claims in administrative procedure may
be filed not later than 07.05.2005. After the expiry of the deadline, an appeal for compensation in
litigation procedure may be filed before a competent court; restitution of property may be requested
only if no legal or factual obstacles exist.
Pursuant to the Law on Denationalisation, the deadline for filing denationalisation claims is not
preclusive, i.e. no prescription arises after the deadline. Therefore, it is impossible to accurately
anticipate the time period within which all procedures (administrative and court) will be completed i.e.
when the denationalisation process is over.
However, by taking into account the current dynamics of the process, it may be assessed that the
majority of cases (around 90%) in administrative procedure would be resolved by the end of 2008.
38. Respect of privacy: is privacy safeguarded by law? Is any case of telephone tapping or
house search allowed without a judge's warrant?
In 1997, the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia ratified the Convention for the Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
11/97), whereby the regulations of the above Convention have become part of the internal legal
order.
In accordance with Article 8 of the abovementioned Convention, every person has the right to respect
for his/her private and family life, home and correspondence. The public authorities shall not interfere
with the exercise of this right, except such as in accordance with the law and is necessary in a
democratic society in the interests of state security, public safety or the economic well-being of the
country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the
protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
Article 25 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) provides explicit guarantee on the respect and
protection of the privacy or personal and family life and of dignity and reputation.
The essence of the right of privacy is a generic term that contains several rights and consists of the
freedom of each individual to decide independently on all issues within the domain of his/her private
and family life without any interference by other persons or by the authorities. In addition to this, the
right of privacy is exercised and realised by guaranteeing the security and confidentiality of personal
data, the inviolability of the home, freedom and privacy of correspondence and all other forms of
communication. (for more details see I_H_16).
Consequently, the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia in Article 18, guarantees the security
and privacy of personal information.

346/453

Citizens are guaranteed protection from any violation of their personal integrity deriving from the
registration of personal information through data processing.
The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, in Article 26, guarantees the inviolability of the
dwellings, establishing that this right may be restricted only on the basis of a court decision in cases
of detection or prevention of criminal offences or the protection of people’s health.
Article 17 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia guarantees the freedom and privacy of
correspondence and all other forms of communication. At the same time, there can only be an
exception to the principle of inviolability of the privacy of correspondence with a court decision, where
necessary for the course of a criminal proceeding or if it is required in the interests of the defence of
the country.
The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia provides guarantees for the exercise of the
fundamental rights and freedoms by stating that each citizen can call upon protection of his/her rights
and freedoms established by the Constitution, before courts and before the Constitutional Court of
the Republic of Macedonia in a procedure based on the principles of priority and urgency. At the
same time, the citizen has the right to be informed about the human rights and fundamental freedoms
and to actively contribute, individually or together with other citizens, to their promotion and
protection.
The right to privacy is not an absolute right and exceptions to this right may be made in cases
determined by law. By establishing precisely the conditions under which the principle of privacy may
be violated, as well as by prescribing the procedure for implementing such an exception, the
guarantee that the right to privacy is being observed and exercised is provided.
The exception to the principle of security and privacy of personal information is stipulated in the
newest Law on Personal Data Protection (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.07/05).
On the legal solutions in the new Law on Personal Data Protection, for more details see I_H_39.
The exceptions to the principle of inviolability of the home, i.e. establishing when a house search is
allowed is regulated by the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02 and 74/04).
The Law on Criminal Procedure stipulates that a search of the home or other facilities of the accused
or of other person may be conducted if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the search will
result in apprehension of the accused or that traces of the criminal offence shall be found or objects
of importance for the criminal proceedings (Article 198).
According to the provisions of the Law on Criminal Procedure, the search is ordered by the court in a
written, elaborated order, which explicitly designates the place and the person to be searched, as
well as the objects, which are searched for or confiscated from the person (Article 199, paragraph 1).
The search warrant is shown before the search to the person who personally or whose home will be
searched. Before the search, the person to whom the search warrant refers will be asked voluntarily
to turn in the person or give away objects which are searched for. (Article 199, paragraph 2)
However, the search may be conducted without prior presentation of a search warrant and without
previous request for turning over the person or objects if an armed resistance is presumed or when
suspecting that a severe crime is conducted by a group or organisation it is considered necessary to
conduct the search suddenly or if the search is to be performed in public premises. (Article 199,
paragraph 3)
In accordance with the Law on Criminal Procedure, the householder or the holder of other premises
will be summoned to be present at the search, and if he/she is absent his/her authorised
representative will be summoned or some of his/her adult members of the family or neighbours
(Article 200, paragraph 3).

347/453

During the search of premises or persons, two adult citizens will be present as witnesses. The search
of a female is performed only by a female officer, and the witnesses are also female. Before the start
of the search, the witnesses will be warned to pay attention to the performance of the search and
they will be reminded of their right, before signing the minutes for the search to write in their
objections if they consider that the contents of the minutes are incorrect (Article 200, paragraph 3).
The Law on Criminal Procedure sets forth the possibility that the search is conducted without the
presence of witnesses if their presence is not possible immediately to be provided and there is a
danger of delay. The reasons for a search without the presence of witnesses must be written in the
minutes (Article 200, paragraph 4).
The search of premises and persons is to be performed carefully without disturbing the order of the
residence (Article 200, paragraph 7). During the performance of the search, only those objects and
identity cards i.e. documents will be temporarily confiscated which are in connection with the aim of
the search in that particular case (Article 200, paragraph 8).
If during the search of premises and persons, objects are found which have no connection with the
crime for which the search is intended, but which point to another crime to be prosecuted ex officio,
the objects will be confiscated and a receipt for the confiscation will be immediately issued. The
public prosecutor will be immediately informed in order a criminal procedure be initiated. These
objects will be immediately returned if the public prosecutor finds that there are no grounds for
institution of a criminal procedure and there is no other lawful ground according to which those
objects should be confiscated (Article 200, paragraph 9).
The Law on Criminal Procedure prescribes the obligation that for each search of residences or
persons minutes be made. The minutes are signed by the official conducting the search, the person
at whose home or on whom the search is conducted and the persons whose presence is compulsory
(Article 201, paragraph 1). The objects and documents, which have been confiscated will be included
and notified correctly in the minutes (Article 201, paragraph 2).
Authorised officials of the police may, without a search warrant, and without the presence of
witnesses, perform a search of a person while enforcing a court order for apprehension or while
depriving a person from freedom if it is suspected that the person possesses arms or tools for attack
or if it is suspected that he/she will throw away, hide or destroy the objects which are to be
confiscated from him/her as evidence in the criminal procedure (Article 202, paragraph 2).
The Draft Law on Communication Interception is in parliamentary procedure for the purpose of
precisely regulating the conditions and the procedure for deviation from the constitutionally
guaranteed right of inviolability of correspondence and all other forms of communication.
The mentioned Law will regulate the conditions and the procedure for communication interception,
the working methods, the storage and use of obtained information and data, as well as the control of
the legality of communication interception.
The Draft contains five separate chapters: general provisions; the conditions and the procedure for
communication interception for the purpose of detecting and prosecuting the criminal offenders; the
conditions and the procedure for communication interception for the protection of the interests of
state security and defence; supervision and control; transitional and final provisions.
Expressing the democratic development of the state, the Draft Law subscribes to the principle that no
one may intercept communication without an order of a competent court, unless they are intended for
or there is agreement by the person or persons involved in the communication.
In accordance with the proposed legal provisions, the interception of communications of a given
person may be ordered by the court when there are grounds for suspicion that this person has
committed a criminal offence for which imprisonment of at least four years is prescribed, or a criminal

348/453

offence for which imprisonment of up to five years is prescribed, and for which there are grounds to
believe that it is conducted or has been conducted by an organised group, gang or other criminal
association, in order to provide data and evidence necessary for successfully carrying out a criminal
procedure which cannot be provided in any other way.
The only relevant institution for submitting a request for communication interception, in accordance to
the proposed provisions, is the public prosecutor, who submits the request on their own initiative or,
upon the proposal of an authorised person, by the Minister of the Interior. The admissibility of the
request is decided on by the investigative judge with an order within 24 hours from the time when the
request was submitted.
At the same time, the law guarantees the right to appeal to the competent public prosecutor if the
investigative judge does not agree with the request for issuing a court order. The appeal is to be
submitted to the criminal Chamber of the competent court within 24 hours from the notification of the
disagreement.
The investigative judge will reject the request for communication interception if it relates to the
communication of a lawyer appointed to defend a person whose communication is the subject of
interception; to communication that is carried out in the offices of the President of the Parliament of
the Republic of Macedonia, the President of the Republic of Macedonia, the Prime Minister of the
Republic of Macedonia; and to communication that is carried out in the offices of members of
Parliament in the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia.
The duration of communication interception according to the proposed provisions is established as
not longer than 30 days from the day of issuing the order for communication interception. However, a
possibility is provided for an extension of up to 90 days more on the basis of submitting an additional
proposal with a separate explanation of the reasons for which the extension is required.
The law also regulates the procedure for serving the order and its implementation, as well as the
storage, delivery and the use of the collected data.
At the same time, it provides for time limits and the way of protecting and destroying the collected
data, as well as for the way and the conditions for notifying the accused and acquainting them with
the collected data from the interception of their communication.
The proposed provisions foresee an obligation of the investigative judge to deliver all the data
gathered on the basis of the issued order to the competent public prosecutor who is to estimate if
there are legal grounds for submitting a request for initiating an investigation.
If the public prosecutor does not submit a request for initiating an investigation within 30 days from
delivering the data collected with the interception of communication, the law stipulates an obligation
of the court to pass a decision for their destruction. The court may also adopt a decision for the
destruction of the collected data in cases when it estimates that the collected data bear no
importance for the procedure, however, by previously obtaining an opinion of the competent public
prosecutor.
The basic intention that the data and the information obtained with communication interception are to
be used in the interest of and for the objectives of the criminal procedure is also exercised by
stipulating a legal provision that the court decides on the admissibility of the data obtained by the
communication interception in a criminal procedure, against which the concerned parties have the
right to appeal to the criminal Chamber of the competent court within 24 hours from serving the
decision.
Upon finality of the decision in the criminal procedure conducted against a person whose
communication has been monitored, the court adopts a special decision to destroy the evidence
within 15 days. The destruction of the data is performed by a commission, comprising a judge, a
public prosecutor and a person authorised by the Minister of the Interior.

349/453

The law provides the right to compensation for damages to the person whose communication has
been intercepted contrary to the provisions of this law, which is decided on by the court that has
issued an order for communication interception, in a fast-track procedure that may not last more than
3 months. The damaged party that is not content with the court decision has the right to appeal to a
higher court within 8 days from the day of reception.
The right to compensation for damages is also provided for a citizen who has suffered damages
because the data collected from interception of his/her communication have been published before
issuing the court’s decision for admitting the mentioned data to be used as evidence in a criminal
procedure, or if destroyed data have been published.
In accordance with the provisions of the Draft Law on Communication Interception, the court may
order interception of the communication of a person suspected of preparing to commit a criminal
offence against the State, against the armed forces or against humanity and international law.
Except in abovementioned cases, the court may order interception of communication in the event of
preparing, encouraging, organising, or participating in an armed attack against the Republic of
Macedonia, or in the cases when a person is disabling the security system, unless there is no other
way to obtain data for such an activity in order to prevent the crime, the armed assault, or the
damage to the security system of the country.
In the mentioned cases, the competent bodies for submitting a request for communication
interception of a person are the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Defence.
The Draft Law stipulates the Supreme Court as responsible for approving the request for
communication interception and provides a possibility for submitting an appeal to the Supreme Court
on the part of the applicant if the judge does not agree upon the submitted request, decided upon by
a council of three Supreme Court judges. A member of the council may not be the judge that decided
upon the request for issuing an order for communication interception, thus fully implementing the
principle of judiciary control and protection.
With the order for communication interception the judge of the Supreme Court will allow
communication interception for the necessary time, but not longer than three months. After expiration
of this period, on the basis of an additionally explained proposal, the judge may order the
communication interception to be extended for a period of up to one year, including the time
designated with the first order.
In accordance with the principle of protection of privacy, the personal data collected with
communication interception are kept in special conditions at the Ministry of the Interior, i.e. at the
Ministry of Defence, for up to one year after the expiry of the time determined with the court order,
after which all the data and the materials related to the execution of the court order are destroyed
under the supervision of the judge who has issued the court order, minutes whereof are taken in
which only the number of the court decision is recorded.
The Law on Communication Interception also regulates the supervision of the enforcement of the
measures by the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, envisaging that the Assembly of
the Republic of Macedonia establish for that purpose a Commission consisting of five members.
The Commission submits an annual report to the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia on the
undertaken control of the legality of the implementation of the measures by the Ministry of the Interior
and the Ministry of Defence within two months after the end of the current year.
With the entry into force of the Law on amending the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of
the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 74/04) the right to privacy may also be limited under the conditions
and in the way determined with this Law by applying special investigative measures.

350/453

According to the regulations of the Law on Criminal Procedure, an order by the investigative judge,
i.e. an order by the public prosecutor may authorise undertaking the following special investigative
measures:
− Communication interception and entry in the home and other premises or transportation
vehicles for creating conditions for communication interception, under the conditions and
according to the procedure established by law,
− Inspection and search of the computer system, seizing a computer system or parts thereof or
the base for storing computer data,
− Secret surveillance, monitoring and audiovisual recording of persons and objects by technical
means,
− Simulated purchase of objects, as well as simulated bribing and simulated acceptance of
bribe,
− Controlled delivery and transport of persons and goods,
− Using undercover agents for monitoring and collecting information or data,
− Opening a simulated bank account, where proceeds of crime can be deposited, and
− Registration of fictitious legal persons or using existing legal persons for data collection.
The application of the special investigative measures is foreseen only for providing data and
evidence necessary for successfully conducting the criminal procedure that cannot be collected
trough other methods or whose collection would involve substantial difficulty, for criminal offences for
which imprisonment of at least four years is prescribed, for criminal offences for which imprisonment
of up to five years is prescribed and for which there are grounds to believe that has been committed
by an organised group, a gang or another criminal association.
In the event when there is no knowledge of the identity of the perpetrator of the crime, special
investigative measures may be ordered concerning the subject of the criminal offence.
In cases determined by law, in the preliminary investigative procedure, special investigative
measures are determined by an order of the public prosecutor or the investigative judge, and in the
course of the investigation, only by an order by an investigative judge.
In the preliminary investigative procedure, particular investigative measures are determined by an
order written and argued by the investigative judge, on the basis of a proposal written and argued by
the public prosecutor. At this stage of the criminal procedure, the investigative judge decides with a
written order on the application of all special investigative measures, except for the special
investigative measure: communication interception and entry in a home and other premises or
transportation vehicles for creating conditions for communication interception. If there is
disagreement between the public prosecutor and the investigative judge as regards the application of
the special investigative measures, the Chamber of the basic court, consisting of three judges, shall
decide.
In the preliminary investigation procedure, when there is no knowledge of the identity of the
perpetrator of the criminal offence, special investigative measures may be authorised with a written
and argued order by the public prosecutor, and on the basis of a written and argued proposal by the
Ministry of the Interior also. The public prosecutor in the above case may decide, with a written order,
to apply special investigative measures, except for applying the special investigative measures:
communication interception and entry in a home and other premises or transportation vehicles for
creating conditions for communication interception, and inspection and search in computer systems,
seizing computer systems or parts thereof, or the base for storing computer data.
The order for the application of special investigative measures is enforced by the Ministry of the
Interior, the Customs Administration of the Republic of Macedonia and the Financial Police.
The order contains data about the individual against whom investigative measures are applied when
the perpetrator is known, the grounds of suspicion for the committed crime, the facts wherefrom the

351/453

application of special investigative measures emerges, as well as the manner, extent and duration of
such measures.
The implementation of special investigative measures, except for the enforcement of the special
investigative measure: communication interception and entry in a home and other premises or entry
in transportation vehicles for creating conditions for communication interception, may last up to four
months. However, upon a proposal of the public prosecutor, when the order is issued by the
investigative judge, i.e. upon a proposal of the Ministry of the Interior, when the order is issued by the
public prosecutor, the duration of the special investigative measures may be extended for at least
three months for justifiable reasons.
If the special investigative measures are undertaken without an order of the investigative judge, i.e.
without an order of the public prosecutor or are undertaken contrary to the regulations of the Law on
Criminal Procedure, the evidence gathered through the use of such measures may not be used in the
criminal procedure.
Nevertheless, the data, reports, documents and objects collected with the use of special investigative
measures under the conditions and in the manner prescribed with the regulations of the Law on
Criminal Procedure may be used as evidence in the criminal procedure.
39. Data protection: Provide information on any legislation or other rules governing this area,
and the adherence of such rules to relevant international conventions. What is done in order
to ensure efficient protection of data? Does any independent data protection supervisory
authority exist? (Please note that these questions have also been raised under the specific
point on data protection under Chapter 24.)
The right to privacy regarding the processing of personal data, as one of the fundamental freedoms
and rights of the individuals and the citizens in the Republic of Macedonia is regulated in the Article
18 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01, 84/03), which guarantees security and privacy of
personal data and protection from possible violation of the personal integrity of the citizens deriving
from registration of personal information through data processing. In the legislation of the Republic
of Macedonia, the constitutional guarantee of security and privacy of the personal data until recently
was governed by the Law on Personal Data Protection(“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 12/94 and 4/02).
The new Law on Personal Data Protectionwas adopted on 25.01.2005 (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 07/05). This law is compatible and aligned with the standards and the
criteria foreseen by the European Parliament and the European Council Directive on the Protection
of Individuals with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the Free Movement of such
Data 95/46/ЕС of 1995 and the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to
Automatic Processing of Personal Data No. 108 of the Council of Europe of 28.01.1981 ratified by
the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 07/05).
The substance of the Law on Personal Data Protection(“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 07/05) is divided into 11 separate chapters.
Chapter 1 - General Provisions, defines the subject and the aim of the law, which is focused on
protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of the citizens, with a special emphasis on protection
of rights to privacy regarding personal data processing. In drafting the provisions systematised
within this chapter, the Constitutional guarantee of security and privacy of personal data and
protection from violation of the personal integrity of the citizens (Article 18) was taken into
consideration.
The legal definitions strictly follow the terminology used in the Directive 95/46/ЕС.

352/453

Consistently incorporating the contents from Article 3 from the Directive 95/46/ЕС, the Law explicitly
identifies the exceptions from its application, focused on processing of personal data performed by
natural persons purely for personal or household activities, processing of personal data in criminal
procedure, as well as protection of the interests of security and defence of the Republic of
Macedonia (Article 4).
Chapter 2 of the Law on Personal Data Protection- Processing of Personal Data, specifies the
conditions which the personal data should meet. When defining the aforementioned provision, the
starting point was the content of the Article 6 from the Directive 95/46/ЕС, where the principles
concerning the quality of personal data are established. Hence, the personal data shall be
processed fairly and lawfully, in conformity with the Law. This data shall be collected for specified,
explicit and legitimate purposes and shall be processed in a manner according to these purposes;
they shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in respect to the purposes they are collected or
processed for. The data shall be accurate, complete and updated as needed. Inaccurate or
incomplete data, having in mind the aims for which they were collected or processed, will be erased
or rectified. The personal data shall be kept in a form that enables identification of the subject of
personal data for not longer than it is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the data were
collected or for which they are further processed. The Data Controllers are responsible to comply
with the abovementioned principles concerning the quality of personal data.
The Law establishes the principles of making data processing legitimate. Previously given consent
of the subject for processing of personal data is established as a mandatory and necessary
prerequisite for processing of personal data.
Exceptions from the aforementioned rule are also specified. Namely, it is established that personal
data can also be processed without the consent of the subject if it is necessary for performance of a
contract where the subject of personal data is a contracting party, or upon a request of the subject
of personal data, prior to entering into a contract; for compliance with a legal obligation of the Data
Controller; for protection of the vital interests of the subject of personal data; for performance of
activities of public interest or of official authority vested in the Data Controller or a third party to
whom the data were disclosed.
The chapter 3 - Processing of special categories of personal data, implements the relevant
provisions contained in the Directive 95/46/ЕС. The Law prohibits processing of special categories
of personal data. This prohibition shall not apply: if the subject of personal data gives consent to
processing of these data; for enforcement of specific rights and obligations of the Data Controller in
the area of Labour Law, to a degree and with adequate safeguards established by laws in this area;
for protection of the vital interests of the subject of personal data or of a third person, if that person
is physically or legally incapable of giving his/her consent; if the processing is performed with
appropriate guarantees by foundations, associations or any other non-profit institutions with a
political, religious, trade-union or other purpose, under condition that the data processing is related
solely to their members and that these data are not disclosed to a third party without the consent of
the subject of personal data; if the processing relates to data which are manifestly made public by
the data subject; when it is necessary to establish, exercise and defend the rights of the subject in a
procedure before competent bodies; if the processing of the data is for purposes of medical
prevention, diagnosis, provision of care or treatment or management of a healthcare organisation
and if the processing of those data is performed by a health professional subject who is under oath
of professional secrecy; and when for reasons of public interest there is a need to perform an
important activity established by law, or the processing is done on the basis of a decision by the
Directorate for Personal Data Protection.
The Law stipulates that processing must be specially designated and protected, while transfer
through a telecommunications network may be carried out if the data are specially protected with
encryption methods to render them unreadable during transmission.
This chapter also determines the conditions under which the personal identification number may be
processed.

353/453

Chapter 4, Rights of the Data subject, is central in the draft law.
This chapter makes a distinction between the information presented to the subject of personal data
in cases of collection of data from the data subject and information presented to the subject of
personal data where the data have not been obtained from the data subject.
The rights of the data subject have been arranged by subject matter, as follows: the right to
examine the data collection; the right to submit a request to rectify, erase or block the processing of
personal data, if the data are incomplete, inaccurate or out of date, or if their processing is not in
conformity with the provisions of this law and the right to request that their personal data are not
used for advertising purposes.
The Law on Personal Data Protection explicitly provides that the scope of the rights and obligations
of the subject of personal data established by provisions of this Law can be restricted in a way and
under conditions established by law, to an extent necessary to fulfil aims due to which this
restriction is introduced and if it is needed: for protection of the national security and defence; for
prevention; investigation, detection or prosecution of perpetrators of criminal offences; because of
breaches of the ethics for regulated professions; for protection of important economic and financial
interests of the state and for protection of a subject of personal data or the rights and the freedoms
of the citizens.
The content of Article 15 of Directive 95/46/ЕС, is incorporated in a special provision of the Law,
which guarantees that no court decision which produces legal effects concerning the performance
of certain person can not be based solely on automated data processing which purpose is
evaluation of certain personal aspect relating to that person. While the paragraph 2 of the same
provision specifies that another decision can be based only on automated data processing if it is
made in the course of entering into a performance of a contract and the person was provided the
opportunity to express his point of view (to safeguard his legitimate interests) or the decision was
made in concordance with the request of that person or in accordance with a law which lays down
measures to safeguard the data subject’s legitimate interests.
The chapter 5 - Confidentiality and protection in processing of personal data, contains provisions
which specify the duties of any person who has access to collections of personal data on the behalf
of the Data Controller or the Data Processing Agent, including the Data Processing Agent, to
provide for confidentiality, protection of personal data and to process the data in accordance with
the authorisations and instructions received from the Data Controller, if not otherwise prescribed by
law.
For providing confidentiality and protection of processing of personal data, the Data Controller must
implement appropriate technical and organisational measures and these measures must
correspond to the equipment and costs needed for their application. Therefore they shall ensure a
level of security appropriate to the risks represented by the processing and the nature of the data to
be protected. The list of technical and organisational measures which are applied by the Data
Controller pursuant to the Law is extensive and complex, in order to provide comprehensive
protection of personal data from all potential forms of unlawful processing.
On the basis of a signed contract, the Data Controller can transfer certain activities from within
his/her competence to the Data Processing Agent, if the Data Processing Agent guarantees that
they will undertake and respect adequate technical security and organisational measures for
protection of data processing. The Data Processing Agent has the duty, when processing the
personal data, to act in accordance with authorisations and instructions received from the Data
Controller and in accordance with provisions of this Law. The Data Controller has the duty to
maintain records on the undertaken technical and organisational measures, as well as on the
signed contracts.
The provisions in chapter 6 - Records of collections of personal data and central register, establish
the content and manner for keeping records on any collection of personal data, an obligation of

354/453

Data Controller to notify the Directorate for Protection of Personal Data before performing wholly or
partly automatic processing operation and an obligation of the Data Controller to submit data on any
newly opened collection of personal data, as well as change of data from the existing personal data
collections. The records from the Central Register kept by the Directorate are publicly accessible
and they are published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia.
The chapter 7 - Transfer of personal data to other countries, specifies that a transfer of personal
data to another countries can be performed only if the third country provides an adequate level of
protection of personal data. There is a precise enumeration of the circumstances assessed by the
Directorate for protection of personal data before performing a transfer of personal data to a third
country.
If the country where the data from the collection of personal data should be transferred does not
provide an adequate degree of protection of personal data, the Directorate will not authorise the
transfer.
The Law specifies the cases where by exception a transfer of personal data to a third country is
performed, if the other country to which the data should be transferred does not provide an
adequate degree of protection.
The chapter 8 - Making personal data available to users, contains provisions which are regulating
the substance related to making personal data available to users, as well as exchange of personal
data between state bodies. It is established that the Data Controller can make personal data
available on the basis of a written request submitted by the user, if the data are needed to perform
activities within the legally established scope of competencies of the user. It provides a prohibition
on providing personal data whose processing, i.e. use cannot be carried out in accordance with the
provisions of this Law and if the purpose for requesting such personal data is in accordance with
specific, clear and lawful purposes for which personal data is collected.
The chapter 9 of the Law, dealing with the Establishment and responsibilities of the Directorate for
Protection of Personal Data, defines the Directorate for Protection of Personal Data, as an
independent supervisory authority, performing control over the legality of of processing of personal
data. For more details see answer 24_B_03.
The chapter 10 - Penal Provisions contains provisions which prescribe misdemeanour sanctions in
case of violation and inconsistent enforcement of provisions of this Law. For committed
misdemeanours, fines as the only sanction for the perpetrators (natural and legal persons) are
prescribed. Fines are prescribed within the scope established in the Law on Misdemeanours
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97 and 35/97).
Chapter 11, Transitional and Final Provisions, lay down the timeframe for appointing a Director of the
Directorate for Protection of Personal Data (six months), as well as a timeframe for the Directorate to
adopt the secondary legislation provided for with this Law (six months). The natural and legal
persons processing personal data must align their work within two years from adopting the secondary
legislation.
Besides the basic Law which governs personal data protection, this area is subject to regulation in a
number of other laws.
The Law on Organisation and Operation of State Administrative Bodies (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 58/00 and 44/02) provides that state administrative bodies do not
disclose data related to the national security, official and business secret, as well as personal data
of citizens in accordance to the Law which governs protection of personal data of citizens.
The constitutional guarantee of protection of personal data is also regulated by the Criminal Code
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 37/96, 80/99, 4/02, 43/03 and 19/04). Given
the need for protection of the data subject, in Chapter 15, Crimes Against the Rights and Freedoms
of Human Beings and Citizens, the criminal act “abuse of personal data” has been introduced. The

355/453

legal essence of this criminal offence consists of a prescribed fine or prison sentence of up to one
year for the perpetrator who, contrary to conditions established by law and without the consent of
the citizen, collects, processes or uses their personal data. The same fine is provided for the
person who will penetrate into the computer information system of personal data with the intention
to use the data for him/herself or another person in order to gain benefit or to cause harm to another
person. The criminal offence abuse of personal data has an aggravated form if the mentioned
criminal offence is committed by officials in carrying out their duty, where a prison sentence of three
months to three years is provided. Taking into account the particular danger of the abovementioned
crimes for the freedoms and rights of human beings and citizens, it is prescribed that the attempt for
committing such a crime is also punishable. Legal persons can also be perpetrators of the primary
form of this crime, consequently being punished with a fine.
The criminal sanctions established in the Criminal Code can be pronounced to a perpetrator of the
mentioned criminal offence under the conditions determined in the Criminal Code and on the basis of
a legally executed criminal procedure in accordance with the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02 and 74/04).
The Law on Voter’s List (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 42/02 and 35/04),
determines the personal data contained in the voter’s list. The list contains the following data: the
personal identification number of the citizens, their surname, the name of one of the parents, their
name, gender, permanent address (municipality, area of residence, street, house number, entrance
number and apartment number), date of registration and deletion and date and type of data
amendment. The above personal data are protected in accordance with the Law on Personal Data
Protection and they must not be used for any other purpose, except for exercising citizens’ voting
right in accordance with the Law on Voter’s List. Any citizen may, within the period determined with
this law, file a request for registering, amending or deleting data in the copies of the voter’s list
provided for public inspection if they or any other citizen are not registered in it; if a person is
registered who does not have the right to vote or does not reside in the area of the municipality, or a
person who has passed away, and if the personal name and address of the person or the personal
name and address of another person have been inaccurately entered. Copies of the voter’s list, with
data related to the ordinal number, surname, name, gender, date of birth and address, are provided
to registered political parties and to independent candidates.
Basic personal data on citizens is recorded in the Registry of Births, Marriages and of Deaths. In
accordance with the Law on Personal Identification Records (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 08/95 and 38/02), registry books are kept, protected and used in accordance with
law. The original copy, the certificate from a registry, as well as a transcript or a copy for entry in a
registry, are issued upon request of the person to whom the data in those documents refer. The
documents are also issued to a concerned party, i.e. a legal entity or body when there is legal
interest established by law. The person to whom the data relates or another interested person, where
there is direct legal interest established by law, have the right to inspection of registries or the
documents and decisions upon which entries are made in the registries.
The Law on Reporting Dwellings and Residence of Citizens (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 36/92, 12/93 and 43/00) establishes that the Ministry of the Interior provides
protection from unauthorised access and use of the data contained in the records on the dwelling,
change of home address and residence of the citizens.
The personal data on asylum seekers, recognised refugees and persons under humanitarian
protection, the data on their residence and the rights they enjoy in the Republic of Macedonia are
contained in the Central Collection of Data, established, processed and used by the Ministry of the
Interior (Asylum Section). The above collection of data is established, processed and used by the
person handling the collection in accordance with the provisions of the Law on Personal Data
Protection. In accordance with the Law on Asylum and Temporary Protection (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 49/03), the data from the Central Collection of Data cannot be
exchanged with the country of origin of the person to whom such data relates or with the country of

356/453

origin of the members of their family. In order to execute the decision for expelling from the territory of
the Republic of Macedonia a person whose asylum request has been irrevocably denied or whose
right to asylum in the Republic of Macedonia has been terminated with an irrevocable decision, the
Asylum Section may exchange the following data with the competent authorities of other countries:
− The name and surname, date and place of birth, gender, citizenship, last residence and home
address, data on the number of family members and on the documents issued by the country
of origin; and
− Fingerprints and a photograph;
The personal identification number of the citizen is a unique designation on the identification
documents of the citizen. In accordance with the Law on Personal Identification Number (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 36/92), the Ministry of the Interior designates a personal
identification number to the citizen according to the place of registration of the newborn child in the
Registry of Births kept on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia. The Ministry of the Interior
provides the keeping, use and protection of the data from unauthorised access in accordance with
law.
Law enforcement officers, in accordance with the Code of Police Ethics (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 03/04), are obliged to adhere to the citizens’ right to privacy in
accordance with the Constitution and the laws of the Republic of Macedonia. Collecting, keeping and
using personal data by the police is performed in accordance with law and the ratified international
agreements for protecting personal data, restrictively and in the extent necessary for carrying out
legal duties. The police objectively inform the public of their activities, in accordance with the
principles of confidentiality of data (observed for protecting the personal integrity of citizens,
observing the principle of presumption of innocence, as well as for conducting a criminal procedure,
etc.). Therefore, professional procedures for relations with the media are established.
The Law on Classified Information (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 9/04)
establishes the measures and activities for protecting classified information. The measures and
activities for security of individuals i.e. issuing a security certificate, have a special place among the
stated measures and activities. The satisfaction of the conditions for issuing a security certificate is
established through a security audit carried out upon previous written consent of the person to whom
a security certificate is to be issued. The data from the completed security questionnaire are used for
the purposes of the audit.
The Law on State Statistics (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 54/97) regulates the
protection of individual data (of natural or legal persons) collected and processed for statistical
purposes. The existing law establishes the meaning of the expressions used and their protection.
The individual data related to a legal or natural person, collected and processed for statistical
purposes are confidential data and they can be used as separate data for statistical purposes only.
Access to the above data may be provided for statistical purposes only and, by exception, for
scientific purposes (without the identification data about the data subject). The quoted law underlines
that individual data cannot be separately used to make any decisions concerning the person they
relate to. When publishing statistical data or preparing them, upon the request of users, the data are
published, i.e. prepared in a form preventing the identification of the subject of the data, unless the
subject of the data has agreed to such publishing, i.e. providing. Data providers are notified of the
protection of data. The measures and techniques for protecting individual data collected and
processed for statistical purposes are established in a Rulebook on the Measures and Techniques on
the Protection of Individual Data Collected for Statistical Purposes (SSO internal document), adopted
by the Director of the State Statistical Office. A Commission for Protection of Data has been
established within the above state administrative body in order to supervise the protection of data. In
order to align the contents of the above law with European regulations, it is planned in the course of
2005 to approach the development of amendments and supplements to the contents of the Law on
State Statistics.

Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997: OJ L 052 22.02.1997;
The Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of
Personal Data No. 108 of the Council of Europe of 28.01.1981;
Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24.10.1995 on the
protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free
movement of such data; and
Recommendation of the Council of Europe No. R (97) 18.

The Law on Single Registry of the Population in the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the
SRM”, No. 46/90) provides for the introduction, keeping and contents of the single automated registry
of the population in the Republic of Macedonia, the competent authority for keeping the registry, the
protection of the data from the registry and the processing, publishing and use of the data from the
registry.
The Law on Personal Identification Records of the Insured and Beneficiaries of Pension and
Disability Insurance Rights (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 16/04) provides for
special competencies of the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund and for protection of the data on
the insured and beneficiaries of pension and disability insurance rights. The abovementioned Fund
determines, with a general act, the technical and organisational measures for securing the data from
the aforementioned personal identification records. The protection of the data contained in the
records on the insured and beneficiaries of pension and disability insurance rights encompasses
undertaking measures and activities for protecting the data from: unauthorised access, unauthorised
processing , prevention of destruction, loss, modification, abuse and unauthorised use of the data.
The Law on Keeping Labour Records (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 16/04),
regulates that the data contained in the records established by this Law can be used for statistical
purposes and for other official needs. Legally established data can also be used by individuals to
whom the mentioned data relate in order to exercise their rights. The legal possibility has been
established to exchange data among institutions and state bodies for the purpose of performing the
legally established competencies of these entities. The Rulebook on Processing, Using and
Protecting the Data in the Information System of the Employment Agency of the Republic of
Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 35/03) closely regulates the method
of processing, using and protecting the data in the information system of the Employment Agency of
the Republic of Macedonia.
The Law on Social Care (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 50/97, 16/00, 17/03
and 65/04) provides an obligation for the social security institution and the employees to keep
professional and official secrets. The Law protects the data and the facts found out during the
conduct of the procedure and during the decision-making concerning the rights of beneficiaries of
social security, of legal family protection, and on the competencies established by criminal
regulations. The above obligation also relates to all the facts and data that may harm the reputation,
dignity and interest of the citizen and their family.
The Law on Family (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 80/92, 09/96, 38/04 and
83/04 – consolidated text) establishes that the data on adoptions are an official secret.
The Law on Health Care (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 38/91, 46/93, 55/95,
17/97 – consolidated text and 10/04) specifies that when providing healthcare, healthcare workers
are obliged to take care of the beneficiaries subject to healthcare, to respect their dignity, to adhere
to medical ethics and to keep the professional secret. The obligation to keep a professional secret
refers, in addition to healthcare workers, to other workers in healthcare and other organisations who
use medical records or in any way (in performing their tasks) come across data contained therein.

358/453

The Law on Keeping Healthcare Records (“Official Gazette of the SRM” Nos. 37/79, 18/88 and
“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 15/95), adopted from a former republic
regulation by Article 5 of the Constitutional Law on the Implementation of the Constitution of the
Republic of Macedonia specifies that the data entered in the records established with this Law are
kept as data of permanent value.
In accordance with the Law on the Protection of the Population from Contagious Diseases (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 66/04), reporting AIDS and the HIV infection, as well as
microbiological findings for Treponema pallidum, HIV, Neisseria gonorhoeae, congenital infections
with the Rubella virus, Tohoplasma gondii and Chlamydia gondii is anonymous.
A Law on the Protection of Mental Health is under development in the Republic of Macedonia, and its
provisions will be aligned with the provisions of the Law on the Personal Data Protection.
According to the existing Law on Telecommunications (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 33/96, 17/98, 22/98 – consolidated text, 28/00, 04/02, 37/04), the holders,
operators of telecommunication networks and means, as well as the providers of public
telecommunication services are obliged to provide inviolability of message confidentiality within their
technical abilities. The protection of the confidentiality of messages does not apply for messages for
which a deviation from this obligation is provided with international agreements concluded, i.e.
acceded by the Republic of Macedonia, and with the regulations of the Republic of Macedonia.
The Law on Electronic Communications, which is being developed (soon it will be in parliamentary
procedure), regulates the issue of ensuring data protection in the way and procedure established by
Directive 2002/58/EC related to processing of personal data and protection of privacy in the field of
electronic communications. The Draft Law contains a separate chapter on the protection of the
secrecy and confidentiality of communications. This chapter will contain, inter alia, provisions
regulating protective measures for providing networks and services, communication confidentiality,
caller or connecting line identification, location information that are not traffic information, automatic
call diverting etc.
The Law on the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 03/02, 51/03, 85/03 and 40/04) provides for the obligation of the members of the
Council of the National Bank and the employees of the National Bank to keep official and business
secrets. This obligation binds these persons for five years following the end of their membership in
the Council of the National Bank, i.e. the termination of their employment with the National Bank. The
data that are an official and business secret may be provided only upon written request of the court.
As an exception, in cases laid down by law, the National Bank delivers data to the Ministry of
Finance, the Deposit Insurance Fund and the Directorate for Money Laundering Prevention, and
such data present an official secret for these entities.
The Banking Law (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 63/00, 103/00, 70/01, 37/02,
51/03, 85/03, 83/04) establishes the persons who may not reveal data and information established as
a business secret of the bank by law, statute and other bank acts. The obligation to keep a business
secret that persists after the termination of employment with the bank also relates to persons with
special rights and responsibilities, bank employees and other persons with access to bank
operations. The data that are a business secret of the bank, and that the bank is obliged to deliver to
the National Bank and to other bodies and institutions in accordance with law, are an official secret.
The data on savings deposits and on bank deposits of natural and legal entities, as well as data on
the operations of natural and legal persons through accounts, are a business secret of the bank. The
above data may be provided only in the following cases:
−
−
−

If the client provides written consent to reveal the data;
Upon written request or order of the competent court;
Upon written request of the national bank for the purpose of supervision, or another body
authorised by law; and

359/453

−

with law.
In accordance with the Law on Securities (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
63/00, 103/00, 34/01, 04/02, 37/02, 31/03, 85/03 and 96/04), the Central Securities Depositary is
established in order to determine and settle obligations on the basis of securities transactions and to
keep a Registry of securities in the Republic of Macedonia.
The Central Securities Depositary, as a central database, contains electronic data on the issued
securities, registering the rights arising from securities, all holders of those rights and the rights
arising from securities that can be enjoyed by third persons. The right to obtain data about ownership
is enjoyed by the owner of non-financial securities, the issuer of securities and legally authorised
bodies and institutions if they need such data in a procedure they conduct within their authorisations
or for the needs of their regular operation in accordance with law. The management and the
employees of the Central Securities Depositary, as well as certified auditors, are obliged to keep the
confidentiality of the data that they have known in carrying out their everyday work, unless they are
obliged to provide such information in accordance with the quoted law or another law. The Rules of
Order of the Central Securities Depositary establish an obligation for keeping the confidentiality of
data up to five years following termination of the employment of the management and the employees
in the Central Securities Depositary. The Law on Securities contains special provisions regulating
operations with long-term securities with regard to confidential data delivered to the Securities and
Exchange Commission and defining the notion of internal information, and it also lists the persons
subject to the obligation to keep internal information and their obligations for keeping such
information.
In accordance with the Law on Supervision of Insurance (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 27/02 and 98/02), insurance companies are obliged to treat as confidential all the
data about the insured and/or other insurance beneficiaries that they have acquired in the course of
performing insurance operations. The members of the bodies of insurance companies, their
shareholders, employees and other persons, who in the course of their work have access to
confidential data, may not transfer them to third parties or allow third parties to use them. The

Independent Data Protection Supervisory Authority
The Law on Personal Data Protection entails a separate chapter, Establishment and Duties of the
Directorate for Protection of Personal Data. The proposed legal provisions provide for the
establishment of the Directorate as an independent state authority with legal entity capacity for the
purpose of supervising the legality of the undertaken activities in processing personal data and their
protection. The Directorate is managed by a director appointed and dismissed by the Assembly of the
Republic of Macedonia, upon proposal of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, for a fiveyear term with the right to re-appointment, but no more than twice. The director and deputy director of
the Directorate are accountable for their work and the work of the Directorate to the Assembly of the
Republic of Macedonia.

361/453

A person satisfying the following conditions may be appointed a director: he/she must be a citizen of
the Republic of Macedonia, an eminent lawyer, and must not have been subject to a security
measure for prohibition of performing a profession, activity or duty. The director’s term of office may
be terminated by dismissal or in the event of death. The director is dismissed if they request that
themselves, if they are sentenced for a crime to an unconditional prison sentence of at least six
months and for non-professional, partial and unconscientious operation.
The director’s function cannot be combined with other public functions or professions. The director is
independent and autonomous in carrying out their function. The director files to the Assembly of the
Republic of Macedonia an annual report on the work of the Directorate and, if necessary, upon
request of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, files additional reports. The annual report on
the work of the Directorate is published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia.
The Law also regulates the duty for the director and the employees of the Directorate to keep the
data they have come across in their work as an official secret, both during their term of office, i.e.
employment in the Directorate, as well as afterwards.
The Directorate has the following competencies: it evaluates the legality of the processing of
personal data; it publishes the principles of processing personal data and ensures their adherence by
the Data Controllers; it does research and has access to collections of personal data compiled by the
data controller according to types of subjects and objectives; it controls the operations for processing
of personal data applied by the Data Controllers; it collects data necessary for its proper work; it
keeps a Central Registry for Collections of Personal Data; it keeps records for transfers of personal
data to other countries; it receives reports from or complaints concerning the processing of personal
data by a Data Controller; it issues prohibitions on further processing of personal data by the Data
Controller, it issues an opinion for secondary legislation acts to Data Controllers and carries out other
work provided for by law. In addition to the above competencies, upon a report filed by a Data
Controller prior to approaching operations for processing of personal data, the Directorate provides
an opinion whether certain operations for processing personal data present a special risk to the
freedoms and rights of the data subject. In the event of suspicion of existence of a special risk to the
freedoms and rights of the data subject, the Data Controller is obliged to request the opinion of the
Directorate.
For the purpose of carrying out the work within the competence of the Directorate regularly and
efficiently, the director and the employees of the Directorate are authorised to: enter any premises
where a registered system of a collection of personal data is processed, after presenting an
appropriate individual authorisation and a document for official identification, and inspect the
collections of personal data; seek written or oral explanation and call and examine persons with
regard to the collection of personal data investigated; to seek presentation of the paperwork and any
other data with regard to the subject of control, test the equipment used for processing the personal
data and the equipment where the collections of personal data are kept, and order the preparation of
an expert analysis and an opinion for the work of the Data Controller.
If the control establishes injuries to the provisions of this Law in processing personal data, the Data
Controller is obliged, at latest within 30 days from the day of establishment of the injury, to align their
work with the provisions of this Law, and, in particular, to remedy the reasons that brought about
such injuries, to complete, update, correct, reveal or keep the confidentiality of the personal data; to
adopt additional measures of protection for the collections of personal data; to stop the transfer of
personal data to other countries; to secure the data or their transfer to other subjects or to erase the
personal data. An administrative dispute can be initiated against the decision of the director.
The grounds for the implementation of the new law is the establishment of the aforementioned
independent authority within six months from its entry into force.

I. ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS
40. Please provide information on how, and to what extent, the right to education is
guaranteed in legislative and practical terms. Please comment on the allocation of resources
and institutional framework in place to facilitate the exercise of this right.
Article 44 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (”Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) establishes that everyone has the right to
education, that education is accessible to all under equal conditions and that primary education is
compulsory and free. Furthermore, citizens have a right to establish private schools at all levels of
education, with the exception of primary education, under conditions determined by law (Article 45).
The Constitution guarantees the autonomy of universities, while the conditions of establishment,
operation and termination of the activities of a university are regulated by law (Article 46).
Paragraph 4 of Amendment VIII replacing Article 48 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia
stipulates that members of communities have the right to instruction in their language in primary and
secondary education, as determined by law. In schools where education is carried out in another
language, the Macedonian language is also studied.
In accordance with Article 3 of the Law on Primary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 44/95, 24/96, 34/96, 35/97, 82/99, 29/02, 52/02- consolidated text, 40/03, 42/03,
63/04 and 82/04), primary education in the Republic of Macedonia lasts eight years and is
compulsory for all children aged seven to fifteen. Primary education is organised and realised in
primary schools, and it can also be organised and realised in healthcare institutions, educationalcorrective institutions and correctional facilities, in accordance with this Law.
Special primary schools and classes are organised within primary schools for students with special
needs, depending on the kind and extent of special needs. For the purpose of achieving greater
social inclusion of this category of students, classes in primary schools can include two students with
special needs.
Primary education for adults can be organised in primary schools, in institutions for adult education,
and in other institutions. Primary musical and ballet education can be organised in a primary school
or other institutions in accordance with the Law on Primary Education.
The Law amending the Law on Primary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
No. 63/04), in application from 01.09.2005, stipulates that primary education will last nine years and
that it will be compulsory for all children aged six to fifteen. Compulsory primary education covers one
preparation year, four years of class teaching and four years of subject teaching.
According to Article 3 of the Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 44/95, 24/96, 34/96, 35/97, 82/99, 29/2002, 52/02- consolidated text, 40/03, 42/03
and 67/04) everyone has the right to secondary education, under equal conditions established in this
Law. Discrimination on the basis of gender, race, skin colour, ethnic and social origin, political or
religious affiliation, property and social status, is not allowed. Students who have completed primary
education are enrolled in secondary education; however, for a certain kind of education (vocational
training lasting up to two years and talented students in art education) students with incomplete
primary education may enrol, undertaking to complete primary education at the same time.
Secondary education students can opt for: general programme education, vocational education, or
art education. Students with special education needs are educated according to adapted
programmes for appropriate professions or for work training.
The right to higher education is regulated with the Law on Higher Education (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 64/00 and 49/03), providing that the citizens of the Republic of
Macedonia, under equal conditions, have the right to education in higher education institutions in the
Republic of Macedonia (Article 6). The Law provides for an opportunity for foreign citizens to be

363/453

educated at the universities in the Republic of Macedonia, where with the reciprocity principle they
can be educated in the higher education institutions in the Republic of Macedonia under the same
conditions as the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia. Persons without citizenship also have the
right to higher education, under conditions established by law and ratified international acts.
The Law on Higher Education provides the normative and legal assumptions for exercising the right
to education. In addition, it establishes the basic requirements for enrolling for undergraduate,
postgraduate and doctoral studies, where the Law recommends that enrolment conditions and
criteria be closely determined by a rulebook of universities. In order to carry out in practice these
legal provisions and to exercise the right to higher education, universities announce competitions for
enrolling students for undergraduate studies, master studies, i.e. doctoral studies, containing the
criteria and requirements for the enrolment of candidates. At the state higher education institutions,
universities, in establishing the competition requirements for the enrolment of students in their first
academic year, provide an appropriate and a fair access of citizens from non-majority communities in
the Republic of Macedonia by establishing an additional quota as determined by a decision of the
Government of the Republic of Macedonia. At the same time, universities have adopted rulebooks
dealing specifically with the requirements and criteria for enrolment at undergraduate, postgraduate,
and doctoral studies – an obligation arising from the Law on Higher Education.
The Law establishes the rights of students in the course of their university studies, such as the right
to choose the kind of studies undertaken; the right to study a number of academic programs at the
same time; the right to continue their studies at another higher education institution if the one where
they are enrolled has ceased working; the right to choose and to be chosen as a student
representative in the bodies of the higher education institution; the right to transfer from one to
another higher education institution, i.e. academic program and thereby use the benefits of the credit
system; and other rights. The Law provides for special privileges determined by the statutes of the
universities pertaining to students with no parents, physically disabled persons, mothers with children
younger than six years, and persons in hospital care. Every university establishes a student attorney,
whose competences are laid down by university statute, for the purpose of protecting student rights.
According to the Law on Higher Education higher education is realised in higher education
institutions which can be state-owned or private. A state higher education institution is established by
the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia with a law, while а private institution can be established
by a domestic or foreign legal or natural person with the approval of the Government of the Republic
of Macedonia. According to the Law on Higher Education, (Article 36), a university can be
established if there are five accredited faculties and higher schools, at least three of which are
faculties. A faculty can be established if, in accordance with Article 35 of the Law on Higher
Education, the following requirements are satisfied: established area of study; provided premises and
equipment; a sustainable level of funding and provided teaching, scientific and associate staff.
In order to establish a private higher education institution, in addition to the requirements laid down
by Articles 35 and 36 of the Law on Higher Education, the founder must submit financial guarantee
for compensation of funds paid by the students if the private institution terminates its work.
Establishment requirements are closely regulated with a Rulebook for Norms and Standards for
Establishing Higher Education Institutions and Performing Higher Education Activities (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 33/03), which upon the proposal of the Inter-university
Conference is adopted by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia.
The establishment procedure commences with a project for establishing a higher education institution
developed by the founder and submitted to the Accreditation Board in order to obtain an accreditation
decision. The Government forms a primary commission which conducts the preparatory work, after
which the founder submits a request to the Ministry of Education and Science in order for it to inspect
the satisfaction of the requirements and adopt a decision for starting operation. Afterwards the
institution is registered in the Registry of Higher Education Institutions, followed by incorporation of its
bodies and entry in the Court Register, whereby the institution becomes a legal entity.

364/453

The supervision of the legality of the work of the higher education institution is conducted by the
Ministry of Education and Science, while the Agency for Evaluation conducts an external evaluation
of the quality of the higher education institution and its work.
Most higher education institutions are joined in the four universities: the Ss. Cyril and Methodius
University in Skopje, the St. Clement of Ohrid University in Bitola, the South East Europe University
in Tetovo, and the State University in Tetovo. Recently the private Faculty of Social Sciences in
Skopje was accredited, and it does not belong to any of the abovementioned universities.
About the structure of the education system, for more details see 18_I_A.
The means for funding primary/secondary education are secured from the State Budget, and can
also be provided from the unit of the local self-government, as well as from other sources
(endowments, presents, legacies, etc.). The Ministry of Education and Science allocates the funds to
the final beneficiaries and controls their purposeful use.
The allocation of the funds to the beneficiaries in the field of primary/secondary education for
particular purposes is carried out on the basis of:
−
−
−

Criteria for allocation of the funds to primary/secondary education;
Criteria for allocation of funds for material expenses in accordance with the approved funds
for primary/secondary education from the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, and
The Programme for investment construction and maintenance of buildings in
primary/secondary education.

The amount of the funds required for primary/secondary education for each budget year is
established by the Ministry of Education and Science, whereas the Ministry of Finance, i.e. the
Government and the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia determine the funds in accordance with
the macroeconomic policy, i.e. the projections for revenue and expenditure in the central budget.
In order to achieve decentralisation in funding primary/secondary education, the funds for
primary/secondary education will be provided in accordance with the Law on Budgets of the Republic
of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 79/93, 3/94, 71/96, 46/00, 11/01,
93/01, 46/02, 24/03 and 85/03), the Law on Enforcement the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia,
and the Law on Financing the Local Self-Government Units (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 61/04).
The financial decentralisation will be carried out in two stages. In the first stage, in the course of
2005, the funds for building maintenance will be transferred to the local level, while in the second
stage, starting from 2007, the funds for employee salaries and investments will be transferred to the
local level by block grants.
The funds for exercising the right to education at the state universities are provided from the Budget
of the Republic of Macedonia and from other sources determined by law. The starting point for
funding state universities is their annual financial plans. Furthermore, Article 89 of the Law on Higher
Education provides a possibility for state universities to introduce co-financing of academic expenses
by students, unless budget funds are received for those education purposes. In practice, this legal
opportunity is used at the universities, and apart from students within the state quota, they enrol
students who co-finance their studies because they cannot enrol within the state-funded quota due to
the limited numbers.

Education funding in the Republic of Macedonia, as stated above, is largely provided from the Budget
of the Republic of Macedonia, as much as 81%, whereas other sources (revenue from bodies,
donations, self-financed activities) provide for 19%. On average, 3,5% of GDP and 13% of the
Budget of the Republic of Macedonia are allocated for education.
The structure of expenditure by programmes is as follows: primary education accounts for 55-60%,
secondary education for 21-23%, higher education for 13-15%, student standard for 2-3%, and
university student standard for 4%.
The greatest part of expenditures is for salaries - 82%, for goods and services - 8%, current transfers
- 9%, and purchasing capital means - 2%. In continuity, the funds intended for material expenditure
and investments have not been sufficient to cover school needs (heating, utilities, materials, current
and investment maintenance, etc.).
Overall education expenditure nominally has a 3% upward trend, however, in respect of
programmes, in recent years expenditure for primary and secondary education has increased,
whereas in higher education, student standard and university student standard have a decreasing
trend with regard to expenditure.
The education budget for 2005 is restricted and it will remain on the same level as 2004. It is
expected that with the decentralisation process, the municipalities (part of them) will, in addition to
the funds they obtain from the budget as block grants for primary and secondary education, use their
additional means, within their possibilities, to take part in covering education expenditure.
In future budget projections special attention must be dedicated to allocating more funds for
education, in particular for material expenditures and capital investment, in order to overcome the
current situation and provide conditions for better quality instruction.
The general institutional framework of the education system of RM (in application from September
2005) is provided in the figure below.

The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia establishes the institution of Ombudsman competent
to protect the constitutional and legal rights of citizens when they are violated by state administrative
bodies or other bodies and organisations with public authorities. The institution of Ombudsman has
been operating since 1997. A special Department for Children’s Rights Protection has been operating
within the legal and constitutional competences of the Ombudsman. This Department is a member of
the European Network of Ombudsmen for Children (ENOC).
A National Plan for the Children's Rights (for more details see I_H_11) is currently being prepared by
the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (with the participation of all ministries - the Ministry of
Labour and Social Policy; the Ministry of Education; the Ministry of Justice; the Ministry of Health; the
Ministry of the Interior; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Agency for Youth and Sports; the
Information Agency; the Education Development Bureau and Associations of Citizens).

The Law on Family determines that parents are free to decide and plan their offspring, but are
obliged to provide their child(ren) optimum conditions for healthy growth. Children in Macedonia born
in or out of the wedlock are equal concerning their relations, rights and duties with the parents and
closer relatives. The parental relation begins with the child’s birth or his/her legal adoption.
The parental right ends by the child's legal age (18 years of age), by the child's marriage before
his/her legal age and by adoption. The parental right of a child over 18 years of age may be
continued by a court's decision in a non-trial procedure, if the child cannot take care of him/herself
due to hindrances in his/her intellectual development.
The parental right pursuant to the Law on Family comprises the rights and duties of parents to take
care of the personality, rights and interests of their juvenile children and children under extended
parental care. The parental right equally belongs to the mother and the father. The parental right
contains the rights and duties related to supporting juveniles, caring for their life and health,
education, schooling and training, and their properties and property rights.
The children have a right to be represented in the legal system by their parents. Juvenile children
have a right to live with their parents. Children may live apart from their parents when it is in their
interest or in the interest of both the parents and the children. Children have a right to maintain direct
contacts with the separated parent or other close relatives of the deceased parent, or the parent
whose parental right has been revoked or who has been hindered to carry out his/her parental right.
The Law on Family determines the competences of the Social Work Centre to undertake measures
and implement forms of protection for the personality, rights and interests of juvenile children. These
are the forms of protection that have been stipulated:
−
−
−
−

Supervision on the exercise of the parental right;
Custody;
Adoption and
Protection from family violence.

Additionally, it specifies a chapter regulating the supervision on the exercise of the parental right in
the part regulating rights and duties of parents and children. The Social Work Centre undertakes the
following measures for the protection of personality, interests and rights of juvenile children:
−

−

−
−

−

−

Notifies the parents on the shortcomings in education and development of the child, offers
them assistance for the adequate development and education of the child, advises them to
visit adequate counselling, health, social or education institution with or without the child;
Regulates the personal relations of the child with the separated parent. The Centre may
temporarily prohibit such relations if they are irregular or to the child’s detriment (irregular and
unjustified non-payment of child support, or non compliance with the Centre’s decision that
regulates personal relations); may keep or take away the child from the parent who has
prevented the child's contacts with the separated parent and entrust him/her to the separated
parent for a certain period of time;
Adopts a decision on a continuous supervision over the exercise of the parental right;
May decide to take away the child from the parent and entrust him/her to the other parent,
another person or institution, if the child has been neglected concerning his/her education or
in case of a serious danger to the child's correct development and upbringing;
The Centre may place a child in an institution upon the request of the parent, the Public
Prosecutor or the guardian, or on the basis of its own knowledge if the child's conduct has
been disturbed;
As regards the child’s property, the Social Work Centre may oblige the parent to inform the
child on how to manage his/her property or may demand a court protection of the property or
a court decision giving the parent a right to custody of the child;

370/453

−

In the event of the parent’s neglect or abuse of his/her parental right, a procedure may be
initiated before a competent court against the parent to revoke his/her parental right; a
proposal to the Court may be filed by the Social Work Centre, the other parent or the Public
Prosecutor. Abuse or a severe neglect of the parental right occurs when the parent physically
or emotionally abuses the child; sexually harasses the child; encourages the use of alcohol;
drugs or induces the child to socially unacceptable conduct; has left the child unattended for
longer than three months and has not supported him/her; or if in any other way the parent
severely violates the child’s rights.

A juvenile without parental support (if the parents are deceased, have disappeared, are unknown or
cannot be traced for longer than a year) or a juvenile whose parents have not been carrying out their
rights and duties regardless of reasons is placed under custody.
The procedure on custody, protection measures, rights and property of the juvenile, appointing a
guardian, and supervising the guardian in performing his/her custody duty is carried out by the Social
Work Centre as an exclusively competent body for custody issues. The Social Work Centre is also
authorised to continue to support a person after the expiry of custody due to legal age if he/she while
under custody and as a result of justified reasons has not been able to prepare for independent life
and work.
A juvenile may be entrusted to a special-case guardian in the event of a dispute between the child
and his/her parents in order to sign certain legal acts or when they have conflicting interests. The
parent may dispose of a juvenile’s property, transfer it, encumber it, or relinquish from a gift or
inheritance, only with a permit issued from the Social Work Centre.
The Law on Family regulates the adoption of juveniles (until they turn 18 years of age) only when
such protection is to the best of their interest. The adoption procedure of a juvenile is strictly formal
by determining the adoption conditions, modes and procedures on adopting, rights and duties of the
adopter and the adopted and the termination of adoption.
Pursuant to the Law there are two types of adoption: full adoption which establishes a parent-child
relation between the adopter and the adoptee as in relations between a natural born child and a
parent; and incomplete adoption establishing parent-child relations between the adopter and
adoptee.
The adoption is allowed only upon a statement of the child's parent, after the child reaches three
months of age. The parent submits the statement to the competent social work centre. The Law
prescribes that adoption is possible without a parent’s statement in case he/she has been declared
unfit for work or parenthood, or in case his/her residence has been unidentified for longer than one
year. Adoption may also be established for a child placed in an institution or a foster family without
the parent's consent if he/she has not attended the child within 6 months from the time he/she had
been obliged to take the child.
By the amendments of the Law on Family - in June 2004 (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 38/04 and 83/04- consolidated text), the expert part of the procedure and the
decision-making on adoptions have been separated. The amendments also envision a single registry
on a state level.
Expert teams within social work centres implement the expert part of the adoption procedure and
prepare an expert opinion on the fitness and motivation of persons who have filed for an adoption of
a juvenile, their personal features and their capability of parenthood. The social work centre is in
charge of parentless juveniles and children without parental care and decides upon the form of their
protection. It submits a proposal to the Commission on the most eligible adopters and a proposal to
place the child in the family of the potential adopters for an adaptive period.
The Commission on Establishment of Adoptions within the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy
establishes the adoption and keeps the registers of adopters and adopted children. The Commission

371/453

comprises 5 members with the following educational background: graduate social worker, graduate
lawyer, psychologist and pedagogue with 15 years of work experience in the field and personal and
professional capabilities for performing the post. The Commission members are appointed by the
Minister of Labour and Social Policy.
The Commission keeps a register on all potential adopters and a register on all adopted children on a
state level; inspects documents of adoption cases; adopts a decision on a mandatory adaptive period
of the child into the family of potential adopters; reviews the Centre’s proposal on the child placement
in adopters' families with the option to change it and propose other adopters. The Commission
formally establishes the adoption. The amendments to the Law determines the ceiling of the
adopter's age, hence the age difference between the adopter and the adoptee must not be greater
than 45 years. The Law stipulates the following exceptions: when a sibling of an already adopted
child is being adopted and when the child is adopted by a married couple if there is age limit between
the child and one of the adopters.
The amendments to the Law on Family establish that juveniles are protected when they are victims of
family violence through determined measures and activities undertaken by the social work centre.
The Law on Social Care determines concrete forms of protection when a child's living conditions in
his/her family are unsatisfactory. The Social Work Centre makes a decision on institutional or noninstitutional protection, implements expert and concrete measures depending on the child's age and
needs.
Day Care Centres are considered non-institutional protection which offer work and production
activities, work therapies and other activities for physically or mentally disabled children. Supporting
children in foster-families is a developed form of protection in the Republic of Macedonia. This form
of protection has been implemented for a long period of time and is constantly developed and
promoted. The process of deinstitutionalisation is supported by fostering children in foster-families
and this practice has shown good results. Children with disabilities are also placed in foster families;
hence their number in specialised institutions has decreased. Foster families receive a monthly
compensation for every fostered child and temporary aid in forms of donations.
Institutional protection is carried out in the Children’s Home for Parentless Children and Children
without Parental Care “11 October” in Skopje, where children are fostered from 3 years of age to their
becoming capable of independent life, and not later than 6 months after their secondary school
graduation. Newborns up to three years of age are fostered in the Newborns and Infants Home in
Bitola. In Skopje there is an institution for fostering moderately mentally challenged children which
offers them accommodation, care, food, and educational and work training depending on their
individual capabilities. Physically disabled children are fostered in an institution in Banja Bansko,
where they are offered accommodation, food, care, cultural and social activities and elementary
education. Their further education is provided in the existing educational system. Children with
severe mental disabilities are fostered in the Special Institute in Demir Kapija.
Parentless children and children without parental care, pursuant to The Law on Social Care, are
eligible for a continuous financial aid, health care (if not provided), and right to accommodation
(which has fallen under the authority of municipalities with the new decentralisation law). The Social
Work Centre pursuant to the Law on the Protection of Children decides on the right to children’s
benefits, special benefits and benefits for a newborn.
The Ministry of Labour and Social Policy has undertaken planned measures and activities on the
protection of homeless children through the implementation of the Programme on the Protection of
the Socially Excluded Persons. This programme is aimed at keeping records of all children,
undertaking measures on working with parents in order to raise the level of their parental duty and
responsibility. In cases of evident parental neglect a procedure on revoking the parental right is
initiated and the child is placed into an institution or a foster family. There are activities under way for
social strengthening of children through their incorporation into programmes of day care centres.

372/453

The Law on Labour Relations determines special protection of employees under 18 years of age that
may not perform heavy and physical duties, underground or underwater work, or other work that may
pose risk or be detrimental to their health and life. This Law also regulates the right to part-time work
of one of the parents of a severely disabled child if both parents are employed or in case of a selfsupporting parent.
Juveniles in the Republic of Macedonia may be prosecuted for crimes and misdemeanours when
they reach 14 years of age. Criminal procedures for juveniles have been regulated in special
chapters of the Criminal Code and the Law on Criminal Procedure. The same principle applies to the
misdemeanour procedure.
The criminal procedure against a juvenile offender is carried out in accordance with the following
principles:
− The criminal procedure is initiated upon the request of the Public Prosecutor;
− For every such procedure the Public Prosecutor notifies the Social Work Centre as a
competent body for custody and requests opinion and a proposal for pronouncing, extending
or revoking the measures ruled by the court;
− A juvenile may not be tried in his/her absence;
− The juvenile is summoned through the parent or the legal representative;
− In the course of undertaking activities in the juvenile's presence, and especially upon his/her
interrogation, the competent bodies are obliged to handle the matter carefully, taking account
for the child's mental development, his/her sensitivity and personal traits, in order to avoid any
detrimental effects to his/her development from the criminal proceeding;
− The juvenile must be represented by a defender in the event of a criminal act punishable with
imprisonment of 5 years or over, and in the event of other criminal acts as assessed by the
judge for juveniles.
− No person may be released from testifying in a criminal proceeding against a juvenile
offender.
The Public Prosecutor may decide not to request an initiation of criminal proceedings for a juvenile
offender which is punishable with a sentence of up to 3 years of imprisonment or a fine. The Public
Prosecutor requests an opinion from the competent Social Work Centre on the initiation of
proceedings against a juvenile.
Aside from the facts related to the criminal offence in the course of the preparatory procedure against
a juvenile, the facts on his/her age, mental development, environment and conditions in which he/she
lives and other circumstances related to the juvenile's personality are especially established. The
parents or the guardians are heard concerning the circumstances and a report is obtained from the
competent social work centre. The social work centre co-operates with the Public Prosecutor and the
court in the course of the criminal procedure against juveniles as well as in proposing measures and
in monitoring their execution. The Social Work Centre monitors the effect of the execution of
measures through the process of the overall re-socialisation into the family, daily activities and
behaviour, inclusion into the education system and through preparation of a Working Programme for
each individual child.
The criminal procedure against a juvenile offender is performed by a judge for juveniles who also
conveys the preparatory procedure. In procedures before basic courts and appellate courts, verdicts
are brought by a council comprising one judge and two lay judges. Lay judges are selected from
professors, teachers, educators and other persons with experiences in educating juveniles. A juvenile
offender may be sentenced with educational measures (rebuke or sending them to a disciplinary
centre), intensified supervision by a parent, other family or a custodial institution; institutional
measures (sending them to an educational institution and to a house of education and correction);
security measures (compulsory psychiatric treatment and confinement in a health institution,
compulsory treatment for alcoholics and drug addicts and prohibition of driving a motor vehicle); and
by exception juveniles may be sentenced to juvenile imprisonment.

373/453

After pronouncing any of the education (correctional) measures of intensified supervision, the court
may prescribe one or more special obligations to the juvenile if it deems them necessary for the more
successful execution of the pronounced measure, such as: to apologise personally to the damaged
person; to correct or compensate the damage caused by the crime; to go to school regularly; not to
be absent from his/her workplace or accept training; prohibition on using alcoholic drinks, narcotics
and other psychotropic substances; to visit appropriate health institution or counselling service, etc.
The court, as an alternative measure may punish juvenile offenders with community work from 5 to
100 hours.
The court decides which measure shall be pronounced. The court takes into account the juvenile’s
age, his/her mental and social characteristics, motives to perpetrate a crime, environment, if he/she
has criminal record and other relevant information. All data are processed by the competent custodial
institution – the Social Work Centre, which gives a proposal to the court. The court always
pronounces the mildest measure that can influence the juvenile and prevent him/her from
perpetrating crimes.
The Law on Misdemeanour determines that juveniles who have reached 14 years of age may be
punished for misdemeanour and be sentenced to educational measures, while juveniles of 16 years
of age may be punished with educational measure, and by exception with a fine or imprisonment.
The Social Work Centre participates in the procedure on determining a misdemeanour procedure
against a juvenile by submitting an opinion to the court about the juvenile’s personality. The Centre
also has a right to be informed on the entire procedure.
The execution of the pronounced measures and punishments to a juvenile offender has been
regulated by the Law on Execution of Sanctions. The aim of executing educational measures is to
provide a proper development of the juveniles by their protection, supervision, and education. The
court entitles the Social Work Centre to convey the educational measure and in accordance with the
type of the measure to use adequate methodology, to perform a social supervision of the execution
or to send the juvenile into an adequate institution.
The State Social Work Institute carries out the expert supervision over the execution of educational
(correctional) measures. The social work centre monitors the measures of intensified supervision.
The institutional measures are carried out by sending the juvenile to an educational institution or to a
correction institution where primary education and other types of expert training for juveniles may be
organised. Juveniles serve prison sentences in a special juvenile prison, separately from adults.
Male and female children are separated.
The Criminal Code stipulates criminal acts where children and juveniles are protected. A qualified
form of the act has been prescribed for crimes of murder, inducing a suicide or abetting a suicide,
abduction, and in cases when the act has been carried out against a juvenile. Special criminal
offences are a sexual attack upon a child, pandering and enabling sexual acts, showing pornographic
materials to a child and incest.
The Criminal Code contains special chapters on crimes against marriage, family and youth. These
criminal acts encompass extra-marital life with a juvenile, taking away a juvenile, change of family
situation of a juvenile, deserting a helpless child, neglecting and mistreating a juvenile, not paying
sustenance and serving alcoholic drinks to juveniles.
According to the annual statistical report of the State Statistical Office in the course of 2003, 287
crimes against marriage, family and youth were reported before the courts in the Republic of
Macedonia, and more specifically:
− Taking away a juvenile – 50;
− Neglecting and mistreating a juvenile – 30;
− Not paying sustenance – 177;

374/453

−

Other crimes - 30.

In the course of 2003, a total number of 183 perpetrators have been convicted of crimes against
marriage, family and youth:
− Taking away a juvenile – 24;
− Mistreating and neglecting juveniles - 26;
− Not paying sustenance - 115;
− Other crimes – 18.
42. How is domestic violence treated in your legislation and in judicial practice?
Domestic violence was for the first time treated in the Macedonian civil legislation with the
amendments to the Law on Family of June 2004 (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
Nos. 80/92, 09/96,38/04 and 83/04- consolidated text). The novelty introduced with the amendments
was the treatment of domestic violence in a civil law act.
Pursuant to Article 1, the Law governs the following: marriage and family; relations in marriage and
family; specific forms of protection provided for family; disturbed relations and violence in marriage
and family; adoption, custody, sustenance; and court procedure in marital and family disputes. Article
2 of the Law stipulates that the State shall provide protection for the marriage and the family against
disturbed relations and violence therein. By Article 5 of the same Law a new Article 33-a has been
added under which any form of violence in marriage and in family is prohibited.
Within the meaning of the Law, Article 94-b defines domestic violence as follows: Violence in
marriage and family means any conduct by a family member who, by using force, threat or
intimidation causes body injuries, commits emotional or sexual abuse or material, sexual or working
exploitation of another family member.
Paragraph 2 of the same Article determines that such conduct shall be regarded as violence if
committed: by one marital partner against the other marital partner who have lived or used to lived in
marital or non-marital union or in any other form of union as family, or if they have joint child; by
brothers or sisters; half-brothers or half-sisters; against a child; against elderly family members and
against family members partially or fully deprived of their civil capacity.
By the Amendments to the Law on Family, Article 94-c, paragraph 2 sets forth that a victim of the
domestic violence may be any family member, regardless of gender or age. Perpetrator of domestic
violence may be a former or current marital or extra-marital partner; a person living or having lived in
union with the victim; person having joint child with the victim; a person in blood relationship of up to
the fourth degree or an in-law of up to the second degree of these persons, i.e. one that has been in
a marital, non-marital or any other form of lifetime union with these persons.
Article 94-d underlines the role of the Social Work Centre, namely: the Social Work Centre, when it
has learnt of disturbed family relations or domestic violence, ex officio or upon a request of a family
member, undertakes measures for protection of family or persons who have been victims of domestic
violence. The Social Work Centre, when it has learnt of any form of violence in a family and of
serious threat for life or health of a family member, undertakes the following measures:
−
−
−
−
−

Provides necessary accommodation of the person victim of violence that may last up to 6
months, with a possibility of its extension for another six months;
Provides the necessary health care;
Provides the necessary psychological and social intervention and treatment;
Guides him/her to the adequate counselling office;
If the family includes a child in a regular school, provides assistance for the continuation of
his/her regular education;

375/453

−
−
−
−
−

Notifies the law-enforcement body;
Provides any form of legal assistance and representation;
Initiates proceedings before a competent court;
If necessary, files a request before the court for pronouncing temporary measure of
protection;
Undertakes other measures that it considers necessary in order to resolve the issue.

The envisaged measures are primarily aimed at protection of the victim and other family members
from further domestic violence. With a view to implementing the provisions of the Law, the Ministry of
Labour and Social Policy (MLSP) has already put in operation four day-care centres for victims of
domestic violence as separate organisational units within the respective Social Work Centres. The
programme for the development of this type of protection envisages extension of the network of such
centres. Practical implementation of the Law has been at the initial stage and therefore limited
number of actions has been registered.
Undertaking of protection measures is mandatory in case victim of domestic violence is a juvenile
child or a person deprived of civil capacity.
The Social Work Centre shall learn of the committed domestic violence from citizens, official or legal
persons who are obliged without delay to submit notification thereof.
Domestic violence has been for the first time treated separately in the Macedonian criminal
legislation with the Law Amending the Law on the Criminal Code (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 19/04) by which provisions on domestic violence were introduced.
Namely, pursuant to Article 122 of the Criminal Code, domestic violence has been defined as
maltreatment; rude insults; endangering safety; causing body injury; sexual or other psychological or
physical violence causing feeling of insecurity, danger or fear against a marital partner, parent, child
or another person living in marital or non-marital union or joint household, as well as against former
marital partner or persons that have joint child or have been in close personal relations.
Provisions on domestic violence have been incorporated as qualified forms of the basic criminal
offences in the following chapters of the Criminal Code: Crimes Against Life and Body (within the
criminal offences murder, momentary murder, body injury and grave body injury); Crimes Against
Freedoms and Rights of Persons and Citizens (within criminal offences coercion, unlawful arrest and
endangering security); and Crimes Against Sexual Freedom and Sexual Morality (within criminal
offences sexual attack upon a child and mediation in conducting prostitution).
The Law on Family regulates the initiation of a regular civil procedure in order to provide for court
protection, regardless of whether criminal proceedings have been instituted against the perpetrator of
domestic violence. The Social Work Centre is the sole institution authorised to submit before court a
request for initiation of procedure for pronouncing temporary measure for protection against domestic
violence, with an obligation for mandatory submission of such request in cases of violence against a
juvenile child or person without civil capacity. Requests on behalf of persons of legal age and
persons with civil capacity shall be filed only upon consent by the victim of the domestic violence.
The Social Work Centre shall enclose with the request the minutes and the report on the undertaken
actions. It may also enclose a proposal for proclaiming temporary measure, along with draftmeasure.
The Law prescribes the following temporary measures that the court may pronounce to the
perpetrator of domestic violence (one or more at a time):
−
−

Prohibition of threats that he/she shall commit domestic violence;
Prohibition of maltreatment, disturbance, telephone calls, contacts or other modes of
communication with a family member, whether direct or indirect;

−

Prohibition for him/her to approach the dwelling, school, working or another place regularly
visited by a family member;
Order for removal from the home regardless of the ownership, pending the final decision of
the competent court;
Prohibition for possession of fire arms or other weapons, or an order for its confiscation;
Obliging him/her to return objects necessary for fulfilment of the everyday requirements of the
family;
Pronouncing of mandatory sustenance of the family;
Order for the defendant to attend adequate counsel;
Order for mandatory medical treatment, if abusing alcohol or other psychotropic substances
or in case of a disease;
Obliging him/her to reimburse the medical and other expenses incurred due to the domestic
violence;
Any other measure which the court deems necessary to ensure safety and well-being of the
other family members.

Proposal for initiation of a court procedure before the Social Work Centre may be filed by a marital
partner; parents or children or other persons living in marital or non-marital union or joint household;
former marital partner or persons having close personal relations against whom domestic violence
has been committed, regardless of whether a complaint has been lodged in criminal proceedings.
A parent, custodian or legal representative may file a proposal on behalf of a juvenile child, a person
with restricted civil capacity, a person that has been deprived of civil capacity, or a person under
extended parenting right. The proposal shall be submitted to the competent Social Work Centre,
depending on the place of residence of the victim of domestic violence.
The Amendments to the Law on Family regulate the procedure for pronouncing temporary measures
for protection against domestic violence, the composition of the court, course of the proceedings and
legal remedies against court decision.
Article 279-a sets forth that a single judge shall decide on the pronouncing of temporary measure for
protection against domestic violence. After a request has been received under Article 94-g of the
Law, the court shall schedule hearing. Pursuant to Article 279-b, public shall be excluded from
hearings in this proceedings.
Article 279-c determines the manner of action of the Social Work Centre, namely: The Court shall act
immediately upon a request by the Social Work Centre for pronouncing temporary measure under
Article 94-g and shall render its judgment within seven days from the day of the receipt of the
request.
By derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, the Court shall decide within three days from the day
of the receipt of the request in case there is reasonable suspicion that serious danger exists for the
life and health of a family member.
Article 279-d provides for the presence at the hearing of the perpetrator and the victim of domestic
violence, as well as a Social Work Centre representative. The Law stipulates that other persons may
also be summoned by a court judgment. Article 279-e sets forth that temporary measure for
protection against domestic violence may last up to one year. In case domestic violence continues
beyond the expiry of the measure, the Social Work Centre may submit a request for extending some
of the measures. The court may request notification from the Social Work Centre on the
implementation of the pronounced measure. Upon a proposal by the Social Work Centre, the court
may extend, annul or amend its decision. The court shall forward a copy of its decision to the parties,
the Social Work Centre, the Public Prosecutor’s Office and the law enforcement bodies. A complaint
filed against the court decision shall not prevent its enforcement.

377/453

As regards the court decision on the pronounced temporary measures for protection against
domestic violence, the Social Work Centre has the following competences:
−

Monitors the implementation of the pronounced measure and notifies the court on the course
of its enforcement;
− May submit a proposal to the competent court for annulment of the pronounced measure prior
to the expiry of the period for which it has been pronounced, if it assesses that the measure
has fulfilled its aim;
− May submit a proposal for alteration of the pronounced measure or its extension, if it
assesses that it has been inadequate or that it will fulfil the required objectives, however in a
longer period of time.
In the enforcement of the protective measure, the Social Work Centre cooperates with citizens, legal
persons and organisations. The Law includes penal provisions, as well, for subjects for whom the
Law prescribes obligation for mandatory reporting on domestic violence with the competent Social
Work Centre. Thus, Article 279-i determines the following fines: A fine of 5.000 to 10.000 MKD shall
be imposed on a person who shall fail to act in accordance with obligations under Article 94-d, i.e.
who shall fail to notify with no delays the Social Work Centre of the knowledge for domestic violence;
A fine of 100.000 to 200.000 MKD shall be imposed on a legal entity that shall fail to act in line with
the aforementioned obligations. A fine has been also prescribed for the person in charge of the legal
entity.
In the court practice so far, one temporary measure for protection has been pronounced, which is
obviously due to the short period of time since the adoption of the Amendments to the Law on
Family.
Following the Law Amending the Law on the Criminal Code (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 19/04), domestic violence has been treated as a criminal offence against life and
body punishable with fines and sentences of six months to life imprisonment. Initiation of criminal
proceedings before court is done pursuant to the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02 and 74/04).
Every child in the Republic of Macedonia is entitled to health care pursuant to the Law on Health
Care (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 38/91, 46/93, 55/95 and 10/04) and the
Heath Insurance Law (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 25/00, 34/00, 96/00,
50/01, 11/02 and 31/03), which regulate the relations and rights under health insurance, procedure
for benefiting from the health care and the health care system and organisation.
In case of domestic violence, family members victims of violence exercise the health care and health
insurance rights in adequate health care facilities depending on the health care needs: in primary
health care; with family doctor; in health care facilities for children under six years of age; in health
care institutions for pupils and youth; in general medicine facilities; in occupational medicine
institutions; in institutions of women health care; in emergency medical service; in adequate specialist
or consultative service or hospital at the secondary or tertiary level. The placement and provision of
health care for the victims of violence has been regulated by the provisions of the Law on Family, i.e.
it falls within the competence of the Social Work Centre. The registration, records and manner of
provision of health care for victims of domestic violence have been conducted within the health care
system in accordance with the existing legislation.
In case of violence, the child shall benefit from the health care and health insurance rights in the
adequate health care facility in accordance with the health care needs, namely: in primary health
care institution; with family doctor; in health care facilities for children under six years of age; in health
care institutions for pupils and youth; in emergency medical service; in adequate specialist or
consultative service or hospital (children’s unit) at the secondary or tertiary level. In order to provide
for health care of appropriate quality for children in general, and specifically in case of violence, when
the need of good-quality health care is even greater due to the physical and mental trauma in
children, the health care institution has to fulfil all the conditions prescribed in the Rulebook on the

378/453

Premises, Equipment and Personnel Requirements for Setting up and Operation of Health Care
Organisations.
Every health care worker is obliged in line of duty to identify, register and report to the police any
case of violence against a child, after providing the child with the necessary medical assistance.
Every case of violence has been encoded with the appropriate category of the International Statistical
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems – 10th Revision (ICD-10) and has been
registered in the medical documentation of out-patient polyclinics or hospitals, i.e. in physician’s
report on the causes of death in case of a death, in accordance with the following legal regulations:
Law on Health Care; Law on Keeping Healthcare Records in the Health Care; Programme for
Statistical Healthcare Research; and the Law on State Statistics.
In the healthcare statistics, individual cases of violence need to be recorded in general. In cases of
involvement of children, the following categories have been encoded and registered under ICD-10:
X60-X84 – Intentional self-harm; X85-Y09 – Assault; Y10-Y34 – Event of undetermined intent; Y35Y36 – Legal interventions and operations of war; T74 – Maltreatment syndrome; Y06 – Neglect and
abandonment; Y07 – Other maltreatment syndromes. On the basis of these, collective reports with
aggregate data have been prepared. These reports have been of particular importance for
identification of risk factors and reasons for violence against children, as well as for undertaking
intervention programmes for prevention of violence against children.
Since the adoption of the Law Amending the Criminal Code of the Republic of Macedonia, there have
been 16 criminal cases subject to court decision registered before the basic courts in the country.
43. Is there specific legislative protection for the rights of the elderly?
Article 35 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic
Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) guarantees the right of assistance to
citizens who are infirm or unfit for work. Article 40 of the Constitution determines that children are
responsible for the care of their old and infirm parents.
The rights of the elderly in the Republic of Macedonia have not been regulated by a separate law, but
provisions on the protection of the rights of the elderly are contained in a number of distinctive laws
and regulations.
The elderly are provided social protection in order to overcome social risks they face due to their age
and health. Social protection is also provided if they are financially insecure and without family care,
as stipulated in The Law on Social Care (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” Nos. 50/97,
16/00, 17/03 and 65/04).
The elderly are entitled to rights of institutional and non-institutional protection in the context of the
services and measures of social protection and social work.
Institutional protection encompasses the accommodation in nursing institutions, such as:
− Elderly homes;
− Nursing homes for disabled adult persons;
− Nursing homes for persons with moderate and severe mental disabilities.
The elderly usually utilise the service of accommodation in an elderly home. There are four
institutions for accommodation of the elderly in Kumanovo, Skopje, Prilep and Bitola, with 505
beneficiaries. These institutions provide alimentation, healthcare and cultural and entertainment
activities for the elderly.
The Law on Social Care passed in 1997 enables the operation of the private sector in this domain.
There are three private elderly homes in Macedonia with 120 beneficiaries and the procedure for
their inclusion into the network of public institutions for social protection has not yet started. With the

379/453

Law Amending the Law on Social Care (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 65/04)
the procedure for establishment of elderly homes and including the private sector as an investor and
provider of this type of services has been regulated.
Non-institutional protection encompasses:
− The right to social service through detecting the problem, offering possible solutions and
determining measures of protection;
− The right to home nursing and assistance, which is provided to old and infirm persons that
cannot take care of themselves;
− The right to day care is provided to old and infirm persons through services concerning the
alimentation, day care, culture and entertainment and hygiene maintenance;
− The right to accommodation in a care-giving family.
The practice hitherto has proved that non-institutional protection of the elderly has not been
developed enough. In order to bring these services closer to the elderly and to assist them in
overcoming problems regarding their every day needs, the Law on Social Care has been amended
and has allowed the option to natural persons to carry out home care and assistance services, as
well as the option for the participation of citizens' associations in the establishment of day care
centres for the elderly. With the realisation of such projects, the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy
has been encouraging the process of deinstitutionalisation of this beneficiary category as well as the
pluralism of service providers in the area.
The social protection system provides permanent financial assistance to elderly without financial
security by way of financial benefits to a third person for assistance and care; healthcare if the
persons have not been ensured; as well as one-time financial benefit if the persons are in social
crisis.
Pursuant to the Law on Family, elderly who have been revoked or restricted their civil capacity are
protected by being placed under guardianship with a guardian who can take care of their health,
interests and property.
The Law on Family regulates the obligation for the support of close relatives. The children are
responsible for the care of their parents if they are unfit for work and do not have personal property
and funds to support themselves. If legal-age children do not carry out their responsibility for the
support of their parent(s), the parent’s right is exercised by filing a lawsuit to the competent basic
court. The court, by derogation may refuse the parent’s request for support if he/she had been
revoked his parental right.
44. Does specific legislative protection for the rights of persons with disabilities exist? Are
there measures designed to ensure their independence and social and occupational
integration?
Article 35 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic
Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) determines that the state provides particular
protection for disabled persons, as well as conditions for their inclusion in the social life.
Rights of disabled persons are protected in the national legislation by the following regulations:
− Law on the Protection of Children (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
98/00, 17/03 and 65/04);
− Law on Primary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 44/95,
24/96, 34/96, 35/97, 82/99, 29/02, 40/03 and 42/03).
− Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 44/95,
24/96, 34/96, 35/97, 82/99, 29/2002, 52/02- consolidated text, 40/03, 42/03 and 67/04).
− Law on Higher Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 64/00 and
49/03).

Law on Spatial and Urban Planning (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
04/96, 08/96, 28/97, 18/99 and 53/01).

Rights of disabled persons are also regulated in by-laws:
− Rulebook on Determining Modes of Exercise of the Right to Remuneration for Part Time Work
Due to Nourishment of a Severely Disabled Child (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No.53/98).
− Rulebook on Assessing and Determining Specific Needs of Persons with Physical and Mental
Disabilities (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 30/00).
− Rulebook on Standards and Norms for Spatial Planning and Designing Facilities (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 02/02).
A National Strategy for the Equalisation of Rights of Persons with Disabilities has been adopted in
the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 101/01). This
strategy has been largely based on the UN Resolution - Standard Rules on the Equalisation of
Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities 48/93.
The national strategy encompasses the overall development and specific needs of persons with
disabilities in the area of health and social care, education, rehabilitation and all other segments of
social life, with an emphasis on family and the development of personality, prevention, raising
awareness, rehabilitation, availability of services and accessories, culture, recreation and sports,
religion, information and research, assessment of programmes for persons with disabilities, expert
staff to work with persons with disabilities and international co-operation.
A Coordinative Body for Equalisation of Rights and Opportunities of Persons with Disabilities has
been established to implement the National Strategy. This body comprises representatives of all
ministries that deal with the issue of persons with disabilities, as well as academic institutions and
representatives of national associations of persons with disabilities. The activities of the Coordinative
Body are aimed at: initiating changes in the legislation and by-laws on the rights of persons with
disabilities; proposing initiatives with regard to creating a policy on the protection of rights of disabled
persons, particularly in the area of social and health care; education; employment; coordination of
operations and organisations of persons with disabilities through organising fora, submitting
initiatives, etc.
In accordance with the Law on the Protection of Children, the Republic of Macedonia provides
particular protection for children with physical and mental disabilities (a special financial benefit) from
the state budget. The Law also stipulates that the municipality may provide additional protection.
The Law provides conditions and opportunities for placing such children in kindergartens depending
on the type and level of their disability, with an emphasis on the special attention in admitting
children, adjustment of programmes, additional expert assistance and special programmes, as well
as staff’s expertise.
The Law on Amending the Law on the Protection of Children (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 65/04) prescribes that children with physical and mental disabilities may be placed

381/453

in kindergartens by a finding and opinion of an adequate expert institution. The legislator has
envisioned the option of including children with special needs into focus groups.
Primary education of children with special needs is carried out pursuant to the Law on Primary
Education. The Law stipulates that children with disabilities may acquire primary education in primary
schools, special primary schools, special classes in primary schools and in specialised institutions of
the primary education. Children with long-term illnesses may be educated in special classes that are
opened in hospitals.
Students with special educational needs may also exercise other rights. Such is the right to free
transportation from the home to the school for both the student and his/her parent/guardian. Students
that cannot be offered transportation are offered free accommodation in dormitories and alimentation
or accommodation in foster families. Special schools also offer special education programmes. The
Law envisions individual and group forms and methods of education of students with special needs in
primary education.
A special opportunity is the respective Ministry’s participation in the publication of books in limited
number of printed copies for students in special schools.
Pursuant to the Law Amending the Law on Primary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 63/04) children with physical and mental disabilities are referred to as children with
special educational needs. Article 27 of the Law introduces the descriptive grading which creates
possibilities for the inclusion of children with special educational needs into the primary schools.
The secondary education is performed pursuant to the Law on Secondary Education. The Law
prescribes that the education process may be carried out in a polymorphic mode in a class, groups or
individually. Thus persons with disabilities may exercise their rights. Article 43 of the Law introduces
plans and programmes for secondary education of students with special educational needs. These
students shall be educated in accordance with adjusted programmes for respective occupations or
for job training. Article 51 stipulates that students with special educational needs may be included,
registered and placed in accordance with the type and level of their disability. Secondary education
may be available to a person not older than 25 years of age.
Pursuant to the Law Amending the Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 67/04) children with physical and mental disabilities are referred to as children with
special educational needs (Article 24). The Law also envisages the secondary school graduation
exam in accordance with curricula on respective occupations or educational profiles (Article 30). With
the current changes and decentralisation and pursuant to Article 53, four special secondary schools
shall continue to operate as state secondary schools.
The Law on Higher Education provides a provision regulating the right to education of persons with
disabilities. The Law stipulates: Students, Ph.D. students and specialisation students without parents,
first or second degree visually and hearing impaired persons, mothers with children of up to 6 years
of age and hospitalised persons have a right to special benefits determined by the statute of the
higher education institution.
The state prohibits discrimination against or exclusion of persons with special needs within
regulations covering social security, social assistance and social protection.
Social security and particularly disability insurance has been intended for establishment or recovery
of working abilities of persons with special needs thus they would be able to make their living on the
basis of what they earn. Working abilities are often established or recovered through the system of
vocational training. Certain remunerations may be acquired out of the work on the basis of social
security, in case of illness, disability, etc.
Pursuant to the Law on Employment of Persons with Disabilities the Minister of Labour and Social
Policy has adopted a Rulebook on the Criteria and Modes of Allocation of Funds from the Special

382/453

Fund on Providing Conditions for Employment of Persons with Disabilities, which determines a onetime grant for:
− Full-time employment of a disabled person;
− Job adaptation for the disabled person;
− Procurement of equipment necessary for the employment of the disabled person; and
− Adaptation of premises for the disabled person.
The Law also prescribes funding for vocational training of both unemployed person with disabilities
and employees with disabilities for the purpose of either employing them or placing them to other
posts.
The Law on Employment of Persons with Disabilities also stipulates that pension and disability
insurance funds, health insurance and fees for employment of persons with disabilities shall be
provided from the budget of the Republic of Macedonia. Furthermore, the Law prescribes that
employees at sheltered workshops who are not disabled are exempted from paying personal income
tax and pension, and disability insurances shall be covered by the budget of the Republic of
Macedonia. Sheltered workshops are exempted from paying profit tax and all other fees related to
profit.
The Law also introduces the method of affirmative action in order to equalise the employment
opportunities of persons with disabilities at the open labour market, which essentially enables their
involvement into the open society and the world of labour. Consequently, the current legislation
provides that:
− Legal entity not having a status of a sheltered workshop may receive grants from the Special
Fund to provide full time employment to a person with disabilities as well as adaptation of
workplaces and premises for persons with special needs.
− Sheltered workshops may be granted funds from the Special Fund to provide full-time
employment of a person with disabilities, adaptation of workplaces and premises, and
procurement of necessary equipment for the employment and operation of the disabled
person.
− A person with disabilities who is an independent entrepreneur may be granted funds from the
Special Fund to provide his/her full-time employment, adaptation of workplaces and premises,
and procurement of necessary equipment for the employment and operation of the disabled
person.
A one-time grant of 20 average salaries (as paid in the month prior to the employment) may be
granted for the purpose of employing a disabled person with the following disabilities: visual, hearing,
vocal and language impairment, physical disabilities, mild mental disabilities, combined disabilities,
and psychoses. As regards employment of visually impaired person with over 97% visibility damage
and a physically disabled person with over 90% of disability, an amount of 30 average salaries (as
paid in the month prior to the employment) shall be granted.
Pursuant to the Law on Employment of Persons with Disabilities the employer is entitled to a onetime grant from the Special Fund in order to provide adaptation of premises for persons with
disabilities. Such grants may amount to 30 average salaries in the Republic (as paid in the Republic
prior to the submission of the request). The employer may also be entitled to a grant amounting to 50
average salaries in the Republic for procurement of special equipment intended for persons with
disabilities (in accordance with the number of new employees); and a grant amounting to 50 average
salaries for adaptation of workplaces and premises in order to suit the technological process to the
needs of the disabled person (in accordance with the number of newly employed persons with
disabilities).
The Law on Employment of Persons with Disabilities prescribes that 15% of the total funds realised
from the current employment fee shall be used for employment of persons with disabilities, financing
special employment needs, adaptation of workplaces and premises and procurement of equipment

383/453

and other adaptations. These funds are allocated in a sub-account of the Employment Agency (the
Special Fund). Concurrently, the funds required for vocational training of unemployed and employed
persons with disabilities shall be secured from the Special Fund.
Laws and regulations concerning health insurance provide particular provisions that facilitate the use
of health care by persons with disabilities. Such persons are exempted from health fees on all levels
of healthcare (primary, secondary and tertiary). They are also exempted from paying fees while
acquiring medical accessories, with an exception of particular accessories for which they are required
to pay 10% of their total value.
The state has also undertaken activities for the socialisation and professional integration of persons
with disabilities. The Republic of Macedonia has been implementing a project with the World Health
Organisation on the early intervention and assistance to children born with disabilities or with risks to
their health. This project has been implemented by several ministries. The Ministry of Health, Ministry
of Education and Ministry of Labour and Social Policy have established a network for a prompt
intervention in children with risks as well as for providing assistance to families with disabled children.
Serious efforts have been made to include these children in regular schools as well as to
deinstitutionalise and replace specialised institutions for such children with day care centres and
foster families.
Citizens with physical or mental disabilities are entitled to institutional and non-institutional protection
services, as has been envisaged with the social protection system. Citizens who are unfit for work
and financially insecure are entitled to permanent financial assistance. Persons who are incapable of
taking care of themselves and satisfy their basic necessities of life are entitled to a financial benefit
for a third person assistance and care. These beneficiaries are also entitled to healthcare.
An employed parent is entitled to part-time employment remuneration for nourishment of a disabled
child. This right may be exercised by one of the parents if they are both employed, or by a single
parent of a child not accommodated in an institution. These benefits are paid through the Social Work
Centre.
Another institutional protection is the right to training for working and manufacturing activity and
placement in a social protection institution. The development of the non-institutional care has
contributed to the process of deinstitutionalisation in this area. Pursuant to the Programme of Social
Inclusion of the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy a network of day care centres for disabled
children is being developed. Concurrently, the state has been developing the placement of these
children in foster families and is working on finding ways to support biological parents so that they
would be able to keep their children.
In addition, the state has been establishing a system of rehabilitation institutions. Programmes
developed and implemented in these institutions provide for an optimum level of independence of
children with special needs. Hence, these programmes take into account the type and level of
disability, and based on individual needs they enable their social inclusion and provide for equal
development opportunities.
Rehabilitation programmes provide for acquiring basic skills up to higher education. Rehabilitation
programmes are realised in the beneficiaries’ places of residence. In exceptional cases and within
certain time limits the rehabilitation may take place out of the beneficiary’s place of residence by
accommodating him/her in a dormitory.
The social protection system also provides funding and donations for procuring necessary
accessories to enable the social inclusion of children with special needs particularly in the education
process and professional life as well as for independent and full participation in every day life and
informal groups.
The accessories should either be free or affordable to families of children with special needs. In
addition, while selecting such accessories, special attention should be paid to the child’s gender,

384/453

his/her age and particularities of his/her needs. Hence accessories are adequate to the type and
level of disability.
The state has been securing the inclusion of children with special needs into processes of creative
work and has facilitated their participation in cultural events. All creative artistic and intellectual
capabilities of children with special needs have been realised both for personal purposes and for
creating cultural goods of the community's interest. These persons are entitled to unhindered
attendance of cultural events at theatres, museums, cinemas and libraries.
The invalids from civil war are entitled to a benefit for a third person assistance and care, healthcare,
professional rehabilitation and orthopaedic instrument.
The Law on Physical and Urban Planning stipulates mandatory standards and norms on physical
planning and design of facilities in the course of the preparation of urban plans. These standards
have been laid down in a Rulebook on Standards and Norms on Physical Planning and Design of
Facilities.
The Rulebook prescribes the implementation of special parameters in the course of designing objects
in order to enable unhindered access to persons with disabilities. The Rulebook also regulates the
use of wheelchairs, stairs, ramps, public transportation stations and stops, universal elevator, public
telephone booths, universal electronic installation and signalisation, sports and public facilities, etc.,
in order to provide conditions for accessibility of these persons to public facilities.
45. Please indicate what steps have been taken to implement the European Social Charter
since its ratification by the Republic of Macedonia.
The Republic of Macedonia ratified the European Social Charter and the Protocol amending the
European Social Charter in December 2004 (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
89/04).
By the ratification of the Charter, Republic of Macedonia expressed its commitment to bring itself into
line and to implement in practice the established standards in the area of social insurance and social
protection. In that sense, Macedonia will endeavour to fully align with the standards established in the
Charter, by developing and promoting the standards and rights and by implementing them in
practice.
In accordance with the existing standards set forth in the regulations in the area of social insurance
and social protection, Republic of Macedonia has decided to accept, besides the Part I, the following
Articles of Part II of the Charter:
Article 1: The right to work
Article 2: The right to just conditions of work
Article 5: The right to organise
Article 6: The right to bargain collectively
Article 7: The right of children and young persons to protection, with the exception of Item 5
Article 8: The right of employed women to protection
Article 11: The right to protection of health
Article 12: The right to social security
Article 13: The right to social and medical assistance
Article 15: The right of physically or mentally disabled persons to vocational training,
rehabilitation and social resettlement
Article 17: The right of mothers and children to social and economic protection
Domestic regulations are considered to be to a large extent in line with the Charter in the areas
covered by the aforementioned Articles.

385/453

Bearing in mind the ongoing continuous process of reforms in social insurance and social protection
– such as the regulations in labour legislation, health insurance legislation; pension and disability
insurance, social protection, protection at work and other regulation - it has been envisaged that if
non-compliance with the Charter is determined, appropriate amendments will be made to the existing
regulations or new ones will be adopted to ensure their harmonisation with the Charter’s standards. A
number of laws have already been harmonized with the EU legislation. In the course of adoption,
special emphasis was given to fundamental values determined in the Charter and to the compliance
of the new regulation therewith.

2. What is the legal status of religious and ethnic minorities living in the Republic of
Macedonia?
The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia” Nos.
52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) regulates the rights of the members of communities and religious
groups on two levels: the first one is through the principle of equality of all citizens before the Constitution
and the laws, and the other one is through the prohibition of all forms of discrimination. The first principle
has been clearly defined in Article 9 of the Constitution. This level as a primary value and a basis of the
democratic and liberal society secures the protection of individual rights of every citizen of the Republic of
Macedonia. The second level represents a system of special rights of the members belonging to the
ethnic communities and religious groups. It provides for protection of and guarantees to the right to
cultural identity of all citizens of the Republic of Macedonia as well as the equality of distinctive cultural
communities as groups.
The second level of constitutional guarantees, further on developed through the relevant legal norms,
secures the rights of every citizen to self-identification and to self-definition in a cultural sense as well as
the right to fair opportunities for promotion of the cultural diversity and distinctiveness of the various ethnic
communities. This second group of norms has been defined in Article 48 of the Constitution.
Legal status of religious groups
According to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonian:
The freedom of religious confession is guaranteed.
The right to express one's faith freely and publicly, individually or with others, is guaranteed.
The Macedonian Orthodox Church, as well as the Islamic Religious Community in Macedonia, the
Catholic Church, the Evangelical Methodist Church, the Jewish Community and other Religious
communities and groups are separate from the state and are equal before the law.
The Macedonian Orthodox Church, as well as the Islamic Religious Community in Macedonia, the
Catholic Church, the Evangelical Methodist Church, the Jewish Community and other Religious
communities and groups are free to establish schools and other social and charitable institutions,
under a procedure regulated by law.
The position of the religious groups, their establishment, practices, religious instruction and their
religious schools as a mode of exercise of the rights to religion and to religious confession have
been further regulated with the Law on Religious Communities and Groups (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 35/97).
The religious communities or groups are free to exercise their religious ceremonies and customs
(Article 2). They perform their activities in accordance with the Constitution, laws and other
regulations (Article 3, paragraph 2).
A foreign citizen may perform religious practices and customs upon a request of a religious
community or group, upon prior consent by the competent body for religious issues (Article 5).
Religious communities and groups may establish religious schools in a procedure and under
conditions determined by the aforementioned law. In addition, they may establish social and
humanitarian institutions in a procedure and under conditions specified by law (Article 7).
Religious communities and groups as well as their organisational forms register at the Commission
for Relations with Religious Communities and Groups (Article 11, paragraph 1).

387/453

The seat of religious communities and groups, which perform religious practices and customs within
the territory of the Republic of Macedonia has to be in the Republic of Macedonia (Article 12,
paragraph 4).
Within their operations pursuant to the aforementioned Law the religious communities and groups
may use media and publish printed matters (Article 15, paragraph 1).
They also may collect donations for religious and humanitarian aims. Such donations may be
collected in the facilities where religious practices and customs take place (Article 16).
Religious ceremonies and other religious practices may take place in churches, mosques and other
temples, as well as in backyards belonging to these facilities. They may also take place in cemeteries
and other facilities of the religious community or group (Article 18, paragraph 1).
Religious ceremonies and practices carried out in private homes (family celebrations, marriage,
baptism, circumcision, confession, blessings of properties, etc.) do not require special approvals
(Article 20, paragraph 1).
Persons in hospitals, elderly homes and other such institutions may express their faith and may be
visited by priests in order to perform religious ceremonies and practices. This must be done in
accordance with the household order of the institution that accommodates them (Article 20,
paragraph 3).
Religious communities and groups, pursuant to the aforementioned Law, may possess and acquire
real estate and other matters necessary for their activities (Article 22, paragraph 1).
Religious instruction may be given only in public facilities where religious ceremonies and practices
take place (Article 21, paragraph 1).
For the purpose of educating clerics, religious communities and groups have a right to establish
religious schools at all education levels, except in the primary education. They may also establish
student dormitories for the persons attending these institutions (Article 25, paragraph 1).
Legal status of the members of non-majority ethnic communities
The legal framework of the ethnic communities’ position has been regulated by the Constitution of the
Republic of Macedonia pursuant to which respective laws regulating and elaborating the rights of
communities’ members have been adopted.
Article 7 of the Constitution regulates the use of languages of the members of non-majority communities:
“The official language on the whole territory of the Republic of Macedonia and in its international
relations is the Macedonian language, written using its Cyrillic alphabet.
Any other language spoken by at least 20 percent of the citizens is also an official language, written
using its alphabet, as specified in this article.
Official personal documents of citizens speaking an official language other than Macedonian shall be
issued in the Macedonian language, as well as in that language in accordance with the law.
Any citizen living in a unit of local self-government in which at least 20 percent of the citizens speak
an official language other than Macedonian may use any of the official languages and their alphabets
in communication with the local office of the central government. The local offices with competencies
in these units of local self-government shall reply in the Macedonian language and its Cyrillic
alphabet, as well as in the official language and alphabet used by the citizen. Any citizen may use
any official language and its alphabet to communicate with Ministries, which shall reply in the

388/453

Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet, as well as in the official language and alphabet used
by the citizen.
In the bodies of the Republic of Macedonia, any official language other than Macedonian may be
used in accordance with the law.”
Furthermore, in the units of local self-government, the language and the alphabet used by at least 20
percent of the citizens of the municipality is also an official language in that municipality, in addition to the
Macedonian language and the Cyrillic alphabet. The bodies of the units of local self-government decide
on the use of the languages and alphabets spoken by less than 20% of the citizens in that unit of local
self-government.
Pursuant to this Law, provisions regarding the use of an official language other than Macedonian and its
Cyrillic alphabet have been incorporated in laws regulating the issues of personal documents (such as
identification card, passports, certificates), civil, criminal and administrative procedures, the publication of
the laws in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia, as well as the laws regulating the
employment in public institutions, enterprises and other legal entities rendering public services, state and
municipal bodies and the City of Skopje.
Rights of the members of communities are also guaranteed with Article 8, paragraph 1, subparagraph 2
of the Constitution, which refers to the principle of equitable representation of members of all communities
regarding the employment in state administrative bodies and other public institutions on all levels. This
principle has already been implemented in the Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00, 112/00, 34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04 and 69/04), the
Law on Labour Relations (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 80/93, 3/94, 14/95, 53/97,
59/97, 21/98, 25/00, 34/00, 50,01, 25/03 40/03 and 80/03 consolidated text) and the Law on Public
Enterprises (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 38/96, 9/97, 6/02 and 40/03).
The Framework Agreement determines the timetable and the forms for accelerated training and
recruitment of members of the ethnic communities in the state administration. This process has been
especially highlighted in the police and military. Some recruitment has already been completed while
some are still under way. For more details see I_J_4 and I_J_7. In comparison with the situation of the
previous years, the results are quite positive. In particular cases, there are dramatic improvements.
However, the process is still under way. Additional improvements in distinct areas are necessary in the
representation of the members of the Albanian and Roma ethnic communities.
Article 9 of the Constitution determines that citizens of the Republic of Macedonia are equal in their
freedoms and rights, regardless of gender, race, colour of skin, ethnic or social origin, political and
religious beliefs, property and social status. It means that all citizens are equal before the Constitution
and law.
The Members of communities are also entitled to the free expression, fostering and development of their
identity and community attributes. They may also use the symbols of their communities. The state
guarantees protection of the ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity of all communities (Article 48
of the Constitution).
The members of communities have a right to found cultural, artistic and educational institutions, as well as
scientific and other associations for the expression, fostering and development of their identity. As
regards education, the members of the communities have the right to instruction in their language in
primary and secondary education in a mode determined by law. In schools where education is carried out
in another language, the Macedonian language is also studied (Article 48 of the Constitution).
Pursuant to this Article, separate laws on primary, secondary and higher education have been
adopted. Primary and secondary education instruction in the Republic of Macedonia is carried out in
the Macedonian, Albanian, Turkish and in the Serbian languages and there are optional classes for
studying the Vlach and the Roma languages. State-funded higher education is available also in

389/453

Albanian and certain curriculums in Turkish. For more details see the answer to question I_J_9 and
I_J_16.
The Constitution guarantees the protection, promotion and enhancement of the historical and artistic
heritage of Macedonia and all communities in Macedonia and the treasures of which it is composed,
regardless of their legal status (Article 56, paragraph 2).
Pursuant to provisions in Articles 9, 48 and 56 of the Constitution, laws regulating the rights of members
of communities in the area of culture and the protection of cultural heritage contain provisions that directly
relate to the protection and promotion of culture and cultural heritage of the members of the communities
in the Republic of Macedonia.
When adopting laws that directly affect culture, use of language, education, personal documentation, and
use of symbols, the Assembly makes decisions by a majority vote of the Representatives attending,
within which there must be a majority of the votes of the Representatives attending who belong to nonmajority communities (Article 69). Article 69 also applies during the adoption of local self-government
laws, as well as laws on local finances, local elections, municipal boundaries and the City of Skopje
(Article 114, paragraph 5). This Constitutional provision (frequently referred to as Badinter rule) has also
been implemented through the Assembly’s Rules of Procedure. Any dispute regarding the application of
this provision within the Assembly, shall be resolved by the Committee on Inter-Community Relations.
According to Article 77 of the Constitution, the Assembly elects the Ombudsman by a majority vote of the
total number of Representatives, within which there must be a majority of the votes of the total number of
Representatives belonging to the communities not in the majority in the Republic of Macedonia. The
Ombudsman protects the constitutional and legal rights of the citizens when bodies of state administration
and other bodies and organisations with public mandates violate them. This provision emphasises that
the Ombudsman shall give particular attention to safeguarding the principles of non-discrimination and
equitable representation of communities in public bodies at all levels and in other areas of public life (this
principle has also been incorporated into the Law on the Ombudsman (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 60/03).
The Committee on Inter-Community Relations has been established with Article 78 of the Constitution.
This Article also determines its composition and competence. The Committee consists of 19 members of
whom 7 members each are from the ranks of the Macedonians and Albanians within the Assembly, and a
member each from among the Turks, Vlachs, Roma, Serbs and Bosniaks. If any of the communities does
not have representatives, the Ombudsman, after consultation with relevant representatives of those
communities, shall propose the remaining members of the Committee. The Assembly appoints the
members of the Committee. The Committee considers issues of inter-community relations in the Republic
and makes appraisals and proposals for their solution. The Assembly is obliged to take into consideration
the appraisals and proposals of the Committee and to make decisions regarding them. In the event of a
dispute among members of the Assembly regarding the application of the voting procedure specified in
Article 69(2), the Committee shall decide by a majority vote whether the procedure applies.
Article 86, paragraph 2 determines that in appointing the three members, the President shall ensure that
the Security Council as a whole equitably reflects the composition of the citizenship body of the Republic
of Macedonia.
The legal and constitutional guarantees of the rights of members of communities in the Republic of
Macedonia have also been expressed in Article 104, paragraph 2 of the Constitution pursuant to which
three of the members of the Judicial Council of the Republic shall be appointed by a majority vote of the
total number of Representatives, within which there must be a majority of the votes of the total number of
Representatives who belong to the communities not in the majority in the Republic of Macedonia.
Same voting principle (Article 69 of the Constitution) applies during the appointment of three judges of the
Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (Article 109, paragraph 2).

390/453

Article 131, paragraph 4 determines that a decision to amend the Preamble, the articles on local selfgovernment, and any provision relating to the rights of members of communities, including in particular
issues on the language use of members of communities; equitable representation of members of
communities; equality of all citizens before the Constitution and laws in freedoms and rights; freedom of
religious confession and conviction; fostering and enhancement of the identity of community members;
protection, promotion and enhancement of the historical and artistic heritage of Macedonia and all
communities; voting in the Assembly on legal acts addressing issues of community members not in the
majority in the Republic of Macedonia (language, education, personal documents, use of symbols);
voting on the Ombudsman and his/her competences regarding the principle of non-discrimination and
equitable representation of members of communities at all levels; the composition of the Committee on
Inter-Community Relations and its competence; the appointment of three members of the Judicial Council
of the Republic and the appointment of three judges of the Constitutional Court of Macedonia, as well as
a decision to add any new provision relating to the subject-matter of such provisions and articles, shall
require a two-thirds majority vote of the total number of Representatives, within which there must be a
majority of the votes of the total number of Representatives who belong to the communities not in the
majority in the Republic of Macedonia.
In addition to the foregoing Constitutional provisions on the legal status of members of ethnic
communities and religious groups, Articles 8 and 118 of the Constitution secure the full implementation of
international instruments in this area, which are directly applicable in the national law. Given that
Macedonia has signed and ratified all significant international universal and regional human and minority
rights instruments (except the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which is in
procedure of ratification), it is safe to conclude that Macedonia belongs to the small group of states in
Europe that provides the highest legal protection of the rights of the members of the ethnic communities
and religious groups.
3. How is the principle of non-discrimination and equal treatment of minorities ensured?
Please provide details of both constitutional and legislative provisions.
1. The strategic determination of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia is the full exercise of
the constitutionally guaranteed rights of the members of communities. At the same time, the Republic
of Macedonia is undoubtedly determined to consistently adhere to all principles, values and
standards contained in the relevant documents in this field, and, in particular in: the Framework
Convention on the Protection of National Minorities; the Convention for the Protection of Human
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (Protocol 12); the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights;
the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious or Linguistic
Minorities; the Helsinki Final Act of CSCE, the Copenhagen Final Act and the Charter of Paris; the
International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination; the European
Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The principle of non-discrimination is incorporated in the
legal order of the Republic of Macedonia. The equality of the members of the communities arises
from Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, which establishes the principle of
non-discrimination stipulating that: citizens of the Republic of Macedonia are equal in their freedoms
and rights, regardless of sex, race, colour of skin, ethnic and social origin, political and religious
beliefs, property and social status. All citizens are equal before the Constitution and law.
In Article 50 paragraph 1, the Constitution provides for equal protection of all citizens stipulating that
every citizen may invoke the protection of freedoms and rights determined by the Constitution before
the regular courts and the Constitutional Court of Macedonia, through a procedure based upon the
principles of priority and urgency. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 54 paragraph 4 of the
Constitution, the restriction of freedoms and rights cannot discriminate on grounds of gender, race,
colour of skin, language, religion, national or social origin, property or social status. In accordance
with Article 110 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, the Constitutional Court protects
the freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen against discrimination on these grounds.
The constitutional provisions for equality of all before law and for the equal right to protection of
citizens’ rights are implemented in the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the Republic of

391/453

Macedonia”, Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/03). In accordance with Article 7 of this Law, every citizen is
entitled to equal access to the courts for the protection of their rights and legal interests.
The anti-discriminatory principle upon appointment of judges is contained in the Law on Courts, as
well as in the amendments of this Law adopted in 2003, implementing the provisions of the Ohrid
Framework Agreement. Article 40 of this Law stipulates that when selecting judges and lay judges
there must not be discrimination on the grounds of sex, race, colour of skin, ethnic or social origin,
political and religious beliefs, property or social status. The selection of judges and lay judges without
violating the legally prescribed criteria will ensure equitable representation of the citizens who belong
to all communities. A similar provision is also contained in the Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04), which specifies that when appointing
public prosecutors and deputy public prosecutors, without violating the criteria established with this
Law, the principle of equitable representation of citizens belonging to all communities in the Republic
of Macedonia will be applied.
Pursuant to Article 4 of the Law on Execution of Sanctions (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 3/97, 23/99 and 74/04) the rules for executing sanctions are applied impartially.
Namely, discrimination on the grounds of race, colour of skin, sex, language, religion, political and
other beliefs, ethnic or social origin, family relations, property or social or another status of the person
subject to the sanction, is forbidden.
In addition, in accordance with Article 8 of the Law on Organisation and Operation of the Public
Administrative Bodies (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 58/00 and 44/02), public
administrative bodies are obliged to provide citizens with an efficient and legal exercise of their
constitutional freedoms and rights.
2. In addition to these constitutional and legal provisions that guarantee the right to nondiscrimination, the legislation of the Republic of Macedonia contains a legal framework for effective
equality of the members of communities, based on the protection of their ethnic, cultural and religious
identity.
According to Article 48 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia:
Members of communities have the right freely to express, foster and develop their identity and
community attributes, and to use their community symbols.
The Republic guarantees the protection of the ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity of all
communities.
Members of communities have the right to establish institutions for culture, art, education, as well as
science and other associations for the expression, fostering and development of their identity.
Members of communities have the right to instruction in their language in primary and secondary
education, as determined by law. In schools where education is carried out in another language, the
Macedonian language is also studied.
The constitutional provision of Article 48 is made operational through the provisions of the following
laws:
a) The Law on Culture (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 31/98, 49/03 and
66/03) regulates the establishment and operation of cultural institutions of members of
communities as one of the forms of expressing and fostering the identity of community
attributes In the Republic of Macedonia there is a long tradition of various cultural institutions
of the communities.
b) Article 45 paragraph 2 of the Law on Broadcasting (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 20/97 and 70/03) provides for an obligation for the public broadcasting
company that broadcasts programmes within the territory of the Republic of Macedonia

392/453

(Macedonian Radio-Television) to broadcast programmes in the languages of the
communities in addition to broadcasting programmes in Macedonian.
Furthermore, Article 45 paragraph 3 of the Law on Broadcasting, regulates that public
broadcasting companies operating locally in areas where the members of communities are a
majority, i.e. live in significant numbers, must also broadcast programmes in the language of
the respective community. Article 45 paragraph 4 of the Broadcasting Law also stipulates the
right of commercial broadcasting organisations (trade broadcasting companies) to broadcast
programmes in languages of the members of the communities in addition to the programmes
broadcasted in Macedonian.
c) Article 4 paragraph 3 of the Law on Religious Communities and Religious Groups (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 35/97) indicates that a citizen cannot be deprived
of their constitutional and legal rights due to religious beliefs, belonging to a religious
community or religious group, carrying out or taking part in religious practices and other forms
of expressing faith.
d) Article 8 of the Law on Primary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
Nos. 44/95, 24/96, 34/96, 35/97, 82/99, 29/02, 52/02- consolidated text, 40/03, 42/03, 63/04
and 82/04) states that for the members of communities who have instruction in a language
other than Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet, the pedagogic and education work is
performed in the language and script of the respective community in the way determined with
this law. The members of the communities that are taught in the language of a community
must also study the Macedonian language. According to Article 82 of the same Law, for the
students who are members of the communities that follow instructions in a language other
than Macedonian, the pedagogy records are kept and issued in the Macedonian language
and its Cyrillic alphabet and in the language and alphabet of instruction;
The Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
44/95, 24/96, 34/96, 35/97, 82/99, 29/2002, 52/02- consolidated text, 40/03, 42/03, 67/04)
stipulates in Article 3 that every citizen has a right to secondary education under equal
conditions established with this Law;
According to Article 6 of the Law on Higher Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 64/00 and 49/03), citizens of the Republic of Macedonia have the right to
education in the higher education institutions of the Republic of Macedonia under equal
conditions.
e) The Ministry of the Interior, inter alia, is obliged to protect human and citizen’s freedoms and
rights guaranteed by the Constitution and to prevent the spread of ethnic, racial or religious
intolerance;
f) The Law on Associations of Citizens and Foundations (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 31/98) in Article 23 stipulates that the activities of a citizen association will
be prohibited if they infringe upon the human rights and freedoms guaranteed by the
Constitution or if they encourage ethnic, racial or religious hatred and intolerance;
g) The Law on Telecommunications (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
33/96, 17/98, 22/98 – consolidated text, 28/00, 04/02 and 37/04) explicitly prohibits the
transmission and delivery of messages encouraging ethnic, racial or religious hatred and
intolerance.
h) In Accordance with Article 3 of the Law on Inheritance (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 47/96), the citizens, under equal conditions are equal in inheritance.
3. The right to use the languages of the communities is exercised in the following ways:
-

In private life, in free use of one’s own language in everyday communication, in the family,
etc.;
In official records - when issuing personal documents; the personal documents of the citizens
who speak an official language other than Macedonian are issued in the Macedonian
language and alphabet, as well as in the official language and the alphabet used by these

393/453

citizens; Additionally, upon request of citizens who belong other non-majority communities
(below 20%), the personal data in the passport is written in the Macedonian language and
alphabet, as well as in the language and the alphabet used by these citizens;
- The right to instruction in their mother tongue in the primary and the secondary education;
- The right to use the languages of the communities in the local self-government units; in local
self-government units a language and alphabet used by at least 20% of the citizens is also an

unit is decided upon the bodies of the local self-government units; this constitutional
regulations is identically provided in the Law on Local Self-Government (“Official Gazette of
the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 5/02);
- The right to use the languages of the communities in the communication with the Ministries

- The right to use the languages of the communities in court proceedings;
- The right to use the languages of the communities in plenary sessions of the Assembly of the
Republic of Macedonia;
- The right to use the languages of the communities when publishing laws and other

Republic of Macedonia has adopted a Law Amending the Law on Publishing Laws and Other
Regulations in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 43/02). Article 8 paragraph 2 of the Law stipulates that the laws
are also published in another official language and alphabet used by at least 20% of the
citizens belonging to the communities in the Republic of Macedonia.
More on the exercise of the right to use the languages of the communities in I_J_9, I_J_12, I_J_13,
I_J_14, I_J_15, I_J_16.
4. The acts of violating the prohibition of discrimination are incriminated as criminal offences
contained in the Criminal Code of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 37/96, 80/99, 4/02, 43/03 and 19/04): Article 137 – Violation of citizen equality,
Article 319 – Causing ethnic, racial and religious hatred, division and intolerance and Article 417 –

associations of citizens and political parties cannot be used, inter alia, for encouraging ethnic, racial
or religious hatred or intolerance. This constitutional provision is furthermore contained in the Law on
Political Parties (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 76/04) and the Law on
Associations of Citizens and Foundations (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
31/98) according to which the competent body will not register a political party or an association of
citizens if their activity is contrary to the constitutional prohibition. The violation of the constitutional
prohibition is a reason to prohibit the operation of an already established political party or citizen
association.
6. Item 4 of the Framework Agreement, devoted to non-discrimination and equitable representation,
expresses the determination for full respect of the principle of non-discrimination and equal treatment
of all persons before law. This principle is especially applied with regard to the employment in the
public administration and in public enterprises, as well as with regard to the access to public
information about the development of business activities. On the implementation of constitutional
provisions and the provisions of the Framework Agreement on equitable representation of the
members of communities in the state administrative bodies and other public institutions, for more

antidiscrimination became significant. According to Amendment XI of the Constitution: The
Ombudsman shall give particular attention to safeguarding the principles of non-discrimination and
equitable representation of communities in state administrative bodies, local self-government units
and in public services. On the implementation of these constitutional provisions, for more details see
I_G_6 and I_J_18.
4. In the context of the implementation of the Framework Agreement, what measures have
been taken to assure equitable representation of communities at central and local level and at
all levels within administrative bodies? Please provide statistics if available.
With regard to specific articles e.g. principles of the Framework Agreement and aiming at more
efficient and accelerated implementation of the Framework Agreement, the Government of the
Republic of Macedonia established special bodies for coordination and monitoring of the activities
and the achieved specific objectives.
In relation to the point Non-Discrimination and Equitable Representation of Members of Non-Majority
Communities the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, established bodies entrusted with
coordination and monitoring of the improvement of equitable representation of members of underrepresented non-majority communities in the public administration and public enterprises. These are
the following:
-

-

Committee of Ministers in charge of monitoring and coordination of the activities aimed at the
improvement of equitable representation of members of non-majority communities in the
public administration and public enterprises (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
No. 09/03). The Committee is chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister responsible for the
implementation of the Framework Agreement and it comprises of the Minister of Justice,
Minister of the Interior, Minister of Finance and the Minister of Labour and Social Policy.
Coordination Body for the Preparation of an Operational Programme for Improvement of
Equitable Representation of Members of Non-majority Communities in Public Administration
and Public Enterprises (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia, Nos. 9/03, 11/03 and
15/03). The Director of the Civil Servants Agency chairs the Coordination Body, while its
members are the Deputy Director of the Civil Servants Agency, the Deputy Secretary General
of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and state counsellors from the following 11
ministries: Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Local Selfgovernment, Ministry of Transport and Communications, Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of
Defence, Ministry of Education and Science, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Labour and Social
Policy and Ministry of Health.

More about the coordination of the implementation of the Framework Agreement in the answer to the
question I_C_15.
In the first period of the implementation of the Framework Agreement, the main focus was placed on
improving the equitable representation in the police and the Army of the Republic of Macedonia.
Those provisions of the Framework Agreement were fully implemented. For more detailed
information on the representation of the ethnic communities in the security forces, see the answers to
the questions I_F_3 and I_J_7.
Following the improvement of the equitable representation in the security forces, the focus was
placed on equitable representation in the administration and public enterprises. In February 2003 the
Government of the Republic of Macedonia adopted a Basis for Preparation of a Programme for
Improvement of Equitable Representation of Communities in the Public Administration and in Public
Enterprises. In April 2003 additional measures were adopted for the improvement of equitable
representation of communities in the public administration and public enterprises concerning the
strengthening of translation capacities, the opening of bilingual jobs, the analysis of the vacant jobs
within the administration and the preparatory training programmes for work in the public
administration, as well as public communication activities.

395/453

As a part of the additional measures, a training programme for 600 candidates belonging to the
communities for jobs in the state administrative bodies (PACE programme) was set up. The first
group of candidates were employed in December 2004 and January 2005, and the second group will
be fully employed by February 2005.
The training of 100 translators/interpreters belonging to the non-majority communities in the Republic
of Macedonia will begin on 1 March 2005. Upon completion of the training programme, carried out
within the framework of a 2004 CARDS project, the chosen candidates will be employed in the state
administrative bodies and courts and will be obliged to work in those bodies for at least two years
following the completion of the training programme.
Article 2 of the Law Amending the Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic
Macedonia”, No. 40/03) establishes an obligation for adoption of Annual Plans for Equitable
Representation of Communities. The annual plans elaborate the current situation in the bodies
(number and percentage of the members of communities in the total number of employees,
presented for both the employees with status of civil servants and other employees in the said
bodies), the employment plans, professional development and training programmes, as well as an
assessment of the fiscal implications concerning the aforementioned activities. This means that, in
addition to the constitutional principle of equal access to jobs and the merit principle, the principle of
equitable representation of citizens belonging to all communities, at all positions defined by the Law
on Civil Servants, is applied in the recruitment of civil servants, without prejudice to the criteria of
expertise and competence (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 59/00, 112/00,
34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04 and 69/04). The public announcements for
employment of civil servants are published by the Civil Servant Agency (CSA) in at least two daily
newspapers, one of which published in the language spoken by at least 20% of the citizens who
speak an official language other than the Macedonian. For more details see I_C_6.
For the successful implementation of the principle of equitable representation, several laws have
been amended, including the Law on Labour Relations (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 80/93, 03/94, 14/95, 53/97, 59/97, 21/98, 25/00, 34/00, 50/01, 25/03, 40/03 and
80/03 - consolidated text), the Law on Public Enterprises (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 40/03), the Law on Primary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 63/04), the Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 67/04), the Law on Pupils’ and Students’ Standards (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 40/03), the Law on the Public Attorney (“Official Gazette of the Republic
of Macedonia”, No. 60/03), the Law on Courts (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
64/03), and the Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 69/04).

5. What measures have been taken to ensure proper budgetary allocations to meet equitable
representation objectives? Please specify the budgets allocated for this purpose since 2001.
The budgetary allocations to meet equitable representation objectives is provided entirely from the
State Budget of the Republic of Macedonia in two ways, through:
- The funding allocated for the implementation of the Strategic Priorities of the Government and
- Within items for budget beneficiaries covering salaries and allowances of the employees.
Appropriate allocations were made in 2002 and 2003 in the budgets of the Ministry of Defence and
the Ministry of the Interior, covering the costs resulting from obligations laid down by the Framework
Agreement concerning equitable representation of communities in the security forces. For more
details see I_J_7.
In the 2004 Budget, funds were allocated for the Strategic Priorities of the Government of the
Republic of Macedonia, covering the costs of the following:
- Employment of 600 civil servants trained within the framework of the PACE programme, a
part of CARDS for 2002;
- Employment of civil servants in various state administrative bodies at different levels
(including managerial staff).
The 2005 Budget envisages that state administrative bodies (except the Ministry of the Interior and
the Ministry of Defence, for more details see I_J_7), are to cover the costs of the employment from
their own budgets for the following:
- Translators/interpreters for state bodies and courts;
- Civil servants at different levels; and
- Salaries of those previously employed in order to meet the requirement of equitable
representation (which are already included in their own budgets).
All vacant positions created by retirement, resignation or dismissal will be adequately filled so that the
principle of equitable representation is met.
Gross salaries are paid from the State Budget of the Republic of Macedonia to employees having a
status of civil servants as well as to employees in the public administration. The amounts paid for
gross salaries by ethnic affiliation of employees are given in Table 1 (the data includes the
employees in the Army of the Republic of Macedonia and Ministry of the Interior)

398/453

In 2001 and 2002 the data on the number of employees and payment of salaries in the public
administration have not been processed in the Ministry of Finance and hence data for these years is
not available.

which has been shown as a budgetary expense in the table.
In order to achieve equitable representation of community members in the Ministry of Defence,
salaries and allowances and the costs of training of the newly-employed persons have been planned
and allocated in the State Budget.

7. What programmes have been established in order to achieve equitable representation of all
communities at all levels of the security forces, what is their stage of implementation and
what are the plans for the future in this respect? Please specify the budgets allocated for this
purpose since 2001.
In the Ministry of the Interior, the basis for the improvement of equitable representation of members
belonging to communities are the Constitutional Amandements, the existing legislation in the area of
internal affairs: the Law on Internal Affairs (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
19/95, 55/97, 38/02, 33/03 and 19/04), the Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00, 112/00, 34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04 and 69/04)
and the adequate provisions of the Framework Agreement.
To achieve the full implementation of the provisions of the Ohrid Framework Agreement and to
comply with the constitutional amendments and the constitutional principle of equitable
representation of non-majority communities in state administrative bodies, the Ministry of the Interior
has accelerated the process of employment of members belonging to non-majority communities in
the Republic of Macedonia, principally through the use of public announcements for the admission of
trainee police officers and for the admission of persons with the status of civil servants belonging to
communities, as well as through the employment of persons for operational positions within the
departments of the Ministry of the Interior.
The admission process for trainee police officers has been supported and implemented with the
assistance of the international community, particularly through the testing, selection and training of
candidates at the Skopje Police Academy. The Ministry of the Interior has made modifications to its
Rulebook on Systematisation of Posts, introducing bilingual positions.
The ethnic breakdown of those employed in the Ministry of the Interior by position and rank, from
2001 to 2004, are given in the Table 1:

Note: Increase of total number of employees in the Ministry of the Interior is due to the transfer of
employees from the Ministry of Defence into Border Police
A total of 84 persons with the status of civil servants belonging to the Albanian community will be
employed in the Ministry of the Interior in 2005, in accordance with the government project for
equitable representation (PACE) financed by CARDS 2002. A total of 574 persons will be transferred
from the Ministry of Defence, of which 165 are members of the Albanian community. Given that at the
moment there is no information what positions these persons will occupy at the Ministry of the
Interior, it is impossible to show them in a table by rank and position. Together with the
aforementioned new employment and transfers, in 2005 the Ministry of the Interior will have 13.120

404/453

employees, of which 1.908 will be members of the Albanian community, i.e. the Albanian community
will be represented with 14,5%.
A total of MKD 796.227.132 from the State Budget has been spent on the salaries, allowances,
personal equipment and education of the newly employed in the police forces since 2001 to the
present day for the employment of members of communities in accordance with the provisions of the
Framework Agreement.

With regard to the Ministry of Defence, the basis for the development of plans and programmes to
achieve equitable representation of members belonging to communities is the existing legislation in
the area of defence (the Law on Defence (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
42/01 and 5/03), the Law on Military Service in the Army of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 2/02, 98/02, 25/03 and 71/03), the Law on Civil
Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00,112/00, 34/01, 103/01, 43/02,
98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04 and 69/04)), as well as the National Security and Defence Concept,
the Strategic Defence Review of the Republic of Macedonia (First, Second and Third Stages), and
the provisions of the Framework Agreement.
The programme for the implementation of the Strategic Defence Review of the Republic of
Macedonia was endorsed by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (No. 23-3084/1 of 23
June 2003), while the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia adopted it through a Resolution for
Development and Transformation on 26.05.2004 (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
No. 34/04). The Strategic Defence Review represents the starting point in the development of the
policy of equitable representation of members of non-majority communities in the Ministry of Defence
and in the Army of the Republic of Macedonia. The Strategic Defence Review contains provisions
concerning the equitable representation of members of these communities in the Ministry of Defence
and in the Army of the Republic of Macedonia (ARM). The Second Stage of the Strategic Defence

405/453

Review contains proposed plans for staffing and a plan for increasing the percentage of members of
communities in the total staff levels of the Ministry and of the Army of the Republic of Macedonia in
the period 2004-2013. The Third Stage of the Strategic Defence Review — the Programme for the
Transformation of Defence and the ARM — contains similar provisions in the chapter entitled Staff,
Situation and Projections. On 25.08.2004, in accordance with the Strategic Defence Review, the
Minister of Defence adopted a Strategy on Human Resource Management in the Ministry of Defence
as well as an Operational Plan and Methodology for the preparation of programmes concerning the
implementation of the Strategy on Human Resource Management. The policy of equitable
representation of non-majority communities is one of the twenty policies established by this Strategy.
The objectives set forth by the policy of equitable representation of members belonging to
communities are planned to be achieved in the period 2004-2007 for the staff having secondary
education, and by the year 2013 for the staff having higher education. Within the framework of these
activities and in accordance with the Law on Civil Servants, the following plans were developed: the
Annual Plan on Equitable Representation of Communities in the Ministry of Defence for 2004
(passed on 31.03.2004), and the Annual Plan on Equitable Representation of Communities in the
Ministry of Defence for 2005 (passed on 31.08.2004).

Ministry of Defence. The total amount of budget expenditures for new employment of representatives
of communities (achievement of equitable representation) for the period of 2002–2004 is
288.475.000 MKD.
8. What measures have been taken in relation to the use of flags and community symbols?
One of the accepted frameworks in the Ohrid Framework Agreement is the “expression of identity”,
which envisions the use of symbols that mark the community’s identity.
Pursuant to this principle and the Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia in
2001, Amendment VIII pertaining to Article 48 (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
91/01): Members of communities have the right freely to express, foster and develop their identity
and community attributes, and to use their community symbols; The Republic guarantees the
protection of the ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity of all communities.
In order to implement this constitutional provision on symbols marking the community’s identity, a
Law on Use of Symbols of Members of Communities shall be prepared and is to be adopted in the
first half of 2005.
9. What proportion of university students belongs to national minorities? Do enrolment
procedures at State universities include rules or programmes that encourage the enrolment of
candidates belonging to non-majority communities, and how is this implemented?
The ethnic breakdown of students in the Republic of Macedonia does not fully correspond with the
ethnic structure of the population.
Consequently, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia has been implementing policies in
order to increase the percentage of students who are members of ethnic communities not in the
majority population of Macedonia. As of 1994 the Government sets a separate (additional) quota for
government funding of higher education of students belonging to non-majority communities
depending on their proportion in the total population (for example if 1000 are to be enrolled under
state funding, in addition to this 1000 student quota, 230 Albanians could additionally be enrolled
under state funding, since at that time the percentage of Albanians was 22.6%). This instrument of
affirmative action has to a certain extent improved the representation of students members of ethnic
communities after 1994 (for instance the representation of members of the Albanian ethnic
community has increased from 2,23% in 1992/93 to 5.7% in 2000/01).
As this increase has not been sufficient the Government introduced additional measures. Thus in
1998 the Government defined a new category of students at state universities who individually pay
the costs, which in turn provided for an additional increase of the total number of students, including
those who do not belong to the majority population in the Republic of Macedonia. This intervention
may, however, be noted only through an analysis of the absolute number of students and not through
the analysis of a percentage breakdown of students by ethnic affiliation.
In order to yet increase the representation of students of ethnic communities the first private
university in Macedonia in 2001 was opened (the University of Southeast Europe in Tetovo) with a

408/453

significant support by the international community. The languages used at the University are
Albanian, Macedonian and English, and thus the total number of Albanians enrolled in higher
education institutions in 2003/2004 has increased to 10,4% of the total number of students.
The Law Amending the Law on Higher Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
No. 49/03) has raised the principle of affirmative action on the level of legal obligation in the process
of enrolment at state universities.
The Law on the Establishment of State University in Tetovo was adopted (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia” No. 08/04), fulfils the obligation for state funding of higher education in the
language spoken by at least 20% of the population in the Republic of Macedonia. The instruction at
the Tetovo University (in Albanian) started in the 2004/05 academic year, following the accreditation
of this higher education institution.
The members of ethnic communities may also exercise their right to education in mother tongue at
the state universities in Skopje and Bitola. These universities have Departments for Albanian
language and literature and Turkish language and literature. The Pedagogical Faculty in Skopje and
Štip that train teachers for primary and secondary education also offer studies in Albanian and
Turkish language.
The Ministry of Education and Science adopted a decision on including the Vlach language and
literature in the curricula of the Pedagogical Faculty in Štip in order to encourage the participation of
members of communities who are less than 20% of the total population in Macedonia. Additionally,
there is a project under way to include the Roma language in the curricula of one of the Faculties of
Philology in Macedonia. The Academy of Theatrical Arts also comprises Departments for the
Albanian and Turkish drama.
After the establishment of the State University of Tetovo a total of 2350 students have been enrolled
in the two accredited academic years. In the academic 2004/05 the total number of Albanian
students has increased to 15,5% of the total number of students at all universities, with a possibility
of growth (taking into account the enrolment period in February 2005). The participation of the
Albanian ethnic community in the total population is 25,17%.

Consequently, positive trends have been detected in all non-majority communities (excluding the
Serb community). This positive trend especially pertains to the Albanian ethnic community.
10. Has the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities been ratified and
how is it implemented?
The Republic of Macedonia ratified the Framework Convention for the Protection of National
Minorities (FCPNM) on 10.04.1997. It entered into force on 01.02.1998. The Initial Report on the
Implementation of the Framework Convention was submitted in September 2003, which was followed
by a visit of a Delegation of the FCPNM Advisory Committee in December 2003. The Committee
drafted and adopted its Opinion in May 2004 and submitted it to the Government in June 2004. In the
beginning of January 2005, the Government’s Commentary was submitted to the Advisory
Committee. A debate and adoption of a resolution is expected in the Committee of Ministers of the
Council of Europe.
As regards the implementation of the FCPNM, one should take into consideration the fact that
besides the obligations under the Convention, the basic framework for the minority policy in the
Republic of Macedonia has been the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, which
generally goes beyond the standards determined by the Framework Convention for the Protection of
the National Minorities.
Taking into account the Constitutional Amendments of 2001 (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 91/01), in 2003, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia submitted a revised
Declaration 3 , under which: The term national minorities used in the Framework Convention and the
provisions thereof, shall apply to the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia living within its borders
who are part of the Albanian people, the Turkish people, the Vlach people, the Serbian people, the
Roma people and the Bosniak people.
The legislation of the Republic of Macedonia is compatible with the provisions of the Convention.
The right to free expression of national identity, encompassed with Article 3 of the Convention,
corresponds with Article 8 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03), according to which a
fundamental value of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia is the free expression of
national identity. In 2002, this constitutional provision was implemented in the Law Amending the Law
on the Census of the Population, Households and Dwellings in the Republic of Macedonia (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 43/02). Pursuant to Article 9 of the Law, for persons
covered by the Census, data shall also be collected on their ethnic characteristics, i.e. their ethnic
affiliation and religious confession.
The right to equality before the law and equal treatment, guaranteed with Article 4 of the
Convention has been included in Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia: Citizens
of the Republic of Macedonia are equal in their freedoms and rights, regardless of gender, race,
colour of skin, ethnic or social origin, political or religious conviction, property and social status.
Citizens are equal before the Constitution and law.
Every citizen may invoke the protection of freedoms and rights established by the Constitution before
the regular courts and before the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia, through a
procedure based upon the principles of priority and urgency. Judicial protection of the legality of
individual acts of the state administration and of other institutions performing public mandates is
guaranteed. A citizen has the right to be informed on human rights and fundamental freedoms as well
as to actively contribute, individually or jointly with others, towards their promotion and protection
(Article 50 of the Constitution). The constitutional provisions pertaining to the equality of all before the
3

The initial Declaration included in the ratification instrument deposited by the Republic of Macedonia on 10.04.1997 reads
as follows: The term “national minorities’ used in the Framework Convention and the provisions of the same Convention
shall be applied to the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia who live within its borders and who are part of the Albanian
people, Turkish people, Vlach people, Serbian people, Roma people and Bosniak people.

410/453

law and to the equal right to protection have been implemented in the Law on Courts (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/95, 45/95 and 64/03).
The right of members of communities to maintain and develop their culture and to preserve the
essential elements of their identity – their religion, language, traditions and cultural heritage guaranteed in Article 5 of the Convention, has been incorporated in the legislation of the Republic of
Macedonia. Namely, in accordance with Article 48 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia,
members of communities have a right freely to express, foster and develop their identity and
community attributes, and to use their community symbols; The Republic guarantees the protection
of the ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity of all communities. Members of communities
have the right to establish institutions for culture, art, education as well as science and other
associations for the expression, fostering and development of their identity. This constitutional
provision has been implemented in the Law on Culture (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 31/98, 49/03 and 66/03), Law on Local Self-Government (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 5/02), Law on Copyright and Related Rights (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 47/96, 03/98, 98/02 and 04/05) and in all other relevant laws.
The right to peaceful assembly, freedom of association, freedom of expression and freedom
of thought, conscience and religion encompassed with Article 7 of the Convention has been
implemented in the Constitution and the laws in the Republic of Macedonia. Namely, Article 21 of the
Constitution guarantees the right of citizens to assemble peacefully and to express public protest
without prior announcement or a special license. The exercise of this right may only be restricted
during a state of emergency or war. The constitutional provision on the right to peaceful assembly
has been regulated with the Law on Public Gatherings (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 55/95).
The freedom of association has been guaranteed in Article 20 of the Constitution of the Republic of
Macedonia. Citizens are guaranteed freedom of association to exercise and protect their political,
economic, social, cultural and other rights and convictions. Citizens may freely establish associations
of citizens and political parties, join them or resign from them. The programmes and activities of
associations of citizens and political parties may not be directed at the violent destruction of the
constitutional order of the Republic, or at encouragement or incitement to military aggression or
ethnic, racial or religious hatred or intolerance. Military or paramilitary associations, which do not
belong to the Armed Forces of the Republic of Macedonia, are prohibited. The constitutional
provisions on the freedom of association have been applied in the Law on Political Parties (“Official
Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 76/04) and in the Law on Associations of Citizens and
Foundations (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 31/98).
The right of every member of a community to manifest his or her religion or belief and to
establish religious institutions, organisations and associations guaranteed in Article 8 of the
Convention has been incorporated in the legislation. Namely, Article 19 of the Constitution of the
Republic of Macedonia guarantees the freedom of religious confession. The right to express one’s
faith freely and publicly, individually or with others is guaranteed. The Macedonian Orthodox Church,
as well as the Islamic Religious Community in Macedonia, the Catholic Church, the Evangelical
Methodist Church, the Jewish Community and other Religious communities and groups are separate
from the state and equal before the law. The Macedonian Orthodox Church, as well as the Islamic
Religious Community in Macedonia, the Catholic Church, the Evangelical Methodist Church, the
Jewish Community and other Religious communities and groups are free to establish schools and
other social and charitable institutions, by way of a procedure regulated by law.
Constitutional provisions guaranteeing the freedom of religious confession and the status of religious
communities and groups have been applied in the Law on Religious Communities and Groups
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No 35/97) – for more details see I_J_2.
The right to freedom of expression of every member of a community included in Article 9 of the
Convention has been implemented in the national legislation. According to Article 16, the Constitution
of the Republic of Macedonia guarantees the freedom of speech, public address, public information

411/453

and the establishment of institutions for public information. Furthermore, free access to information
and the freedom of reception and transmission of information have been guaranteed. The Framework
Agreement, in Annex C - Implementation and Confidence-Building Measures, item 6 - Culture,
Education and Use of Languages, emphasises the need to increase the assistance for projects in the
area of media in order to further strengthen radio, TV and print media, including Albanian language
and multiethnic media, as well as to increase professional media training programmes for members
of communities not in the majority in Macedonia. In that sense, provisions of the Broadcasting Law
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 20/97 and 70/03) set forth an obligation of the
public broadcasting enterprise that broadcasts on the entire territory of the Republic of Macedonia –
Macedonian Radio and Television, to broadcast, apart from Macedonian language programmes,
programmes in the languages of all communities. Hence, the Macedonian Radio and Television has
fully allocated its Third Channel for the community languages programmes. Public enterprises
broadcasting at the local level are obliged to broadcast programmes in the language of a community
that constitutes a majority or a substantial number of the population in the respective area.
In addition, Article 45, paragraph 4 of the Law on Broadcasting provides for the right of the
commercial broadcasters (commercial broadcasting companies) to broadcast, apart from the
Macedonian language programmes, programmes in the language of communities.
The right of the members of communities to use their language, in private and in public, orally
and in writing, in relations between these persons and the administrative authorities, as well as the
right to be informed promptly, in a language which he/she understands, of the reasons for his/her
arrests, guaranteed with Article 10 of the Convention, have been respectively implemented in Article
7 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia which governs the right to use of languages, the
Law Amending the Law on General Administrative Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 44/02), the Law Amending the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 44/02).
The right of member of a community to use his/her surname and name in his/her language
and the right to display signs, inscriptions and other information of a private nature visible to the
public, encompassed in Article 11 of the Convention, have been implemented in the legislation of the
Republic of Macedonia. Namely, pursuant to Article 1 of the Law on Personal Name (“Official Gazette
of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 08/95), the personal name is a citizen’s personal right. A citizen
uses his/her personal name as written in the Birth Register. Members of communities have the right
to use their community’s language and alphabet when writing their personal name in the registers
and IDs.
Pursuant to the Law Amending the Law on Travel Documents of the Citizens of the Republic of
Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 20/03 and 46/04), for citizens who
speak an official language other than Macedonian, upon their personal request, the form for the
passport and emergency passport shall, as well, be printed in the official language and the alphabet
that they use. In addition, for citizens who speak an official language other than Macedonian, upon
their personal request, the data that are filled in the passport and the emergency passport may be
written in the Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet and in the official language and alphabet
used by the respective citizen.
For citizens who speak a language other than the official, upon their personal request, the personal
name data that are filled in the passport, may be written in the Macedonian language and its Cyrillic
alphabet and in the language and alphabet used by the respective citizen.
The Law Amending the Law on Personal Identity Card (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 38/02 and 16/04) prescribes that for the citizens who speak an official language
other than Macedonian, the form of the identity card shall be printed and the data therein shall be
written in the official language and alphabet used by the respective citizen.
Pursuant to the Law Amending the Law on the Road Traffic Safety (“Official Gazette of the Republic
of Macedonia”, Nos. 38/02 and 38/04), citizens who speak an official language other than the

412/453

Macedonian, the form of the driving licence, licence for tractor driver and the driving certificate, shall
be printed and the data therein shall be written, besides in Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet, in
the official language and alphabet used by the respective citizen. Identical solution exists with regard
to the printing of the form for traffic licence and the vehicle registration certificate, and the data filled
therein.
The Law Amending the Law on Personal Registers (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
No. 38/02) prescribes that in the local self-government units in which at least 20% of the citizens
speak an official language other than Macedonian, the form of the registers shall be printed and the
data therein shall also be written in the official language and alphabet used by the respective citizen.
The certificates being issued on the basis of the registers shall be written in Macedonian and in the
official language and the alphabet used by the respective citizen.
The obligation of the state to promote equal opportunities for access to education for
members of communities included in Article 12 of the Convention, has been implemented pursuant
to the Law on Protection of Children (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 98/00,
17/03 and 65/04), Law on Primary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos.
44/95, 24/96, 34/96, 35/97, 82/99, 29/02, 52/02- consolidated text, 40/03, 42/03, 63/04 and 82/04),
Law on Secondary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 44/95, 24/96,
34/96, 35/97, 82/99, 29/2002, 52/02- consolidated text, 40/03, 42/03 and 67/04) and Law on Higher
Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 64/00 and 49/03).
The right of members of communities to set up private educational establishments guaranteed
in Article 13 of the Convention has been implemented in the legislation of the Republic of Macedonia,
with the exception of the primary education. Namely, pursuant to the Constitution of the Republic of
Macedonia (Article 45), citizens are entitled to establish private schools at all levels, with the
exception of the primary education. Article 34 of the Law on Higher Education guarantees the right to
establishment of higher education institutions.

The right to learn one’s language, as well as the obligation of the state, within the framework
of the education system and in areas inhabited by members of communities traditionally or in
substantial numbers, to ensure teaching of or instruction in their languages, encompassed in
Article 14 of the Convention, have been incorporated in the legislation of the Republic of Macedonia.
The Government of the Republic of Macedonia provides full pre-school, primary and secondary
education in community languages, in accordance with the conditions prescribed by law. Article 95
of the Law on Higher Education guarantees the right to conduct the teaching at the state institutions
of higher education, under respective curricula, in the language of a community other than the
Macedonian. In doing so, state funding is provided for the higher education and for the language
used by at least 20% of the population of the Republic of Macedonia.
As regards the teaching at private institutions of higher education, the same Article stipulates that it
may be conducted in the languages of communities that are not in the majority in the Republic of
Macedonia or in some internationally spoken languages.
The right to effective participation of members of communities in cultural, social and economic life
and in public affairs, in particular those affecting them, guaranteed in Article 15 of the Convention,
has been implemented in the Constitution and the laws in the Republic of Macedonia. Namely,
pursuant to Article 22 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, every citizen who has
attained the age of 18 years acquires the right to vote. The right to vote is equal, universal and is
exercised at free elections by secret ballot. Persons deprived of the civil capacity do not have the
right to vote.
The right to vote and its exercise have been applied in a number of laws, such as the Law on
Election of Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 42/02, 50/02 and 46/04), Law on Election of the President of the
Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 20/94, 48/99 and

413/453

11/04), Law on Local Elections (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 45/04, 52/04
and 60/04), Law on Voters’ List (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 42/02 and
35/04) and Law on Polling Stations (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 50/97).
Article 14 of the Convention has also been implemented in a number of other laws, which include
provisions on non-discrimination, like the Law on Courts, Law on Culture, Law on Civil Servants
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00, 112/00, 34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02,
17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04, 69/04) etc.
The right to freedom of movement and to free choice of place of residence, guaranteed in
Article 17 of the Convention, has been implemented in the Constitution and the corresponding laws
of the Republic of Macedonia. Namely, pursuant to Article 27 of the Constitution, every citizen of the
Republic of Macedonia has the right to free movement within the territory of the Republic and freely
to choose his/her place of residence; every citizen has the right to leave the territory of the Republic
and to return to the Republic; the exercise of these rights may be restricted by law only in cases
where it is necessary for the protection of the security of the Republic, criminal investigation or
protection of public health. The constitutionally guaranteed right to free movement and the right to
free choice of place of residence have been applied in the Law on Reporting Dwellings and
Residence of Citizens (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/92, 12/93 and
43/00).
11. Provide an overview (including statistics) of the situation of Roma, and the Government’s
plans for their integration (adoption and implementation, including details on funding, with
examples of concrete results).
a) Current situation:
The 1991 Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia equally treats the Roma with other communities.
Namely, in accordance with Amendment IV to the Constitution, “The citizens of the Republic of
Macedonia, the Macedonian people, as well as citizens living within its borders, who are part of the
Albanian people, the Turkish people, the Vlach people, the Serb people, the Roma people, the
Bosniak people... taking responsibility for the present and future of their fatherland... equal in rights
and obligations towards the common good - the Republic of Macedonia... have decided to establish
the Republic of Macedonia as an independent, sovereign state, with the intention of establishing and
consolidating the rule of law, guaranteeing human rights and civil liberties, providing peaceful
coexistence, social justice, economic well-being and prosperity in the life of the individual and the
community...”
The Republic of Macedonia is the first state in the world to mention the Roma in its Constitution and
recognise them as a constituent people.
The Roma have freely expressed their ethnic affiliation in all censuses conducted in the Republic of
Macedonia after 1948 (the forms have contained sections on ethnic affiliation, including a section for
the Roma). As of 1994, census forms have also been printed in the Roma language in addition to
Macedonian.
According to data from the last Census in 2002, there were 53.879 Roma living in the Republic of
Macedonia, representing 2,66% of the total population. This was an increase in their number as
compared to the 1994 Census, when the number of the Roma was 43.707, or 2,2% of the total
population.
A breakdown of the Roman population according to age and gender is given in the following table:

Since the introduction of political pluralism in the Republic of Macedonia, the Roma have been taking
an active part in political life through the establishment of their own political parties.
Several political parties of ethnic Roma have been founded during this period, including the Party for
the Full Emancipation of the Roma (PFER), the United Party of the Roma (UPR), the Alliance of the
Roma in Macedonia, the United Party of the Roma, and the Democratic Party of the Roma. The
PFER and UPR later joined forces to form the United Party for Emancipation. Experience has shown
that Roma parties often form coalitions with the major political parties.
Since the first multiparty elections in the Republic of Macedonia, the Roma have been represented in
the Assembly (two Representatives in 1990, one Representative in 1994, 1998 and 2002
respectively).
One of the members of the Committee on Inter-Ethnic Relations, which consists of 19 members,
should be elected from the ranks of the Roma Representatives in the Assembly (If a community has
no Representatives in the Assembly, following consultations with representatives of that community,
the Ombudsman proposes the rest of the members of the Committee).
One municipality In the Republic of Macedonia (Šuto Orizari, near Skopje) has a predominantly
Roma population. The mayor is an ethnic Roma, as well as the majority of the councillors.
There are between 30 and 40 Roma non-governmental organisations which are active in the fields of
human rights, culture, education, environmental issues and infrastructure projects.
The right to free expression of cultural identity is fully guaranteed and is also supported by public
funds supporting publishing, public events etc. There are a number of Roma folk and drama groups,
some of them having a long tradition.
Even though the question of standardisation of the Roma language in Europe and the world is a
complex one because of the existence of many dialects, the first grammar book of the Roma
language was published in the Republic of Macedonia in 1980. This is considered the first attempt on
an international level for the standardisation of the Roma language. A number of publications in the
Roma language have beep printed ever since, including a textbook for supplementary courses in
Roma.
Currently there is optional instruction in Roma language in a school in the municipality of Šuto
Orizari.

There are a number of periodicals printed in Roma, as well several television and radio stations.
Within the programmes of the public broadcaster Macedonian Radio and Television, Macedonian
Television broadcasts two thirty-minute programmes a week in Roma, and Macedonian Radio
broadcasts a daily thirty-minute programme in the Roma language through Network 3. Radio
Kumanovo has a Roma department, and there are also programmes in Roma broadcast by Radio
Tetovo (thirty minutes a day).
In 2002, 4.032 hours of television programmes were broadcast in Roma (out of the total of 158.289
hours), as well as 1.385 hours of radio programmes (out of the total of 133.917 hours).
Two private television stations broadcast programmes in both Roma and Macedonian — BTR and
TV Šutel.
The current social and economic situation of Roma, who are especially burdened by transition
problems, places them in the category of the poorest citizens of the Republic of Macedonia.
According to the data of the Employment Agency of the Republic of Macedonia, the total number of
unemployed Roma on 31 August 2004 was 17.014 (4.3% of the total number of the unemployed), of
which 7.114 were women. Below is the breakdown of their educational levels and gender.

According to the figures for 1996, 11,7% of the total number of families receiving public welfare
benefits were Roma, the majority of whom were non-skilled workers. Data from 2003 shows that
about 12% of the total number of households in the Republic of Macedonia receiving public welfare
benefits (64.500) belong to the Roma community (about 7.700 households).

Government plans for integration:
In early 2004, in order to develop a consistent approach towards the improvement of the situation of
the Roma community and their swifter integration into society, the Government of the Republic of
Macedonia began preparing a National Strategy for Roma, whose draft was officially presented in
mid-September 2004. The organisation of a round table discussion in mid-October 2004 marked the
beginning of the public debate on the Draft Strategy for Roma. The basic aim of the public debate
was to allow for greater participation, particularly on the part of the Roma community in the
preparation of this document.
The National Strategy for Roma in the Republic of Macedonia was adopted by the Government of the
Republic of Macedonia on 31.01.2005 and its implementation can begin.
The most important objective of the Strategy is to promote the strengthening of the position and
integration of Roma within the main social and economic structures in the Republic of Macedonia by
determining the best way to realise a meaningful multidimensional state policy, which is to serve as a
pivotal cornerstone on which concrete projects dealing with more specific areas will be built. The
Strategy should also respond to the genuine needs, problems and priorities of the Roma and to
introduce a balanced and sustainable approach by combining the set objectives in harmony with the
legally guaranteed human rights and state policy. The Strategy is a complex document, which
couldn’t be prepared with the participation of a single Ministry or by the Government alone. It was
imperative that representatives of the Roma community should take part in both its preparation and
implementation so that a consensus and broad support can be achieved during its implementation on
the ground. Only a multidimensional approach in the Strategy’s development and application can
guarantee a successful implementation.
The general aims of the National Strategy for Roma are as follows:
-

A greater integration of Roma in the mainstream of Macedonian society;
The reduction of poverty among Roma as the most marginalised group;
The long-term development of every aspect of the Roma community;
The full engagement of the Macedonian state in the preparation and implementation of the
priorities set forth in the Strategy; and
The establishment of the normative and institutional prerequisites for the reaching European
Union standards.

The preparation of this important document for Roma was supported by the Project on Ethnic
Relations (PER) organisation.
In addition to this, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia took an active part in the initiative
known as the Decade of Roma Inclusion. At the initiative of the World Bank and the Open Society
Institute, eight Prime Ministers from the governments in South-Eastern Europe were invited to
Budapest in 2003 (30.06 -01.07) — those of Macedonia, Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro, Croatia,
the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. They expressed their commitment to
participate in the initiative and to make an active contribution to a more rapid integration of Roma in
their countries. The first conference of the Steering Committee was held in December 2003 in
Budapest, where several important decisions were made:
−
−
−

A Steering Committee of the Decade was established where each state is represented by one
member;
A Secretariat of the Decade was formed with its seat in Budapest;
Each state was obliged to establish a National Working Group, which would include Roma
representatives for the preparation of National Action Plans of the Decade;

418/453

−

Four priority areas of the Decade were identified - education, employment, healthcare and
housing - for which the National Working Groups would develop action plans, as well as three
main themes which should permeate the priority areas: the reduction of poverty, women’s
issues and non-discrimination.

The Macedonian Prime Minister appointed a National Coordinator of the Decade of Roma Inclusion.
A National Working Group was formed whose members include representatives of several ministries,
state institutions, political representatives of the Roma and representatives of Roma NGOs, which
developed four Draft Action Plans for the four priority areas of the Decade. These were distributed to
several ministries, to political parties of the Roma and to virtually all Roma NGOs for comments and
suggestions.
A conference was organised in October 2004 which attracted a large number of representatives from
political parties and NGOs of the Roma. The National Action Plans were finalised and adopted on
31.01.2005 by the Government.
12. Provide a description of existing language legislation and language training programmes
for minority languages. Is language legislation in line with the Council of Europe's
recommendations?
The Republic of Macedonia ratified the Framework Convention for the Protection of National
Minorities (FCPNM) of the Council of Europe on 10.04.1997. The Convention came into force on
01.02.1998, after which the provisions of the Convention became a constituent part of national
legislation. The Republic of Macedonia also signed the European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages (25.07.1996), which has still not been ratified.
Article 12 of the FCPNM concerning the right to education in the languages of the minorities,
adequate opportunities for teacher training and access to textbooks, the promotion of equal
opportunities regarding access to education at all levels for persons belonging to national minorities,
has been incorporated into the provisions of the laws on primary, secondary and higher education in
the Republic of Macedonia.
Article 3 and Article 8 of the Law on Primary Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 44/95, 24/96, 34/96, 35/97, 82/99, 29/02, 52/02( consolidated text), 40/03, 42/03
and 63/04) guarantees equal rights in primary education to all children, Macedonians and those who
are a part of the Albanian, Turkish, Roma, Vlach, Serb and Bosniak people, as well as to all others.
For pupils who are part of the Albanian and Turkish communities, the education process in
kindergarten groups (see Table 1) and primary schools (See Table 2) is performed in the pupil’s
mother tongue using the corresponding alphabets.
The pupils of Serbian, Turkish, Roma and Vlach ethnic affiliations, who receive instruction in
Macedonian, can also learn their mother tongue.
In secondary education, in accordance with Article 3 and 4 of the Law on Secondary Education
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia””, Nos. 44/95, 24/96, 34/96, 35/97, 82/99, 29/02,
52/02 (consolidated text), 40/03, 42/03 and 67/04) the education process is performed in
Macedonian, Albanian and Turkish.
Pupils of ethnic Albanian affiliation in Macedonia can receive instruction in Albanian in six
municipalities as well as in the city of Skopje: out of a total of 90 secondary schools, instruction takes
place in Albanian in 26 and in Turkish in 7. In the school year 2002/2003, there were 94.868 pupils
enrolled in secondary education, of which 76.459 (80,59%) received instruction in Macedonian,
17.624 (18,57%) in Albanian, and 785 (0,82%) in Turkish. This year (2004/05) the percentage of
ethnic Albanians in the total number of students in secondary education reached 22,52%.
In the enrolment competitions for higher education, in accordance with Article 23 of the Law
Amending the Law on Higher Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 49/03),

419/453

an additional quota, set by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, is provided for
communities benefiting from positive discrimination (for more details see I_J_9).
Article 14 of the FCPNM (recognising that every person belonging to a national minority has the right
to learn in his or her minority language) has been incorporated into the legislation mentioned above.
The Republic of Macedonia provides for pre-school, primary and secondary education, as well as
higher education in linguistics, pedagogy and dramatic arts in the languages of several minorities, or
more specifically, primary education in Albanian, Turkish and Serbian and secondary and higher
education in Albanian and Turkish.
The academic year 2004/2005 saw the introduction of the optional study of the Vlach language in the
Faculty of Pedagogy in Štip in order to train up teachers for optional instruction in Vlach. Additionally,
there is a project under way to include the Roma language in the curricula of one of the Faculties of
Philology in Macedonia.

The use of the languages of communities living in the Republic of Macedonia covers every sphere of
the society (state bodies, the administration, local self-government, judicial procedures, personal
documents, the media, education, culture, etc.). Hence, specific aspects of the existing language
legislation is to be found in the answers throughout the whole Chapter I, Political Criteria.

421/453

13. In practical terms, can a person communicate with a regional office of the central
government, or a main office of the central government, in any official language? What
arrangements have been taken to ensure translation and interpretation?
Amendment V (Article 7) to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) specifies the official languages
in the Republic of Macedonia and their use.
On the whole territory of the Republic of Macedonia and in its international relations the official
language is the Macedonian language, written using its Cyrillic alphabet (Article 7, paragraph 1).
Any other language, spoken by at least 20% of the citizens, is also an official language, written using
its alphabet, as specified in Amendment V (Article 7, paragraph 2).
Paragraph 4 of the aforementioned Amendment sets forth that any citizen living in a unit of local selfgovernment in which at least 20% of the citizens speak an official language other than Macedonian,
may use any of the official languages and their alphabets in communication with the local offices of
the central government. The local offices with competence in these units of local-self government
shall reply in Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet, as well as in the official language and
alphabet used by the citizen.
Any citizen may use any official language and its alphabet to communicate with the local offices of
the central government, which shall reply in Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet, as well as
in the official language and alphabet used by the citizen.
Paragraph 5 of the Amendment stipulates that in the state administrative bodies in the Republic of
Macedonia, any official language other than Macedonian may be used in accordance with the law.
Paragraph 6 of the Amendment prescribes that in the units of the local self-government, the language
and the alphabet used by at least 20% of the citizens is an official language in addition to the
Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet. The bodies of the local self-government units decide
on the use of the languages and alphabets used by less than 20 percent of the citizens in the
respective unit of local self-government.
Changes to the Law on General Administrative Procedure (“Official Gazette of the SFRY”, No. 47/86
- consolidated text) introduced by the Law Amending the Law on General Administrative Procedure
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 44/02), were made with the purpose of bringing
a number of its provisions in line with the Amendment V to the Constitution.
Namely, Article 15 of this Law stipulates that official language in the administrative procedure is
Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet (paragraph 1). In the administrative procedure conducted in the
state administrative bodies, other state bodies, bodies of local-self government units, legal and other
persons awarded public mandates under law another language spoken by at least 20% of the
citizens and its alphabet shall be used in accordance with the Law (paragraph 2). Parties and other
participants in the procedure who are not citizens of the Republic of Macedonia and who do not
understand Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet are entitled to an interpreter (paragraph
3).
Article 64 the aforementioned Law sets forth that submissions include requests, forms used for
automatic data processing, proposals, declarations, applications, appeals, complaints and other
statements by way of which individuals or legal persons, i.e. organisations communicate with state
bodies. Paragraph 3 of the aforementioned Article sets forth that the right under Article 15, paragraph
2 may be enjoyed by any citizen living in a unit of local self-government in which at least 20% of the
citizens speak an official language other than Macedonian, i.e. in communication with the local
offices of Ministries, he/she may use any of the official languages and their alphabets. The local
offices with competence in these units of local-self government shall reply in Macedonian language
and its Cyrillic alphabet, as well as in the official language and alphabet used by the citizen. Any

422/453

citizen may use one of the official languages and its alphabet to communicate with Ministries, which
shall reply in Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet, as well as in the official language and
alphabet used by the citizen in question.
Parties in the procedure who speak a language other than Macedonian which is also an official one,
may file submissions in that language and its alphabet. The bodies conducting the procedure shall
translate such submissions and act upon them. Bodies conducting the procedure, when deciding on
administrative matters, reply in Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet as well as in the official
language and the alphabet used by the respective party in the procedure.
Taking this into consideration, Ministries, other state administration bodies and administrative
organisations which decide for the rights and interests of citizens, as well as other participants in the
administrative procedure, are obliged to implement the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic
of Macedonia, the Law on General Administrative Procedure and the Law on the Local SelfGovernment pertaining to the use of languages and alphabets in the communication of these bodies
with persons belonging to the communities. In that respect, Ministries and other state administrative
bodies and administrative organisations are obliged to undertake actions in their local offices, i.e.
units for printing bi-lingual forms (summonses, receipt notifications, proposals, declarations, rulings
and other writs) for citizens living in local self-government units (municipalities) in which at least 20%
of the citizens speak an official language other than Macedonian.
Public enterprises, legal and other
shall also undertake measures and
forms (summonses, receipts and

Hence, a procedure is underway on the announcement of tenders for printing bi-lingual forms of the
local offices of Ministries and other state administrative bodies and administrative organisations for
citizens living in local self-government units (municipalities) in which at least 20% of the citizens
speak an official language other than Macedonian.
Following the changes in the procedural laws governing the right to use community languages in
court and administrative procedures, in the course of February 2004, the Government of the Republic
of Macedonia, on proposal of the Ministry of Justice, adopted the Information and the Implementation
Project on Employment of Translators and Typists in Courts and State Administrative Bodies. The
documents envisage employment and appropriate training of translators and typists in the use of
community languages. On the Session held on 06.01.2005, the Government adopted the Decision for
training of translators/interpreters in languages of communities that are not in majority in the Republic
of Macedonia. Translators/interpreters will be employed in the state administrative bodies and in the
courts. Their training will be performed in accordance with a programme determined by the Civil
Servants Agency, supported by the CARDS 2004 Programme. Selection of candidates for
translators/interpreters will be performed by the Civil Servants Agency in accordance with the Law on
Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00, 112/00, 34/01, 103/01,
43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04 and 69/04). Following the training, candidates will sign
contracts with the Civil Servants Agency, committing themselves to work in the state administrative
bodies and courts for a period of two years from the day of the completion of the training.
14. Is the right of translation of all proceedings and documents in criminal and civil judicial
proceedings ensured in accordance with the relevant Council of Europe documents? If so,
how is this done?
The right to translation of all documents in penal and civil court procedures in the Republic of Macedonia
are in compliance with relevant documents of the Council of Europe, but also with obligations arising from
the Framework Agreement on the use of languages of ethnic communities in courts. This right is also in
compliance with the principle of equitable representation of all communities into the judicial institutions,
which has been continuously implemented.

423/453

Namely, pursuant to the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
Nos.15/97, 44/02 and 74/04), the person summoned, apprehended or deprived of freedom must
immediately be informed in a language he/she understands on the reasons of summoning, apprehending
or depriving him/her of freedom and on any indictments against him/her as well as on his/her rights.
He/she may not be extorted a statement.
In the course of a criminal procedure, Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet are official as well as a
language and alphabet used by at least 20% of the citizens (Article 6).
The persons participating in the procedure, such as the defendant, the injured party, the plaintiff,
witnesses and other persons, who speak an official language other than Macedonian, have a right to use
their language and alphabet in the course of preliminary investigation proceedings and in the course of
the main hearing, as well as in procedures concerning appeals. The Court shall provide oral interpretation
as well as translations of documents and other written material. In addition the court shall provide
translated written material of importance to the procedure or the defence.
Other parties and witnesses in the court procedure have a right to free interpretation if they do not
understand or speak the language in which the procedure is conducted. The person shall be given legal
advice on his/her right to interpreting. The legal advice shall be noted in the minutes. The translation or
interpretation is performed by a court-authorised interpreter (Article 7).
Indictments, appeals and other submissions are submitted to the court in the language in which the
procedure is conducted. Citizens who speak an official language other than Macedonian may submit their
submissions in the language they speak and in its alphabet, or in the language in which the procedure is
conducted. The court shall translate the submissions and present them to other parties in the procedure.
The defendant that does not understand the language in which the procedure is conducted is given
translations into the language he/she has used in the course of the procedure. Foreign citizens deprived
of freedom or in detention may submit their submission in their language, and in other cases - under
conditions of reciprocity (Article 8).
The court sends summons, rulings and other written correspondence in the language in which the
procedure is conducted. Citizens who speak an official language other than Macedonian shall receive
summons, rulings and other written correspondence into their language. A defendant in detention, in
prison or confined in a health institution under compulsory psychiatric treatment shall receive translations
of submissions into the language he/she has used in the procedure. The defendant that does not
understand the language in which the procedure is conducted is given translation of the verdict in the
language he/she has used in the course of the procedure (Article 9).
With regard to grounds for disputing the verdict, an essential violation of the criminal procedure
provisions, among others, is when the court has violated the provisions on the use of language in the
course of the procedure as prescribed by this Law (Article 355, paragraph 1, subparagraph 12).
In accordance with the Law on Litigation Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
Nos. 33/98 and 44/02), the litigation procedure is conducted in Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet. In
the course of litigation procedure an official language and its alphabet used by at least 20% of the citizens
is also official in the procedure, as prescribed by the Law. A member of a community who as a party or a
participant in the procedure does not understand or speak the Macedonian language and its Cyrillic
alphabet has a right to an interpreter. The interpreting costs are covered by the court. The court shall give
legal advice to the party or a participant in the procedure who uses another official language and its
alphabet spoken by at least 20% of the citizens (and who as a party or participant in the procedure does
not understand the Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet) that he/she has a right to use his/her
language and the right to an interpreter. The Chamber President or a judge is obliged to note the court’s
legal advice and the party’s statement or a statement of another participant in the procedure into the
minutes (Article 6).

424/453

The parties and other participants in the procedure that speak an official language other than Macedonian
have a right to use their language in the course of court hearings or in his/her oral correspondence with
the court. The parties and other participants in the procedure shall be provided oral interpreting into their
language in the course of hearings, as well as oral and written translations of documents used as
evidence in hearings. The translation or interpreting is performed by a court-authorised interpreter (Article
94-а).
Summons, rulings and other written correspondence are sent to parties and other participants in the
procedure in Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet. Citizens who speak an official language
other than Macedonian shall receive summons, rulings and other written correspondence into their
language (Article 94-b).
Parties and other participants in the procedure shall submit bills of indictment, appeals and other
submissions to the court in Macedonian language and its Cyrillic alphabet. Parties and other participants
in the procedure who are citizens of the Republic of Macedonia and whose mother tongue is an official
language other than Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet may submit bills of indictment, appeals and
other submissions to the court in their mother tongue. The court translates these submissions into
Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet and presents them to other parties in the procedure (Article 94-c).
Parties and other participants in the procedure who are citizens of the Republic of Macedonia and speak
a language other than Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet which is not an official language, enjoy a right
to use their language in the course of hearings and in their oral communication with the court. The parties
and other participants in the procedure shall be provided oral interpreting into their language in the course
of hearings, as well as oral and written translations of documents used as evidence in hearings. Parties
and other participants in the procedure who speak a language other than Macedonian and its Cyrillic
alphabet, which is not an official language, shall be legally advised on their rights. They are entitled to an
interpreter in order to follow the oral proceedings before the court in their mother tongue. They may
relinquish the right to interpretation if they declare they speak the language in which the procedure is
conducted. Such legal advice and statements of parties and participants shall be noted in the minutes
(Article 94-d).
The court shall cover the costs for providing interpreting to parties and participants in the procedure who
are citizens of the Republic of Macedonia (Article 94-e).
As regards the essential violation of the provisions on litigation procedure, it should be noted that such
violation occurs when the court has violated the provisions concerning the use of language in the course
of the procedure (Articles 6, 94-a, 94-b, 94-c, 94-d and 94-e).
In addition, in April 2004, Rules of Procedure Amending the Court Rules of Procedure were adopted
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 27/04). In order to implement the provisions of the
Amendment V to the Constitution (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia, Nos. 52/91, 01/92,
31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) and the aforementioned legal changes in court procedures, they determine the
pattern of the forms for correspondence with parties in the court proceedings. Moreover, the forms were
translated and distributed among all judicial bodies in the Republic of Macedonia, in line with the
amendments to the Procedural Laws and the Rules of Procedure Amending the Court Rules of
Procedure. With a view to more transparent operation and awareness rising among citizens for the
implementation of the Framework Agreement and Amendment V to the Constitution, forms for
correspondence with parties in the court procedure were published in the Albanian language daily
newspaper Flaka and the Macedonian language daily newspaper Utrinski vesnik.
15. Can citizens who speak an official language other than the majority language receive
official personal documents in that language? What arrangements have been made in this
respect?
The citizens of the Republic of Macedonia who speak an official language other than the language
spoken by the majority population get official personal documents in the language and alphabet that
they use. The legal basis for issuing personal documents to the citizens who speak an official
language other than Macedonian is contained in the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia

425/453

(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) as the
highest legal act of the state.
According to paragraph 3 of Amendment V replacing Article 7 of the Constitution of the Republic of
Macedonia, Official personal documents of citizens speaking an official language other than
Macedonian shall be issued in the Macedonian language, as well as in that language in accordance
with the law.
Article 1 paragraph 5 of the Law Amending the Law on Personal Identity Card (“Official Gazette of
the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/02), amending Article 5 of the Law on Personal Identification
Card (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 8/95) provides that for the citizens
speaking an official language other than Macedonian the form of the personal identification card will
be printed and the data therein will be entered, besides in Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet, in the
official language and alphabet that the citizen is using.
Article 1 of the Law Amending the Law on Travel Documents of the Citizens of the Republic of
Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 20/03) amending Article 28 of the
Law on Travel Documents of the Citizens of RM (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
No. 67/92) provides that citizens speaking an official language other than Macedonian will, upon their
personal request, have the form of their passport and emergency passport also printed in the official
language and alphabet that the citizen uses. In addition, Article 13 of the Law Amending the Law on
Travel Documents of Citizens of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 46/04) amending the Article 28 of the Law on Travel Documents of Citizens of the
Republic of Macedonia clarifies that citizens speaking an official language other than Macedonian
will, upon their personal request, have the data entered in the passport and emergency passport
besides in Macedonian and its Cyrillic alphabet also in the official language and alphabet that the
citizen uses.
The obligation to issue official documents in the field of traffic and transport in the language of
citizens speaking an official language other than Macedonian, such as: driving license, vehicle
certificate, tractor driving license, driving certificate and certificate of registration, emerges from the
Law Amending the Law on Road Traffic Safety (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
38/02).
In 2004 further amendments were enacted by the Law Amending the Law on Road Traffic Safety
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 38/04), whereby in the field of categories and
subcategories, the Macedonian driving license is entirely harmonised with the driving licenses issued
in EU countries.
The Rulebook on Amending the Rulebook on Forms for Travel Documents and Visas for Citizens of
the Republic of Macedonia, on the Method of Photographing for Travel Documents and on Keeping
Records, published on 21.10.2004 (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 73/04),
provides for bilingual forms for travel documents and the emergency passports issued to citizens of
the Republic of Macedonia.
The adoption of a Rulebook on the Forms for a Vehicle Certificate, Driving License, Tractor Vehicle
Certificate, Tractor Driving License, Certificate of Registration, Driving Certificate and Certificate of
Temporary Vehicle Registration, is in procedure, whereby bilingual forms of the above documents will
be prescribed.
The Ministry of the Interior have started issuing personal identification cards in the Republic of
Macedonia, in the language and alphabet of citizens speaking an official language other than
Macedonian since 15.05.2003 and until 31.12.2004 a total of 174.352 personal identification cards
have been issued, 138.758 of which in the Macedonian language and alphabet, and 35.594 also in
an official language and script other than Macedonian i.e. in Albanian.

426/453

In addition, Ministry of the Interior have also started issuing travel documents in an official language
and alphabet other than Macedonian since 06.12.2004 and until 31.12.2004 a total of 6.196 bilingual
travel documents have been issued, upon personal request from citizens.
With the adoption of the secondary legislation act in the field of traffic, the legal framework will be
completed and the citizens speaking an official language other than Macedonian will be issued a
driving license, vehicle certificate, tractor driving license, driving certificate, tractor vehicle certificate
and certificate of registration in their language.
16. Have specific agreements been negotiated to ensure State funding for university level
education in languages spoken by at least 20% of the population?
In July 2003, the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia adopted the Law Amending the Law on
Higher Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 49/03), introducing, inter alia,
changes to Article 95 of the Law on Higher Education (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 64/00).
Paragraph 2 of this Article determines that persons belonging to communities, in order to express,
foster and develop their identity and other attributes, are entitled to instruction at the state institutions
of higher education, under specific curricula, in the language of community other than the
Macedonian, in accordance with the provisions of this Law and the Statute of the respective
institution of higher education. The same paragraph further prescribes that state funding shall be
provided for higher education in the language spoken by at least 20% of the citizens of the Republic
of Macedonia.
In addition, paragraph 3 of Article 95 of the Law on Higher Education stipulates that the instruction in
the state pedagogical institutions of higher education providing training for educators in pre-school
institutions, teachers in primary education and teachers of didactic subjects and subjects in methods
of instruction in secondary education, may be conducted in languages of other communities that are
not in the majority in the Republic of Macedonia, which entails an obligation for the state to fund
these curricula.
In order to ensure state funding for the higher education in the language spoken by at least 20% of
the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, the Law on Establishing the State University in Tetovo
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 08/04) was adopted by the Assembly of the
Republic of Macedonia in January 2004. The Law, as a founding act, establishes the State University
in Tetovo, with the following four faculties and a polytechnic centre included in its structure: Faculty of
Natural Sciences and Mathematics; Faculty of Humanities and Arts; Faculty of Economy; Faculty of
Law; and a Polytechnic Centre. Hence, only the University has a capacity of a legal entity, while the
faculties and the polytechnic centre have a status of internal organisational units within the
University.
For the purpose of preparing the commencement of the operations of the State University in Tetovo,
the Government of the Republic of Macedonia established a Committee which, in a period of seven
months, completed the necessary preparations, in particular in terms of providing the necessary
teaching and associate personnel. The Committee announced competitions and conducted a
procedure of selection of teachers and associates in accordance with the Law on Higher Education.
Once the Ministry of Education and Science conducted a direct inspection in order to check whether
the conditions have been fulfilled for the beginning of the operation of the University, the Minister
adopted an (interim) Decision for the start of the operation of the University. Subsequently, the
University was enlisted in the Registry of the Institutions of Higher Education in the Republic of
Macedonia; the bodies of the University were set up; and it was enlisted in the Court Registry. Thus,
the State University in Tetovo acquired the capacity of a legal entity and started its operation as a
legal institution of higher education as of 01.10.2004.
Necessary funding for this institution of higher education, pursuant to the aforementioned Article 95,
paragraph 2 of the Law on Higher Education, are provided from the State Budget and from other

427/453

sources determined by law. The 2004 Budget of the Republic of Macedonia allocated 44.503.000
MKD for the operation of the State University in Tetovo, which started its operation in the academic
2004/2005. The 2005 Budget, for the same purpose allocates funds of 83.000.000 MKD.
Furthermore, state funding of the higher education in the language spoken by at least 20% of the
citizens is also provided for the Department of Albanian Language and Literature at the Faculty of
Philology; for the Faculty of Pedagogy “St. Kliment Ohridski” in Skopje, where, in accordance with the
already established right of persons belonging to communities in Article 95, paragraph 2 of the Law,
studies are conducted for teachers in pre-school and primary education for the persons belonging to
the Albanian and Turkish communities; as well as for specific study programmes for ethnic Albanian
students at the Faculty of Drama Arts and Faculty of Physical Culture.
17. Are there any professional restrictions for minorities (de iure or de facto)?
a) De iure professional restrictions
In the Republic of Macedonia de jure professional restrictions for members of non-majority
communities do not exist. This would be contrary to the Law on Labour Relations (“Official Gazette of
the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 80/93, 03/94, 14/95, 53/97, 59/97, 21/98, 25/00, 34/00, 50/01,
25/03, 40/03 and 80/03 - consolidated text), which contains provisions prohibiting discrimination on
grounds of various reasons, including the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of ethnic origin.
Moreover, Article 9 of the Constitution (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 52/91,
01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) prohibits discrimination on any ground and guarantees that citizens of
the Republic of Macedonia are equal in their freedoms and rights, regardless of gender, race, colour
of skin, national and social origin, political and religious conviction, property and social status.
b) De facto professional restrictions
De facto, there is evident lesser representation of some ethnic communities in the public
administration, army, police and the judiciary, as a consequence of which the principle of equitable
representation has been incorporated as one of the key provisions in the Ohrid Framework
Agreement. The reference “equitable representation” is not a synonym of proportional representation,
i.e. it does not indicate that all communities must be represented in the public administration
according to their proportion in the total population. The concept of equitable representation, which
assumes the respect of the principle of competence and integrity, aims at the establishment of a
professional, specialised and competent public administration. This concept will be different on the
level of different bodies; however, it should adhere to the tendency of realisation of proportional
representation. The principle of non-discrimination and equitable representation has been explicated
in item 4 of the Framework Agreement, which requires that non-discrimination and equal treatment of
all persons before the law must be fully respected. This principle is especially accentuated during the
recruitments in the public administration and public enterprises, as well as regarding the access to
public funding in the process of business development.
Laws regulating employments in public administration contain measures that secure the equitable
representation of communities in all central and local bodies at all levels as well as employment
therein. At the same time, principles of competence and integrity must be respected. The authorities
are undertaking activities to correct the current imbalance in the composition of the public
administration, especially through the employment of members of the communities who have not
been sufficiently represented. Special attention has been paid to accomplish this representation in
the police so that it would reflect the breakdown of the population of Macedonia. The equal
representation of persons belonging to all communities into public bodies at all levels and in other
fields of public life has become one of the fundamental values of the Constitution with its VI
Amendment (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 91/01). Hence, changes have been
made in the following laws: the Law on Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, Nos. 59/00, 112/00, 34/01, 103/01, 43/02, 98/02, 17/03, 40/03, 85/03, 17/04 and 69/04),
the Law on Labour Relations (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 80/93, 03/94,
14/95, 53/97, 59/97, 21/98, 25/00, 34/00, 50/01, 25/03, 40/03 and 80/03 – consolidated text), the

428/453

Law on Public Enterprises (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 38/96, 9/97, 06/02
and 40/03), and the Law Amending the Law on Internal Affairs (“Official Gazette of the Republic of
Macedonia”, No. 38/02), as well as in the Rulebook on Criteria, Standards and Procedures for
Employment and Selection of Civil Servants (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
59/01). The Ombudsman has an adequate role in the implementation of this principle in practice.
He/she undertakes concrete activities for the protection from discrimination and for securing
equitable representation of members of communities.
This policy has resulted in a visible increase of the members of communities in the public
administration, army, police and judiciary. On this, for more details see I_J_4 and I_J_7.
18. Is there a minority rights ombudsman or any other official body that protects the rights of
minorities in your country? Please also indicate which Government department(s) is/are
responsible for minority issues.
The Republic of Macedonia has introduced the institution of an Ombudsman on 03.07.1997 when the
first Ombudsman was appointed by the Assembly.
The competencies of the Ombudsman are set out in the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 52/91, 01/92, 31/98, 91/01 and 84/03) and the
Law on the Ombudsman (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 60/03).
According to Article 77 (Amendment XI) of the Constitution, the Ombudsman protects the
constitutional and legal rights of citizens when these are violated by bodies of the state administration
and by other bodies and organisations with public mandates. The Ombudsman shall give particular
attention to safeguarding the principles of non-discrimination and equitable representation of
communities in public bodies, bodies of the units of local self-government and public institutions and
services.
Therefore, in accordance with the Law on the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman protects the
constitutional and legal rights of citizens and also implements actions and measures for the
protection of the principles of non-discrimination and equitable representation of members belonging
to communities in state administrative bodies and in the bodies of the units of local self-government
as well as in public institutions and agencies.
This general position concerning the protection of minority rights is elaborated in further provisions of
the Law, which stipulate the following:
−

−

−

A request to the Ombudsman can be submitted by any person who believes that his or her
constitutional or legal rights have been violated, or believes that a violation of the principles of
non-discrimination and equitable representation of members belonging to communities in
state administrative bodies and other bodies and organisations with public competencies has
occurred (Article 13);
The Ombudsman can give his/her opinion with regard to the protection of constitutional and
legal rights and also to the protection of the principles of non-discrimination and equitable
representation of members belonging to communities concerning a case which is in process,
regardless of the type and stage of the process instituted before state administrative bodies
and other bodies and organisations with public competences (Article 28);
It is within the competency of the Ombudsman to monitor situations with regard to the
safeguarding of the respect for and the protection of constitutional and legal rights of citizens
as well as the principles of non-discrimination and equitable representation of members
belonging to communities. The Ombudsman may visit and carry out inspections on state
administrative bodies and other bodies and organisations with public competencies (Article
29). The Law on the Ombudsman allows for the possibility of the establishment and
organisation of departments that are to provide for a higher level of efficiency and success
regarding the protection of the constitutional and legal rights of citizens in particular fields.

429/453

In addition, Article 78 of the Constitution (Amendment XII) states that the Assembly establishes a
Committee on Inter-Community Relations. The Committee consists of nineteen members, of whom
seven members each appointed from the ranks of the Macedonian and Albanian Representatives in
the Assembly and one member each from among the Turks, Vlachs, Roma, Serbs and Bosniaks in
the Assembly. If a community has no Representatives in the Assembly, following consultations with
relevant representatives from that particular community, the Ombudsman proposes the remaining
members of the Committee. The Assembly appoints the members of the Committee.
Government departments responsible for minority issues
The following special bodies have been established within the Government of the Republic of
Macedonia and also within state administrative bodies for the promotion of the culture and education
of members of communities in the Republic of Macedonia:
1. Ministry of Culture, Office for Affirmation and Promotion of the Culture of Members of
Communities in the Republic of Macedonia
In accordance with Article 26, Paragraph 2, of the Law on the Organisation and Operation of State
Administrative Bodies (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 58/00 and 44/02), in
2003 an Office for Affirmation and Promotion of the Culture of Members of Communities in the
Republic of Macedonia, within the Ministry of Culture was established, without the status of a legal
entity, which is headed by a director, and appointed and dismissed by the Government of the
Republic of Macedonia.
In accordance with the Regulations of the Ministry of Culture, the Office for Affirmation and Promotion
of the Culture of Members of Communities in the Republic of Macedonia performs activities regarding
the affirmation, promotion and publication of the cultural creative work and the care, nurturing and
presentation of the cultural heritage of the members of communities in the Republic of Macedonia, as
well as analytical, administrative and technical activities with regard to the encouragement and
promotion of the culture of these communities.
This Office consists of two Sectors:
-

-

Sector for Affirmation, Promotion and Publication of Cultural Creative Work and for the Care,
Nurturing and Presentation of the Cultural Heritage of the Members of Communities in the
Republic of Macedonia; and
Sector for Encouragement and Promotion of Cooperation with Neighbouring and European
Countries and for International Technical Assistance with the aim of fostering and promoting
the cultural identity of the members of communities in the Republic of Macedonia.

2. Ministry of Education and Science, Office for the Development and Promotion of Education
in the Languages of Members of Communities
In accordance with the Law on Organisation and Operation of State Administrative Bodies, an Office
for Development and Promotion of Education in the Languages of Members of Communities was
established within the Ministry of Education and Science.
The Office is responsible for the implementation of tasks concerning the education of members of
communities in accordance with the constitutional provisions and international conventions signed by
the Republic of Macedonia, with the participation of all the bodies of the Government of the Republic
of Macedonia and other state bodies and institutions responsible for the education of members of
communities.
The Office aims to overcome language barriers and to promote inter-ethnic confidence, through
building a democratic model and relations encouraging a more effective socialisation and inclusion of
members of the various linguistic communities within the social fabric of the Republic of Macedonia.

430/453

The Office places special emphasis on the prevention of discrimination in the field of education and in
the entire educational process.
In addition to these bodies, the Office of Human Rights, Legal Analysis and Comparative Law, which
is active within the Ministry of Justice, and the Office for the Council of Europe and Human Rights,
within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are contributing, at a more general level, to the provision,
promotion and protection of human rights, which include minority rights.
19. Are any "stateless" people living in the Republic of Macedonia as a result of the
dissolution of the SFRY?
Taking into account the former and the existing regulations defining the issue of citizenship, it could
be concluded that there are no stateless persons in the Republic of Macedonia or de jure persons
without citizenship as a result of the dissolution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(SFRY). Some citizens who have not regulated their Macedonian citizenship and whose status has
not been regulated in the process of succession (i.e. de facto they do not have a citizenship) are in
the process of formalising their status given that all citizens who had lived in the territory of the former
SFRY had had de iure and de facto both a federal and a republic citizenship.
Namely, pursuant to the legal regulations on the citizenship in the former SFRY and in the Republic
of Macedonia as its constituent part, which had been valid during the existence of the former SFRY Law on Citizenship of the FPRY (“Official Gazette of the FPRY”, No. 54/46); Law on Citizenship of
the PRM (“Official Gazette of the PRM”, No. 16/50); Law on Yugoslav Citizenship “(Official Gazette of
the SFRY”, No. 38/64); Law on Citizenship of the SRM (“Official Gazette of the SRM”, No. 09/65);
Law on Citizenship of the SFRY (“Official Gazette of the SFRY”, No. 58/76) and the Law on
Citizenship of the SRM (“Official Gazette of the SRM”, No. 19/77), a dual citizenship existed. In
accordance with the aforementioned regulations, in addition to the federal citizenship, every citizen of
the former SFRY had also had a Republic citizenship and vice versa.
The Law had also prescribed that a citizen could only be entitled to one Republic citizenship.
Acquisition of a citizenship of another Republic used to mark a loss of the right to citizenship of the
previous Republic. The possession of a Republic citizenship had not been connected to the citizen’s
residence, which meant that a citizen of any of the Republics of the former SFRY had been entitled to
the option to live in one Republic and posses an identification card of another. However, a citizen of
SFRY had been entitled to one Republic citizenship and one identification card.
After the dissolution of the former SFRY, the Republic of Macedonia adopted the Law on Citizenship
of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 67/92, 08/04 and
45/04-consolidated text) which entered into force on 11.11.1992.
This Law eliminated the duality of federal and republic citizenships and established a single
citizenship for the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia.
The principle of legal continuity of the citizenship status of the citizens of Macedonia has been fully
incorporated into this Law. All citizens that have had the citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia
pursuant to the previous regulations were not required to prove their citizenship status. The
Citizenship Registry that had been updated by hand from 1947 until 1992 was used as a basis for the
transfer of citizenship data into the Citizenship Registry of the Republic of Macedonia.
The fact that registration of residence in one of the former Yugoslav republics had not been
conditioned by the Republic’s citizenship and as a result of the intensive inter-republic migrations
during the time of the SFRY, there were persons in the Republic of Macedonia who after its
independence continued to reside without having a citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia (they
have been and they still are citizens of one of the former Yugoslav republics).
In order to enable these persons to acquire a citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia as easily as
possible, so that they would be able to exercise their civil, social and other rights, the Law on

431/453

Citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia of 1992 contained a transitional provision, pursuant to
which the citizens of the former Yugoslav republics and the citizens of the former SFRY who had
registered their residence in the territory of the Republic of Macedonia, were allowed to acquire
Macedonian citizenship, if within a year from the entry into force of the Law on Citizenship they
applied for citizenship, they had permanent incomes, if they were adults and if prior to filing the
request they had lived on the territory of Macedonia for at least 15 years.
In order to fully adhere to the European Convention on Citizenship signed by the Republic of
Macedonia on 06.11.1997 and ratified on 18.02.2002 and taking into account the experiences from
the practical implementation of the Law on Citizenship, on 22.01.2004, the Government passed the
Law Amending the Law on Citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the
Republic of Macedonia”, No. 08/04) which entered into force on 02.03.2004.
By passing the amendments to the Law, the Government has corrected the reservation to the
European Convention on Citizenship (Chapter 3, Article 6, Paragraph 3), which referred to the length
of stay as a valid condition to apply for citizenship on the basis of naturalisation. Pursuant to the
Draft-Recommendations by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), as of
25.06.2004, the length of stay has been reduced to less than 10 years, i.e. in accordance with Article
3 of the latest amended Law, Article 7, paragraph 2 prescribes at least 8 years of duration of stay
before applying for citizenship.
In addition, this Law also contains a new transitional provision relating to persons originating from the
former SFRY who have continued to live in Macedonia after the date of state succession and had
registered their residence in the Republic of Macedonia by 08.11.1991 and by the time of application
had permanently lived therein. Namely, they may acquire Macedonian citizenship if within two years
after the entry into force of this Law they apply for citizenship, unless they are subject to criminal
procedures for crimes endangering the security and the defence of Macedonia. In addition, they must
be 18 years of age and must speak Macedonian to the degree that they may easily communicate
with their surrounding.
Hence, persons who are citizens of the former SFRY who live in the Republic of Macedonia and who,
due to various reasons, have not regulated their citizenship, may acquire the citizenship of the
Republic of Macedonia.
In addition (and in accordance with the ECRI recommendations), the Republic of Macedonia in
coordination with UNHCR, beginning from December 2004 started an information campaign
throughout the state with an objective to fully and thoroughly inform all relevant persons, including the
Roma and Albanian population, on the opportunities given by the extended deadline for the
regulation of their citizenship status in accordance with the law.
The whole network of Macedonian non-governmental organisations supported by UNHCR has joined
the campaign. The campaign also envisages free legal aid and assistance to applicants provided by
NGO legal teams. In addition, the campaign envisages information advertisements in several radio
stations that cover the whole territory of Macedonia. TV advertisements are also planned in various
languages.
It is of exceptional importance to note that all procedures before the Ministry of the Interior initiated
pursuant to Articles 7 and 9 shall be subject to procedure in accordance with the provisions of the
new Law (Article 14), which gives the citizenship applicants a privileged status and treatment.
The processed data on positively resolved applications for citizenship after the adoption of the new
amendments (22.01.2004) indicate that the Ministry of the Interior has been acting efficiently and has
granted 580 citizenships on the basis of the application of Article 14. There are another 800
applications that are currently being reviewed. During the same period, 41 persons have been
declined their application due to the length and continuity of their residence in Macedonia, while only
8 persons have been declined due to the insufficient knowledge of Macedonian language.

432/453

In accordance with the existing legal regulations, those whose applications have been declined may
appeal before the Second-Instance Government Commission and then to the Supreme Court of the
Republic of Macedonia. At the same time, there have also been applications for discharge of
Macedonian citizenship pursuant to the obligation of dismissal and reception that these citizens have,
after acquiring citizenship in one of the EU countries according to their laws.

K. RETURN OF REFUGEES AND DISPLACED PERSONS:
1. Statistics: Please provide statistics for the following categories of persons:
(a) Refugees from the Republic of Macedonia who went to other countries during (1) the
Kosovo crisis of 1999; (2) the crisis of 2001. What proportion of these refugees has returned?
(b) Refugees from other countries who came to the Republic of Macedonia. When did they
arrive and what proportion has returned?
(c) Displaced persons within the Republic of Macedonia. How many were there in 2001 and
how many have returned?
(a)
Official data on the number of persons who have sought asylum in other countries is not available in
the Republic of Macedonia. The only available data is the number of Macedonian citizens who have
requested assistance with their repatriation in the Republic of Macedonia. The number of such
persons is 842 refugees who have been on the territory of Kosovo.
(b)
As a result of the Kosovo crisis in 1999, in the first half of that year, international protection in the
Republic of Macedonia has been requested by approximately 360.000 refugees - ethnic Albanians
mainly, originating from Kosovo. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia, on 02.03.1999,
adopted a Conclusion for Granting Temporary Protection. The majority of these persons – around
234.000 (64,9%) were hosted in families in the Republic of Macedonia. The remaining 126.000
(35,1%) were accommodated within the eight collective centres that have been build for this purpose
country wide. The Collective Centre Stenkovec which is in the vicinity of Skopje, accommodated the
largest portion of persons – 91.476, or about 72,6%.
In accordance with the international principle of shared responsibility in cases of mass-influx of
refugees, and aiming to alleviate the pressure on the Republic of Macedonia, 28 European states,
USA, Canada and Australia took over from the Republic of Macedonia 4 a total of 94.408 Kosovo
refugees. As soon as the security situation in Kosovo improved, 50.572 persons that have been
transferred to third countries, were repatriated through the territory of the Republic of Macedonia. A
certain number returned directly to Kosovo and a certain number is still present in these countries.
As the security situation in Kosovo was improving, the ethnic Albanian Kosovo refugees sheltered in
the Republic of Macedonia have voluntarily returned to their homes. By the end of 1999, on the
territory of the Republic of Macedonia there were 8.103 refugees under the Temporary Protection
Status. The majority of them were non-Albanian citizens of Kosovo, i.e. Roma, who have fled the
Yugoslav province after the return of the ethnic Albanian refugees. On the basis of voluntary
repatriation or upon individual voluntary departure in third countries, the total number of refuges
under temporary protection status in Macedonia was decreasing. At the end of the 2000, the total
number of persons under temporary protection in the Republic of Macedonia was 5.416 refugees,
and further decreased to 3.410 at the end of 2001; and 2.750 at the end of 2002.
On 22.09.2003, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia adopted a Conclusion abolishing the
temporary protection for the refugees from Kosovo. In doing so, all those refugees who deemed that
4

14.104 in Germany; 8.045 in Turkey; 7.648 in the USA; 6.501 in Italy; 5.801 in Norway; 5.461 in France; 5.006
in Canada; 4.795 in Austria; 3.828 in the Netherlands; 3.597 in the UK, etc.

433/453

conditions for a safe return and stay in Kosovo had not yet been met, were allowed to file individual
applications for recognition of the right to asylum in the Republic of Macedonia, pursuant to the new
Law on Asylum and Temporary Protection (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.
49/03), that entered into force in August 2003. A total number of 2.326 persons have invoked this
right. Acting upon submitted applications, the Asylum Unit within the Ministry of Interior has granted
refugee status to 12 asylum-seekers; granting also the right to asylum on the humanitarian grounds
for 809 persons. A number of 209 applications for seeking asylum were rejected; and in 199 cases
the determination procedures for the right to asylum were suspended due to various reasons (nonavailability/ failure to appear at the interview; regulated residence on the basis of the Law on
Movement and Residence of Aliens (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 36/92,
66/92, 26/93, 45/02, 49/03). Procedures are still underway for the remaining 1.097 asylum seekers
applicants.
(c)
During the crisis in the Republic of Macedonia, a number of citizens from the crisis regions, in fear for
their safety, moved to other regions of the country and acquired a status of internally displaced
persons (IDPs). The number of the internally displaced persons during the 2001 crisis at one point
reached its maximum of 76.046 (on 11.09.2001).
Out of this number, 72.134 were accommodated within the host families, while the remaining 3.912
persons were accommodated within 21 collective centres throughout the country. Once the
conditions were created for their return (reconstruction of homes), many of these persons returned to
their homes.
Currently there are still 1424 internally displaced persons in the Republic of Macedonia, which means
that a total of 74.622 persons have returned to their homes. From the current total figures of 1424
internally displaced persons, 794 are Macedonians, 397 are Serbs, 110 Roma, 106 Albanians and 17
Bosniaks.
2. Legal and regulatory framework: Please enumerate and describe the legal and regulatory
framework governing the return of refugees and displaced persons.
The legal and regulatory framework of the Republic of Macedonia governing the return of refugees
and internally displaced persons in the country comprises international instruments and national
legislation. This process took place in a time when Macedonia was affected by the refugee crisis in
1999 and the internal armed conflict in 2001. In such circumstances, along with the development of
legislation and implementation mechanisms, authorities in Macedonia were faced with large scale
crises that posed serious risks.
Hence, the first mass influx of refugees from the Kosovo crisis in 1999 was handled on the basis of
the Macedonian Government's conclusion on acceptance of persons massively fleeing from Kosovo
into Macedonia and on granting them a status of persons under humanitarian protection. This
decision was in accordance with the EXCOM conclusions No. 15-1979, 22-1981, 74-1994 and
especially the 9541/01 Directive on minimum standards for giving temporary protection in the event
of mass influx of displaced persons.
After the initial consolidation of mass influx and creation of conditions for the application of the status
determination procedure, and after the individual review of applications for a refugee status (as
opposed to the collective mode of determining their status in the course of fleeing, the prima face
criteria), the regulatory framework in this period was the application of the Convention Relating to the
Status of Refugees from 1951 and the Protocol on the Refugee Status from 1967 ratified by the
Republic of Macedonia.
On 25.07.2003, the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia adopted the Law on Asylum and
Temporary Protection (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 49/03) which is a primary
law regulating the issues of refugees and asylum seekers. It also regulates the conditions under

434/453

which the Republic of Macedonia may issue temporary protection and the rights arising from such
status (Article 1).
The adoption of this Law was in fact the implementation of the National Action Plan on Asylum and
Migration adopted in October 2002, within the Stability Pact initiative.
The Law on Asylum and Temporary Protection was adopted in accordance with provisions of the
Convention (1957) and Protocol (1967) and is a concrete implementation of these international
instruments in the national context, regardless of the fact that Macedonia had previously ratified them
without any reservations.
It is also important to mention Article 61 of the Law on Asylum relating to voluntary repatriation and
organisation of this repatriation by the Ministry of Interior in co-operation with UNHCR, which may
occur after the expiry of the right to asylum in the Republic of Macedonia.
The crisis in 2001 caused a number of internal migrations in Macedonia. Key regulatory framework is
the Ohrid Framework Agreement, which in Annex C, item 3 – Refugee Return, Rehabilitation and
Reconstruction (for the text and details see the answer to the question I_C_14) regulates the mode of
return of refugees and internally displaced persons in the Republic of Macedonia. Hence, the
Framework Agreement is still the most important regulatory framework for the return of refugees and
internally displaced persons.
Additionally, a wider regulatory framework comprise the more significant conclusions and ad hoc
guidelines adopted by Government crisis bodies regarding particular issues related to refugees and
internally displaced persons. For instance: as a result of lack of facilities to accommodate the
internally displaced persons, the Government adopted a decision to disburse accommodation and
alimentation costs in collective centres. After the normalisation of conditions and completion of
reconstruction of destroyed or damaged houses in crisis areas in the course of 2003, the
Government passed a decision to revoke the status of an internally displaced person to a certain
number of persons given that prerequisites for their return had been created.
The Ministry of Labour and Social Policy disposes of data on internally displaced persons in January
2005, according to which the total number of these persons is 1424, while the number of persons
temporarily residing in Kosovo is 837.
All readmission agreements ratified by Macedonia are part of the wider regulatory framework. This
particularly includes the readmission provisions regulating the return of Macedonian citizens who
have illegally left Macedonia and have been declined a status of a recognised refugee or whose
refugee status has expired in the countries in which they have applied, and with which Macedonia
has signed such readmission agreements 5 .
It is important to note that all readmission agreements have been prepared pursuant to the Council
Recommendations of 30 November 1994 with regard to the specimen of bilateral readmission
agreement between EU member countries and third countries, and pursuant to Recommendations of

5

Ratified Agreements by the Republic of Macedonia:
- Agreement on Readmission with Italy signed on 26.06.1997 (“Official Gazette of the RM”, No. 34/97);
- Agreement on Readmission with Switzerland on 16.04.1988 (“Official Gazette of the RM”, No. 27/98);
- Agreement on Readmission with Slovenia on 27.01.1998 (“Official Gazette of the RM”, No. 21/98);
- Agreement on Readmission with France on 08.10.1999 (“Official Gazette of the RM”, No. 13/99);
- Agreement on Readmission with Slovakia on 23.01.2002 (“Official Gazette of the RM”, No. 13/02);
- Agreement on Readmission with Bulgaria on 30.01.2002 (“Official Gazette of the RM”, No. 12/02);
- Agreement on Readmission with Croatia on 20.06.2002 (“Official Gazette of the RM”, No. 47/02);
- Agreement on Readmission with Germany on 26.06.2002 (“Official Gazette of the RM”, No. 09/04);
- Agreement on Readmission with Hungary has been signed and is in the process of ratification;
- There are ongoing negotiations with the countries of Benelux, Denmark, Ukraine, Romania, the Czech
Republic and Albania.

435/453

24.07.1995 regarding the principles on preparation of protocols on implementation of readmission
agreements.
Another relevant act regulating the return of refugees and internally displaced persons is the
Amnesty Law (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 18/02), which grants amnesty to
perpetrators of crimes related to the conflict in 2001 and hence their return in Macedonia has been
facilitated.
Precisely, Article 1 of this Law reads: “This Law releases from prosecution, terminates criminal
procedures and fully acquits (hereinafter: amnesty) citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, persons
with legal residence as well as persons having property or family in the Republic of Macedonia
(hereinafter: persons), for which there is reasonable doubt that they have organised or perpetrated
crimes related to the conflict in 2001, 26 September 2001 inclusive. The amnesty also covers
persons who have organised or perpetrated crimes before 1 January 2001 related to the conflict in
2001.
Provisions in this law do not refer to persons who have committed crimes related to the conflict in
2001 and who are under the competence of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia.”
The return of refugees from the Republic of Macedonia who have sought asylum in other countries is
assisted by the UNHCR. These persons during the return process enjoy all rights pursuant to existing
legal regulations as other Macedonian citizens.
3. Please provide statistics for reconstruction: number of houses reconstructed to date;
break-down by year, ethnicity, cost; number of requests still pending (including details of the
ethnicity of those whose requests are still pending); envisaged deadline for the processing of
such requests; envisaged deadline for completion of reconstruction.
The number of houses that have been reconstructed to date is in total 6051 houses, including 4873
of first and second category and 1178 of third and fourth category.
Break-down by year:
By the end of 2002, a total of 5337 houses were reconstructed, including 4873 houses of first and
second category (from these 200 houses were audited and again fixed in 2004) and 464 houses of
third and fourth category.
By the end of 2003 a total of 677 houses of third and fourth category were reconstructed; whereas in
2004 a total of 37 houses of third and fourth category were reconstructed, and over 200 of first and
second category were audited.

Number of reconstructed houses according to the ethnic affiliation of owners:
-

5253 houses of Albanians
798 houses of Macedonians/Serbs/Others

Reconstruction costs:
The international community and donors have hitherto secured approximately 33, 9 million EUR
covering the costs of reconstruction of the aforementioned houses as well as the reconstruction of
the following ones which are still under way:
− 29 houses in M. Maala and Brest,
− 19 houses (12 houses of first and second category and 7 houses of third and fourth category)
in Tanuševci, and
− 102 houses of first and second category in Tetovo and its vicinity, including 6 houses in the
village of Slupčane.

436/453

Number of requests still pending (Houses that have not been included in the hitherto reconstruction
programmes)
Due to various reasons there are another 112 houses that have not entered the process of
reconstruction. One of the reasons is the fact that a large portion of these houses are seasonal, i.e.
are used in a certain time of the year; hence the reconstruction programme has envisaged their
reconstruction at a later phase. The rest are houses with problems of determining their legality, i.e.
they have been erected on an undefined land in the property of the Republic of Macedonia (in the
villages of Raduša and Dumanovce).
Also, some houses have been vandalised and ruined after the reconstruction, thus they cannot be
used (in the villages of Opae and Otunje). Approximately 570.000 EUR are necessary for the
renovation of these houses. (See table)
In addition, there are still unreconstructed houses in the village of Aračinovo (76) and Matejče (119)
as owners (users) of the houses have either refused reconstruction aid or have refused to sign the
reconstruction contract.
According to claims of the Association of Citizens “Associated Organisation of Displaced Persons
from Aračinovo – “Zora”, out of 176 houses owned by ethnic Macedonians, during the conflict 40
houses have been completely destroyed, and after the conflict 13 have been burnt down. Around 80
houses have been hitherto reconstructed; over 30 have been sold; while around 60 families have
begun construction or have bought lands in nearby villages and settlements as a result of lack of
confidence for a continued life in the village. Approximately 1.942.600 EUR are necessary for the
reconstruction of these houses (see table).
Other houses that have not been reconstructed are those that do not meet the criteria for
reconstruction (such as summer kitchens, garages, insured houses, houses without property rights,
deserted houses, second houses, houses not used for living, etc.). During the first assessment they
were registered as damaged; however, during a detailed technical assessment their status was
determined. The number of these houses is 164.
Envisaged deadline for completion of reconstruction
The aforementioned houses currently under reconstruction are: 29 in M. Maala and Brest; 19 (12 of
first and second category and 7 of third and fourth category) in Tanuševci; and 102 of first and
second category in Tetovo and its vicinity, including 6 houses in the village of Slupčane that should
be completed by the end of 2004. The remaining 112 houses will be reconstructed after securing
reconstruction funds in 2005 (see table).
Houses that have not been completed due to refusal to sign tripartite contracts (Aračinovo 76 and
Matejče 119) will be reconstructed after conditions for their reconstruction are met, i.e. after the
signing of reconstruction agreements and securing funds.

4. Explain your overall policy on the return of refugees and displaced persons. Explain which
efforts have been made to overcome the tensions and difficulties that resulted from the 2001
crisis, and in particular:
- to promote inter-ethnic confidence and security of persons and goods;
- to revitalise the economy of the former crisis areas.
By the end of December 2004, as result of the 2001 crises In Republic of Macedonia, there were
1424 internally displaced persons, out of which 468 persons are hosted by the host families and the
rest of 956 persons are sheltered within the collective centres in city of Kumanovo and Skopje.
The accommodation cost and of food for the internally displaced persons sheltered within the
collective centres is provided and covered in total by the budget of Republic of Macedonia. For the
internally displaced persons hosted by families, a family packages are provided on monthly basis,
and for the families that are hosting internally displaced persons a monthly amount of 75 EUR is
provided as grant.
In addition, for the persons who have returned to their reconstructed homes and have no basic home
furnishings, a one-off install grant is being provided, by the Ministry of labour and Social Policy, and
so far more than 350 families have received this kind of assistance.

438/453

The Government official attitude towards internally displaced persons is to support the return to their
homes in spite of difficulties and constrains that may be met and regardless of the time this may take.
In doing so, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia will continue to take all the measures
within its capacity to ensure return for the remaining 1424 persons to their homes.
In regards of the return of the refugees, all information are provided in the answer of the question in
the I_K_2 and 24_F_10.
In this context, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia is paying special attention to several
questions, all related to the reconstruction of damaged homes during the 2001 conflict, security
conditions, and the revitalisation of the former crisis areas.
During the 2001 crisis in the Republic of Macedonia, a total of 6,678 houses were damaged in the
crisis areas. At the moment there are only 112 remaining houses qualified for reconstruction.
The Government of the Republic of Macedonia consider this process as being successfully brought
to an end with the financial assistance of the international community. A total of 32 million EUR have
been awarded at the Donors’ Conference in Brussels for the reconstruction of the damaged homes
and additional 1.9 million EUR was reallocated from the CARDS programme for this purpose.
With the end of the 2001 crisis, and by the signature of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, the major
paths were defined for overcoming of the tensions and difficulties as result of the crises
Namely in the Annex C of the Ohrid Framework Agreement a number of measures have been
envisaged aimed at restoring interethnic confidence as well as the confidence between the local
population in the former crisis areas and the police.
In order to implement the provisions of the Ohrid Framework Agreement as an assigned strategic
priority, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia adopted a special Plan on the Implementation
of the Framework Agreement, which envisages the following measures in connection with the
promotion of interethnic confidence and the security of persons and property:
−

−
−

Strengthening of security and safety in the areas involved in the 2001 crisis, including the
reconstruction and rebuilding of demolished or damaged police stations (Matejče, Tearce,
Žerovjane and Raduša), and the creation of the necessary conditions for their normal
functioning, as well as the construction of a new police stations in areas assessed as needing
strengthened security (Aračinovo).
Strengthening of the presence of an adequate number of police officers from different ethnic
origin and re-gaining the competences by the police in the former crisis areas, and
Continuation of activities aimed at mutual confidence building between the police, the local
population and local self-government in these populated areas.

In this context, the police stations in Aračinovo and Matejče were built (through a donation from the
governments of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of
Hungary), and the police station in Žerovjane has been reconstructed (through a USAID donation
from the United States). The project for the construction of a police station in Tearce is currently
under way (following a donation from the Norwegian Government), i.e. the construction works will
commence in March. The equipment for all of them has been provided by the Government of the
Republic of Macedonia, i.e. from the Ministry of the Interior.
At the same time, the Principal Plan for the Return of the Police Force to the former crisis areas was
fully implemented. A result of its implementation is that a mixed police force is now successfully
performing its functions in the field.
Through various projects initiated by international implementing agencies and the non-governmental
sector, in cooperation and coordination with the Ministry of the Interior and the OSCE, the mutual
confidence was strengthened and promoted, including the security of persons and property, the

439/453

development of cooperation between the police and the population at local level through the
establishment of special citizens’ counselling groups, as well as the reform of the police with the aim
of ensuring better quality services to citizens.
As far as the revitalisation of the former crisis areas is concerned, the Government of the Republic of
Macedonia adopted a special Programme of Activities for the Economic Revitalisation of the Former
Crisis Areas.
The main objective of the Programme is to initiate a new stage of activities following the
implementation of the process of reconstruction of damaged homes, i.e. a stage in which efforts will
be intensified to achieve economic growth in the former crisis areas.
The areas in which the future activities of the programme should be concentrated are the following:
agriculture, the communal sector and business.
In this context, a special Action Plan of Activities for Revitalisation is being foreseen, and which is
currently in the final phase of preparation. During the preceding one-year period, a number of
projects have been completed in the aforementioned areas as defined in the programme, primarily
through appropriate annual programmes developed by the Government of the Republic of
Macedonia, but also through the close cooperation with the donor community.
With regard to the revitalisation of the roads, the water supply and sewage systems, and the
telecommunications infrastructure, it has to be noted that this has been almost fully completed
through the intervention funds from the international community and the participation of several public
companies from the Republic of Macedonia, in accordance with the programme for urgent measures
adopted by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia and presented at the Donors’ Conference
in Brussels in March 2002.
In order to support the implementation of the Framework Agreement (Annex C — ConfidenceBuilding Measures) and rehabilitation of the 2001 crises consequences, the Government of the
Republic of Italy and the Government of Republic of Macedonia, provided an amount of 1.3 million
EUR for the purpose of the economic revitalisation of the former crisis areas. These funds were
reallocated from the programme for the reconstruction of a number of damaged houses in the village
of Matejče, whose owners had not signed the tripartite reconstruction contracts.
In this context, at the request of the Government of the Republic of Italy, the implementing agency
International Management Group (IMG) developed a project entitled “Economic Revitalisation of the
Former Crisis Areas”.
The aim of the project is to complete the reconstruction of some of the damaged commercial
buildings through a grant, and also to offer individuals “soft” loans for purchase of machines and
equipment to restart their businesses.
The project will be implemented in the way that will provide the amount of approximately 750.000
EUR (or nearly 60%) of the donation to be used as a grant for completion of the reconstruction of the
damaged commercial buildings and for restart of the production providing for services or agricultural
activities (this refers to only 81 beneficiaries who have qualified). The remaining funds, of up to 1.3
million EUR, will be utilised through grants of restricted loans upon favourable conditions for the
purchase of machines and equipment, and the provision of services, out of which the minimum of
12%, will also be given in the form of grants.
In this context, it is important to emphasise that a total of 3.4 million EUR will be required to complete
the revitalisation process for the qualified 81 legal entities. The remaining amount (above the 1.3
million EUR) is to be offered in the form of loans upon the same conditions provided by the interested
commercial banks and other credit institutions.
According to a preliminary analysis, the aforesaid 81 beneficiaries will create 283 new jobs.

440/453

In the same context, another donation of 400.000 EUR by the Government of the Kingdom of
Denmark should be mentioned, implemented through the project by the Danish Council for Refugees.
The project, which was completed in 2004, was aimed at supporting, among other things, the
economic independence of returnees (former internally displaced persons and refugees) and socially
vulnerable members of communities in the intervention areas, as well as making an overall
contribution to the process of the return and reintegration of internally displaced persons and
refugees in Macedonia.
Based on specific criteria, 181 beneficiaries were selected from the municipalities of Tetovo, Tearce
and Izvor. These beneficiaries were given agricultural machines, livestock or professional equipment,
mostly in the form of grants.
Aware of the importance of the process of economic revitalisation of the former crisis areas, the
Government of the Republic of Macedonia defined it as a strategic priority and therefore envisaged
the initial sum of 10 million MKD budgetary assets for this purpose in accordance with the economic
situation in the country and with the intention of increasing it in the second half of the year.
Other projects by the Government of Republic of Macedonia are being analysed. One part of the
donation provided by the Government of the Republic of China will be utilised for this purpose, in
accordance with the signed bilateral Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation.
At the same time, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia will intensify its activities regarding
the establishment of an adequate institutional structure within the General Secretariat, to ensure
better coordination and management of the process of economic revitalisation of the former crisis
areas.

L. BILATERAL RELATIONS

1. Please provide an overview of your relations with neighbouring countries, and countries of
the Western Balkan Region, including outstanding bilateral issues and prospects for
solutions.
The Republic of Macedonia fosters good relations with all countries in the region of Southeast
Europe (SEE), which are characterised by a progressive development. The Republic of Macedonia
has achieved a high level of co-operation and understanding in the bilateral relations with its
neighbours, which is confirmed by frequent visits, meetings and contacts at all levels. The contractual
framework governing the cooperation and relations is continually developed. In its relations with the
neighbours, the Republic of Macedonia is committed to openly responding to all questions, applying
the highest standards as those applied by member-states of the European Union. Overall, the
relations of the Republic of Macedonia with its neighbours have been adequately balanced and by
such a quality they are continuously developed with a clear European perspective.
The commitment of Republic of Macedonia and its readiness to play an active role in the region has
been reconfirmed by its contribution as an initiator, founder or an active participant in all regional
initiatives. As of the beginning the Republic of Macedonia has been participating in the South-East
European Cooperation Process, being also its productive chair. Furthermore, the Republic of
Macedonia has chaired the Central European Initiative, and has been participating in the Stability
Pact for SEE and SECI since their establishment. The Republic of Macedonia participates in
activities under the Adriatic-Ionian Initiative, and has also been participating in the Danube and the
Szeged Processes. At the same time, the Republic of Macedonia is in a procedure of acquiring fully-

441/453

fledged membership in the Organisation of the Black Sea Economic Co-operation .For more details,
please see answer 27_B_03.
The peaceful departure from the former federation and the peaceful approach while acquiring its
independence was the initial and positive input for the constructive development of the relations of
Republic of Macedonia with the SEE countries. The steps of the Republic of Macedonia in this
context have been acknowledged in Europe and worldwide.
By implementing substantial and rapid reforms rooted in its own needs, and accordingly responding
to regional challenges, the Republic of Macedonia has been confirming itself as a factor of stability in
SEE.
In overcoming the crises and conflicts in the Region, the Republic of Macedonia has proven itself to
be open and co-operative towards initiatives by the European Union and the international community.
The Republic of Macedonia has been pursuing a transparent foreign policy based on mutual
recognition of differences and respect for the sovereignty and identity of the peoples in Southeast
Europe.
Some relations have been burdened with difficulties, the consequences of which are partially present
even today. The source of the so-called open issues among the countries in the Region has been
and still is the slow accommodation of some of the countries to the realities that emerged as a result
of the changes in Central and Southeast Europe.
The commitment to European integration strengthens the stability of this part of Europe. The
accession of the Republic of Macedonia into the Union (the prospects for accession of other
countries in the Region, as well) will reduce the influence of patterns of conflict from the past and will
open prospects for all nations and states. At the same time, the Union will be free to deal with other
challenges. In essence, all known issues in the relations between the Republic of Macedonia and its
neighbours can be resolved by the full adherence to the United Nations Charter, OSCE Final
Document, and the Charter of Paris, as well as by respect of high standards enshrined in all relevant
conventions for human and minority rights, and with the respect and implementation of values,
principles and basic acts of the European Union.
REVIEW OF BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH THE NEIGHBOURS AND THE COUNTRIES OF THE
WESTERN BALKANS
The relations with the Republic of Albania are good and dynamic and their progress is particularly
evident at the bilateral political level. The relations are characterised by an open dialogue on all
issues of mutual interest, accompanied with intensive co-operation in all fields. There are frequent
visits at all levels and in all fields. The Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Albania share the
same foreign policy goals – the European Union and the Euro-Atlantic integration.
The Adriatic Charter and the activities undertaken in its framework aimed at the advancement of the
co-operation in relation to the Euro-Atlantic integration have given particular impetus to the
development of bilateral relations in the last two years. Similar activities are undertaken on the basis
of the signed Memorandum for Co-operation for Exchange of Experiences in the Process of Eurointegration. The Republic of Macedonia continuously supports Albania’s endeavours to join the
European integration processes, as well as its membership of NATO. In the course of development
of bilateral relations, a number of bilateral agreements, protocols and other documents have been
signed creating a solid legal framework for the development of the co-operation. However, their full
and consistent implementation is necessary. The Agreement on Good-Neighbourly Relations and
Friendship is expected to be signed (please see 27_Annex_01). Bilateral relations have reached a
level that enables the successful prevention of negative scenarios for the security in the Region,
particularly following the Kosovo crisis.
The economic co-operation is carried out on the basis of the Free Trade Agreement signed in
March 2002, which in a short period of time provided for increased and more balanced bilateral trade.
However, higher forms of co-operation are still lacking. In 2003 the bilateral trade was 18,81 million

442/453

EUR, of which 15,34 million EUR exports and 3,47 million EUR imports; and in the course of
January-August 2004 the total trade was 13,32 million EUR, of which 9,85 million EUR exports and
3,47 million EUR imports.
The two countries have been coordinating their activities in regional initiatives in order to secure
funds for regional infrastructure projects of mutual interest, such as the Corridor 8, the Euro-region
Ohrid-Prespa projects, environmental protection, etc.
The border co-operation has been carried out on the basis of the signed 7 agreements regulating
the maintenance and demarcation of the border line; measures for prevention and resolution of
border incidents; the visa regime and the facilitation of communication of the border area inhabitants;
legal assistance in civil and criminal law matters; mutual execution of court decisions and extradition.
Visas for citizens of both countries are issued in Diplomatic and Consular Missions and at the bordercrossings. As of June 2000, the Agreement Facilitating Communication of Inhabitants in the Border
Areas has officially been implemented. Its aim is to alleviate the problems regarding illegal crossings
of state borders, thefts, etc. The activities for opening new border-crossings for cross-border
communication, as well as the co-operation based on the implementation of recommendations of the
Border Security and Management Ohrid Conference in the Region are expected to be intensified.
As a result of intensive bilateral meetings at the political level, there are on-going preparations of
treaties that would regulate issues of cultural co-operation and protection of national minority rights
in the two countries in accordance with European standards. The Macedonian national minority in
Albania is organised in several associations registered in accordance with the applicable legislation
in the country; however, representatives of the minority claim that little has been done for the
practical exercise of their human and minority rights. During the population census in the Republic of
Albania, in April 2001, all instruments for methodology testing and validity of data have not been
applied as it was done during the census in the Republic of Macedonia in 2002. Thus significant
differences in data as regards the number of this population have been registered between
governmental and non-governmental expert sources.
There is continuous cooperation co-operation with the Republic of Bulgaria in many fields. The two
countries are building partner relations by assuming contractual obligations on the basis of the
declared mutual interests. The contractual framework of the relations between the two countries has
been completed to a great extend (please see 27_Annex_01). Several other agreements are in
procedure of negotiation or ratification. The accession of the Republic of Bulgaria to the EU and the
accession of the Republic of Macedonia to EU and NATO have been identified as mutual interests
and are the basis for intensive co-operation, in which respect a Memorandum of Co-operation was
signed in August of 2004.
The political bilateral relations are developed through frequent visits at all levels, including the
highest. In addition to the economic co-operation, the two countries also successfully cooperate in
the fields of cross-border cooperation, defence, justice and home affairs, transport and
communication, agriculture, forestry and water management, local self-government, culture,
environment protection and in other fields.
The economic co-operation between the two countries has been carried out pursuant to the Free
Trade Agreement signed in 1999, which has been fully harmonised with the WTO rules. The
Agreement envisages the establishment of a free trade zone as of 01.01.2005. The payment
operations are to be contractually regulated. The trade between the two countries in 2003 was
154,65 million EUR (exports 22,8 million EUR, imports 131,85 million EUR); and in the course of
January-August 2004 the trade was 133,45 million EUR (exports 24,66 million EUR, imports 108,79
million EUR). The Republic of Bulgaria is ranked sixth in terms of overall foreign trade of the Republic
of Macedonia. Bulgarian investments in Macedonia from 1991 until 2004 were approximately 13,30
million EUR.
The two countries have been successfully co-operating in multilateral bodies, primarily in
international organisations, through mechanisms of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Co-operation

443/453

(EAPS) and Partnership for Peace (PfP), and they are members of almost all regional initiatives. The
co-operation under the Stability Pact, mostly in the Second Working Table, is of great importance. In
this respect, Bulgaria and the Republic of Macedonia have submitted projects of mutual interests
(interconnection of railways between the two countries, the 400 kV transmission line from Štip to
Blagoevgrad, new border-crossings, etc). They also actively co-operate in the South East European
Cooperation Process, where, as in the CEI, the priority mutual interest is the construction of Corridor
8, and especially the finalisation of construction of the railroad connection between the two countries.
Issues related to the border between the two countries have been regulated by many bilateral
agreements in several fields. The co-operation in this area will be intensified through the already
reached agreement on convening expert consultations regarding the border, phyto-sanitary and
customs regime, in accordance with the EU standards. Pursuant to the recommendations of the
Ohrid Conference on Border Security and Management, as of 01.09.2004 the border police have
taken over the competence for securing the eastern border towards the Republic of Bulgaria.
The Macedonian national minority in this neighbouring country, as well as the Republic of
Macedonia, expect that by Bulgaria’s advancement towards European Union membership, conditions
for the free expression of ethnic identity of all citizens in Bulgaria will improve. The Republic of
Macedonia is committed to resolving all known open issues through the realisation of human and
minority rights standards in this neighbouring country.
The relations and co-operation with the Hellenic Republic have significantly improved in the last
nine years, after the signing of the Interim Agreement. At the present, there is intensive economic
and other co-operation; however, meetings at the highest political level are still lacking. In October
2004, an Office for Consular and Trade Relations of the Republic of Macedonia was opened in
Thessalonica and a similar office of the Hellenic Republic is expected to be opened in Bitola. The
Republic of Macedonia expects further support from the Hellenic Republic, as the only neighbour,
which is both an EU and NATO member, for its European and Euro-Atlantic integration, as well as
continuation of the activities within the Greek plan for economic revitalisation of the Balkans. In order
to promote the current co-operation, the Republic of Macedonia has proposed several draftagreements, several agreements of which have been harmonized and are expected to be signed in
the near future (see 27_ Annex_03).
Economic co-operation: The Hellenic Republic is the first ranked investment partner of the
Republic of Macedonia, with the investment priorities in the fields of energy, telecommunications and
finance. The Greek investments account for 57% of the total foreign investments in the Republic of
Macedonia. The trade between the two countries is increasing - in 2001 it was 319,47 million EUR
(112,95 million EUR of exports and 206,52 million EUR of imports); in 2002 it was 374,01 million
EUR (123,28 million EUR of exports and 250,73 million EUR of imports); in 2003 it was 426,66
million EUR (158,74 million EUR of exports and 267,92 million EUR of imports) and in the course of
January-August 2004 the trade was 263,59 million EUR (115,40 million EUR of exports and 148,19
million EUR of imports). The increase of trade, higher forms of co-operation and organised regional
interconnections are the main tasks in terms of future activities.
At the same time, the regional and multilateral co-operation has been successfully carried out
under regional initiatives and international organisations, with a focus on the trilateral co-operation,
as well, which includes the Republic of Albania.
In the context of the border between the two countries (which in accordance with undertaken
reforms has been secured by the border police at the side of the Republic of Macedonia) there have
been no problems for a longer period. This co-operation was particularly successful and intense
during the complex operation of securing the Olympic Games, and is expected to continue in the
future. Taking into account its commitment to accession to the European Union, the Republic of
Macedonia expects new measures to be undertaken at the bilateral level in accordance with the EU
criteria, that would adjusted the current border-crossing regime to the new conditions and trends.

444/453

On the other hand, full diplomatic relations between the two countries have not yet been established
as it is stipulated in the Interim Accord signed in 1995.
In addition, the two countries have not yet considered the issue of former citizens of the Hellenic
Republic who have been deprived of their citizenship and whose entry and stay in the Hellenic
Republic has been denied under decrees adopted by former Greek governments. In this context, still
unresolved is the exercise of property rights in the Hellenic Republic by current Macedonian citizens
and their descendants. This and other questions with regard to national minority rights have been
raised by the Republic of Macedonia, but there are still no effective and open talks at the bilateral
level, in this respect.
An open question in the relations between the Republic of Macedonia and the Helenic Republic is the
objection of the Hellenic Republic to the use of the constitutional name of the Republic of Macedonia.
The Republic of Macedonia has been adhering to its responsibilities assumed under the UN Security
Council Resolution 817 (1993) and has been supporting the continuation of the dialogue process
within the UN, which is to be carried out in a constructive and friendly atmosphere and mutual
respect, in the spirit of good-neighbourly co-operation. The Republic of Macedonia firmly maintains
its position to preserve its constitutional name in the entire internal and international communication.
The Republic of Macedonia expresses readiness to finding a mutually acceptable solution in the
bilateral communication between the two countries.
After the normalisation of the relations of the Republic of Macedonia with Serbia and Montenegro in
1996, the two countries entered a period of co-operation and contractual regulation of their relations
in various fields, which was intensified after the democratic changes in this neighbouring country in
2000. The only open question between the two countries – the delineation and description of the
Macedonian-Yugoslav border – was resolved in this period as well (in 2001). This agreement has
been implemented successfully and the demarcation of the border is expected to be completed in
2005. A new border crossing has been opened to facilitate communication of border area inhabitants,
and currently there are procedures under way for opening additional three such border crossings.
The high level of political bilateral relations and co-operation has been confirmed by the frequent
and numerous highest-level meetings. These relations and co-operation have been characterised by
a positive development trend, with a high level of mutual trust, understanding and goodneighbourliness, which all contribute to the maintenance of the peace and stability in SEE. The
Republic of Macedonia has been supporting Serbia and Montenegros’ endeavours for a speedy
integration into European and Euro-Atlantic processes.
The Republic of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro have signed 23 bilateral agreements and
acts. There are initiatives for signing co-operation agreements in the field of information and
protection of cultural and historical monuments, as well as the Agreement on Good Neighbourly
Relations and Friendship. (see 27_Annex_01).
The economic co-operation has been carried out in accordance with the Free Trade Agreement,
signed in 1996. By concluding agreements for the promotion and mutual protection of investments
and avoidance of double taxation, the two countries have created prerequisites and a solid legal
framework for a more successful co-operation. For the purpose of expanding and promoting the
economic co-operation, in March 2000 the two countries founded a Joint Macedonian-Yugoslav
Chamber. The total trade in 2003 was 429,04 million EUR (241,10 million EUR of exports and 187,94
million EUR of imports) and in the course of January-August 2004 the trade was 292,40 million EUR
(167,37 million EUR of exports and 125,03 million EUR of imports). There are negotiations under way
for the adaptation of the Free Trade Agreement due to changes in the status of the state community
following the Belgrade Agreement.
As a result of the endeavours for the protection of national minorities, on 06.07.2004 the Republic
of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro signed an Agreement on the Protection of the Macedonian
National Minority in Serbia and Montenegro, and the Serbian and Montenegrin national minority in
the Republic of Macedonia, as a first such agreement in the region. The two countries expect that its

445/453

implementation will provide further guarantees for the rights of national minorities in accordance with
international standards.
The Republic of Macedonia is still hosting about 1800 persons, citizens of Serbia and Montenegro,
originating from Kosovo, who have remained in the Republic of Macedonia following the Kosovo
crisis in 1999. In order to resolve their problems the Government has initiated several activities for
their safe return to their places of living.(for more details see answers, I_K_01 and I_K_02)
The Republic of Macedonia continues to closely follow the developments in Kosovo, in accordance
with the UN Security Council Resolution 1244. The Republic of Macedonia is giving its full support
to the UN and international community policies the ultimate goal of which is the establishment of a
true multiethnic community, to promote security, strengthen the democratisation and to establish rule
of law. At the same time, the Republic of Macedonia offers continuous support to the endeavours of
the UN and other relevant factors in the fulfilment of their responsible mission. The Republic of
Macedonia has been developing co-operation with UNMIK and the interim administration of Kosovo,
pursuant to the Resolution 1244 of the UN Security Council, on issues of mutual interest, and
especially concerning practical issues of importance to citizens. The movement of people and goods
to and from Kosovo has been facilitated; there are ongoing preparations for the establishment of a
trade office; and an interim free trade protocol is being drafted.
The Republic of Macedonia has been reiterating that any future status of Kosovo must not result in
the destabilisation of the SEE. The Republic of Macedonia supports the resolution of this issue
through dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina, with enhanced participation by the international
community. With regard to the endeavours for relaxation of the situation in the region, it is especially
important for the Republic of Macedonia that the technical operations for demarcation of the border in
the Kosovo section are complete prior to the ultimate outcome of the Kosovo problem. Hence, the
Republic of Macedonia has been asking for a firm commitment on the part of the international
community to adhere to international principles in order to prevent any unfavourable development.
The relations and co-operation with Bosnia and Herzegovina are good and are developing in all
areas. They are characterised by a continuous political dialogue at all levels, bilaterally and
multilaterally, as well as by readiness for their improvement. Due to the specific and complex
constitutional and legal system of Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially in respect of international
relations, the two countries have signed a few bilateral agreements ( see 27_Annex_01).There are
negotiations under way for the harmonisation of several agreements that can be signed. Five
agreements are in their final phase.
The economic co-operation between the two countries does not match the possibilities of the two
countries, which is partly a result of the situation in the Region, and especially in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. The trade between the two countries has amounted in 2003 to 31,26 million EUR, of
which Macedonian exports amounted to 20,91 million EUR and imports of 10,35 million EUR. The
trade between the two countries for the period of January-August 2004 was 21,78 million EUR, of
which Macedonian exports was 14,68 million EUR and imports of 7,10 million EUR. An additionally
negative factor for a greater economic co-operation has been the absence of a contractual
framework in this area.
The two countries have been successfully co-operating at the multilateral level and under
regional initiatives. The Republic of Macedonia has expressed readiness to share its experiences in
the European Union and Euro-Atlantic integration processes with Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Minorities: Since 1991 a population census has not been organised in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In
1998 a so-called consideration of the number of population and its ethnicity was organised in Bosnia
and Herzegovina, where the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia have been categorised under the
“others” section.
The relations and co-operation with the Republic of Croatia have continuously been developing in
all areas of mutual interest, with readiness expressed by both parties to their further improvement.
The relations have been characterised by friendship; absence of open issues and a political dialogue

446/453

at all levels. The co-operation has especially been dynamic under European and Euro-Atlantic
integration processes. The two countries have signed an Agreement on Co-operation in the context
of EU accession, as one of the obligations arising from the Stabilisation and Association Agreement
with EU (for more details see answer I_L_02), as well as the Memorandum of Co-operation. The two
countries also closely co-operate within the Adriatic Charter.
Bilateral agreements: The two countries have achieved a high level of contractual regulation of cooperation in various areas (22 agreements and 1 protocol – please see 27_Annex_01). They have
also expressed an interest in signing a Payment Operations Agreement, Media Co-operation
Agreement, and Health and Medicine Co-operation Agreement.
As regards economic co-operation, apart from traditional forms, the two countries have announced
more significant mutual investments, as well as investments of Croatian companies in the
Macedonian economy. The trade between the two countries for the period of January-June 2004 was
73,23 million EUR, of which Macedonian exports were 40,46 million EUR and imports of 32,77 million
EUR. The total trade volume between the two countries in 2003 amounted to 104,29 million EUR, of
which Macedonian exports amounted to 58,32 million EUR and imports of 55,97 million EUR.
The two countries have been successfully co-operating at the multilateral level, especially as
regards the candidacy of the Republic of Macedonia for the ECOSOC (for 2005-2007) and Croatia’s
candidacy for a non-permanent UN Security Council member, as well as under regional initiatives.
Minorities: The Republic of Croatia has established a positive position regarding the activities of
Croatian citizens of Macedonian origin. The two countries have established mechanisms for state
support in protection of their ethnic identity and social and political activity.
For more details on the relations between the Republic of Macedonia and other countries in the
neighbourhood and co-operation in regional initiatives, see answer 27_B_03.
2. Please describe the steps you have taken to negotiate a convention on regional
cooperation with Croatia, in accordance with Article 12 of the Stabilisation and Association
Agreement.
Pursuant to its foreign policy commitment to developing neighbourly co-operation, and taking into
account European Union’s criteria defining the successful regional co-operation as one of the
conditions for the integration of the countries of the region into the EU, the Republic of Macedonia
has initiated negotiations with the Republic of Croatia to sign a Convention on Regional Cooperation, to which end it has prepared a draft-text.
The European Commission has been informed on the proposal, and it has welcomed the initiative.
After reviewing the draft-text, the European Commission has given remarks and suggestions, and
parts of them have been incorporated into the text in the course of negotiations.
Meanwhile several joint consultations have been realised as regards the draft-text. Following the
entry into force of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between the Republic of
Macedonia and the European Union, negotiations between the Republic of Macedonia and the
Republic of Croatia have intensified.
Pursuant to Article 12 of the SAA, and taking into account the fact that strengthening of the regional
co-operation between the two countries within the Stabilisation and Association Process is a
significant step forward to accession, the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Croatia have
agreed to sign an Agreement on Co-operation between the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic
of Croatia in the Context of Approximation and Accession to the EU.
In the spirit of co-operation as an incentive to other countries in the region, but also as a contribution
to united and stronger Europe, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the two countries have signed the
Agreement in Skopje on 06.09.2004.

447/453

The Agreement shall come into effect after the completion of internal legal procedures of ratification
within the two contracting parties.
The Republic of Macedonia, pursuant to its legal procedure, has ratified the Agreement in the
Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia on 01.02.2005.
3. How has the SFRY Succession Agreement been implemented? Are there any remaining
difficulties?
The Agreement on issues concerning succession of the former SFRY was signed in June 2001, and
after its last ratification by the Assembly of the Republic of Croatia in 2004, conditions for its entry
into force have been met.
In the course of the final phase of negotiations (April 2001), some of the provisions concerning the
division of state foreign exchange reserves have been implemented. Following the signing of the
Agreement, the implementation of the provision on the division of the diplomatic property of former
SFRY was initiated. After the successful conclusion of negotiations for regulating the debt of the
former USSR to former SFRY, this segment was implemented according to the modalities
determined in the Memorandum and with the agreed between particular countries-successors of the
former SFRY and the Russian Federation, during the additional talks. In 2003, part of the assets that
had been frozen in certain financial institutions in the U.S. were distributed. The committees on
financial issues and diplomatic property responsible for the preparation of the decisions on further
implementation of the Agreement with regard to remaining issues are having regular meetings.
The Republic of Macedonia is firmly determined to continue with its constructive attitude and active
contribution in the realization of this international agreement. Pursuant to provisions of this
Agreement, the Republic of Macedonia is to convene the first assembly of the Permanent Joint
Committee for the Implementation of the Agreement, which is going to enable the institutional basis
for its realisation.
Taking into account the different views and issues that have not yet been tackled, a realistic
assessment on the efficient implementation of the Agreement can be given after the first session of
the Permanent Joint Committee.

M. INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS

1. General
a) How is co-operation with The Hague tribunal organised both at political and operational
levels? Is there a specific legal framework? What is the procedure followed when the
government receives requests for assistance (RFAs) from the ICTY? Which is the
ministry/body in charge?

f) Is your country ready to respond positively to possible future requests for information from

448/453

the ICTY and how do you envisage ensuring the appropriate follow-up?
g) How many cases have been opened by the ICTY and what is the state of the proceedings?
h) Do you have legislation and mechanisms to protect witnesses?
i) What judicial cooperation and extradition mechanisms exist with the other countries which
belonged to the former Yugoslavia?
a)
The Government of the Republic of Macedonia has expressed its firm political commitment and
support regarding the operation and actions of the Hague Tribunal, highly appreciating its role in
undertaking efficient measures to bring to justice the perpetrators of serious war crimes and other
crimes against humanity.
The cooperation has been unimpeded, with full respect of the ICTY documents: the UN Security
Council Resolution 827 (1993); the Statute of the Tribunal adopted by the Resolution and the Rules
of Procedure and Evidence. The Republic of Macedonia, being a UN Member, has obligations under
the Resolution 827, i.e. it has undertaken and fulfilled all legally binding international obligations
deriving from the Resolution and other international documents. The cooperation with the ICTY has
been regulated by the provisions of the Law on Criminal Procedure (“Official Gazette of the Republic
of Macedonia”, Nos. 15/97, 44/02 and 74/04).
May 2004 inclusive, requests for assistance (RFAs) from the ICTY were submitted to the
Government of the Republic of Macedonia, i.e. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which forwarded them to
the Ministry of Justice. Subsequently, the Ministry of Justice, if there was a need, communicated the
Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Defence and the competent court. Replies to RFAs were submitted
to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as the competent ministry for coordination.
b)I
n order to abbreviate the regular procedure and respond to RFAs within the shortest possible period,
as of May 2004 the Ministry of Justice has been in charge of responding to RFAs. The Ministry
approaches the competent court with special request for serving summonses to witnesses and
suspects. The following documents are enclosed therewith: notification of the receipt of summons, list
of addresses and other data previously obtained from the Ministry of the Interior, a copy of Article 29
of the ICTY Statute and Rule 39 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. For suspects, the following
is also enclosed: a copy of Rules 42 and 43 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, regulating the
right to be assisted by a defence attorney and the Instruction on Assignment of Defence Attorney to
the competent court.
If necessary, the Ministry of Justice communicates the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of
Defence requesting consent for relieving persons employed in these Ministries from the obligation to
preserve a state secret, which is to be disclosed to the Tribunal.
c)
In the course of 2004, 22 RFAs were received and all of them were replied. Since May 2004, replies
to 13 of these RFAs were submitted. Out of the total number of the received RFAs, 6 referred to
submission of specific data, information and documents requested by the Tribunal, while 16 RFAs
referred to serving summonses for interviewing persons in the capacity of witnesses and suspects.
So far, 163 summonses have been submitted, including 111 to persons in the capacity of witnesses
and 52 to persons in the capacity of suspects. Since May 2004, 96 summonses have been served for
interviewing persons in the capacity of witnesses and 52 summonses for interviewing persons in the
capacity of suspects. In January 2005, another 3 RFAs on hearing persons in the capacity of
witnesses were delivered to the Ministry of Justice.
d)
Preparation of RFAs replies is conducted in the shortest possible timeframe, respecting obligations
incorporated in the Statute of the Tribunal for acceptance without delays of the ICTY requests and
orders concerning identification and location of persons, taking testimonies, provision of evidence,
and service of summonses (13 days on average).

449/453

All RFAs submitted thus far have received positive replies; out of them 113 RFAs are referring to
interviewing persons in the capacity of witnesses.
e)
All RFAs received so far have been replied. Reasons for delays in submission of replies have been of
objective nature, depending on the particular RFA (number of persons to be served summonses for
interviews; specific nature of the requested data or information). Delays have been due to the
difficulties faced by the delivery service when serving summonses and the need of assistance by the
Ministry of the Interior (more than one person with the same first name and surname; persons who
have moved out; need for police assistance when persons were apprehended by means of force, by
a special order of the investigative judge).
f)
The Republic of Macedonia will continue to cooperate with the ICTY in future. The procedure will be
conducted in accordance with the ICTY Statute and the national legislation. In doing so, the
established cooperation will be further enhanced.
g)
The Government of the Republic of Macedonia and the Ministry of Justice in particular have
confirmed their readiness to cooperate by handing over five cases to the ICTY competence.
Proceeding upon the Decision of the ICTY Trial Chamber of 04.10.2002 on handing over the
competence for investigations and court proceedings regarding five cases – NLA Leadership,
Mavrovo construction workers, Lipkovo Lake, Ljuboten and Neprosteno, the Ministry of Justice
forwarded the aforementioned cases on 29.11.2002.
The RFAs from the Tribunal so far referred to the Ljuboten case.
h)
Protection of witnesses in the Republic of Macedonia has been regulated by Chapter XIX-a of the
Law on Criminal Procedure. Provisions of the Law stipulate that, in the course of proceedings, the
public prosecutor i.e. investigative judge or president of the chamber may undertake actions for
protection of witnesses, collaborators of justice or victims appearing as witnesses in the proceedings,
in case they may be exposed to intimidations, threats of revenge and risks for their life, health and
physical integrity or when their protection is required. The Law on Protection of Witnesses that is
currently in parliamentary procedure (passed first reading) is in line with the efforts to provide
increased protection of witnesses.
i)
Court and extradition cooperation with the countries that belonged to the former Yugoslavia has been
carried out by applying the Council of Europe Conventions – the European Convention on
Extradition, European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, Convention on Transfer
of Sentenced Persons with its Protocol, ratified by the Republic of Macedonia in 1999, as well as on
the basis of bilateral agreements.
The Republic of Macedonia has signed bilateral agreements with the Republic of Croatia and the
Republic of Slovenia, namely:
−

−

− Agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Slovenia on Extradition
(“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No.24/96), which entered into force on
05.09.1997.
The judicial cooperation has been carried out through the respective Ministries of Justice. The
requesting state submits judicial requests to the requested state, which forwards them to the court of
the respective jurisdiction.
The Republic of Macedonia has signed bilateral agreement with Serbia and Montenegro that has still
not entered into force. The judicial cooperation has been carried out through the Ministries of Justice
of the two states.
With Bosnia and Herzegovina, the court cooperation has been carried out through diplomatic
channel, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Macedonia.
2. Domestic trials for war crimes
a) Please explain how the Amnesty Law is implemented.
b) Does the Republic of Macedonia accept the notion of command responsibility, as defined
by the ICTY Statute (Art. 7.3) and the Rome Statute of ICC (Art. 28)? Is evidence coming from
the ICTY acceptable, in theory and in practice, in national court proceedings?
c) Does your country have the necessary trained judicial personnel (prosecutors, lawyers,
judges) to process domestic war crimes trials?
a)
The Amnesty Law (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, No. 18/02) releases from
prosecution, terminates criminal procedures and fully acquits of serving the remaining sentence (in
the text to follow: amnesty) citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, persons with legal residence as
well as persons having property or family in the Republic of Macedonia (in the text to follow:
persons), for whom there is reasonable doubt that they have organised or perpetrated crimes related
to the conflict in 2001, 26.09.2001 inclusive. The amnesty also covers persons who have organised
or perpetrated crimes before 01.01.2001 related to the conflict in 2001.
The amnesty releases from prosecution persons for whom, pursuant to the Criminal Code or other
law in the Republic of Macedonia, there is reasonable doubt that they have organised or committed
crimes related to the conflict, 26.09.2001 inclusive.

law in the Republic of Macedonia, there is reasonable doubt that they have organised or perpetrated
crimes related to the conflict, 26.09.2001 inclusive.
In addition, persons who have organised or perpetrated crimes pursuant to the Criminal Code or
other law, related to the conflict, 26.09.2001 inclusive, are fully acquitted of serving the remaining

The sentence and all legal consequences arising thereafter are annulled for crimes perpetrated
26.09.2001 inclusive.
The foregoing provisions do not apply to persons who have committed crimes related to the conflict
in 2001 under the competence of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.
Part of this Law’s provisions apply to the persons who in the course of the conflict have not
responded to summonses for serving the army or who have evaded military services and drills, as
well as persons who have deserted the military forces.

451/453

In addition, the Law acquits of serving the remaining sentence persons who have been convicted of
crimes pursuant to the Criminal Code or other law of the Republic of Macedonia, and who have
started serving their sentence by the day of the Law's entry into force. This acquittal refers to 25% of
the remaining sentence.
Acquittal does not refer to persons convicted of crimes against humanity and international law;
persons convicted of illegal production and trafficking in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and
precursors or those enabling the use of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and precursors, as
well as to persons sentenced to life.
Procedure
The procedure on the implementation of the Amnesty Law for persons currently under criminal
proceedings is initiated ex officio by the competent public prosecutor and/or by the competent basic
court or the person subject to amnesty, or by a third person who on behalf of the defendant may file
an appeal.
Procedure for persons already convicted and serving a sentence is initiated by the penitentiary
institution in which they serve their sentence. Procedure for persons who have not started serving
their sentence is initiated ex officio by the court that has brought the first instance verdict or upon the
request of the public prosecutor or the convicted person.
The amnesty decision is adopted by the competent body in accordance with the Law on Criminal
Procedure and the Law on Execution of Sanctions (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”,
Nos. 3/97, 23/99 and 74/04).
Implementation of the law

Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) Statute (Article 7, item 3) and the Rome Statute of the
International Criminal Court (ICC) (Article 28).

452/453

Command responsibility has been regulated in Chapter XXXIV of the Criminal Code of the Republic
of Macedonia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia”, Nos. 37/96, 80/99, 4/00, 43/00, and

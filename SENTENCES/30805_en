BERLIN, Germany -- By a vote in parliament, Germany became the 13th EU member to ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Serbia on Thursday (February 10th).
Foreign Ministry State Secretary Werner Hoyer acknowledged that Serbia must meet several conditions before the country is admitted, but said some stimulus should be provided in order to continue key reforms.

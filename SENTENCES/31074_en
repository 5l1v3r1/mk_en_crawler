ATHENS, Greece -- The Conspiracy Nuclei of Fire militant group claimed responsibility Sunday (February 6th) for a parcel bomb sent to the Justice Ministry building in Athens last week.
In a statement on its website, the group vowed to continue its armed struggle.
The bomb, addressed to Justice Minister Haris Kstanidis, was detonated outside the ministry building last Wednesday.
The trial of 13 suspected members of the anarchist organisation is under way in Athens.

STRASBOURG, France -- Serbia-Montenegro became a member of the Council of Europe on Thursday (3 April), entering the continent's foremost human rights group barely three years after ridding itself of Slobodan Milosevic's regime.
The loose union, which replaced Yugoslavia last month, became the group's 45th member and will further extend the reach of the Council into the Balkans.
The ceremony in Strasbourg came a day after US Secretary of State Colin Powell met with officials in Belgrade, expressing strong support for the country's efforts to fight organised crime and dismantle the remnants of the Milosevic regime.
"I am delighted by the commitment the government has made to reforms and aggressive action taken against criminals," he said.
Powell met with Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic and Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic, reiterating demands for the arrest of several suspects wanted by the UN war crimes tribunal, including Bosnian wartime commander Ratko Mladic.
He described improved co-operation as an "important element of Serbia and Montenegro's international obligations".
Zivkovic pledged to strengthen further co-operation with The Hague and to speed up military reforms.

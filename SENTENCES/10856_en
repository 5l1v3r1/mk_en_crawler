BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten and EU security chief Javier Solana are visiting Belgrade on Tuesday (5 October) for talks aimed at accelerating Serbia-Montenegro's EU integration through the so-called "twin-track" approach, according to an EU press release.
Patten has said the approach will keep the country from lagging behind its neighbours.
He also stressed that Belgrade's co-operation with The Hague tribunal is crucial.
On Monday, Serbia-Montenegro and the EU signed a framework agreement for participation in EU programmes, ensuring financial assistance during the accession process.

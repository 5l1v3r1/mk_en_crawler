BUCHAREST, Romania -- The troops of the 811th Dej Infantry Battalion deployed in the Iraqi province of Dhiqar are conducting their most important security mission since arriving in the country, Lieutenant Razvan Buburuz, commander of a Romanian reconnaissance platoon, told Radio Romania Actualitati on Friday (14 November). 
Since last week's attack on Italy's headquarters in southern Iraq, Romanian reconnaissance teams have strengthened monitoring in the area and are searching for six terrorist suspects, believed to be preparing attacks against international coalition forces.
In other news, the defence ministry announced that a second Romanian soldier, Sergeant Major Mihail-Anton Samuila, has died from wounds suffered during an ambush last week in Iraq.

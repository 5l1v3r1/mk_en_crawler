STRASBOURG, France -- The Council of Europe (CoE) might close the post-monitoring procedure for Bulgaria by the end of this year, said Josette Durrieu, chairwoman of the CoE Monitoring Committee. 
The post-monitoring was introduced in 2000 to continue dialogue with authorities on a number of issues requiring further co-operation. 
Durrieu said on Thursday (26 June) that the procedure would be closed if no obstacles surface.

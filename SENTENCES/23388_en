SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- One mine-clearer was killed and another was seriously injured in a landmine explosion Sunday (May 24th). 
The mine was left over from the 1992-1995 conflict. 
The victims accidently tripped the mine while clearing a field near the town of Donji Vakuf in central BiH. 
Since fighting ended, mines peppering the country have caused nearly 1,700 casualties, including nearly 500 deaths, according to a Washington Times report in December.

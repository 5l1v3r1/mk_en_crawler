LISBON, Portugal -- European football's governing body decided Tuesday (15 June) to fine Croatia 6,839 euros for improper conduct in its game with Switzerland. 
Five of Croatia's players were booked in that match. 
Coach Otto Baric said he would make changes to the line-up for Thursday's game against France.
In other news, Greek players expressed confidence ahead of their game with Spain Wednesday night. 
"They do not frighten us. 
They may be better players but names on shirts don't win matches," said Demis Nikolaidis, who plays for Atl√©tico Madrid.

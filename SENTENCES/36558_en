PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK announced Wednesday (4 August) that it plans to build a power plant and lignite mine in Kosovo. 
The project aims to help the province meet future domestic power and export needs, while attracting foreign investors and creating new jobs. 
The UN's economic chief in Kosovo, Nikolaus Lambsdorff, said the plant and mine would cost between 500m euros and 1 billion euros, adding that the EBRD might participate. 
Lambsdorff noted, however, that certain technical and legal issues must be resolved before launching a tender for the project.

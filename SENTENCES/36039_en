SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A Bulgarian parliamentary delegation, led by Assembly Chairman Ognyan Gerdzhikov, kicked off a two-day visit to Sarajevo, meeting members of the BiH Parliament's two chambers Thursday (25 March). 
The talks focused on strengthening bilateral co-operation, especially in the economic sector, culture, science and sports.
Also Thursday, the Bosniak Party of Democratic Action and the Croatian Democratic Community said they have finally reached an agreement, resolving the nearly month-long institutional crisis in the Federation of BiH (FBiH). 
The agreement clears the way for discussion of the FBiH budget draft for 2004 on Friday.

ATHENS, Greece -- The public is bracing for a nationwide strike on Wednesday (December 12th) against proposed pension reforms, a stoppage that is expected to largely cripple the country. 
There will be no flights from Athens, no public services and no public transport. 
Doctors, journalists, engineers, lawyers and bank employees are participating in the strike. 
A rally in downtown Athens, organised in part by Greece's largest trade union the General Confederation of Greek Workers, is expected to draw about 100,000 protesters.
In other news, four diplomatic cars were attacked in Athens on Monday by assailants using small gas canister devices. 
Two of the cars belonged to officials from the Turkish Embassy. 
The other two were owned by staff from Italy and the Philippines. 
The cars had diplomatic plates, but nothing that indicated a particular country. 
No one was injured in the incidents.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The chamber of deputies rejected a no-confidence motion Monday (26 June) against Education Minister Mihai Hardau, which was filed by the main opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD).
It blames Hardau for the poor situation in the educational system and particularly for a recent leak from the ministry regarding testing.
At parliament, Hardau dismissed the accusations, saying the current government is paying for the mistakes of the previous PSD administration.

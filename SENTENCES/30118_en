PODGORICA, Montenegro -- As expected, the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) unanimously nominated Finance Minister Igor Luksic as the new prime minister Tuesday (December 21st), following the resignation of Milo Djukanovic. 
After the party's meeting, Luksic said that members of his cabinet will be announced shortly. 
President Filip Vujanovic is expected to give him a mandate to form the new government, which must be approved by parliament. 
Luksic vowed to continue working to fulfil the priorities of the current government. 
Djukanovic had signalled he would step down after the EU decided to grant Montenegro candidate status. 
That happened on Friday. 
Deputy Prime Minister Svetozar Marovic stepped down as well.

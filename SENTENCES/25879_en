SOFIA, Bulgaria -- US Ambassador to Bulgaria James Warlick said on Tuesday (February 16th) that no elements of the US missile defence shield will be deployed in Bulgaria at this stage. 
Last week, Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said that Sofia and Washington would hold preliminary talks on the issue. 
Warlick said the question is "still in the air" and has only been discussed informally as part of the NATO partnership. 
The issue came up after Romania agreed this month to host elements of the US system, expected to become operational by 2015.

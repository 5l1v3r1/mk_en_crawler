ATHENS, Greece -- The country's major trade union, the General Confederation of Workers of Greece (GSEE), staged a 24-hour strike Wednesday (October 8th) to protest government plans to privatise air carrier Olympic Airlines and other state companies. 
The strike forced the airline to cancel 50 flights and operate only one flight per destination from the Athens airport. 
A demonstration called by the GSEE also disrupted traffic in the Greek capital. 
Intercity rail services and hospitals limped along with only emergency staff. 
Workers at the partly privatised telecom company OTE and the state-run Public Power Corporation also joined the protest.

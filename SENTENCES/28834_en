BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Parliament (EP) will offer a draft solution to Albanian leaders aimed at ending the longstanding stalemate, saying otherwise they risk seeing the country's EU integration process blocked. 
Two main EP groups -- the European People's Party and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats -- will send the draft to Tirana. 
If rejected, "the EU will halt all integration processes related to Albania, including the visa liberalisation process," Victor Bostinaru, vice-chairman of the delegation for relations with Balkans countries, said on Thursday (June 10th). 
The stalemate is over transparency issues stemming from the June 2009 general elections.

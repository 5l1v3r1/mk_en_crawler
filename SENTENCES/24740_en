NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat has sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to protest Greek Cypriots' oil exploration missions in the Mediterranean Sea, media reported on Thursday (December 4th).
The letter was the latest move in a tit for tat over oil research that erupted between Cyprus and Turkey last month.
The Greek Cypriot side's unilateral activities violate Turkish Cypriots' rights and hamper the current reunification process, Talat said in the letter.
Cypriot President Demetris Christofias has lodged two complaints with the UN accusing Turkey of harassing research vessels within Cyprus's exclusive economic zone.
Also Thursday, the Greek Cypriot government reiterated its intention to press ahead with oil exploration missions despite Turkey and Turkish Cypriots' protests.
"We will exercise our sovereign rights, and we will not stop or cede those rights to anyone," said Commerce, Industry and Tourism Minister Antonis Paschalides.

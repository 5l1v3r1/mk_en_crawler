ZAGREB, Croatia -- General Vladimir Zagorec received a seven-year prison sentence on Monday (March 2nd) for embezzling 3.96m euros in a shadowy weapons deal. 
The court convicted him of abuse of office between 1993 and 2000 while he was deputy defence minister in charge of weapon supply. 
It also ordered him to return the money he embezzled to the state. 
Croatian prosecutors say that when he left the defence ministry in 2000, Zagorec stole the money and a significant number of diamonds he received from a German trader in 1993 as collateral in the weapon deal. 
Among the richest people in Croatia, Zagorec has a personal fortune estimated at more than 26m euros.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH) -- On Friday (10 October), the BiH government approved the draft defence law, aimed at bringing the country closer to EU and NATO integration. 
The bill envisages the establishment of a single defence system in the federation -- clearly defining the place and role of its elements. 
Under the draft law, the Defence Ministry should be established at a state level and should have two deputy ministers representing different constitutive nations. 
The draft law is to be debated by the BiH Parliament.
In other news, Egypt and Algeria are seeking the extradition of two individuals who have been arrested in BiH on suspicion of engaging in terrorist activities. 
Aissa Benkhira was arrested on an international warrant in September, while Amquad Youssef was apprehended in August when he tried to enter the country using a forged Belgian passport. 
Both men hold BiH citizenship, which makes extradition impossible under the country's constitution.

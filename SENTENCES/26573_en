BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the only opposition party that usually supports the pro-European government in key votes, once again rejected the possibility of joining the government coalition.
In an interview with Beta on Saturday (January 9th), LDP leader Cedomir Jovanovic explained that joining would only increase tensions already straining the coalition.
Jovanovic, however, insisted that the LDP and the government could be partners and â€“ in all EU-related issues - be more effective this year than last.

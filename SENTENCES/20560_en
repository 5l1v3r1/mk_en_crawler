BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government adopted a proposal Monday (March 10th) to dissolve parliament and to schedule snap parliamentary elections for May 11th.
In a short statement, the government also said that it can no longer function because there is no agreement on unified and common politics within the ruling coalition.
President Boris Tadic supports the date in May, to coincide with previously scheduled local elections.

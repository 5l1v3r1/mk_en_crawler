TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament on Monday (June 9th) passed amendments to the law on the legalisation, urbanisation and integration of illegal property. 
The topic initially did not belong on the agenda, which prompted a walkout by opposition lawmakers who complained they had not received the document. 
The legislation gives local government more of a role in property-related procedures. 
President Bamir Topi returned the measure to parliament in April for revision.

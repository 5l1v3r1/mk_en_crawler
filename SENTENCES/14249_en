THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal formally closed the trial against Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday (14 March) following the former Yugoslav president's death Saturday. 
The trial had spanned four years, and involved more than 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Milosevic's son Marko has travelled to the Netherlands to retrieve the body. 
He had said he would ask Moscow authorities to allow a "temporary burial" of his father in the Russian capital, where he and his mother have lived since Serbia issued an arrest warrant against her, charging corruption and abuse of office. 
On Tuesday, however, the Belgrade district court decided to annul the warrant against Milosevic's widow, Mirjana Markovic, allowing her to return to Serbia and attend her husband's funeral, if held there. 
The indictment, charging corruption and abuse of office, remains in effect.
Asked about Milosevic, former US diplomat Richard Holbrooke told the BBC on Monday that he never saw any sign of deep convictions during negotiations in the 1990s. 
"There was no serious ideological content to his beliefs â¦ I don't even feel he was a deep, serious Serb nationalist," Holbrooke said.

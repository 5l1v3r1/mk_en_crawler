BELGRADE, Serbia -- An appeals court in Belgrade on Monday (October 11th) overturned the 12-year sentence of Bosnian national Ilija Jurisic, convicted last year of war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. 
The court ordered a retrial and his release, in the meantime. 
In September 2009, he was found guilty of ordering an attack against a former Yugoslav National Army convoy withdrawing from Tuzla in May 1992. 
At least 51 soldiers were killed and 50 were wounded in the attack, according to the indictment. 
Jurisic was arrested in Belgrade in 2007 and has been in custody since then. 
He denies all charges.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul suggested on Wednesday (January 24th) that the government supports amending controversial Article 301 of the Turkish penal code, to remove all barriers to freedom of expression.
He said the issue would be resolved in co-operation with NGOs.
Gul's statement came a day after the funeral of prominent Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink, whose murder late last week raised questions about freedom of expression, excessive nationalism and ethnic tolerance in Turkey.
Dink was among several journalists and intellectuals to have faced charges under Article 301, which makes it a crime to "insult Turkishness".
According to local media reports, the murder of Dink may have a positive impact on Turkish-Armenian relations, which have been frozen since 1993 due to the ongoing dispute over the alleged genocide against Armenians during the waning days of the Ottoman Empire.
During the journalist's funeral in Istanbul on Tuesday, Armenian Deputy Foreign Minister Arman Kirakossian said his country was ready to re-establish diplomatic ties with Turkey without conditions.
Gul issued a similar statement on Wednesday.

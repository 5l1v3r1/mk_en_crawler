ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Hundreds of people spent the night outdoors in Istanbul and nearby cities Thursday (10 July), following unconfirmed reports of a major earthquake in the making.
There have been frequent but light tremors in the area since Sunday.
These have been felt in neighbouring Bulgaria as well.
Local scientists have tried to reassure the residents of Turkey's largest city.

PODGORICA, Montenegro, Yugoslavia -- Parliament Speaker and interim President Filip Vujanovic dismissed talk of early general elections in the republic.
He asserted that the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists confidently won the recent elections and said there is no reason to suggest new general elections are warranted.
He commented that a cabinet would be formed shortly, adding that, for the time being, the 22 December presidential election is the priority.

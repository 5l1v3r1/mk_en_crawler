BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Yugoslav President and leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia Vojislav Kostunica said Saturday (25 January) his party would vote against the law on implementation of the Constitutional Charter, describing the draft as "incoherent" and the implementation law as a step backwards.
The ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia is expected to vote in favour of both documents at a session of the Serbian Parliament on Tuesday.
The Montenegrin and Yugoslav parliaments have pledged to vote by the end of January.

TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha stressed on Sunday (March 9th) that Albania and Greece's borders are "untouchable".
Asked about the notion of a Greater Albania being established -- now that Kosovo has declared independence -- Berisha told the Kathimerini newspaper that his government rejects such claims.
"There are some property issues in the legal aspect in the region, but the borders are untouchable," Berisha said.
Nationalists say the notion of Great Albania would incorporate Albania and parts of Macedonia and southern Serbia inhabited by ethnic Albanians.

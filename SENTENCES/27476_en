SOFIA, Bulgaria --Finance Minister Simeon Dyankov on Friday (November 26th) said European institutions are to blame for the crisis that hit the eurozone.
"Once you design a new currency, you need the institutions to go with it and the recent troubles showed we don't have the institutions," Dyankov told the BBC, accusing the European Commission and the European Central Bank of failing to rigorously monitor the economies of the countries using the euro.
At the same time, he pointed out Bulgaria remains committed to joining the eurozone.
"Currently it does not sound like this is a very fiscally responsible club and it could benefit from new members," Dyankov said.

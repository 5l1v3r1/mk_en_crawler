TIRANA, Albania -- Following the release of an EU report criticising efforts, the government announced Saturday (8 May) that it is working on a strategy to fight drug trafficking.
Interior Minister Igli Toska said anti-smuggling efforts would be a top government priority this year and would include a set of anti-mafia laws, a crackdown on corrupt police officers and the establishment of a witness protection programme.
In other news, Albanian media reported Friday that talks on funding the Pan-European Corridor 8 would begin next month.
The project would link Albania with Macedonia, Bulgaria and Turkey.
At the same time, IMF representative to Tirana, Ian Peter Olters, said the government should pay more attention on infrastructure projects.

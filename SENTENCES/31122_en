NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has warned that talks on Cyprus' reunification cannot drag on forever, media reported on Friday (March 4th).
In a progress report to the UN Security Council, he voices concern about the slow pace of talks between Cypriot leaders, warning that upcoming elections in Turkey and Cyprus could further affect the dynamics of the talks.
Ban says that he will decide by the end of the month whether to call a new meeting with Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu.

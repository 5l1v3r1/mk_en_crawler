BRUSSELS, Belgium -- UN war crimes tribunal (ICTY) chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz reiterated his position on Saturday (October 2nd) that the EU should maintain its pressure on Serbia to arrest former Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic. 
"It is important for the EU to maintain the principle of conditionality that links the enlargement process with full and complete co-operation with the tribunal," he told Belgian dailies La Libre Belgique and De Standaard. 
The tribunal is expected to close its doors in three to four years. 
Mladic disappeared shortly after the ICTY charged him in 1995 with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.

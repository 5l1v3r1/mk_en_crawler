LUXEMBOURG -- "Technical reasons" prevented the EU foreign ministers from discussing Albania's request for EU candidate country status on Tuesday (October 27th). 
The Swedish EU presidency said the delay was not for political reasons. 
"The only reason for the delay is that the German parliament is expected to convene soon...since Germany went through elections recently," Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said. 
Albania applied for candidate status in April.

TIRANA, Albania -- The interior ministry announced on Tuesday (June 23rd) it has sent the final list of eligible voters to the Central Election Commission.
A total of 256,794 citizens won't be able to vote in Sunday's parliamentary elections because they don't hold a valid ID or passport.
The ministry said those who have applied but not yet collected their new ID cards must do so by Saturday in order to vote.

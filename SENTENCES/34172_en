BUCHAREST, Romania -- On Friday (11 July), the European Investment Bank (EIB) loaned Romania 131m euros for the rehabilitation of about 1,400 schools throughout the country. 
About 80 per cent of them are in rural areas, the rest in urban areas. 
The move constitutes the second phase of a project launched in 1997. 
According to an official statement, the loan "demonstrates that the EIB supports particularly those regions in Central Eastern Europe which have larger burdens from the past than others".

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The organisation of peaceful and fair elections remains a criterion for launching Macedonia's EU accession talks, Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki in Brussels on Wednesday (June 11th). 
Rehn added that the European Commission is closely watching the situation in Macedonia ahead of a repeat vote in some polling stations on Sunday. 
The first attempt, on June 1st, was marred by violence, voter intimidation and fraud at 196 polling stations. 
For his part, Milososki assured Rehn that Macedonia will continue to strive for equality and the rule of law. 
He added that Sunday will be an important confirmation of Macedonia's democratic capacity. 
The country hopes to receive a specific starting date for EU accession talks before the end of the year.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of the "Forward Serbia" parliamentary group and leader of the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), Tomislav Nikolic, was dismissed on Friday (January 16th) from his position as chairman of parliament's administrative committee. 
Seven members of the panel launched the initiative to sack him. 
All seven are members of the ruling coalition. 
Democratic Party (DS) member Nenad Konstantinovic will replace Nikolic as chairman. 
Nikolic later told reporters he expected the move, attributing it to an informal deal between the DS and the Serbian Radical Party (SRS).

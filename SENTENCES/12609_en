PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica visited Kosovo to attend Orthodox Christmas celebrations Friday (7 January), the second official visit by a Serb leader to the UN-administered province since 1999.
Kostunica attended a liturgy in the western town of Pec, and met with the residents of several Serb-populated settlements in Kosovo.
He assured them that his government would do everything to support the Serb community in the province.
In other news, Serbian Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic went to Bujanovac on Saturday, in a bid to calm tensions following Friday's shooting death of an ethnic Albanian teenager in the Presevo Valley.
Border guards fired at Dashnim Hajrullahu as he illegally crossed the border between southern Serbia and Macedonia.
While expressing regret, Davinic said the guards followed procedure.

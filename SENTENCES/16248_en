ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament convenes on Tuesday (October 17th) to discuss a controversial bill that would make it a crime to deny that genocide took place against Armenians during the final years of the Ottoman Empire.
The legislation was passed by France's lower house of parliament last week.
Turkish lawmakers are expected to draft a common declaration condemning the decision by their French counterparts.
Approval of the bill came despite EU concerns that it would have a negative impact on Turkish-EU relations.

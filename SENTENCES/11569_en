PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Recent power cuts in Kosovo Serb villages were due to unpaid bills, according to UNMIK chief Soeren Jessen-Petersen.
He urged the villagers either to pay the bills or reach an agreement with the Kosovo Energy Corporation on an installment plan, and warned against using the issue for political purposes.
Jessen-Petersen also called on Kosovo Serbs to take part in the province's institutions, saying refusal to do so would affect them and not the institutions.
He set a deadline of 26 January for them to decide whether to participate.

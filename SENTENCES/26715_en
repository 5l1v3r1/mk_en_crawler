BUCHAREST, Romania -- Justice Minister Catalin Predoiu urged magistrates on Monday (September 7th) to quit their protest and return to their normal workloads, arguing that the government has resolved wage-related issues and concerns over insufficient financing.
The strike has suspended most court activity in the country.
"Protests are generally illegal and their generalisation and continuation seriously harms the interests of the citizens, the economic activity in the country, justice security, the safety of citizens and the public opinion," Predoiu said.
In an effort to slash public spending, Romania has decided to end a number of bonuses paid to public employees and freeze wages in the public sector.
For judges in particular, this means abolishing their bonuses for workplace stress, which is roughly half of their net wage.

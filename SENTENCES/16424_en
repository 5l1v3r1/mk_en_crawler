COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Parliament approved the EU Accession Treaty of Bulgaria and Romania in the first reading Wednesday (October 11th).
The Danish legislature thus opened the ratification process for the document, which must be endorsed by all 25-member states by the end of the year.
Denmark and Germany are the last two holdouts.
On Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country would complete the ratification on time.

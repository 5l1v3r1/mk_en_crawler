SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The European Commission (EC) is pressing BiH to approve a law on holding a population census across both entities. 
The head of the EC delegation to BiH, Dimitris Kourkoulas, said on Wednesday (May 12th) that Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele and Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn have sent a letter to BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric, calling for action on such legislation. 
They stress that without it, EU integration will be impeded. 
BiH political leaders plan to conduct a census next year, but are arguing about content and wording.

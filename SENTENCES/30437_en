TIRANA, Albania -- Albania has not ordered ballots for the May 8th local elections, since an opposition party has submitted a complaint about their content, local media reported on Sunday (April 10th).
The Central Election Commission (CEC) cannot order the printing of the ballots until a claim by the opposition Socialist Party (SP) is settled.
The SP says that the names and logos of the parties forming the opposition coalition do not appear on the ballots;
only the name of the coalition they have formed is listed.
The SP says this will be confusing to voters when they cast their ballots in the most important municipality, Tirana.
The CEC is waiting to order 7.2 million paper ballots.

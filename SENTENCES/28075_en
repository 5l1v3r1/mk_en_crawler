PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Kosovo is expected to receive an EU visa liberalisation roadmap this year, European Parliament (EP) Rapporteur on visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans Tanja Fajon said on Wednesday (October 20th) in Pristina. 
Fajon did not rule out November, when Kosovo will also receive the next European Commission (EC) Progress Report, yet stressed that Kosovo has work to do to finalise the visa liberalisation process. 
"Kosovo will remain very isolated if it is not included, and I am certain that there will be great disappointment among the people. 
Therefore, we need to find a way to include Kosovo in the process," Fajon said after meeting with acting President Jakup Krasniqi. 
The EC had promised to send the strategy for visa liberalisation by September, but delayed it, arguing authorities in Pristina were not ready.

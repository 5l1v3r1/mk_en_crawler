ATHENS, Greece -- The government issued an emergency order late on Monday (November 29th) forcing ferry workers to end their strike and return to work, after the action left hundreds of islands cut off from the mainland for a week.
The ruling followed failed talks between the Federation of Greek Sailors and the government.
The protest, which started last Tuesday, was aimed at reaching a collective labour agreement that won't deprive sailors of any benefits or rights.
Protestors defied the order Tuesday, continuing their strike.
This was the second time in several months that the government issued a threat of arrest unless strikers return to their jobs.
The first was against protesting truck drivers.
In other news, the main journalists' union, ESHEA, is staging a 24-hour strike Tuesday, as are public sector doctors.
A strike called by civil aviation workers, however, has been cancelled after a court ruled the action illegal.

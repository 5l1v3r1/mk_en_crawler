THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The Hague war crimes tribunal (ICTY) decided on Friday (December 5th) that war crimes indictee Vojislav Seselj is capable of continuing to conduct his own defence despite the prosecution's claims of the opposite. 
Seselj, leader of the Serbian Radical Party, is facing charges of inciting nationalism and ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, along with murder, torture, imprisonment and deportation.
Also on Friday, the Appeals Chamber ordered the temporarily freed former Yugoslav National Army officer Veselin Sljivancanin to return to the detention for his appeal hearing on January 21st, after which he will enjoy another furlough. 
The chamber ruled the Serbian government should appoint an official to accompany Sljivancanin from Belgrade to The Hague. 
Sljivancanin received a five-year sentence for torturing and persecuting Croatian prisoners of war in Vukovar in November 1991. 
In December 2007, the Appeals Chamber decided to grant him his temporary release, since he had served more than 90% of his prison sentence.

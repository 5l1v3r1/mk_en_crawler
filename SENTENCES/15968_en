PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- NATO's military presence in Kosovo will probably stay unchanged for at least six months after a decision is made on the province's future, the commander of KFOR said Friday (November 17th). 
Kosovo is about to enter "a crucial time", Lieutenant-General Roland Kather said. 
"I'm absolutely sure we will maintain strength, organisation and in particular manpower at least six months after a UN resolution," he added. 
According to the commander,no cuts in the 17,000-strong force are foreseen.
In other news, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Titov confirmed Friday that Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku is expected to visit Moscow in late November. 
Titov said his country would again stress the importance of finding a mutually acceptable solution to the status problem.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- As expected, Republika Srpska (RS) President Milorad Dodik nominated entity Finance Minister Aleksander Dzombic as prime minister-designate on Tuesday (November 23rd). 
Dodik said the choice is logical and is evidence of the continuity of his Alliance of Independent Social Democrats' (SNSD) reform programme. 
Dzombic says he will begin consultations on forming a new cabinet immediately and hopes to wrap them up in ten days. 
He added his priorities will be investments in the energy sector, large infrastructure projects and agriculture.

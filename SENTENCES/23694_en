BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Macedonia could receive a date for launching EU accession talks by the end of this year, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Wednesday (April 22nd) after a meeting with Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki in Brussels.
Rehn added that the same goes for visa liberalisation.
He hailed Macedonia for its regional leadership in meeting EU membership criteria.
Rehn once again praised the country for its successful elections last month and said the long-awaited solution to the name dispute with Greece should come this year, especially after the current government won another mandate.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Only days after the European Commission (EC) stopped Bulgarian financing under the PHARE pre-accession programme, Brussels decided to block funding under the SAPARD programme as well. 
Finance Minister Plamen Oresharski confirmed on Friday (March 7th) that about 100m euros earmarked for Bulgaria under the agricultural programme have been frozen following investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office which indicated funds had been siphoned off. 
The 100m euros had been designated for the SAPARD effort to boost the processing and marketing of agricultural and fish products.

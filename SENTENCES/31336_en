PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The official campaign for the December 12th snap elections launched on Wednesday (December 1st).
Twenty-nine parties and citizens' initiatives, eight of them Serb, will compete for seats in parliament.
The campaign season will last just ten days.
In the run-up to it, parties have been trading accusations and allegations, something some analysts describe as violations of the code of conduct.
Chief of the International Civil Office Pieter Feith is again calling on Kosovo Serbs to vote since "with their participation, Serbs will take their interests into their own hands." The European monitoring body ENEMO will be on the ground before and during Election Day, while thousands of local monitors have already been certified to monitor the snap vote.

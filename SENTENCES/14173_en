TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu and the new government reportedly are at odds over cabinet plans to return the National Information Service (SHISH) to interior ministry control.
Local media reported on the dispute Thursday (15 September), citing recent remarks by both sides.
Moisiu told the Voice of America's Albanian service that he disagrees with the idea and urged Prime Minister Sali Berisha to carefully consider the issue.
Moisiu hinted it would spoil efforts to restructure SHISH that have just started showing results.
Deputy Prime Minister Ilir Rusmajli rejected those concerns Wednesday, saying plans to incorporate SHISH within the interior ministry are aimed at enhancing the fight against corruption and terrorism.

ANKARA, Turkey -- At a cabinet meeting Tuesday (July 1st), Justice Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin said Turkey wants France to pursue accession talks in a transparent manner, despite opposing EU membership for Turkey.
He added that Ankara expects to open three new chapters during the next six months of France's tenure as EU president, which began Tuesday.
Since launching accession negotiations in 2005, Turkey has opened only eight chapters.
The EU suspended talks on 15 of the 35 chapters due to Turkey's refusal to open its ports to Cyprus.

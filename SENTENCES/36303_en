WASHINGTON, United States -- The US NGO Freedom House on Wednesday (26 May) issued a report on democracy development in nations in transition. 
The ratings are based on progress in the electoral process, civil society, media independence, governance, legislative framework and corruption. 
The highest score, 7, means the least developed democracy. 
Among Southeast European countries, Bulgaria received a 3.25, followed by Romania with a 3.58, and Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro with a 3.83. 
All four countries are grouped in the category of semi-consolidated democracies. 
Macedonia, Albania and BiH received scores of 4.00, 4.13 and 4.29, respectively, and are considered transitional governments or hybrid regimes. 
Kosovo got a 5.50 rating.

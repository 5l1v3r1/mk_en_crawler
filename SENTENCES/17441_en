SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Insisting that the quality of an investigation is more important than speed, Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev urged both the EU and the public to be patient as his office collects the evidence it needs to tackle corruption and organised crime cases.
He told Reuters on Monday (May 21st) that he does not expect the European Commission to propose the introduction of safeguards in justice and home affairs against Bulgaria in its June monitoring report.
He says such measures would only make fighting organised crime and corruption more difficult.

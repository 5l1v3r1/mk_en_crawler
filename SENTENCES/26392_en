THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- An Appeals Chamber at the UN war crimes tribunal on Thursday (November 12th) reduced the 33-year sentence handed down to former Bosnian Serb General Dragomir Milosevic to 29 years.
Milosevic was convicted in 2007 of war crimes and crimes against humanity for directing the 44-month siege of Sarajevo that resulted in more than 10,000 deaths during the 1992-1995 conflict.
The Appeals Chamber concluded that although he was responsible for the crimes in his role of a military commander, no evidence proves he ordered the shooting of civilians during the shelling of the Bosnian capital.
Prosecutors had requested life in prison for Milosevic.

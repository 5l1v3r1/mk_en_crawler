ATHENS, Greece -- Foreign ministry spokesman Panos Beglitis reiterated Thursday (7 November) that Greece rejects the possibility of a double name solution in its dispute with Macedonia. 
Beglitis explicitly denied the latest statements coming from Skopje that the long-standing argument could be resolved if Greece agreed to the proposed solution. 
A newly appointed member of the Macedonian negotiation team, Ljubomir Frckovski, recently reintroduced the idea, originally suggested earlier this year by the International Crisis Group. 
The scenario envisages the use of Macedonia's constitutional name "Republic of Macedonia" in international communications, and a separate name for contacts with Greece, which for historical reasons does not recognise its neighbour as "Macedonia".

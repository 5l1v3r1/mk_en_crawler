ATHENS, Greece -- Adopting emergency measures to protect the economy from the effects of war in Iraq is unnecessary, says Finance Minister Nikos Christodoulakis. 
Following a cabinet meeting Thursday (13 March) however, he said efforts should be made to bolster economic growth and limit inflation. 
He added that no public company will be allowed to raise prices by more than the inflation rate and that the country's poorest will receive government support if necessary.

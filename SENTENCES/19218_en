BELGRADE, Serbia -- Tomislav Nikolic, the presidential candidate representing the ultra-nationalist Serb Radical Party, said on Monday (January 28th) he is "completely open to co-operation with the EU", as long as Kosovo remains part of Serbia. 
Local analysts say he appears to be toning down his nationalistic and anti-Western rhetoric in an attempt to appeal to more voters. 
His rival in Sunday's presidential run-off, incumbent President Boris Tadic, accuses Nikolic of trying to deceive voters.

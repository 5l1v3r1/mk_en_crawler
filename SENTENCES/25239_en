PRISTINA, Kosovo -- NATO will remain committed to securing a safe and peaceful environment in Kosovo, NATO's Military Committee Chairman Giampaolo Di Paola said on Tuesday (September 29th) in Pristina. 
He added that the presence of more than 20 representatives of the Alliance during the committee's visit shows that Kosovo remains an important mission.
For his part, NATO's South Wing Commander, Admiral Mark Fitzgerald, said that KFOR's downsizing is linked to other local and international security forces in Kosovo. 
Separately, KFOR Commander, German General Marcus Bentler, predicted the Kosovo Security Force will need two to five years to become fully operational.

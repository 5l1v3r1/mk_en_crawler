SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Thousands of Bosnian Serbs gathered on Sunday (July 12th) at the Bratunac military cemetery to remember Serbs killed during the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH.
High-level delegations from Republika Srpska and Serbia brought flowers and lit candles at the memorial cross established in honour of the victims.
The ceremony took place the same weekend as observances marking the Srebrenica massacre, in which more than 8,000 Bosniaks died at the hands of Bosnian Serb troops.
Estimates of Serb casualties vary, ranging from the hundreds to the thousands.
They were killed in 1992 and 1993 by Muslim forces led by Naser Oric.
He was brought to justice but acquitted by The Hague war crimes tribunal last year.
The court said there was insufficient evidence proving his command responsibility for war crimes.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Franco Frattini, the European Commission (EC) vice president in charge of justice, freedom and security, urged Tirana Wednesday (9 February) to intensify efforts to complete crucial reforms.
During a meeting with Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano in Brussels, Frattini praised the progress achieved in judicial restructuring and reaffirmed support for the Balkan country's bid to join the EU.
He also said the EU expected Albania to conduct free, fair and democratic elections.
OSCE-mediated negotiations between the two main parties -- the ruling Socialist Party and the opposition Democratic Party -- on a new electoral map for the country have not yet yielded an agreement.

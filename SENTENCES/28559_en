BELGRADE, Serbia -- Student Miladin Kovacevic, who is charged with beating a fellow undergrad at a university he attended in the United States, agreed on Tuesday (September 14th) to plead guilty and serve two years and three months in prison.
"The deal was reached because my client wanted to take the burden off Serbian politicians and the judiciary, as well as [the] Serbian nation," said lawyer Borivoje Borovic.
Kovacevic was accused of inflicting "severe bodily harm with possible deadly consequences", stemming from an assault on Bryan Steinhauer, 22, of Brooklyn, New York.
Steinhauer sustained skull fractures and a severe brain injury after the May 2008 fight.
Kovacevic was also accused of counterfeiting documents that allowed him to quickly leave the United States after the incident.
As part of the plea bargain, which Steinhauer's family opposes, prosecutors reportedly dropped these charges.
A court must still authorise any deal.

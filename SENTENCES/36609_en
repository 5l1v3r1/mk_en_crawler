TIRANA, Albania -- Ridvan Bode, secretary general of the main opposition Democratic Party (DP), said on Friday (30 July) that the DP will strictly impose the new property law in the localities where it won local elections. 
Bode reiterated DP disapproval of the law, but rejected concerns that the party will refuse to implement it. 
DP representatives are in office in nearly half of the country's municipalities.

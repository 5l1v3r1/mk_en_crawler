SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A landmark police reform agreement cleared another hurdle Friday (14 October) when the BiH Parliament House of Representatives voted to adopt it.
The vote followed endorsement by the entity-level parliaments of the Federation of BiH and Republka Srpksa.
The legislation, which aims to overhaul BiH's police sector in line with EU-set standards, next goes to the state-level upper chamber, the BiH House of Peoples, which will consider it on Tuesday.
Also on Friday, High Representative Paddy Ashdown halted a bid to rename Sarajevo International Airport after the late Bosniak leader Alija Izetbegovic, saying such a move would undermine the reconciliation process.
The initiative -- announced by BiH Presidency member Sulejman Tihic earlier this month -- had aroused strong opposition from Bosnian Serbs.

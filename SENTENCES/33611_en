ANKARA, Turkey -- There is no visible sign of weakness in the Turkish economy, IMF Managing Director Horst Kohler said Sunday (14 September), noting that economic indicators have strengthened.
He said the most important issue at present is implementing the IMF-proposed programme that targets a primary budget surplus of 6.5 per cent.
Also Sunday, the office of the chief of general staff said the Turkish Armed Forces believe education should be provided in accordance with contemporary, secular standards and under state supervision.
The education ministry, which is seeking to change the country's public education strategy, had requested the military's viewpoint.

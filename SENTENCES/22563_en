BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of Serbia's national council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, said on Thursday (August 7th) there are no special operations or searches currently under way for the two remaining Hague fugitives, Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic.
The council is conducting "normal, routine checks of available information" he said.
"I can't say we are now closer to either one of the fugitives than we were a while ago," Ljajic added.
On Wednesday, the daily Blic cited government sources who said Mladic will be apprehended and extradited to The Hague tribunal by the end of August.
According to the report, the government's plan is to arrest him during parliament's summer recess.

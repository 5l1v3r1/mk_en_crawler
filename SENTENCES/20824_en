ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament on Monday (November 5th) cancelled for the second time the discussion on a declaration covering so-called Armenian genocide bill approved by a US congressional committee. 
Two weeks ago, Parliament Speaker Koksal Toptan and the deputy chairmen of the parliamentary groups decided to adopt a declaration on the bill, which defines the WWI-era mass killings of Armenians in Turkey as genocide. 
But discussion of it, scheduled for Tuesday, was cancelled due to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's visit to Washington.
After meeting with US President George W Bush on Monday, Erdogan welcomed US lawmakers' own decision to shelve debate on the bill. 
"The so-called Armenia genocide ... 
has the potential to deeply damage our strategic co-operation," Erdogan said.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Ambassadors of France, Germany, Italy, the UK and the US support the Central Election Commission's (CEC) decision not to install cameras at polling stations during the November 15th local elections, media reported on Thursday (September 3rd). 
"The installation of the monitoring cameras at polling stations is not a norm in Europe or in the United States," the ambassadors said in Pristina. 
According to them, the use of cameras poses a significant risk to a citizen's fundamental right to a secret ballot.
In other news, NATO will continue with plans to reduce its military presence in Kosovo, despite recent disagreements between Kosovo authorities and EULEX, local media reported on Thursday. 
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told a news conference in Brussels that the Alliance will keep working to trim the KFOR troops from 15,000 to 10,000 in the coming months. 
"The security situation has improved and conditions are met, therefore we can undertake this step," Rasmussen said.

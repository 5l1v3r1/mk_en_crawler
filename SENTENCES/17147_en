ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Namik Tan said on Wednesday (31 May) that meetings were being held with Armenian representatives, aimed at normalising bilateral ties. 
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has contacted his Armenian counterpart, Robert Kocharian, to urge a joint historical examination of the WWI-era killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. 
The issue has thwarted normal diplomacy between Ankara and Yerevan for decades.

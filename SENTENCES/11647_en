ATHENS, Greece -- Dick Pound, the head of the World Anti-doping Agency, announced Monday (21 March) that his organisation would appeal the decision of a Greek panel which cleared top Greek athletes Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou of charges they evaded several drug tests before and during the 2004 Athens Olympics.
Pound said he would bring the case before the Court of Arbitration for Sport if the International Association of Athletics (IAAF) Federation accepts the Greek decision.
The IAAF expressed surprise when the Greek Athletic Federation cleared the athletes of the charges last week.

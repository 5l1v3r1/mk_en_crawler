BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU praised the recent completion of the legislative agenda emerging from the Ohrid Peace Agreement in Macedonia, and called for continued efforts to implement the laws during the second meeting of the EU-Macedonian Stabilisation and Association Council in Brussels on Monday (18 July). 
The Council reviewed the progress of EU-related reforms in the country and developments in the political and economic fields. 
The Council welcomed the launch of the decentralisation process and stressed that the government is expected to ensure the smooth transfer of power to local self-governments.
Also Monday, Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski sealed the new law on use of national symbols and flags, passed by parliament last week. 
Approval of the law, which allows municipalities where ethnic Albanians are a majority to fly the Albanian flag together with the Macedonian one, marked the completion of the Ohrid legislative agenda.
In other news Monday, media in Skopje reported that the UN tribunal in The Hague has rejected the request for provisional release of indictees Ljube Boskovski and Johan Tarculovski. 
They are charged with war crimes stemming from the 2001 interethnic conflict.

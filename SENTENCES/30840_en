PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Parliament adopted a resolution Thursday (March 10th) on dialogue with Serbia. 
The Democratic Party of Kosovo-sponsored text supports dialogue between the independent states of Kosovo and Serbia on practical issues to improve the citizens' lives and advance both countries towards EU integration, without addressing Kosovo's sovereignty and integrity. 
The resolution was rejected by the three opposition parties -- the Democratic League of Kosovo, the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo, and the Vetevendosje movement. 
Representatives from Pristina and Belgrade opened a series of meetings earlier this week without the prior consent of Kosovo's parliament.

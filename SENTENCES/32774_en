WASHINGTON, United States -- Meeting Tuesday (10 December) with her US counterpart Colin Powell, Macedonian Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva said that her government agrees that Allied Harmony should be the last NATO mission in Macedonia.

She and Powell signed bilateral agreements on the preservation and protection of cultural heritage.
Mitreva also met with World Bank and IMF representatives.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The leaders of Republika Srpska's (RS) ruling parties, the Union of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) and the Party of Democratic Progress (PDP), Milorad Dodik and Mladen Ivanic, met on Friday (February 1st) in a bid to clear up differences that have marred relations in the ruling coalition in recent months. 
Dodik and Ivanic agreed to form a working group to review all issues at all levels of power -- local, executive and judicial. 
Dodik said the task force was given three weeks to submit that review to party leaders. 
Dodik and Ivanic also agreed that co-operation is relatively good, especially on key issues such as police and constitutional reforms. 
They reviewed the possibility of teaming up for local elections, projecting that such an alliance could secure them victory in at least 50 municipalities.

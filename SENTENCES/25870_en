ATHENS, Greece -- Farmers who have blocked the Kulata-Promahon border with Bulgaria for nearly a month decided announced Tuesday (February 16th) that they would end their protest. 
The decision followed a meeting with Deputy Agriculture Minister Michalis Karchimakis. 
One of the protestors' representatives said that while they are satisfied for now, they will block the roads again if their demands are not met by November. 
The farmers are demanding secure subsidies, guaranteed buy-out prices for their produce, lower production costs and help with their bank credits.

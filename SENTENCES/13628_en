SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic said Sunday (23 October) that the chief negotiator for future Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with the EU would likely be a Serb.
The European Commission last week formally approved launching the talks.
Terzic will be meeting with Republika Srpska President Dragan Cavic to discuss the nomination of a chief negotiator.
Also Sunday, in an interview with the Banja Luka daily Nezavisne novine, British Ambassador to BiH Matthew Rycroft said the country must change its constitution and current state apparatus before joining the EU.
Britain is the current holder of the rotating EU presidency.
In other news, the government adopted a report on the security situation in BiH in the first half of 2005, citing improvement in several areas.
Officials credit the consolidation of security structures.

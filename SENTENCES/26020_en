TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha received the questionnaire to evaluate Albania's readiness for future steps in EU integration on Wednesday (December 16th).
Helmut Lohan, European Commission head in Tirana, delivered the document that contains 2,280 questions to Berisha, advising him that the answers require results of broad reforms that can only be achieved through political consensus.
"I hope that the stalemate between the parties will end in the beginning of 2010 if Albania wants to go ahead as its citizens deserve," Lohan said.
He was referring to the dispute between the ruling Democratic Party and the opposition Socialist Party, over alleged irregularities in the June general elections.
Due to the conflict, the opposition has been boycotting the work of parliament for months.
Albania applied for EU candidate status in April.

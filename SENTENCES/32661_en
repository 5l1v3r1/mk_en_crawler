SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Chairman of the Supreme Cessation Court Ivan Grigorov said Monday (23 December) that he had drawn an uninformed conclusion in proclaiming the security services' investigation of Gen Atanas Atanasov illegal.
However, he added, there were still several aspects of the probe that were conducted in violation of the law - specifically, the failure to destroy, in a timely manner, recorded conversations Atanasov had with a number of opposition leaders and media directors.
Grigorov also complained about information that was leaked to the media.
Secretary General of the National Security Services Gen Boyko Borisov says such leaks pose a serious threat to Bulgaria's integration into NATO structures.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal is expected to wrap up the trial of former Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) army commander Rasim Delic on Monday (September 15th). 
Delic, one of the most senior Muslims to appear before the tribunal, allegedly failed to prevent war crimes by mujahedeen units under his command between 1993 and 1995. 
He allegedly allowed his troops to rape, torture and murder dozens of Croats and Serbs in BiH.

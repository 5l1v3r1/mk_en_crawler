BUCHAREST, Romania -- Teachers decided on Wednesday (May 6th) to scrap a nationwide protest originally scheduled for Thursday -- when national exams are held -- after a successful round of negotiations with the government.
Students in their final year of high school are sitting for the exams, now that government representatives offered a new proposal that satisfies the unions.
Labour Minister Marian Sarbu says it includes three essential points -- the cabinet's allocation of 6% of GDP for education, the finalisation of a new bill on wages in the sector, and decentralisation of the system.
Sarbu also promised no layoffs in education.
Two days ago, teachers announced they would stage a general strike during national exams after the cabinet acknowledged there is no money for promised 50% wage increases.
President Traian Basescu, in turn, admitted he made a mistake last year in signing the bill granting such raises.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- EU Integration Office Director Milica Delevic said on Thursday (February 17th) that an EU expert mission will arrive on Monday to begin assessing the pace of reform implementation in Serbia. 
The mission's task will be to verify developments regarding the judiciary, law enforcement agencies and the fight against organised crime and corruption. 
Over time, several expert teams will pay visits to Belgrade to assess Serbia's readiness to meet EU criteria and help the European Commission draft its opinion on Belgrade's EU application. 
Serbia hopes to receive candidate status this year.

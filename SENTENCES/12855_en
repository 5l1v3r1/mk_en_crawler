ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters on Friday (1 April) that he was not planning to hold early parliamentary elections. 
Local media reported recently that Erdogan was contemplating such a move after a series of deputies left his Justice and Development Party. 
Erdogan said political stability and security were vital for Turkey's economy. 
Also Friday, President Ahmet Necdet Sezer vetoed a law authorising the full sale of a private television network to foreign investors, arguing that it was harmful to Turkey's national interests.

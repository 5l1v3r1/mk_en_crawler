PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbia has invited new UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier to visit Belgrade, spokesman Russell Geekie said on Monday (July 21st).
He describes the visit, which is expected to take place Wednesday, it as an introductory visit aimed at discussing how to launch a technical dialogue with Pristina on topics outlined in UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's recent report on Kosovo.
In other news, the Kosovo ombudsman's office concluded in its annual report that courts and ministries are the top offenders among institutions in terms of inefficiency and human rights violations.
The report, published on Monday, concludes that public institutions have failed to resolve property issues.
Also Monday, Kosovo began issuing new passports to replace the current UNMIK ones.
The passports are written in the two official languages, Albanian and Serbian, and cost 25 euros.

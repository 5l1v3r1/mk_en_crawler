BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania might be forced to seek additional external financing this year, President Traian Basescu warned on Friday (March 5th).
Basescu said there may be no other choice if the government cannot reduce spending to desirable levels.
Basescu's statement is in sharp contrast to recent ones from Prime Minister Emil Boc and Finance Minister Sebastian Vladescu who have suggested that Romania might not need the entire 20 billion euros of financial assistance contracted with the IMF, the EU and other international financial institutions.

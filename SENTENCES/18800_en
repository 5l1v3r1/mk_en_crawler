ANKARA, Turkey -- Two centre right parties, the True Path Party and Motherland Party, formally agreed Saturday (May 5th) to join in a new formation called the Democrat Party. 
Talking to reporters afterwards, the leaders of the two parties -- Mehmet Agar and Erkan Mumcu -- said they believe the move would benefit both parties and the future of the country. 
Rank and file members must still approve the merger.
Late Sunday, meanwhile, the leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party, Deniz Baykal, met with Zeki Sezer, leader of the Democratic Left Party. 
That raised speculation that another merger or coalition may be in the works ahead of the July 22nd general elections.
In other news, a first round of voting may be held Monday on a proposal by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) to allow the president of Turkey to be elected in a popular vote rather than by parliament. 
AKP's candidate, current Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, was forced to withdraw his bid after opposition MPs successfully blocked him from winning the parliamentary vote, despite the ruling party's majority.

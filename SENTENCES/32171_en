TIRANA, Albania -- The OSCE presence in Albania welcomed the adoption of amendments to the law on public and private radio and television, enacted Thursday (7 November), as a result of close co-operation between Albanian institutions and international partners. 
The amendments create a legal framework for implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding for the mapping of radio and TV frequencies in Albania, signed in July. 
It will provide an accurate picture of the scope of each station and frequency, which will lead to the adoption of a national frequency plan within the next five months.

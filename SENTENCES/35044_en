BUCHAREST, Romania -- The regional organisation of the ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) in Cluj decided to break its co-operation agreement with the Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania (UDMR) at the local level. 
In an announcement Sunday (27 June), Cluj PSD leader Ioan Rus said this was because UDMR had chosen to work with the opposition National Liberal Party-Democratic Party alliance in the Cluj municipal council.

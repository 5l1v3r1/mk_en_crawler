BUCHAREST, Romania -- Mircea Geoana on Thursday (May 14th) won the Social Democratic Party's (PSD) nod to be its candidate in the November presidential elections.
As many as 10,000 PSD members attended the extraordinary meeting of the party's National Council, which also tapped candidates for the June 7th European Parliament elections.
The announcement regarding Geoana was not even on the official agenda Thursday.
He announced his interest in running weeks ago.
The other two announced candidates are Prince Radu Duda, a member by marriage of Romania's royal family, and Crin Antonescu, leader of the National Liberal Party.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prosecutors formally indicted on Friday (December 22nd) four Bosnian Serbs -- Zdravko Bozic, Mladen Blagojevic, Zeljko Zaric and Zoran Zivanovic -- with crimes against humanity in connection with the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
The four, former members of the Republika Srpska (RS) military police, are accused of participating in the illegal detention and murders of Bosniak civilians in Srebrenica.
Separately, RS Interior Minister Stanislav Cado visited Podgorica on Friday and announced that an ongoing investigation has ruled out any possible involvement of Montenegrin government officials in an alleged plot to assassinate RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik.
Initial reports about the plot suggested that Serbia's Zemun clan and BiH criminal circles were behind it, along with senior Montenegrin officials.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic on Friday (January 15th) recalled Serbian Ambassador to Podgorica Zoran Lutovac, for consultations in Belgrade after Montenegro decided to establish diplomatic relations with Kosovo. 
According to a government statement, Podgorica's move "infringes regional stability and makes more difficult the establishment of the best possible relations among neighbouring countries". 
Montenegro and Kosovo's diplomatic ties were formalized earlier the same day in letters by their respective foreign ministers, Milan Rocen and Skender Hyseni.
Meanwhile, the defence ministry in Belgrade announced on Friday that a planned visit of Montenegro's Defence Minister Boro Vucic to Serbia has been cancelled.

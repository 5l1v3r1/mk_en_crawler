BRUSSELS, Belgium/ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish President Abdullah Gul said Friday (March 27th) Ankara is not against "any candidate" for the post of NATO secretary-general. 
"Turkey does not have any particular objection [to Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen's candidacy]," media reports quoted Gul as saying in Brussels. 
Gul's statement referred to media reports claiming Turkey may block Rasmussen's candidacy over a number of objections, including to Copenhagen's decision allowing Kurdish Roj TV to broadcast from Denmark.
Later Friday, however, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned there was strong opposition from Muslim nations to Rasmussen's bid to become the next NATO secretary-general. 
NATO is expected to name its new chief at its next summit in April.

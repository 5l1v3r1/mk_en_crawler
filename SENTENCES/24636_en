NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Former President Tassos Papadopoulos is in critical but stable condition, President Demetris Christofias said on Saturday (December 6th) after a visit to Papadopoulos' hospital room in Nicosia. 
Papadopoulos, 74, was recently diagnosed with lung cancer. 
Some media reported erroneously on Friday that the former leader of the country had died. 
Papadopoulos was president from February 2003 and February 2008. 
Cyprus joined the EU during his mandate.
In other news, a land mine explosion injured seven migrants, including three children, in the buffer zone dividing Cyprus on Friday. 
Authorities said that the group was trying to cross to the southern part of the island from the breakaway north and entered a minefield.

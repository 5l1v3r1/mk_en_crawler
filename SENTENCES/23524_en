PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu on Sunday (April 26th) appealed to Kosovo Serbs to return to their homes and to contribute to the overall development of society.
"They [Serbs] will have the support of both Kosovo and international institutions.
I appeal to local Serbs to remain peaceful;
to love Kosovo as their country as all other citizens;
to contribute to the overall stability, and ...
to return to their homes.
Nobody harasses them," Sejdiu said.
In other news Sunday, the International Red Cross asked both Pristina and Belgrade to demonstrate more commitment regarding missing persons.
The head of the working group for missing persons at the International Red Cross, Caroline Tissot, said the governments of Kosovo and Serbia have a legal obligation to provide families of the missing with information.
There are about 2,000 people -- primarily Albanians -- who are still considered missing since the conflict in Kosovo ended.

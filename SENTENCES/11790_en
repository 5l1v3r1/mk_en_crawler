ZAGREB, Croatia -- Authorities have arrested ten people suspected of having belonged to Bosnian Serb paramilitary units during the 1992-1995 conflict.
A police spokesman told the media Friday (17 June) that all the detainees were Croatian citizens who live in eastern Croatia, an area with a sizeable Serb population.
The detentions came less than a week after the arrest of a man suspected of belonging to the Serbian Scorpions unit, whose members were filmed executing Muslims in Srebrenica in 1995.
In other news, a court in Belgrade sentenced a Scorpions member to 20 years in prison for murders committed in Kosovo in 1999.
Sasa Cvjetan, 40, was found guilty of taking part in the execution of 14 ethnic Albanian civilians, mostly women and children, in Podujevo.
He was first convicted and sentenced last April.
But the Serbian Supreme Court rejected the initial sentence, citing procedural violations.

WASHINGTON, United States -- During his visit to Washington on Thursday (10 March), Romanian President Traian Basescu called for a new Black Sea strategy. 
"Euro-Atlantic security is closely connected to the security of the Black Sea area. 
Some of the transnational threats Europe faces come from this region," he said, urging greater involvement by the United States, the EU, NATO and OSCE. 
He said Romania favours promoting freedom, democracy and prosperity to secure stability.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published Saturday (4 December) that his government would not accept any new conditions from the EU.
He also insisted that the Union set a firm date at its 17 December summit for the launching of accession talks with his country.
This would enable Ankara to adopt a programme for meeting the standards of membership.
In other news, Vladimir Putin heads for Ankara on Sunday, the first state visit ever by a Russian president.
He is to have dinner with President Ahmet Necdet Sezer Sunday ahead of formal talks Monday.
The visit is expected to focus on economic issues.

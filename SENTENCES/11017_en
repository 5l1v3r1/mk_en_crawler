SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Police reform talks that had been under way for three days in the town of Vlasic were temporarily suspended late Wednesday (27 April), according to local media reports.
The break occurred after Serb parties rejected a proposal for new police regions that extend beyond entity boundaries, insisting instead that the regions comply with current entity configurations.
Nevertheless, 11 BiH parties decided to establish a commission, which will to try to hammer out a new map of police regions.
Talks will resume when the draft is ready, probably in mid May.
In other news, two members of the BiH Council of Ministers -- Foreign Trade Minister Dragan Doko and Transport and Communications Minister Branko Dokic -- are expected to resign Thursday.
Dnevni Avaz reports that Dokic decided to step down after the BiH Supreme Court rejected his appeal of embezzlement charges recently filed against him.
No reason was given for Doko's decision.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski on Wednesday (2 August) called on the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) to act responsibly and in line with laws and parliamentary procedures. 
Crvenkovski's statement came a day after the DUI left the parliament session at which new speaker Ljubisa Georgievski was elected.
In an interview Thursday with the Sofia-based Focus agency, DUI spokeswoman Ermira Mehmeti said the party favours "a consensus democracy" and would demonstrate "constructiveness" as an opposition party. 
But DUI still insists it should be included in the new coalition government led by VMRO-DPMNE, as most ethnic Albanians backed DUI in last month's parliamentary elections.

WASHINGTON, United States -- The state department announced on Tuesday (13 December) that US assistance to BiH since 1995 has reached $1.35 billion.
From 1996-1998, the US funding -- designated mainly for kick-starting reconstruction and enhanced economic growth, as well as support of minority re-integration -- totaled nearly $250m annually.
More recently, aid has gone to strengthening economic reforms and state institutions, including law enforcement agencies.
In other news, Sarajevo officials announced on Tuesday that the Netherlands has granted $11m to fund the UNDP's Srebrenica Region Recovery Programme.
It will be used for projects in the municipalities of Srebrenica, Bratunac and Milici.
Also Tuesday, the UNHCR's office in BiH welcomed an agreement sealed among BiH and entity ministries and the three power utilities in the country that provides for the reconnection of returnee houses to the BiH electricity grid.
It described the accord as a step forward in the process of sustainable refugee return.

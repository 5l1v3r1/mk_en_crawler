THE HAGUE, the Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has agreed to former Bosnian Serb police head Stojan Zupljanin's request to merge their two war crimes trials before The Hague tribunal, according to media reports Tuesday (December 16th). 
In a letter Monday, Karadzic said combining the two cases would help his defence by distributing the work involved, and would also allow key defence witnesses in both trials to testify once.
Zupljanin is already being tried together with former Republika Srpska Interior Minister Mico Stanisic, whose lawyers oppose merging Zupljanin's and Karadzic's trials. 
Zupljanin is charged with 1the murder, persecution and torture of Muslims in 1992. 
Karadzic is charged with ethnic cleansing during the 1992-1995 conflict and with the 1995 murder of Muslims in Srebrenica.

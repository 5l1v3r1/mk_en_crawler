TIRANA, Albania -- Despite some earlier reservations, the Central Election Commission (CEC) accredited on Thursday (May 14th) the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), with its 39 monitors who will observe the June 28th general elections. 
Earlier this week, the ruling coalition rejected the appointment of ODIHR mission head Audrey Glover. 
But the OSCE intervened by supporting the monitoring mission and explaining the government had no role in such appointments. 
The European Commission reminded Albania that such stands do not help its EU integration process.
In other news Thursday, the government announced the appointment of Viktor Guni as the new minister of labour, social welfare and equal rights. 
President Bamir Topi issued a decree quickly, after former minister Anastas Duro's Union of Human Rights Party (HRUP) signed a pre-election coalition agreement with the opposition Socialist Party. 
The Greek minority HRUP had been a government partner with the ruling Democratic Party.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prosecutors announced on Thursday (November 29th) that they have indicted 14 former Yugoslav Army troops and militiamen for war crimes committed in Croatia.
According to the indictments, prepared with help from the Croatian judiciary, the defendants killed 22 civilians in their houses on October 10, 1991, when they overran the village.
Another 23 Croats were executed while detained in the Lovas area near Vukovar.
The defendants are also accused of forcing captives to walk through a minefield.
Twenty-two died as a result, while three others were murdered in a separate incident.
The 14 defendants have been charged with committing a total of 70 murders.
They were arrested in May.

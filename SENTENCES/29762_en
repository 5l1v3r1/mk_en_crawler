SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Authorities froze the bank accounts Thursday (January 27th) of about ten companies registered at the address of the A1 television channel, including those of the media. 
According to prosecutors, a total of 4m euros have been blocked. 
The decision comes after the late December arrest of A1's owner Velija Ramkovski, based on allegations of fraud and organised crime, and was part of an operation aimed at tax evaders. 
The channel reiterated on Thursday that the arrest and freezing of bank accounts is politically motivated, as it has frequently criticised the ruling VMRO-DPMNE party.

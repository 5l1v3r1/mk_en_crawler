BUCHAREST, Romania -- The leader of the major opposition National Liberal Party (PNL), Theodor Stolojan, said Wednesday (3 September) that he would resign if an alliance with the Democratic Party (PD) is not endorsed by month's end.
The election co-operation agreement was reached between Stolojan and PD leader Traian Basescu late last week, but local press reports say some members of the PNL chairmanship oppose it.

PARIS, France -- Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy again called on Belgrade to extradite Ratko Mladic to the UN war crimes tribunal, saying the handover is key to continuing EU Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks beyond April. 
Douste-Blazy spoke to reporters after meeting with Serbia-Montenegro counterpart Vuk Draskovic in Paris.
Separately Tuesday, Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic said he believes in the ability of Belgrade authorities to locate and arrest Mladic. 
Marovic stressed that he expects the case to be resolved after three fruitless years.
In other news, Serbian police early Wednesday raided the premises of a Belgrade TV station, BK TV, controlled by Power of Serbia Movement leader Bogoljub Karic. 
The tycoon fled the country earlier this year after prosecutors filed charges against him in connection with the Mobtel GSM affair.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Constitutional Court said on Monday (August 9th) it cannot rule on a lawsuit filed by representatives of the national minorities who want the October 3rd general elections postponed until parliament amends electoral legislation in line with recommendations by the European Court in Strasbourg.
The judges say the case falls outside their scope.
The minorities pledge to file a new international lawsuit over the case.
In December, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that BiH's Constitution, created as an annex to the Dayton Peace Agreements, discriminates against minorities.
The Court urged BiH to reform the constitution and guarantee equal representation for all.
But critics say parliament systemically delays the adoption of necessary amendments despite pressure from the EU and the rest of the international community.

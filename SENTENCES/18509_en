SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Sulejman Tihic will remain the leader of the main Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA) after a vote by the main board Saturday (December 9th). 
The session followed weeks of debate within SDA, where some in the party pressed for his resignation for failing to win re-election as the Bosniak member of the tripartite BiH presidency during the October 1st general elections.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Following a several-month delay, Turkey has approved a US request for continued access to the Incirlik military airbase in southern Turkey. 
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul told reporters on Monday (25 April) that the government decided to extend US access to the base by one year. 
US troops use the base for logistical and humanitarian purposes related to peacekeeping operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In other news Monday, Turkey confirmed that Greece has apologised for the recent vandalising of a Turkish flag in Athens. 
The incident happened at the Greek War Academy while Greek Foreign Minister Petros Molyviatis was visiting Ankara last week.

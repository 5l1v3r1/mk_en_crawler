ROME, Italy -- Turkey is preparing to begin EU accession negotiations at the end of 2004 by concentrating on the Copenhagen political criteria, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Tuesday (30 September) during a visit to Italy. 
Commenting on EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenther Verheugen's comments earlier this week that reaching an agreement on Cyprus was also a precondition for accession negotiations, Gul said Cyprus is not determining Turkey's relations with the Union. 
"The procedure, which has been implemented in every country that wanted to be a member of the EU, will also be implemented on Turkey." (Anadolu Agency, NTV, TRT 2 - 30/09/03)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said Tuesday (13 May) that if Turkey undertakes certain steps towards democratisation, it could become a member of the EU as soon as 2007.
He added that failing to resolve the Cyprus dispute should not be an obstacle to EU membership.
Italy assumes the rotating EU presidency in July.

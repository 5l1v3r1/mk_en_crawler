BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Republika Srpska (RS) government expects its commission tasked with investigating the 1995 Srebrenica massacre to present its final report by the Friday (30 September) deadline.
Prime Minister Pero Bukejlovic met with commission members Monday to reiterate that the Office of the High Representative's (OHR) deadline must be observed and the document must be available for discussion by the Bosnian Serb cabinet on Friday.
Also Monday, RS President Dragan Cavic warned that sanctions imposed by the OHR could paralyse his ruling Serb Democratic Party (SDS) and fuel radicalism within the party.
Cavic's comment came during a speech to an extraordinary meeting of the party.
He suggested the SDS might withdraw from the BiH Council of Ministers.
Separately, another top Bosnian Serb politician, BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic -- a member of the Party for Democratic Progress -- said he would not rule out early elections in BiH.
His comments appeared in Tuesday's Nezavisne novine.
In other news, thousands of pensioners from across RS demonstrated in Banja Luka, on Monday, demanding better living conditions and back payments of pensions owed since 2002.
Rally organiser Rade Rakulj says pensioners are the poorest and most endangered social class in the entity.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The major opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) demanded on Friday (1 April) that all large-scale privatisation or concession deals be frozen until the parliamentary elections this summer.
BSP wants the freeze to extend to nearly completed procedures, including the concession for the two seaside airports in Varna and Bourgas.
The left-wing opposition also sharply criticised the ruling coalition for a highway concession deal sealed with Portuguese firms last week.
One of the contractors is related to Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg.

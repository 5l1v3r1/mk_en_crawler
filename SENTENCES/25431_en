BELGRADE, Serbia -- Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic said on Thursday (March 25th) that he hopes his country will get EU candidate status by the middle of next year.
After meeting with a visiting delegation of EU diplomats, Djelic said he had proposed that an EU-Balkan summit set for June in Sarajevo will focus on prospects for membership.
Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU must be ratified before the country can receive candidate status.

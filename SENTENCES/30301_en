TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Democratic Party (DP) announced about 300,000 people turned out in Tirana to mark the 20th anniversary of the end of the communism regime Sunday (February 20th). 
After dictator Enver Hoxha's regime was toppled two decades ago, the DP was established and became the first ruling party in pluralism. 
Speaking at the event, party leader and Prime Minister Sali Berisha noted that "Albania managed to bring down the fiercest communism regime in Europe." The protest was also seen as a response to anti-government rallies organised by the opposition.

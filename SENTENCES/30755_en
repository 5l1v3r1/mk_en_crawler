BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska President Milorad Dodik said on Friday (March 11th) that he will order the arrest of former Vice President Ejup Ganic and retired Army General Jovan Divjak if they enter the entity's territory.
Serbia accuses them of participating in a 1992 attack in Bosnia, in which dozens of mainly Serb army soldiers were killed.
The UN war crimes tribunal has dismissed the charges and BiH's war crimes court has said it has insufficient evidence to press charges.
Dodik said on Friday he will ask police to investigate the possibility of arresting the two former officials and sending them to Serbia.

TIRANA, Albania -- An airplane flying from Tirana to Bologna with 110 passengers on board changed course and landed in Bratislava, Slovakia on Sunday (January 17th). 
The reason for the diversion remains unclear. 
Local media reports allege the Slovak crew was protesting unpaid wages. 
However, Air Slovakia -- which leased the plane to the Albanian company -- has denied this, saying its pilots were paid on time and a technical problem was to blame.

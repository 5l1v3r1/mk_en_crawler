ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament approved a series of constitutional amendments Wednesday (June 16th) that enable the completion of EU accession negotiations.
The vote was 133-4, with one abstention.
This marks the fourth time the constitution is being amended since 1990.
The amendments facilitate holding a referendum on joining the EU, strengthen judicial independence and give local courts the power to directly apply EU laws.
There are also non-EU-related amendments, including one on voting by expatriates, which will only be allowed in diplomatic and consular buildings, and three parliamentary seats will be earmarked for Croatians living abroad.
In addition, the election of Constitutional Court judges will require a two-thirds majority of votes in parliament, instead of a simple majority.
The changes will also allow Croatia to extradite its citizens to other countries, to stand trial for crimes.

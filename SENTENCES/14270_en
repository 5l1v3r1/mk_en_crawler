BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Parliament's foreign affairs committee discussed on Thursday (13 October) the status of minority rights in Vojvodina, Serbia's northern province, which has a sizable Hungarian minority population.
The discussion was an opportunity for Serbia-Montenegro to challenge claims that minority rights are violated in Vojvodina.
Rasim Ljajic, Serbian-Montenegrin human and minority rights minister, argued that incidents between members of different nationalities have been overstated.
Similarly, Bojan Pajtic, head of the Vojvodina cabinet, insisted that any such cases are isolated and that there is no systematic violation of human rights.

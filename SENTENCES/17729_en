SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor jailed for years in Libya may be released this week, says Seif al Islam, son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and head of the Gaddafi Foundation, which negotiated the deal regarding the medics.
In an interview with the Arab newspaper Al-Hayat, quoted by the DPA news agency on Friday (July 20th), al Islam said the medics may be able to leave as soon as all details of an agreement between Libya and Bulgaria are clarified, a process that is nearly complete.
Earlier sentenced to death for allegedly infecting more than 400 Libyan children with HIV, their sentence was commuted last week to life in prison.
Al Islam suggests the transfer of the six to Bulgaria would coincide with Wednesday's visit of French President Nicolas Sarkozy to Tripoli.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Michael Steiner said Tuesday (4 March) that it is still too early to discuss the important issues pertaining to Kosovo. 
His statement was in response to sharp criticism from Belgrade that he had suggested talks on more practical matters, mainly economic and administrative. 
Belgrade had said it wants to concentrate on refugee returns, freedom of movement and the decentralisation of northern Mitrovica.
Also Tuesday, Steiner met with Ali Ahmeti, leader of Macedonia's Democratic Union for Integration. 
They focused on regional security issues, including implementation of the Ohrid peace accord. 
Ahmeti also met with Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova and other political leaders.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The European Parliament (EP) Rapporteur for Kosovo, Ulrike Lunacek, said on Wednesday (October 6th) that Kosovo's EU visa liberalisation "should be discussed without losing any time".
The Austrian representative at the EP said that in July, the entire EP had made it clear that the European Commission should set the guidelines or first steps for Kosovo's visa liberalisation process.
Speaking to Deutche Welle, Lunacek said that in her contacts with Kosovo authorities, she is continuously reassured of the work that is being done in this direction.
From Prizren on Wednesday, Minister for Integrations Besim Beqaj said the conditions have already been met -- mainly by adopting and implementing the Repatriation Law -- to officially receive the process roadmap.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Radio B92 reports Thursday (27 November) that the Central Institute of Criminology in Wiesbaden, Germany has confirmed that a sniper rifle found during Operation Sabre was used to murder Serbian Prime Minister Djindjic.
The rifle, a Heckler and Koch, was found in the massive police operation after Djindjic's assassination in March.
Investigators say the weapon was fired by Zvezdan Jovanovic, who received it from Milorad "Legija" Lukovic, the Zemun clan leader who remains on the loose.

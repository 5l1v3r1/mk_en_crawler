PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Police raided the headquarters of the Self-Determination (Vetevendosje) movement in Pristina early on Thursday (April 15th) searching for leader Albin Kurti, who was to appear in court later in the day. 
Kurti is accused of participating in a crowd committing a criminal offence and taking part in obstructing officials from performing their duties. 
The charges stem from a demonstration three years ago. 
Kurti is the only person being held responsible for the February 10th 2007 demonstration during which two protestors died and more than 80 people were wounded. 
Police could not find him Thursday, prompting officials to adjourn Friday's court session until Monday. 
Kurti has been boycotting to protest international missions that don't recognise Kosovo's independence.

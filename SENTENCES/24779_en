ATHENS, Greece -- Gunmen opened fire on riot police in central Athens on Monday (January 5th), wounding one young policeman critically. 
The assailants reportedly fired the same Kalashnikov automatic weapons used against a van carrying police last month. 
Monday's attack targeted police guarding the culture ministry, in the wake of weeks of angry protests over the fatal shooting of a teenager by a Greek police officer.

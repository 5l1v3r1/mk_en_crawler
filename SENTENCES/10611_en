ANKARA, Turkey -- A court on Wednesday (13 October) charged radical Islamic cleric Metin Kaplan with terrorism and plotting to overthrow the Turkish state.
Kaplan, nicknamed "the Caliph of Cologne", appeared before court a day after his extradition from Germany.
He already has served a four-year sentence in Germany for ordering the murder of a rival Islamic leader.
In other news Wednesday, both German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said they want the European Commission to launch talks with Turkey without delay.
Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker also urged a quick start to the talks, saying they should get under way in the first half of 2005.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Association of Independent Trade Unions (SSSH) is threatening to leave the national Social and Economic Council if the cabinet fails to back a proposed four-day work week, SSSH's President Dragica Misetic said Thursday (July 9th).
The Association of Employers (HUP) may follow suit.
According to trade union estimates, the shorter week could apply to about 100,000 employees and will save approximately 20,000 jobs.
Employers and trade unions have been holding talks with the government for the past few weeks.
However, cabinet officials seem unwilling to support the measure due to fiscal constraints.

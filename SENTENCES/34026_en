ZAGREB, Croatia -- On Tuesday (29 July), members of the government defended proposed changes to the penal code, arguing that concerns expressed by OSCE mission head Peter Semneby were groundless.
Semneby had suggested that the changes, which would make slander a criminal offence, could violate freedom of speech.
Foreign Minister Tonino Picula, however, said the potential penalties were milder than those already in place in other European countries.
Justice Minister Ingrid Anticevic-Marinovic and Culture Minister Antun Vujic also defended the draft measure.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Two parties, the New Democratic Power-Forca and the Albanian Alternative, urged supporters Monday (March 24th) to back Nebojsa Medojevic, for president. 
He is running as the candidate of the Movement for Changes in the April 6th election. 
The two parties say they are dissatisfied with the level of democratisation under the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists and their coalition partners. 
They also criticised the level of decentralisation and what they view as an insufficient implementation of international human rights conventions.

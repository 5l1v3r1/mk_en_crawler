SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said on Tuesday (January 13th) he plans to draft a set of measures that will yank BiH out of the current stalemate in its EU integration effort and to announce them by the end of the month.
In an interview with Dnevni Avaz, Lajcak said he would not impose thousands of pages of EU legislation but instead would seek a means to accelerate those reforms.
BiH politicians must change their way of thinking, something that cannot be imposed from abroad, Lajcak commented.
He also noted that no reforms have resulted since the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU in June.
Lajcak considers this to be a crucial year in BiH's EU bid, as the country will either advance with its regional peers -- Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia -- or stagnate.

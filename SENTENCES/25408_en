BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic and Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac attended the opening of a military base Monday (November 23rd) named Jug (South) near Bujanovac. 
At the ceremony, Tadic said the facility will be a key factor for security and peace and will help in the fight against organised crime, while contributing to the economic development of southern Serbia. 
The base, also known as Cepotina after a nearby hill, is described as the largest and most modern of its kind in the region. 
It is located near the ground safety zone and the administrative line with Kosovo.
Albanians living in southern Serbia are unhappy with the base, describing it as the "militarisation" of their region.

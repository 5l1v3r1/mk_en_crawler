TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha on Wednesday (October 27th) praised a report by Transparency International, which noted a slight improvement in Albania's efforts to fight corruption. 
The country moved eight places in this year's ranking to 87th position. 
Berisha told a cabinet meeting the results are due to government efforts and reforms. 
He added that the report would have been more positive if Tirana Mayor and opposition Socialist Party leader Edi Rama would stop issuing construction permits in the capital under shady circumstances. 
Rama was fast to react, accusing the cabinet of being the main source of corruption in issuing licenses to build hydro plants.

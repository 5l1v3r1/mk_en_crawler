SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) officially named incumbent Georgi Parvanov as its candidate in the 22 October presidential elections, during a celebration Saturday (29 July) of the party's 115th anniversary.
Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev, the BSP's leader, said the goal is to attract a wider circle of support.
Meanwhile, right-wing opposition parties are hinting that after protracted negotiations, they are finally close to naming a joint candidate for president.
The official announcement is expected on Tuesday.
The frontrunners appear to be Nedelcho Beronov -- president of the Constitutional Court, who was proposed by the Democrats for Strong Bulgaria -- and Anastasia Mozer, chairwoman of the agricultural party BZNS-PU.

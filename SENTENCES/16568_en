THESSALONIKI, Greece -- Police say they detained 27 people over incidents that marred street demonstrations marking the opening of the 71st Thessaloniki International Fair on Friday (8 September). 
The protests, reportedly held by supporters of a local football team, turned violent after demonstrators started throwing fireworks and stones at buildings, damaging three shops and injuring two police officers.
In Athens Saturday, three more arrests were made following a rally by trade unions against the government's economic reform programme. 
Police fired tear gas after rioters broke away from peaceful marches and clashed with security personnel. 
Several cars were damaged.

NEW YORK, United States -- Turkey voted against the new set of sanctions to be levied on Iran by the UN Security Council on Wednesday (June 9th).
After brokering a significant nuclear swap deal with Brazil and Iran, Turkey's vote -- with Brazil -- was no surprise, noted Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu.
The new resolution attempts to impose tougher sanctions on Tehran's nuclear programme.
Davutoglu described Turkey's stance as principled.
The nuclear swap deal signed last month was considered a significant diplomatic achievement.
Hours before the vote, the US, France and Russia released three separate letters, rejecting the swap.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament on Wednesday (November 21) held the first of two votes on the 2008 budget.
Among other things, it introduces a flat tax, higher excise duties and a higher minimum wage.
Of 163 deputies attending the session, 59 voted against the government bill.
Addressing lawmakers, Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev said the budget would ensure financial stability, accelerate economic growth, and boost incomes.
It is based on forecasts of 6% economic growth, a surplus of more than 3% of GDP, and an inflation rate of 6.7% -- figures which the opposition says are too optimistic.

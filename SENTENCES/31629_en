BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Intent on improving co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, lawmakers convened Monday (14 April) to amend a law enabling the extradition of more Serb suspects to the Netherlands-based court.
Pending expected parliamentary approval, a provision that any suspect indicted after April 2002 should be tried in domestic courts will be removed from the law.
In other news, Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic reiterated on Sunday that former Bosnian Serb Army commander Gen Ratko Mladic is not in the country.
Svilanovic said that judging from conversations with Internal Affairs Minister Mihajlovic, Mladic is gone.
For months, prosecutors at The Hague have insisted Mladic had been hiding in the area, protected by some in the army.
In other news, Svilanovic told BK TV that he believes alleged links between former Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica and the assassination of political rival Zoran Djindjic are greatly exaggerated.
He says he does not believe Kostunica should be detained over the matter.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The first hearing on the third indictment in the Ergenekon trial is scheduled for Monday (September 7th) in Istanbul. 
The city's court has decided to merge the third indictment with the previous one, thus bringing the total number of indictees to 108. 
Prosecutors are seeking life sentences for 24 of those charged with planning assassinations against leaders of the Armenian and Alevitian communities -- murders and bomb attacks aimed at destabilising the country and eventually leading to a coup d'etat. 
Generals of reserve forces, university professors, and former security officials are among the indicted. 
The trial is being held behind closed doors in a new prison near the Istanbul suburb of Silivri, where most of the charged are being detained.

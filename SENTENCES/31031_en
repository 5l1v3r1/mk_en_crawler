SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) is waiting for Republika Srpska (RS) to drop plans to hold a referendum on the BiH Court and Prosecutor's Office, OHR spokesperson Dorothee Junkers said on Monday (May 2nd).
She warned that if RS fails to do so, High Representative Valentin Inzko will have to respond.
The RS parliament decided on April 13th to call a referendum on High Representative-imposed laws, particularly on the BiH Court and Prosecutor's Office.
Srna news agency, quoting unnamed diplomatic sources in Sarajevo, reports that Inzko could use his Bonn Powers to halt the referendum and impose sanctions against Bosnian Serb political leaders who support it.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Liviu Dragnea of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) took office on Wednesday (January 21st) as the new administration and interior minister, promising better administration and safer streets. 
Dragnea backs administrative and financial decentralisation and says the local administration needs immediate reforms. 
Dragnea promised to respect the ministry's structure and to talk to each head of county administration and police. 
President Traian Basescu had been planning to attend but decided not to at the last moment, reportedly because so many PSD officials were there.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Netherlands extradited a Serbian man, regarded as one of the chief drug smugglers in Europe, to Belgrade on Thursday (23 March), the Beta news agency reported. 
Sreten Jocic, accused in Serbia of having ordered a killing, was transferred from Belgrade airport to a prison under tight security, with police deployed along the road. 
Jocic had been arrested in 2002 in Bulgaria on a Serbian arrest warrant, but was first handed over to the Netherlands where he was already facing a prison sentence.
In other news, Vladimir Bozovic, inspector general of the Serbian interior ministry, delivered a lecture Thursday on fighting police corruption at the International Law Enforcement Agency in Budapest. 
Representatives of Hungarian, Romanian and Serbia-Montenegro police were in the audience.

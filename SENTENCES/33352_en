SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Principal Deputy High Representative Donald Hays warned on Monday (5 May) that the international community is losing patience over the Republika Srpska (RS) government's delay in implementing scheduled reforms at the RS Elektroprivreda power utility.
Hays said he discussed the issue with RS Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic and RS Elektroprivreda's provisional management at a meeting in Doboj last weekend.
Two months ago, the Office of the High Representative urged immediate reforms after presenting the results of a special audit of the company, which showed embezzlements and losses totaling more than 30m euros.

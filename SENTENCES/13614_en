ZAGREB, Croatia -- Tension is brewing between the government and the trade unions over economic issues. 
On Monday (21 November), syndicate representatives left a session of the country's Economic and Social Council, saying the cabinet failed to fulfil its pledge to include the unions in the drafting of the 2006 budget law. 
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader denied the charge, insisting that his administration has respected its commitments and planned to consult the unions about the budget before it is submitted to parliament for approval.

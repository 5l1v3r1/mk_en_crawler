TIRANA, Albania -- The government has decided to send peacekeeping troops to Chad, in central Africa, to support an EU initiative there. 
Albanian troops are already serving in international missions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iraq and Afghanistan. 
"I think it's a good decision because it is a very important moment for our country," Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha said after a government meeting Wednesday (May 7th). 
Albania was invited to join NATO at the Bucharest summit in early April.

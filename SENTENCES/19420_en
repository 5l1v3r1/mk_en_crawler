ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told parliament on Tuesday (October 30th) that Turkey will not give up diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis with Kurdish separatists, but it will not exclude a cross-border military operation against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in northern Iraq. 
Erdogan blamed the terrorist group's attacks on "the vacuum in the Iraqi government" and said lead countries in the world and in the region do not provide Ankara with the support it needs to fight the PKK. 
He also warned that future relations between the United States and Turkey depend on Washington's response to this matter.
Separately Tuesday, Foreign Minister Ali Babacan said Turkey wants the PKK issue discussed and resolved within the EU. 
He also stressed that his country is among those that support Iraq's integration, development and security.

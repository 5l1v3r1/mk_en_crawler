BELGRADE, Serbia--Vojvodina's parliament approved the province's statute Monday (December 14th).
The law strengthens the province's autonomy and gives it jurisdiction in 20 areas, including regional development, agriculture, tourism, industry, transportation, health care, the economy and privatisation, and mining and energy.
Vojvodina will also get its own representative in Brussels, though it will not be able to sign international agreements--only regional ones.
A total of 86 lawmakers from the ruling coalition supported the measure, while three members of the opposition coalition between the Democratic Party and New Serbia party opposed it.
Members of the Serb Radical Party and the Serbian Progressive Party boycotted the vote, claiming the legislation is a separatist act that will lead to Serbia's disintegration.
The Serbian parliament has already okayed the statute.

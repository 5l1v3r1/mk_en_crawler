SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The head of the OSCE Mission in BiH, Ambassador Douglas Davidson, called for the establishment of a state-level ombudsman institution in the country, in an interview with Dnevni Avaz daily published Thursday (May 17th). 
The ambassador positively assessed the work of the current ombudsmen in Republika Srpska and the Federation of BiH, but underlined that a state-level ombudsman would better guarantee protection of rights of all BiH citizens.

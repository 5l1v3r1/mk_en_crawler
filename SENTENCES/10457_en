SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament voted Thursday (18 November) to accept the resignation of Prime Minister Hari Kostov and gave President Branko Crvenkovski ten days to select a successor.
The Social Democrats, winners of the last general election, will be asked to nominate a candidate.
Crvenkovski, who was visiting Albania at the time of the parliamentary vote, said there is no political crisis in the country.
He denied suggestions of differences between the partners in the ruling coalition.
Crvenkovski and Albanian counterpart Alfred Moisiu discussed ways to forge closer bilateral relations and undertake joint efforts to move their countries closer to EU membership.
In other news Thursday, Macedonia's Interior Ministry said it has charged former Agricultural Minister Marjan Gjorcev with abuse of office and corruption.
He is accused of mismanagement and draining 190,000 euros in state funds.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker warned Kosovo Albanian leaders on Monday (November 13th) to refrain from any unilateral moves, in the wake of UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's decision to postpone his proposal on status by several months."Any statements that allude to Kosovo taking unilateral actions are in contradiction to the Contact Groupâ€™s Guiding Principles," Ruecker said.
"Such statements can undermine support for Kosovo at this crucial time." His comments came at a meeting in Pristina with Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku and KFOR Commander Lieutenant General Roland Kather.
Meanwhile, EU security chief Javier Solana said in Brussels Monday that the bloc supports Ahtisaari's decision to put off the proposal until after Serbia's parliamentary elections in January.
According to Solana, this would give Serbia a chance to elect a strong democratic government.
He suggested there should be no further postponements.

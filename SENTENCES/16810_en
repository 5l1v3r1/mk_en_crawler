ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police on Friday (4 August) arrested reporter Domagoj Margetic, who is accused of non-compliance with and disrespect for the UN war crimes tribunal.
Earlier in the week, Margetic refused to accept a tribunal injunction that the Croatian judiciary attempted to deliver to him.
According to a statement from the Zagreb court, the investigative judge in the case later ordered him detained for 48 hours while Croatian authorities await an extradition request from The Hague tribunal.
The injunction apparently is related to Margetic's recent publication -- on his own website -- of the protected witnesses in the tribunal's 2004 trial against Bosnian Croat General Tihomir Blaskic.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Thousands gathered in Zagreb's main square on Friday (December 5th) in a rally organised by Web activists demanding early elections, better living conditions and improved education.
The rally, which spread into a few other cities as well, occurred after the police apologised on Wednesday for arresting a young man who organised a Facebook online group called "I bet I can find 5,000 people who dislike [Prime Minister Ivo] Sanader".

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Deputy Prime Minister and Regional Development Minister Kostadin Paskalev resigned Friday (1 November), citing a lack of political confidence in his work.
Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg accepted the resignation after meeting with him personally.
Paskalev is a member of the opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party, but indicated that was not the issue.

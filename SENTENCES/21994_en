ANKARA Turkey -- One protester died on Monday (October 20th) in clashes with police during Kurdish protests against Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's visit to the southeastern town of Diyarbakir.
Supporters of the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party and suspected members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) set fires on the streets of Diyarbakir, the latest in a series of rallies in support of imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan following allegations of his mistreatment in prison.
Authorities deny the claims.
Also Monday, Foreign Minister Ali Babacan announced that Turkey is considering three-way consultations with Iraq and the United States to step up actions against PKK bases in northern Iraq.
Iraqi President Jalal Talabani proposed the talks.
Meanwhile, Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdish autonomous region in northern Iraq, said on Monday he is ready to accept establishment of a buffer zone between Iraq and Turkey.
Leaders hope the zone will prevent PKK incursions.

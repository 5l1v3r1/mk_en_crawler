PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Minister of Local Government Administration Sadri Ferati said on Saturday (January 2nd) that most of the work in the decentralisation process has been completed, citing as evidence the participation of Serb community members in the recent municipal elections. 
Ferati added that progress has been achieved due to the Kosovo government's commitment to collaborating with EULEX, and with the support of other international partners. 
Speaking to TV 21, he announced that digitalisation of municipal administration services will take place in 2010.

NEW YORK, United States -- Croatian President Stipe Mesic on Tuesday (December 9th) criticised the actions and policies of US President George W. Bush's administration in the fight against terrorism.
Speaking at a special session of the UN Security Council in New York that Mesic convened to renew the world's commitment to fighting terrorism, he said US methods have discredited the global fight against terrorism.
According to Mesic, whose country leads the UN Security Council this month and heads the council's anti-terror committee, the global solidarity that Washington gained after the September 11th 2001 terrorist attacks was "deflated" because the war against terrorism turned into "a kind of exclusive responsibility of one country, or of a group of countries that it led".
In other news Tuesday, the Association of Croatian Journalists urged authorities to investigate cases of corruption at the state television channel HRT.
On Monday, HRT suspended a leading editor for suspected corruption after Slavonski Brod Mayor Mario Duspara said he paid 8,000 euros to a public relations agency to arrange his participation in an HRT show.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian crime figure Sreten Jocic pleaded not guilty Tuesday (April 20th) at his trial in Belgrade for the murder of prominent Croatian journalist Ivo Pukanic.
According to the indictment, Jocic masterminded Pukanic's October 2008 murder, paying 1.5m euros to kill the journalist, who had been reporting on organised crime.
Pukanic, co-owner and editor-in-chief of the weekly Nacional, died in a car bombing in downtown Zagreb, along with the newspaper's marketing director, Niko Franjic.
Two others are on trial in Serbia, along with five defendants in Croatia.

BANGKOK, Thailand -- An arrest warrant was issued on Tuesday (May 25th) for former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, on terrorism charges. 
He is suspected of involvement in recent violent anti-government street protests that left more than 80 people dead. 
Shinawatra was ousted in a 2006 military coup and then sentenced in absentia to two years in prison for corruption and abuse of office. 
Montenegrin authorities confirmed recently that he holds a Montenegrin passport. 
A source close to him told AFP on Tuesday that Shinawatra is back in Montenegro with his family. 
He was first spotted there in March.

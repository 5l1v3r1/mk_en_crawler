BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EUFOR Commander Major General David Leakey said Sunday (9 January) that EUFOR and NATO had solid evidence that war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic visited military facilities in Han Pijesak, eastern BiH, over the summer.
Leakey also said that recent actions by EUFOR in the region and other measures taken jointly with the BiH Defence Ministry were aimed at ensuring facilities could no longer be used to shelter such suspects.
On Monday, BiH Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic is to be given the results of the investigation by a ministry team.
The probe is also aimed at identifying potential supporters of Mladic within the Bosnian Serb government and military institutions.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) on Thursday (June 3rd) announced an end to its unilateral 14-month ceasefire with Turkey, conceding it has achieved little. 
Turkish forces have continued to launch attacks against PKK targets, said the terrorist organisation. 
PKK spokesman Ahmed Danees told Reuters that in addition, Kurdish political and party officials face attacks in Turkey and the country has made little progress in its reforms aimed at expanding the rights of the Kurdish minority.
Meanwhile, Iraqi Kurdish leader Massud Barzani promised on Thursday that he will work to stop Kurdish violence against Turkey. 
"We are against the continuation of violence. 
We do not see Turkey's security as separate from our own. 
We will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation," Barzani said after meeting with Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu in Ankara. 
Davutoglu welcomed the move and said Ankara wants "full economic integration" with the region on the basis of "common strategy of trade, energy and transport".

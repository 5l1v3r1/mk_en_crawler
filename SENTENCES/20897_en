SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak rejected on Thursday (October 4th) the last-minute police reform deal struck by Bosniak and Bosnian Serb leaders Haris Siladzic and Milorad Dodik last week. 
Lajcak said that while it was a solid attempt at compromise, the document fails to meet the three key principles for police reform set by the EU. 
Lajcak said a proposal he made remains on the table, and that he would give local parties a few more days to hammer out a compromise.
Reforming the police forces in BiH's two entities has been a key stumbling block to signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.

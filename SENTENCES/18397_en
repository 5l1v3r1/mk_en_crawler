ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned on Monday (April 9th) Iraqi Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani not to threaten Turkey, saying he crossed the line of diplomacy. 
The Turkish Foreign Ministry also delivered an official note to the Iraqi government. 
US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack followed up Monday, saying Barzani's statements in no way supported the goal of greater Turkish- Iraqi co-operation on issues of common concern, including fighting Kurdistan Workers Party terrorists.

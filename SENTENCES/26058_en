BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The Greek government submitted its economic stabilisation plan to the European Commission (EC) on Friday (January 15th).
The programme, designed to eliminate Greece's budget deficits and salvage the country's position on world markets, includes spending cuts, pay freezes and salary caps in the public sector.
Greece's deficit ballooned to 12.7% of GDP last year, well above the 2.8% limit permitted for countries in the eurozone.

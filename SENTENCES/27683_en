SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Several thousand people gathered in downtown Skopje on Sunday (June 27th) to protest government policies. 
Participants in the demonstration, organised by the main opposition party SDSM, blamed the VMRO-DPMNE-led cabinet for the economic situation, and criticised Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski for failing to advance Macedonia's EU and NATO bids. 
The SDSM wants early elections, but only after NATO's November summit, so as to not affect aspirations to join the Alliance.

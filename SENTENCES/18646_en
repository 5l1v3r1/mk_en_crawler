PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The militant ethnic Albanian group Vetevendosje (Self-determination) organised a rally in Pristina on Saturday (February 10th), demanding that Kosovo's parliament proclaim independence immediately.
About 3,000 Kosovo Albanians showed up to protest against UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's blueprint for the province.
Violence then broke out as the demonstrators tried to break through security barricades and storm government buildings.
Police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.
On Sunday, UNMIK reported that two persons seriously injured in the clash had died overnight.
The previous day some 10,000 Serbs in the divided town of Mitrovica protested against Ahtisaari's plan.
The protest was organised by the Serbian National Council of Kosovo and local Serb leaders, who announced protests would be held in other Serbian towns, as well as a huge rally in Belgrade.
Meanwhile, a delegation of eight US senators and representatives, led by independent Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, visited Pristina on Friday and met with Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku.
"We're looking forward to the implementation of those recommendations as Kosovo moves on to achieve its rightful status as an independent nation," Lieberman said after the talks.

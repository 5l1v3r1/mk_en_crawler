THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The trial of Serbian Radical Party (SRS) leader Vojislav Seselj for contempt of court starts on Tuesday (February 22nd) at The Hague war crimes tribunal.
A year ago, Seselj was charged after revealing the identity of 11 protected witnesses in his war crimes trial.
The court sentenced him in 2009 to 15 months in prison for revealing the identity of three protected witnesses in one of his books, despite a court ban on disseminating such information.
Seselj also faces separate charges for war crimes committed against non-Serbs in Croatia, Vojvodina and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 1993.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Without police reform, the EU cannot start talks on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) Steering Board agreed Thursday (7 April) during its regular quarterly progress review. 
The PIC members met in Brussels with High Representative Paddy Ashdown, BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic, BiH Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic, RS President Dragan Cavic, and RS Minister of Interior Darko Matijasevic, who briefed them on the latest developments in the country. 
Afterwards, PIC members issued a communique calling on BiH authorities to quickly resolve differences over establishing an efficient state-level police structure. 
They also stressed their support for the work of the Defence Reform Commission, including its efforts to make the armed forces more professional. 
The PIC session was considered particularly crucial. 
It was the last before a series of meetings in April and May, during which the international community will discuss the status of BiH's aspirations to join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme and begin SAA negotiations.

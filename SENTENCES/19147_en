BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU will pull more than half of its 6,500 troops from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) within the next three months, the outgoing director-general of the EU Military Staff announced on Wednesday (February 28th).
General Jean-Paul Perruche told reporters that some 2,500 EU soldiers will remain in the country, ready to re-establish a more robust presence if needed.
BiH Presidency Chairman Nebojsa Radmanovic welcomed the news, saying it "confirms that we have reached the point where we are able to ensure the stability and reform process on our own".
The mandate of the international community's high representative has been extended another year, however.

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Relations between Slovenia and Croatia are in a very sensitive phase and should be paid special attention, Slovenian President Danilo Turk said on Saturday (July 18th) in an interview with the daily Dnevnik. 
He stressed the two countries should continue talks on the latest proposal by the European Commission (EC) to solve their border issue, and avoid "aggressive and offensive rhetoric". 
Turk also recalled last week's incident when police arrested a Croat veteran who allegedly plotted to assassinate Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor. 
He said that although a "mentally ill person" prepared the assassination plan, it clearly showed the current tense atmosphere between the two neighbouring countries.

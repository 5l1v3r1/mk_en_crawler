BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu urged parliament Monday (July 28th) to launch criminal probes against former ministers and current lawmakers suspected of graft.
Basescu called for a special meeting of the parliament's two chambers to approve high-level corruption probes against seven former cabinet ministers and former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase.
They are suspected of a variety of offences such as accepting bribes, using their influence to benefit relatives, and engaging in deals that damaged the interests of the state.
Last week, the European Commission issued a report that criticised Romania's results in fighting high level corruption.

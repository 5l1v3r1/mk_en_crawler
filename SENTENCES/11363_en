WASHINGTON, United States -- During a visit to Washington on Wednesday (25 May), Serbia-Montenegro Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic reiterated the state union's willingness to fulfil its obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal. 
Ljajic, who also heads Serbia-Montenegro's national council for co-operation with the UN tribunal, also insisted that authorities would arrest and extradite fugitive indictee Ratko Mladic if he were located on Serbian territory. 
His statement came amid reports the US Congress may delay its decision on financial aid to Serbia-Montenegro, originally slated for the end of this month, until June.

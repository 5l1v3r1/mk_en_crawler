ATHENS, Greece -- Riot police fired tear gas at rock-throwing protesters who gathered in Athens Sunday (December 6th), to mark the first anniversary of the fatal shooting of a 15-year-old boy by a policeman. 
On Sunday, 6,000 police are on the streets of Athens to tamp down violence. 
In Thessaloniki, Greece's second-largest city, demonstrators threw petrol bombs at police and smashed a storefront Sunday, according to the Associated Press. 
More than 150 people were arrested in Athens late Saturday, on the eve of demonstrations in memory of 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos. 
His death sparked huge protests in Greece for weeks.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu's minority government is scheduled to face a no confidence vote in Parliament Monday (June 11th), filed by President Traian Basescu's Democratic Party (PD).
The party, a former ally of Tariceanu's National Liberal Party, was ousted from the cabinet earlier this year.
PD cites the failure of the May 19th referendum on Basescu's impeachment as reason for the no confidence vote.
Tariceanu's cabinet is expected to survive, however, since the main opposition Social Democratic Party has said it will not back PD's initiative.

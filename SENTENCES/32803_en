BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Polls opened Sunday (8 December) for the third attempt since October to elect a Serbian president. 
Serbs in Kosovo will also participate in the election. 
Voters will choose from three candidates: Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica, Vojislav Seselj of the Serbian Radical Party and Borislav Pelevic of the Serbian Unity Party. 
Serbian Patriarch Pavle on Saturday urged voters to go to the polls, reminding them that each vote counts. 
His call came amid growing concerns that the election could yet again be foiled by low voter turnout. 
If fewer than 50 per cent of voters go to the polls or if none of the candidates gets more than 50 per cent support on the first round, a second round would be held 22 December.

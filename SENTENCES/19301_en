BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu sacked five prefects on Tuesday (August 28th), citing the need to boost government efficiency. 
All five, however, were replaced with members of the ruling National Liberal Party. 
About three weeks ago, the government replaced six other prefects, nearly all of them members of the Democratic Party, a former ruling coalition ally.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Beginning a two-day visit to Belgrade on Monday (22 August), UN envoy Kai Eide again urged Serbia-Montenegro authorities to encourage Kosovo Serbs' participation in provincial institutions.
Following a meeting with federal Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic and Serbian President Boris Tadic, Eide said Serbs must be more engaged in the processes in the province.
The visit is his last before he submits a report on the implementation of internationally set standards in Kosovo to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.
Also Monday, the Serb Ticket for Kosovo and Metohija rejected the so-called Plan B for decentralisation, recently passed by the provincial government and endorsed by UNMIK.
According to group leader Oliver Ivanovic, the document does not clearly define Serb municipalities' territories.
The Serb Ticket is preparing a Plan C, which would be presented to UNMIK and the interim cabinet in Pristina.

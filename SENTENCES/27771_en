PRISTINA, Kosovo -- US Ambassador to Kosovo Christopher Dell said on Wednesday (November 24th) that institutional officials should stay away from election campaigning and polling stations in the upcoming December 12th general elections.
According to Dell, monitoring networks have secured enough people to guarantee a regular and democratic process.
The US ambassador was speaking at a conference on foreign investments organised by the US Economic Chamber in Kosovo.

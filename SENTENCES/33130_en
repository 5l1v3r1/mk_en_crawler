BUCHAREST, Romania -- In his televised State of the Nation address Thursday (15 May), President Ion Iliescu did not eliminate the possibility of making some cabinet changes.
While the thrust of his speech was that "fresh air" must be brought to government, he remained cautious.
He said while it might be useful to make cabinet changes, it is up to the prime minister to decide.

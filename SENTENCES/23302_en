ANKARA, Turkey -- The Constitutional Court has annulled a law establishing an ombudsman's office, which was designed to hold public authorities to account, media reported on Friday (December 26th).
The court said its judges unanimously cancelled the law on Thursday.
In 2006, former President Ahmet Necdet Sezer vetoed the bill and contested its legality before the Constitutional Court.
Observers said the court's decision represents a setback in government efforts to meet EU accession requirements regarding the judiciary.

ATHENS, Greece -- A parliamentary committee on Monday (October 18th) said that five former ministers of the previous New Democracy-led government should be indicted for several land swap deals involving a monastery.
The committee investigating the scandal recommended that Theodoros Roussopoulos, Petros Doukas, Evangelos Basiakos, Alexandros Kontos, and George Voulgarakis should be charged with several offences including breach of duty, fraud, and violating the public interest.
Parliament will vote on the recommendations next month.
The investigation revealed that the deals, in which the 1,000-old Vatopedi monastery received prime state-owned real estate in exchange for much less valuable rural land, cost taxpayers about 100m euros.
The five former cabinet ministers and the monastery have denied any wrongdoing.

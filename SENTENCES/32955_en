SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Presidency Chairman Borislav Paravac said Thursday (26 June) the country's defence reforms could continue without changes to the constitution.
He said the two armies could remain in the jurisdiction of the Federation of BiH and Republika Srpska entities, and run joint activities in three areas:
defence of BiH sovereignty, intervention in cases of natural disaster, and peacekeeping missions abroad.
Paravac's term ended Thursday, and the Croat member of the presidency, Dragan Covic, began his eight-month term as chairman Friday.
Also Thursday, SFOR Commander Gen William Ward praised BiH's efforts to restructure and downsize the armed forces, suggesting the country would meet NATO membership criteria.

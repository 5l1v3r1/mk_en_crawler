BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said on Wednesday (January 21st) that this will be a pivotal year for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), and he urged the country to boost EU integration reforms. 
During a meeting with BiH Presidency chairman Nebojsa Radmanovic in Brussels, Solana said the EU will expect BiH to reach a compromise on the status of the Brcko District as well as on the issue of ownership of state property. 
Radmanovic said he hopes for resolution of the issues in the first half of the year so the country moves closer to EU candidacy status. 
Still, he admitted there is no consensus right now. 
High Representative Miroslav Lajcak also attended the talks and described them as "sobering".

STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament (EP) opened an investigation Sunday (March 20th) into allegations that a Romanian member and two colleagues in the institution were involved in bribery.
The British newspaper Sunday Times reported that Adrian Severin, a former Romanian deputy prime minister, along with Ernst Strasser of Austria and Zoran Thaler of Slovenia, accepted offers of up to 100,000 euros per year in return for proposing amendments in the EP.
The alleged wrongdoing was brought to light during an eight-month investigation by the paper, a probe that initially involved a total of 60 EP members.
Three of them are said to have responded to the offer.
Severin denies all accusations, insisting he had the right to work as a "political consultant".

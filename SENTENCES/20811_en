DIYARBAKIR, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said last week's bomb attack that killed five people and injured more than 100 amounted to betrayal of the Kurdish people by those supposedly fighting for their freedom, the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
Erdogan visited Diyarbakir on Sunday (January 6th), to meet with some of those wounded in Thursday's attack on a bus carrying soldiers.
The bomb exploded as the bus passed a school, killing four young students.
Four people arrested after the blast have since been released.
The fight against the PKK is expected to feature prominently during Turkish President Abdullah Gul's meeting with US counterpart George W. Bush on Tuesday.
Turkish officials have expressed satisfaction with the level of co-operation received from the United States following a November meeting between Erdogan and Bush.

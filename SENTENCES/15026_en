SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov will visit the United States in mid-October and hold talks with counterpart George W. 
Bush. 
It will be their first official meeting since Parvanov's election four years ago, though they have met before at different international forums.
In other news Thursday, the Bulgarian government approved the appointment of 28 new district governors. 
The Bulgarian Socialist Party has governors in 14 districts, including the capital, Sofia. 
The centrist NMS-II has eight governors and the ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) has six. 
The issue became a source of political controversy after it was decided that MRF would receive governorships in districts without large Turkish communities.

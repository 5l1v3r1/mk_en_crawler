TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament Speaker Servet Pellumbi told visiting NATO Policy Adviser Spiro Dokianos on Wednesday (11 June) that integration into NATO is the ultimate objective of ongoing army reforms. 
Stressing the progress achieved so far, Pellumbi said the reforms are being made in line with modern standards. 
"Albania will shortly be a constituent of the Atlantic alliance," Dokianos predicted.

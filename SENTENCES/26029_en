ATHENS, Greece -- Several left-wing trade unions launched a 24-hour strike Thursday (December 17th) against government-proposed changes to the pension and insurance system. 
One of the unions, PAME, urged all civil servants, teachers, doctors and port employees to join the action, which will be accompanied by rallies in Athens, Thessaloniki and other big cities. 
The action comes only days after Prime Minister George Papandreou announced a series of measures aimed at saving the country's economy by reducing its growing budget deficit and debts. 
Greece's situation prompted another rating agency to downgrade the country's credit rating Thursday. 
S&P followed Fitch in labelling Greece a risky place for investments.

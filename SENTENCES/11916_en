BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Kai Eide, UN special envoy for the review of democratic standards implementation on Kosovo, met with Nebojsa Covic, head of the Co-ordination Centre for South Serbia, in Belgrade on Wednesday (13 July).
Afterwards, Eide said he would not allow anyone to pressure him while he writes up his evaluation.
He also vowed to produce a realistic picture of his observations.
In other news, UNMIK spokesperson Remi Dourlot held a news conference Wednesday, saying UNMIK will launch the decentralisation process after it is certain the Kosovo government is ready to make concrete steps in that direction.
Dourlot added that once UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen receives the necessary guarantees from the government, the implementation of pilot projects could begin.

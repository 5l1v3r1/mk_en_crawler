PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Only 20 per cent of the houses destroyed during the violence in mid-March have been rebuilt, said Kosovo Culture and Sports Minister Behxhet Brajshori, who also heads the Damage Assessment Committee.
KosovaLive quoted him as saying Wednesday (9 June) that a total of 843 Kosovo Serb houses were destroyed during the riots and that 101 are under construction.
EU security chief Javier Solana, who visited Kosovo on Monday, seemed pleased the process of reconstruction is under way but expressed dissatisfaction with its pace.

PRISTINA, Kosovo â There is ambiguity over Behgjet Pacolli's status as president Thursday (March 31st), following a full ruling Wednesday by the Constitutional Court.
The court agreed that Pacolli's election by parliament last month violated Article 86 of the constitution because no quorum was present and Pacolli ran unopposed.
He was expected to formally step down, but is now quoted as saying, "There is no need for resignation;
I practically am leaving the office of the president and the process will restart from point zero." Prime Minister Hashim Thaci says that the government will act in full accordance with the laws and constitution.
His Democratic Party joined in a coalition with Pacolli's New Kosovo Alliance after the December general elections, agreeing to share power in the government and the presidency as part of the deal.
Experts suggest new coalitions will be formed in order to avoid extraordinary elections.

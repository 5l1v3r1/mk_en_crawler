NEW YORK, United States -- UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier on Friday (January 22nd) briefed the UN Security Council on Kosovo, urging local authorities, Kosovo Albanians and Kosovo Serbs to work together in the creation of a multi-ethnic society to protect cultural heritage and promote regional prosperity.
Zannier presented UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's latest report, stating that Kosovo has been largely peaceful and stable despite the risk of flare-ups in the north.
Zannier noted sufficient progress in the return of displaced persons, identification of missing persons, the establishment of multi-ethnic courts and police service.
Kosovo Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni spoke at the session, noting that 65 countries have recognised his country's independence.
He expressed hope that Pristina will become a member of the UN and vowed that Kosovo would continue to find ways to strengthen relations with its neighbours, including Serbia.
Serbian President Boris Tadic said that Belgrade's position on Kosovo's status is unchanged, saying:
"Serbia will never, under any circumstances, implicitly or explicitly, recognize the unilateral declaration of independence." (UN News Centre, Radio Free Europe, B92, Beta, Tanjug, RIA-Novosti - 22/01/10)

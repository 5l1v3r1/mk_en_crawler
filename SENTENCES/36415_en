BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government adopted a national action plan Friday (13 August) aimed at fighting child trafficking. 
Under the programme, the government will establish a commission to co-ordinate and monitor anti-trafficking measures. 
The team will be set up within a month and will work under the authority of the inter-ministerial commission for prevention of human trafficking. 
The national action plan envisions a period of analysis that will lead to a series of measures to be implemented at the local and central levels.

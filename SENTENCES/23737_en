ATHENS, Greece -- More than 9,000 Greek farmers on Saturday (January 24th) expanded their protests against the government's farming policy, using tractors to blockade two major border crossings with Macedonia. 
It was the sixth consecutive day of protests demanding an increase in government subsidies and pensions. 
Farmers were already blocking the borders with Bulgaria and Turkey, as well as several major roads across the country, including the Athens-Thessaloniki national highway. 
At one point, Greek farmers reportedly attempted to force their way across the border into Bulgaria and were held back by Bulgarian border police. 
On Friday, the Bulgarian government formally protested to the Greek Embassy in Sofia, saying the blockade breaches the EU principles of free travel and trade.
In other news, protesters clashed with police forces during a march in Athens on Saturday to demand the release of people arrested during last month's riots. 
About 150 anarchists broke away from the rally and started throwing fire bombs at police. 
The anarchists set on fire a newspaper kiosk and a bus station and caused minor damages to four banks. 
Police responded by firing teargas. 
Protests also took place in the southwestern town of Patras.

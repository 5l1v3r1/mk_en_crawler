TIRANA, Albania -- A series of small quakes rattled the northeast region of Dibra late on Saturday (September 12th), causing another wave of panic among residents in the wake of a stronger quake that measured 5.4 on the Richter scale.
Another tremor measured 4.3.
No injuries or damage were reported.
Experts say these aftershocks are normal following last week's strong one that damaged about 1,000 homes.

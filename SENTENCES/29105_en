SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The national mail service Bulgarian Posts imposed its highest level of security checks Friday (November 5th) after a suspicious package addressed to Israel's ambassador to Bulgaria turned up in a post office in downtown Sofia.
It ended up being regular mail and contained no explosives.
The so-called "red alert" code means that each parcel is checked both manually and by x-ray.
The alert follows a series of parcel bombs being sent to embassies and officials in neighbouring Greece and abroad.

ATHENS, Greece -- Serbian-Montenegrin President Svetozar Marovic met with his Greek counterpart Karolos Papoulias in Athens on Wednesday (21 September).
They discussed bilateral relations, as well as the issue of Kosovo and Serbia-Montenegro's Euro-Atlantic aspirations.
Papoulias said Greece supports Serbia-Montenegro on its European path and expressed hope that the problem of Kosovo can be solved within the context of the European family.
He also expressed support for Macedonia's Euro-Atlantic bid, but warned that the dispute over Macedonia's name could overshadow this.

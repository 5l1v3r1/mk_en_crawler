DURRES, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha, leader of the ruling Democratic Party, suggested on Tuesday (December 26th) that the upcoming local elections could be postponed after all, from January 20th to February 20th, in a bid to resolve ongoing disputes with the opposition.
During a visit to Durres, Berisha stressed that he was ready to negotiate with the opposition Socialist Party, which has threatened to boycott the elections if the date is not changed.
Later Tuesday, leaders of left-wing opposition parties announced they might call off the boycott.

TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament on Thursday (April 2nd) adopted a law to pay financial compensation to former political detainees and people persecuted during the former communist regime. 
Finance Minister Ridvan Bode said the government has allocated about 22.2m euros to compensate 1,440 families whom the former regime persecuted between November 1944 and October 1991. 
The main opposition Socialist Party (SP), political successor to the former Albanian Communist Party, refused to support the law.

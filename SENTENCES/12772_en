SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government will submit bail guarantees to the UN war crimes tribunal for two indictees -- Ljube Boskovski and Johan Tarculovski -- on Wednesday (8 June), according to a decision made Friday.
Former interior minister Boskovski and Tarculovski, an ex-security officer, are charged with crimes stemming from the country's 2001 interethnic conflict.
The cabinet will ask that they be returned to Macedonia to await the start of their trials in The Hague.

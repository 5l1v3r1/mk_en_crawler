PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- President Ibrahim Rugova on Saturday (28 December) reiterated calls to make the southern Serbian province independent.
He said that having the province internationally recognised as independent would strengthen democratic society, advance Kosovo's interests and contribute to peace.
UNMIK spokesman Simon Hazelock said such calls are detrimental to the future of the province, adding that Kosovo should meet democracy and security standards before seeking independence.

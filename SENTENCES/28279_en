VIENNA, Austria -- A two-day international conference on constitutional changes in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) ended in Vienna on Saturday (April 17th), Bosnian media reported on Sunday.
Participants agreed that the constitution should be amended in accordance with a recent ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, which declared the constitution discriminates against those who do not belong to one of the country's three constituent peoples -- Croats, Serbs or Bosniaks.
According to forum participants, implementing the ruling requires a minimal change to the current election system, so that the October general elections meet European standards.
Prominent Bosnian and foreign experts as well as diplomatic representatives took part in the conference.

NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said in a report to the Security Council Friday (30 January) that the parliament in Kosovo has not addressed all problems concerning minorities. 
"The parliament is once again refusing to take into account legitimate minority concerns in the legislative process and is overstepping its competencies," Radio B92 quotes the report as saying. 
The document outlines progress in many areas and warns of stalled reforms in others.

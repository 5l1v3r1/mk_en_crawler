TIRANA, Albania -- Transparency International Albania (TIA) urged the various political parties Sunday (April 12th) to publish their candidate lists for the June parliamentary elections as soon as possible.
The TIA said parties should publish the names and CVs of their candidates so voters have a clear idea for whom they will cast their vote on June 28th.
By law, parties must submit their lists by May 18th.
The TIA also urged current members of parliament who plan to seek re-election to disclose their assets for the sake of transparency.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Police arrested the leader of the main pro-Kurdish party in Turkey Monday (December 17th) on charges of using a fake disability report to avoid military service.
Nurettin Demirtas, leader of the Democratic Society Party (DTP), was detained at the Esenboga Airport in Ankara, as he returned from Germany.
He denies the charges.
The leader of the DTP group in parliament, Ahmet Turk, described the arrest as a "not very elegant political act".
"This should be viewed as a political decision.
By the way, if [Demiras'] goal was to run away, he would have never returned," Turk said.

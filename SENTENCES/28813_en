BELGRADE, Serbia -- Charges are forthcoming in the so-called Darko Saric drug case, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said in an interview with RTS on Saturday (April 10th).
Saric's group is one of the most successful organised crime groups in the region, with connections to cocaine coming in from South America.
Dacic said his idea to set up a regional centre to fight organised crime has the backing of Croatia with Montenegro and other countries in the region also showing interest.

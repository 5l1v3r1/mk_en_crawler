PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon says the mission's efforts are paying off, nine months after launching operations in Kosovo.
"The EULEX Justice Component has started to play a key role in assisting an independent and professional justice system in Kosovo," de Kermabon said in a statement Sunday (September 6th).
Statistics show EULEX personnel prosecuted 467 cases, including those involving corruption, organised crime, war crimes, terrorism, interethnic crimes, weapons and drug smuggling, and homicide cases.
Kosovo institutions have agreed that EULEX should 'inherit' all war crimes and terrorism cases from UNMIK.
Elsewhere, an official from Sweden, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said the controversial protocol on police co-operation between the EULEX and Serbia will be signed soon, despite opposition from Kosovo.
Lars Wahlund was quoted on Sunday as saying there is no willingness in Brussels to change any section of the protocol, which is a technical arrangement between Serbia and the EU regarding border issues.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The head of the International Civilian Office (ICO) in Kosovo, Pieter Feith, said on Saturday (May 31st) that Belgrade has no right to veto what is going on in the former Serbian province.
In an interview with the Pristina-based newspaper Zeri, Feith said that after June 15th, when the constitution of the young country takes effect, the only international presence in it will be the ICO, which he said "means that the Kosovo government will receive further powers".
Also Friday, Liberia reportedly recognised Kosovo's independence, becoming the 42nd country to do so.

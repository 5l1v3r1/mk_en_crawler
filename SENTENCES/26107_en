SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko announced on Thursday (March 18th) that the Office of the High Representative's (OHR) Mostar branch will close as of June 30th, based on progress there. 
The city elected a mayor in December when the Mostar City Council named Bosnian Croat Ljubo Beslic to the post. 
An earlier inability to reach an agreement kept the mayoral post vacant for more than 14 months.

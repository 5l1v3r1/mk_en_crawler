SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Leaders of the main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE announced Wednesday (10 March) they have backed off from the idea of boycotting upcoming presidential elections. 
According to local media, VMRO-DPMNE reconsidered its position after holding talks with representatives of the international community. 
The party is now expected to announce its candidate on Monday. 
VMRO-DPMNE threatened the boycott after the ruling coalition passed an amended presidential law without including VMRO-DPMNE's proposals. 
The party also disagreed with the appointment of Stevo Pendarovski as head of the State Election Commission.
Also Wednesday, Macedonia introduced a new code of police conduct, drafted in line with EU standards and with the help of experts from Proxima, the EU police mission. 
The guidelines are aimed at limiting cases of abuse.

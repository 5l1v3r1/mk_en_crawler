ANKARA, Turkey -- Health authorities are denying reports that swine flu caused the death of a patient at an Antalya hospital on Monday (May 4th). 
Initial reports suggested a link to the disease, but the hospital subsequently ruled it out as the patient had never travelled abroad. 
It did, however, recommend an autopsy to determine the exact cause of death.
Meanwhile, Turkey stepped up measures against swine flu at its border crossings with Greece and Bulgaria, media reported on Monday. 
Two medical teams were stationed at the Kapikule border crossing with Bulgaria to perform screenings.

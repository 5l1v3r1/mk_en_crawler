SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik stated on Saturday (September 26th) that RS will not accept any decision imposed by High Representative Valentin Inzko in order to prevent the collapse of the state-controlled electricity company, Elektroprenos. 
He threatened that Serb representatives will leave the joint institutions in BiH altogether if Inzko tries to push his measures through.
The High Representative had extended the mandate of the company's board, which expired last year, and ordered the board to appoint a new general director. 
The Serbs have been boycotting the company's work for over a year, while trying to form their own grid.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The smaller party in the ruling coalition, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), said on Saturday (August 8th) it will back a motion to strip Podgorica Mayor Miomir Mugosa of his immunity as a lawmaker.
Mugosa, a member of Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic's Democratic Party of Socialists, was accused of attacking two Montenegrin journalists last week.
Deputy Parliament Speaker Rifat Rastoder says his SDP will support the move if it helps clarify what happened.
State Prosecutor Ranka Carapic has said there is no evidence so far to initiate a criminal procedure against Mugosa.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Wednesday (10 December) sentenced former Bosnian Serb Colonel Dragan Obrenovic to 17 years in prison for his role in the 1995 massacre of more than 7,000 Muslims in Srebrenica. 
Obrenovic, 40, was acting commander of the Zvornik Brigade that carried out some of the killings. 
He pleaded guilty in May to committing crimes against humanity. 
In exchange, prosecutors dropped four other charges against him and recommended a sentence of 15 to 20 years.

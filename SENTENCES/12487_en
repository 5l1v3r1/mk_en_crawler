THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- UN prosecutors announced on Tuesday (5 July) that they want to put nine former Serb military and militia commanders on trial together for the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. 
A spokesman said holding a single trial for all defendants would save time, avoid duplication of evidence and minimise hardships for victims and witnesses.
In other news, the UN court announced that the trial of former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj has been scheduled for January 2007. 
The proceedings are expected to last from 12 to 18 months. 
Haradinaj is a former commander of the now disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army. 
He returned to Kosovo last month to await trial.

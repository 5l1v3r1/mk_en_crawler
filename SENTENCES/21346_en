PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu said on Thursday (June 26th) that hard-line Serb leaders in the former Serbian province are trying to destabilise Kosovo by planning to form a separate, parallel parliament Saturday.
After meeting in Pristina with UNMIK's newly appointed chief, Lamberto Zannier, Sejdiu said the parallel parliament in the north would be part of "illegal structures" that are "not acceptable".
"They aim to destabilise Kosovo," Sejdiu told a press conference.
As for plans to reconfigure UNMIK, Sejdiu said he fully supports the move and promised to co-operate in the upcoming process.
Zannier said the decision to reconfigure UNMIK has been long awaited, in light of the deployment of the new EU police and judicial mission, EULEX.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- UN tribunal prosecutors have asked the Trial Chamber to expand the indictment against Rasim Delic, the former commander of the Bosniak Army of BiH. 
The tribunalâ€™s Sarajevo spokesman, Mathias Hellman, said on Friday (28 April) that prosecutors want Delic held responsible additionally for war crimes committed against Croats in Grabovica, Uzdol and Bugojno. 
He must also bear direct responsibility -- not only command and organisational responsibility -- for crimes committed by the Mujahedin unit "El Mujaheed" in 1995. 
Delic's lawyers argue that the prosecutors have not explained why these additional cases were not addressed initially.

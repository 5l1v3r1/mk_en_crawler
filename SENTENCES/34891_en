TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Socialist Party (SP) is continuing talks with other left-wing parties on their participation in government, says SP Secretary General Gramoz Ruci. 
The talks follow Prime Minister Fatos Nano's call for a government reshuffle. 
Speaking Saturday (20 December), Ruci said negotiations with the Human Rights Union Party (HRUP) have been completed, with HRUP accepting the minister of health position and two deputy minister seats. 
He added that talks with the Social Democratic Party have produced no results so far.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Court of BiH on Tuesday (June 30th) sentenced a former member of the Serb military police to seven and a half years in prison for murdering and torturing non-Serb civilians during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
Earlier, defendant Rade Veselinovic pleaded guilty to murdering one civilian in the Sarajevo suburb of Hadzic in June 1992, the court said in a statement. 
Veselinovic was involved in the illegal detention of non-Serb civilians in Hadzic and neighbouring settlements, before they were formally arrested, then beaten and tortured, the statement added.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Parliament passed a law Thursday (October 26th) regulating the procedure for adopting a new constitution. 
It calls for a referendum to be held if a draft constitution fails to receive a two-thirds majority in the legislature. 
Should such a referendum be held, a simple majority would be required for approval. 
The law passed without the support of opposition parties. 
They had left the assembly, angry that more discussion was not allowed before the vote.

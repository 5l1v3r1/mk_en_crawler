TIRANA, Albania -- The 10th round of Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) negotiations between Albania and the EU is under way, with the new Albanian government vowing to accelerate EU integration preparations.
The cabinet stressed on Thursday (29 September) that it is aware of the economic and political criteria that must be met for the signing of the SAA and is ready to fulfil them.
Albanian officials and EU experts also focused on Albania's property laws and the readmission of illegal immigrants, as well on the need to improve border and customs control management and reform the judicial system.
Tirana hopes to sign the SAA agreement during the first quarter of 2006.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A second round of local elections is under way Sunday November 4th to determine mayors of 162 municipalities, 33 districts in Sofia, Plovdiv and Varna, and 1,243 mayoralties. 
Election Day was overshadowed, however, by the arrests of six people, suspected of buying votes. 
They face up to three years in prison. 
Those convicted of selling their votes face up to a year in prison.
In other news, Bulgarian border police stopped a Greek-registered truck Friday, and found 25 illegal Iraqi immigrants jammed in the trailer. 
Officials say it had barely any ventilation and that the Iraqis would have likely suffocated. 
They say the immigrants paid Greek traffickers 5,000 euros each to get them to Germany.

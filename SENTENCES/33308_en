SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The health ministers of Bulgaria and Croatia signed a healthcare co-operation accord in Sofia on Wednesday (7 May). 
The deal followed talks between the prime ministers. 
The goal now is to act as partners in EU accession talks, rather than competitors. 
Bulgarian Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg said the countries enjoy excellent political relations and will continue to work for regional stability. 
His Croatian counterpart, Ivica Racan, added that economic relations should be expanded, especially trade volume.

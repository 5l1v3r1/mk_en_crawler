VIENNA, Austria -- The first direct talks between Belgrade and Pristina started Tuesday (14 October) after Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic announced that Belgrade would not boycott the event.
The threat was made after Belgrade officials learned that UNMIK chief Harri Holkeri had removed the only Kosovo Serb official in Pristina's delegation.
International media reported the move may have been an effort to balance the delegation after Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi and other ethnic Albanian officials refused to attend.
"I am aware that the first step of a journey is often the most difficult one," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said in opening remarks.
"But as one moves ahead, progress becomes easier." (Reuters - 14/10/03;

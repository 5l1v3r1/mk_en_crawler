BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer has assured UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari of the Pact's support for Ahtisaari's plan to resolve the Kosovo status issue. 
Ahtisaari visited NATO Headquarters in Brussels on Friday (February 16th) for talks with de Hoop Scheffer and the North Atlantic Council. 
According to a statement issued afterwards, Ahtisaari thanked KFOR for providing logistic and other support. 
In turn, de Hoop Scheffer repeated that KFOR remains committed to the safety of all and would strongly react to any form of violence in the province.
In other news Friday, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that Washington supports democracy in both Kosovo and Serbia. 
She acknowledged, however, that negotiators on the Kosovo status issue have a very difficult job. 
On Saturday, State Department spokesman Tom Casey said that Kosovo's future status is the focus of ongoing talks between the US and Russia. 
On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov vowed that his country would back a new resolution on Kosovo at the UN Security Council, only if both Belgrade and Pristina support the proposal.

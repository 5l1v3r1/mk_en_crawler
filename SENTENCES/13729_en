BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Parliament passed a resolution on Thursday (19 January) that states a further enlargement of the EU would be impossible without the adoption of a new EU Constitution. 
Deputies argued that the treaty of Nice only provides for an alliance of 27 members -- the current 25, plus Bulgaria and Romania, which are due to join the EU in 2007 or 2008. 
The EU must return its focus to the adoption of a new charter before it considers accepting new members, the resolution said. 
It comes on the heels of renewed calls for the adoption of a slimmed down version of the draft constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005.

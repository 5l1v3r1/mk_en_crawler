SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prosecutors confirmed on Tuesday (June 5th) the arrest of a Turkish man, suspected of leading a recently smashed human trafficking ring that smuggled people from the Balkans and Turkey into Western Europe. 
The traffickers were busted a couple of weeks ago in a joint operation by police from BiH, Serbia, Macedonia, Croatia and Slovenia.
In other news Tuesday, Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights Thomas Hammarberg kicked off a week-long visit to BiH.

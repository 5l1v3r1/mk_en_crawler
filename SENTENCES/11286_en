THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Croatia has extradited former Macedonian Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski to stand trial for war crimes at the UN tribunal. 
Boskovski, 44, arrived in The Hague on Thursday (24 March) and was taken to the court's detention facility. 
He and his former bodyguard Johan Tarculovski are charged with the murder of seven ethnic Albanian civilians during a police operation in Ljuboten in August 2001. 
Boskovski was awaiting trial in Croatia on charges that he organised the 2002 murder of seven illegal immigrants in Macedonia, wrongfully labelled as members of al-Qaeda.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Police have arrested four alleged members of an organised crime group and are looking for nine others following last week's murder of a major underworld figure.
The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Interior Ministry said premises were searched in Sarajevo, Zenica and Gorazde.
According to local media, most of the gang members were ethnic Albanians with long records of racketeering and involvement in contract murders.
The operation was prompted by the June 27th shooting of Ramiz Delalic, a former Bosniak warlord active during the 1992-1995 conflict.
He was standing trial for the March 1992 murder of a man at a Serb wedding in Sarajevo, one of several events that triggered the conflict.

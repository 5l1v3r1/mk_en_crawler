WASHINGTON, United States -- Reuters reported Tuesday (5 November) that senior members of the US administration are discussing the possibility of providing some $800m in economic and military assistance to Turkey.
President George W. Bush could propose the aid package as part of a supplemental funding request or in his next budget.
In other news, Turkey's influential Army Chief of Staff Hilmi Ozkok said the military would respect the results of Sunday's elections that brought the Justice and Development Party (AKP) to power.
For its part, AKP announced Tuesday that it plans to downsize government, reducing the number of ministries.

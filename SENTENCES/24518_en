ATHENS, Greece -- Main opposition party leader George Papandreou is calling on the government to resign and hold early elections to end days of street violence triggered by the case of 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos, whom a policeman shot dead on Saturday.
The only thing the government can now do for the country is leave, Papandreou told PASOK's parliamentary caucus Tuesday (December 9th).
The two police officers charged with Grigoropoulos' death are expected to appear in court Wednesday.
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis called for national unity against the violence that he said threatens ''society and democracy itself''.
He held another round of emergency talks with political leaders Tuesday, though government spokesman Evangelos Antonaros dismissed reports that the cabinet plans to introduce emergency measures to restore order.
Meanwhile, violence marred Grigoropoulos' funeral Tuesday afternoon.
Thousands of mourners clashed with police at a cemetery in Athens, forcing police to use tear gas against groups of rock-throwing youths.
There was more violence outside parliament's headquarters.
Violence also erupted in the port city of Patras, where the police headquarters came under siege.
On Wednesday, meanwhile, the two largest trade unions proceeded with long-scheduled strikes, despite an appeal from Karamanlis to postpone them.
The protests have crippled flights and other transportation.
Thousands have gathered again outside parliament protesting pension reforms and the government's economic policies.
Scattered clashes with police are reported there.

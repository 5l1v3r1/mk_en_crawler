BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative to BiH Christian Schwarz-Schilling visited Banja Luka on Wednesday (May 2nd) for talks with top Republika Srpska (RS) officials, aimed at resuming political negotiations on constitutional reforms.
He stressed that amending the constitution is the only way to guarantee stability.
The talks also focused on Srebrenica Municipality.
Bosniak politicians are seeking its removal from RS jurisdiction, in light of a recent International Court of Justice ruling that established genocide had been committed there in July 1995.
Schwarz-Schilling said that by the end of this week he would appoint a special co-ordinator for Srebrenica to oversee how the refugee return and economic improvement programmes are being implemented.

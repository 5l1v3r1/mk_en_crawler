SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The European Parliament's (EP) rapporteur for Bulgaria, Geoffrey van Orden, said the EU Council will make a final decision on the country's EU membership date on 14 December, rather than with the release of the European Commission's next evaluation report on 26 September.
In an interview Thursday (7 September) on Bulgarian National Radio, van Orden also said that Bulgaria and Romania might be admitted to the Union with safeguard clauses next year, but stressed that there has been no decision yet.

MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Investigations against 900 individuals suspected of war crimes are currently under way at the Mostar cantonal court, the court prosecutor's office announced on Tuesday (8 June).
The UN war crimes tribunal has approved the investigations.
According to Mostar judges, the greatest problem stems from the fact that most suspects presently live abroad.
By law, even if indictments are issued, people cannot be tried in absentia.
In other news Tuesday, Turkey signed an agreement donating $2m to support ongoing reforms to the Federation of BiH Army.
The funds will be used to modernise the military.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Authorities have complained to the European Commission (EC) about an influx of Albanians from Macedonia and southern Serbia, Balkan media outlets said Sunday (February 28th). 
Large numbers of migrants have reportedly been arriving in Belgium in the hope of being granted asylum and financial aid. 
Brussels said they will be returned to their native countries in accordance with agreements on readmission that Macedonia and Serbia signed with Schengen zone member states.
Belgian Prime Minister Ives Leterme plans to visit Skopje on March 8th and to meet with Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic to discuss the problem. 
During a visit to Tetovo, Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said the government will try to improve infrastructure and living conditions in order to reduce the number of Macedonians seeking asylum. 
Gruevski urged people not to believe individuals or tourist agencies who promise political asylum in European countries.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Ahmed Dogan, leader of the ethnic Turk Movement for Rights and Freedoms, went on trial Thursday (September 2nd) at the Supreme Administrative Court charged with conflict of interest.
The proceedings were triggered by a report from parliament's anti-corruption committee that questioned Dogan's role in four energy projects.
He received 1m euros in fees as a consultant on the projects while his party was in power.
On Thursday, the court asked that he provide proof of his competence in construction, mining and hydrology, as well as of the consulting work he did on the projects.
Dogan's lawyer told journalists there is no evidence against his client, whose background is philosophy.

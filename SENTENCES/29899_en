ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu spoke by phone Sunday (March 27th) with Syrian counterpart Walid Mualem to express his country's support for the reform process there.
Davutoglu told Mualem that Ankara is closely following the situation in Syria, which has been hit by a wave of protests that has spread across the Arab world.
Davutoglu's conversation with the Syrian diplomat followed a telephone call from Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Friday.
Erdogan reassured Assad of Turkey's support for him, but at the same time warned of the image security officials are creating by using force against demonstrators.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Preliminary results released Monday (27 October) show the Bulgarian Socialist Party is ahead in Sunday's local elections, which were marked by a record low voter turnout of about 40 per cent.
Turnout in the previous local vote in 1999 was 57 per cent.
The elections highlighted the decline of the ruling Simeon II National Movement, projected to receive no more than 10 per cent of the votes.
The Movement did particularly poorly in mayoral races, and is likely to have a candidate in just one of the provincial capitals during the second round of voting next Sunday.
Candidates representing the Socialists and the right-wing Union of Democratic Forces will be vying for mayor's seats in runoffs in the major cities.

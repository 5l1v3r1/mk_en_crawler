ANKARA, Turkey -- In a new twist in the scandal surrounding Deniz Baykal, who recently resigned as leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party, a private investigation firm claimed on Thursday (May 20th) that a recently-surfaced sex video featuring Baykal was a fake. 
The revelation may help him win back the top job, at the party congress this weekend. 
Many members, however, have already rallied behind another senior party member, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, and nominated him as the new leader. 
Private investigation firms have no legal authority in Turkey and prosecutors are still looking into the video.

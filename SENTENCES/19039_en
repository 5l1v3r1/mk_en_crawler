ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Zagreb County Court's investigative judge handling the case of Branimir Glavas, a parliament member charged with war crimes, postponed the trial and effectively ordered Glavas released on Saturday (December 2nd). 
The reason was Glavas' health, which has deteriorated during a 37-day hunger strike. 
He left the prison hospital later Saturday for his hometown of Osijek. 
He is accused of crimes committed against ethnic Serbs there in 1991. 
Glavas initially was placed in custody weeks ago at the request of prosecutors, amid concerns over witness intimidation.

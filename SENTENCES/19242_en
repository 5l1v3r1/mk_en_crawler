TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha said on Sunday (March 30th) that he is enthusiastic about the evaluation Albania received from his EU counterparts who met in Slovenia at the weekend.
"For the first time in 17 years of relations between Albania and the EU, the EU has given a positive assessment of Albania in comparison with other countries in the region," Basha said.
"A possible invitation to join NATO will also have a positive effect on Albania's road towards the EU," Basha said ahead of the Alliance's summit in Bucharest later this week.
Separately Sunday, Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli expressed optimism that Albania will be invited to join NATO at the summit.
"Two years ago this was unbelievable," she said.

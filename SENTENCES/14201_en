BUCHAREST, Romania -- The senate rejected a no-confidence motion Tuesday (13 September) against Agriculture Minister Gheorghe Flutur, submitted by the opposition nationalist Greater Romania Party. 
The party demanded Flutur's dismissal, saying he is downplaying what they say is a critical situation in agriculture. 
Ruling coalition partners managed a sufficient majority against the motion.
Also Tuesday, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu met with World Bank Director for Central and Southern Europe Anand Seth in Bucharest. 
They agreed to seal a strategic partnership agreement soon that would provide Bank funding for projects related to administrative and judicial reforms, as well as implementation of some IT projects.

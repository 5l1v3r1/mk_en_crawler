SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski commented on Sunday (January 28th) that he was not concerned about the decision of the largest ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), to leave parliament.
Gruevski said that DUI has the right to decide its political moves and its choice should be respected.
At the same time, however, he rejected the conditions set by the main opposition party, the Social Democratic Alliance for Macedonia (SDSM), to resume dialogue with the government.
Gruevski stressed it was time the opposition parties understood their role and realise that executive decisions are in the hands of the ruling coalition.
The VMRO-DPMNE had not won the election to implement the programmes of other parties, Gruevski said.

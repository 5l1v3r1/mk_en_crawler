ZAGREB, Croatia -- Speaking at a seminar in Zagreb on Friday (17 March), OSCE Ambassador to Croatia Jorge Fuentes urged an increased role for national minorities in the country's decision-making process.
The event, co-organised by the Croatian government and the OSCE, attracted over 50 leading minority representatives, minority parliamentarians and international organisations.
According to Fuentes, there has already been constructive dialogue between the central government and minority parliamentarians, but communication must be improved at the local level.

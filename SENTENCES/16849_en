SKOPJE, Macedonia -- With more than 99 per cent of votes counted Thursday (6 July), officials say the opposition VMRO-DPMNE and its allies won 44 seats in the 120-member legislature during Wednesday's general elections. 
Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski has conceded defeat. 
His Social Democrat-led coalition will end up with 32 seats, followed by the ethnic Albanian coalition Democratic Union of Integration-Party for Democratic Progress with 18, and their main rival, the Democratic Party of Albanians, with 11. 
The rest of the seats went to a few smaller parties.
VMRO-DPMNE leader Nikola Gruevski, 35, confirmed his plans to head the new government. 
He said priorities would include the acceleration of Euro-Atlantic integration, economic development and fighting unemployment and poverty. 
Most observers say the elections generally were fair and democratic.

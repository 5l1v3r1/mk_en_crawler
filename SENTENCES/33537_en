SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government has requested that the EU transform its military mission, Concordia, into a mission with civilian and consultative functions, says Cristina Gallach, spokeswoman for EU security chief Javier Solana.
Concordia's mandate expires on 15 December.
The government has previously said it would be able to handle security issues itself but would need EU help to strengthen local multiethnic police forces.
Gallach said Monday (22 September) that the EU Council of Foreign Ministers would likely decide on the request by the end of September.
In other news, Macedonia announced Monday the establishment of the operational centre for its upcoming voluntary weapons collection programme.
The six-week campaign opens on 1 November.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen has signed a law which provides for conducting the first head census in Kosovo since 1991, according to media reports Tuesday (21 December). 
The law, passed by parliament last year, envisions beginning the census in early 2005. 
The count should supply data on demographics and the housing situation in Kosovo.
Also Tuesday, Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj said he would welcome political contacts with Belgrade to help resolve the issue of the province's final status.

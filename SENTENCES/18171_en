SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Starting the process of police reform all over again would set BiH back several years, says Ljiljana Radetic, spokeswoman for the Office of High Representative. 
She responded on Thursday (April 12th) to a session of the Republika Srpska (RS) Parliament dedicated to the issue of police reform. 
Lawmakers demanded the start of new talks aimed at amending a 2005 political agreement on police restructuring in the entities. 
Subsequent opposition by RS has postponed reform by two years, in turn delaying the EU integration process.

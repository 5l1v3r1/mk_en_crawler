ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan reaffirmed Turkey's policy to boost economic co-operation with Iran at a press conference Thursday (September 20th) before flying to New York for the 62nd session of the UN General Assembly.
"Iran and Russia are the most important resources in terms of Turkey's need for natural gas," Erdogan said.
Given the country's pressing need for natural gas, it is out of the question to completely cut relations with Iran in the sector, he added.
Prior to the press conference, US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns urged Turkey and other countries to sever their business ties with the Islamic republic to help prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.
Last month, Turkey signed a deal to boost energy co-operation with Iran and to invest $3.5 billion in its South Pars gas field.

TIRANA, Albania -- Prosecutors have ordered the arrest of Deputy Transport Minister Nikolin Jaka and eight others suspected of rigging tenders for the construction of a major highway over the past two months. 
The officials include Bashkim Kamberi, general director of roads in the Ministry of Transport, several junior officials and three businessmen.
Prosecutors also want to question Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha, who previously served as minister of transport. 
He denies any wrongdoing and refuses to co-operate with investigators. 
Prime Minister Sali Berisha told parliament on Tuesday (September 18th) that the corruption allegations are groundless. 
The road in question links Kukes to Durres.

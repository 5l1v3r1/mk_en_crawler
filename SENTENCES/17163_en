BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Bosnian Serb government will not agree to a complete merger of the Muslim-Croat and Serb police forces, Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said in an interview published on Tuesday (October 31st). 
The EU has repeatedly stressed that police reform is a condition for signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with BiH, which has until November 20th to report on progress in this area. 
"If we will have to choose between the European Union and the police of Republika Srpska, we will choose the police of Republika Srpska," Dodik said. 
Bosnian Serbs have indicated they would agree only to a partial unification that would leave their interior ministry intact.

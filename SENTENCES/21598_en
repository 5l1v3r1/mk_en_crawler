NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The European Commission (EC) has proposed 7.6m euros in aid to help Cyprus cover damage caused by a severe drought over the past two years, local media reported on Sunday (October 26th). 
The funds, allocated from the EU Solidarity Fund, will mainly help reimburse costs of emergency measures, such as transporting water from Greece. 
This is the first time the EC is using the Solidarity Fund to provide financial aid for emergency measures in response to an exceptional drought, EU Regional Policy Commissioner Danuta Huebner said. 
Damage and related expenses amounted to about 1.25% of the gross national income.

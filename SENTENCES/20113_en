THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Prosecutors with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague have requested that former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj be sentenced to 25 years in prison for crimes against humanity. 
According to the prosecutors' final brief, released on Tuesday (January 15th), strong evidence of guilt has been presented. 
The former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) commander is accused of allowing and encouraging guerrillas under his command to commit rape, murder and torture in 1998. 
He is standing trial with two co-defendants -- Idriz Balaj and Lahi Brahimaj. 
Haradinaj resigned as prime minister in 2005 and surrendered to the tribunal.
In other news, the trial of Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj continued on Tuesday with testimony by the prosecution's second witness. 
Seselj is accused of inciting violence and recruiting militia members who committed war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. 
UN prosecutors suffered a setback when their first witness conceded that while the defendant's wartime writings and speeches incited violence, they did not contain "hate rhetoric".
Also Tuesday, a group supporting former Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic announced that it had sent a petition to the UN tribunal requesting her early release from a Swedish prison where she is serving an 11-year sentence for war crimes. 
Her supporters cite her age and poor health. 
Plavsic is 77.

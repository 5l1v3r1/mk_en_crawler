ANKARA, Turkey -- President Ahmet Necdet Sezer warned on Sunday (October 1st) that Turkey faces a continuing threat from fundamentalists.
In his last address to parliament before stepping down in May 2007, the president indirectly accused the government of adopting measures that undermined the secular state and created tensions.
Sezer also spoke in favour of retaining a powerful military as a guardian of secularism, in an apparent message to the EU.
Brussels has been pressing Ankara to restrict the army's role in politics.
Also Sunday, a bomb exploded in front of a hospital, injuring three people in the southern town of Mersin.
No group has far claimed responsibility.

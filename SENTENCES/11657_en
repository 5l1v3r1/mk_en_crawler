BERLIN, Germany -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told visiting Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis on Monday (21 March) that the EU's accession talks with Turkey would start on 3 October as scheduled. 
The chancellor expressed confidence that Ankara would be able to fulfil all EU requirements by that date. 
Karamanlis reiterated his government's position that Turkey must first sign a customs protocol that extends a previous agreement with the EU to the Union's ten new member-states, including Cyprus. 
Schroeder told reporters he was confident that Ankara would make good on this commitment as well. 
His comments follow those of other German politicians who suggested a perceived stalemate in Turkish reforms might delay the launch of EU negotiations.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Activists launched a campaign called "One Minute of Darkness for Continual Light" on Sunday (May 1st) based on the model of a similar action that reached its peak in 1997.
Back then, the initiative unfolded to reach about 30 million participants.
It was sparked after a local parliamentarian, a police academy chief, a beauty queen, and a murder suspect wanted by Interpol were all found in the same car following a traffic accident in the town of Susurluk, raising questions about connections between the state and the mafia.
The current campaign, which will see participants turn off their lights for one minute at a certain time of the day to protest a different issue every day, will last until the June 12th general elections.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Defence Minister Selmo Cikotic says his country has reasons to be positive ahead of NATO's April summit in Bucharest. 
Cikotic told the Federal News Agency of BiH (FENA) and radio Deutsche Welle on Sunday (March 2nd) that BiH would present itself as a serious candidate for full-fledged NATO membership and that NATO is expected to recognise the country's progress in defence reforms by launching an Intensive Dialogue Programme, the next stage in co-operation with NATO.

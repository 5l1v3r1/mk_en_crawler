PODGORICA, Montenegro, Yugoslavia -- The ruling Montenegrin coalition, consisting of the Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), agreed to dismiss chief prosecutor Bozidar Vukcevic over a scandal involving human trafficking. 
The coalition will likely ask for the dismissal immediately after court proceedings are finalised. 
Several other parties and NGOs have called for Vukcevic to step down after his deputy, Zoran Piperovic, was arrested over suspicion of protecting a prostitution network.

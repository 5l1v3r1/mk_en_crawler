SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The EU envoy in Macedonia, Erwan Fouere, has urged better dialogue among local political parties to create a climate of mutual trust, eliminate tensions surrounding the formation of the new government and guarantee continuation along the road to Euro-Atlantic integration. 
In an interview Sunday (30 July) on A1 TV, Fouere stressed the importance of strengthening dialogue between VMRO-DPMNE, which won the 5 July parliamentary elections, and the Democratic Union for Integration, which got the majority of ethnic Albanian votes.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government has stepped up extraordinary anti-flood measures in several areas of the country, including the Sava River near the towns of Jasenovac and Slavonski Samac, and the Una River near the town of Hrvatska Kostajnica.
Urgent measures were also adopted in parts of Dalmatia.
In other news, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader issued a statement Tuesday saying authorities expect a positive report on Croatia's EU membership application from the European Commission.
Sources cited by HINA say the report will be issued early next week.
Sanader voiced optimism, despite comments by UK Europe Minister Dennis MacShane concerning the fugitive status of retired Croatian General Ante Gotovina.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish Army General Staff Secretary General Sabri Demirezen said Friday (27 February) that Turkey is the country in the region that most effectively protects its borders. 
Demirezen also said that border forces are fighting illegal immigration with increasing effectiveness. 
He was responding to critiques by some European countries about inefficiencies in Turkey's fight against illegal immigration and human trafficking.
Also on Friday, European Parliament President Pat Cox stated that finding a solution to the Cyprus issue would introduce a positive climate of change in Turkey's EU membership bid. 
Cox will convey this message during his visit to Turkey that begins Monday.

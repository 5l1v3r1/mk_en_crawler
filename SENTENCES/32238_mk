BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- The Yugoslav Army flatly denied media reports that its personnel have helped Iraq beef up its defence in anticipation of US air attacks. 
On Sunday (6 October), the BBC reported that Yugoslav radar and weapons systems experts were assisting Iraqi Army personnel in developing an improved anti-aircraft system. 
The report quoted a source who suggested that Iraqi officials could learn from Serbia's experience in 1999. 
But spokesman Dragan Velickovic says the army has no official arrangement with Iraq to provide such assistance.
In other news, Serbian presidential nominee Miroljub Labus was reproached Saturday by a key supporter, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. 
At issue, a controversial statement Labus made, suggesting that early elections are unavoidable and that Parliament should return the mandates of members of rival Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia. 
"The presidential candidates should confine themselves to issues covered by the presidential mandate," said Djindjic.

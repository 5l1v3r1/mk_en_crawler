BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic is urging foreign investors to come to Serbia. 
In a speech to an international conference, he described economic development as the key to political stability, not only in Serbia, but also the entire region. 
Noting that Greece is one of his country's main trading partners, he pledged to support all investments by Greek firms in Serbia. 
Following talks with Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis in Athens on Wednesday (9 February), Tadic told reporters that he and Karamanlis agreed that co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal and Kosovo's future status were the two main problems in the region.

TIRANA, Albania -- About 45 Roma families are refusing to be displaced just outside Tirana in tents provided by the government, media reported on Sunday (March 27th). 
The Roma are asking the government to find them shelter inside the capital in order to be able to survive by collecting scrap metal. 
The families have been living in the streets since arsonists torched their barracks were near the Tirana train station in February. 
The issue prompted EU embassies in Tirana to react against the discrimination facing this community. 
Deputy Labour and Social Welfare Minister Filoreta Kodra said the camp is an emergency solution for the displaced Roma.

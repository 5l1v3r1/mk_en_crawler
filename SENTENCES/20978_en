BELGRADE, Serbia -- Carla del Ponte, outgoing chief prosecutor of the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, reiterated on Tuesday (December 4th) that evidence suggests fugitive indictee Ratko Mladic is hiding in Serbia. 
She also said that during her final visit to Serbia on Monday, no official she spoke with contradicted her on that point and that Belgrade officials are trying to convince Mladic to surrender. 
Del Ponte added that she would insist the EU not sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Serbia as long as Mladic is at large. 
"What's important is that Mladic ends up in The Hague ... 
before the SAA's signing. 
Because if we lose that lever, it will never happen." (Danas, Blic - 05/12/07; Tanjug, B92, RTS, FoNet, AFP - 04/12/07)

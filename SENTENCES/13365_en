ANKARA, Turkey -- The National Security Council adopted a new policy document on Tuesday (25 October). 
It introduces certain changes in the wording of issues related to the country's security policy priorities and determines more precisely the powers of the Turkish military in tackling domestic security problems. 
It cited religious fundamentalism, separatism and extreme left-wing activity as the main security threats facing Turkey. 
The government must next approve the document.

TIRANA, Albania -- Thousands of people gathered for a rally in Tirana Wednesday (12 July) evening, organised by five opposition parties protesting allegedly undemocratic behaviour by the Democratic Party-led government of Sali Berisha.
Addressing the crowd, Edi Rama, leader of the main opposition Socialist Party, again accused Berisha of trying to manipulate and control the work of independent institutions.
He warned that unless the cabinet shows more respect for democratic rights, the opposition would seek early parliamentary elections.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic has called for the dismissal of Serbia's top security officials over the continued failure to capture war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic.
In an interview in Saturday's (6 May) edition of Blic, Draskovic blamed the heads of security bodies and relevant ministers, including Serbian Interior Minister Dragan Jocic and the chief of the Security Information Agency, Rade Bulatovic.
"Mladic must be arrested, and not any time, but in the next ten days.
After that, it will be too late," Draskovic said.
He described Belgrade's international position as "more than grave" after the EU broke off talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia-Montenegro last week -- a sentiment echoed by several officials, including Serbian President Boris Tadic, State Administration and Local Government Minister Zoran Loncar and Serbia-Montenegro Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic.
Meanwhile, another series of police raids in Belgrade netted a handful of arrests, according to media reports Friday.
The five are suspected of helping Mladic escape justice.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic said on Sunday (March 14th) that Serbia would not object to the extradition of former Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) presidency member Ejup Ganic to Sarajevo, stressing the most important thing is for Ganic to stand trial. 
During a ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of the Serbian Renewal Movement, Tadic said all those suspected of war crimes must face justice. 
Ganic was arrested on March 1st at London's Heathrow Airport on a warrant issued by Belgrade. 
He was later released on bail, pending an extradition hearing. 
Serbia wants to prosecute Ganic in connection with a May 1992 attack in Sarajevo against a Yugoslav National Army convoy, which left more than 40 soldiers dead. 
BiH has also demanded his extradition.

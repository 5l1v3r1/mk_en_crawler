PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Kosovo will declare its independence "within the next days", regardless of who wins the second round of presidential elections in Serbia on Sunday, Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said on Wednesday (January 30th) after meeting police representatives in the province.
"What is happening in Serbia has no influence on Kosovo," Thaci added.
Asked by the BBC whether he will request that Serbia recognise Kosovo's independence, Thaci said that Pristina is ready to recognise Serbia's independence and it would be natural to expect the same from Belgrade.
Meanwhile, a Kosovo official who wished to remain anonymous told Reuters that the breakaway province's independence declaration will be tied to Sunday's Serbian presidential run-off.
"If Tomislav Nikolic wins, this will happen either on the 9th or 10th of February," the source said.
If Tadic, the other contender in the vote, is elected, Kosovo will declare its independence around February 18th, after a scheduled EU foreign ministers' meeting.

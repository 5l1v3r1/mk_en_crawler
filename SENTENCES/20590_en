MOSTAR, Bosnian and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country needs a single coherent state and that is where constitutional reform talks should begin, US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney said in Mostar on Thursday (August 9th), during a meeting with leaders of the main Croat parties in BiH. 
His comment was in response to recent initiatives by the Croat parties to adopt a single position regarding constitutional amendments and amid rising support for the creation of a third entity, a Croat one, in BiH.
McElhaney noted that while the United States has a federal structure, none of the states is allowed to act solely in its own interest.

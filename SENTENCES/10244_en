SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown announced Friday (26 November) that he has annulled the BiH law on pardons, saying it created judicial imbalances and would have enabled well-connected criminals to escape justice. 
He noted that, by adopting the law, the BiH government and parliament had effectively bypassed his decision earlier this year to remove immunity from corrupt politicians.

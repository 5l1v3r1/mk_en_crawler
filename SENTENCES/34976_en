SOFIA, Bulgaria -- US Undersecretary for Defence Douglas J. Feith led a delegation to Romania and Bulgaria this week, to discuss the possible relocation of US military bases to Eastern Europe.
During a news conference in Sofia on Wednesday (10 December), he said Washington would consider all factors, including the countries' support for the US operation in Iraq and their position on exempting Americans from prosecution by the International Criminal Court (ICC).
Both Bulgaria and Romania opened their air space to US operations but Bulgaria failed to sign the ICC agreement.
In other news, a delegation from Albania was in Sofia on Wednesday, for political consultations at the foreign ministry.
The talks covered issues of bilateral co-operation, including opportunities to exchange high-level visits in 2004.

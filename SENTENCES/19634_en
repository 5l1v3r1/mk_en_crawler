PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The international troika in the Kosovo status negotiations was given a "green light" by international politicians to present a new proposal on the future status of the breakaway province, the Pristina-based daily Koha Ditore reported on Sunday (October 28th). 
Western diplomats stated that due to disagreements within the Contact Group, the leaders have agreed to leave the status issue up to the three members of the troika team who represent the EU, United States and Russia -- Wolfgang Ischinger, Frank Wisner, and Alexander Botsan- Kharchenko, respectively. 
According to the newspaper, the troika will propose a solution based on the principle of confederation.

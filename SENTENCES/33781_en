ATHENS, Greece -- Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos says he is ready to resume talks on the Cyprus issue whenever UN Secretary General Kofi Annan considers it appropriate.
Papadopoulos' comment came as he arrived in Greece on Tuesday (25 November) to meet with his Greek counterpart, Costis Stephanopoulos.
Besides the Cyprus problem, the presidents discussed the co-ordination of Greek and Cypriot steps in view of Cyprus' accession to the EU on 1 May 2004.
Papadopoulos also signed the Olympic Truce document, which stipulates the suspension of all military conflicts during the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics.

NEW YORK, United States -- Secretary of State Colin Powell said Washington is deeply concerned about the case of the five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor sentenced to death for allegedly spreading the HIV virus to children in Libya. 
Powell discussed the matter with Libyan counterpart Abdelraham Shalgham on Friday (24 September) on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. 
On Sunday, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy said that his counterparts from EU member states pledged the issue would be taken into consideration in future talks on lifting the weapons embargo against Libya.

ANKARA, Turkey -- President Abdullah Gul approved legislation late Tuesday (November 20th) regarding the establishment and operation of nuclear power plants in Turkey and the sale of energy. 
The law allows the ministry of energy and natural resources to announce tenders for the construction of nuclear power plants and grants it authority to determine the plants' capacity and location. 
The nuclear power law also allows the government to grant purchase guarantees to companies looking to operate nuclear plants.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A Turkish panel investigating an Israeli-led raid on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla that left nine Turkish citizens dead last May presented the final version of its report on the case to the UN on Friday (February 11th). 
The document was drafted after testimony was taken from over 100 passengers on the ship, and after consultations with local and international experts.
According to Mithat Rende, the chairman of the panel, the report has many similarities to a document drafted by a UN panel investigating the incident. 
In it, experts rejected Israeli statements that passengers were armed. 
Instead, they used tools available to defend themselves amid fears they would be killed. 
The experts concluded Israel could have rendered the ship ineffective using peaceful means.

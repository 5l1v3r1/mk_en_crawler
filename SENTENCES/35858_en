WASHINGTON, United States -- According to media reports Saturday (24 January), the Senate has approved a draft bill that stipulates, for the first time, that aid to Serbia should be extended if former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic is apprehended.
After approval by Congress, the bill moves to President George W. Bush, who will sign it into law.

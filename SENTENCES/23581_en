VIENNA, Austria -- Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni announced on Wednesday (January 28th) that more countries are expected to recognise Kosovo's independence soon. 
During meetings with senior diplomats in Vienna, Hyseni received assurances that Pakistan, Ecuador, Ethiopia and Barbados are seriously considering recognition. 
Hyseni is asking representatives of these countries to lobby for Kosovo's recognition in their regions.
In other news Wednesday, the foreign ministry announced that it has received assurances from most UN members that they will side with Kosovo in the case Serbia filed against it before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). 
"Many of them have replied positively to Kosovo's request to submit written answers in favour of Kosovo's independence at the ICJ," Deputy Foreign Minister Vlora Citaku said.

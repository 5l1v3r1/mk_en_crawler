BELGRADE, Serbia -- Authorities launched a probe Friday (May 22nd) into allegations of abuse and brutal beatings of drug addicts at the Crna Reka rehabilitation centre near Novi Pazar, which is run by the Serbian Orthodox Church.
A video broadcast on the weekly Vreme web site showed a patient's beating, prompting the investigation.
Meanwhile, Serbian Ombudsman Sasa Jankovic filed charges against nine people working at the facility who were identified based on the video.
The health ministry announced it will send a team to investigate treatment methods used there.

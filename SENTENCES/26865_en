VIENNA, Austria -- High Representative Valentin Inzko said on Friday (December 4th) that the latest offer regarding a new constitution for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is the last one. 
"The final proposal of a new constitution is on the table currently and I hope that it will be accepted," Inzko told the Vienna-based daily Kurir. 
Last month, EU and US representatives met with leaders of the main parties in BiH and proposed a series of constitutional reforms aimed at accelerating the country's EU and NATO integration.

STRASBOURG, France -- The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) gave the go-ahead Monday (4 October) for members of the Turkish Cypriot Parliament to participate in PACE meetings. 
The decision means that Turkish Cypriot lawmakers will not need to obtain permission from Greek Cypriot authorities, and will participate as "representatives of the Turkish Cypriot Community". 
PACE President Peter Schieder stressed the move does not mean recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- As many as 30 Kurds, including former lawmakers and prominent activists, were arrested in Belgium Thursday (March 4th) as part of a police operation against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terrorist group.
The international Kurdish-language television network Roj TV reportedly went off the air after a raid on its studios in the northern city of Denderleeuw.
Around 300 police officers carried out the operation in cities across Belgium, including Brussels, Charleroi and Antwerp, media reports said.
The sting is part of an EU-wide crackdown on PKK activities, and comes one day after France announced it has filed terrorism charges against nine Kurds arrested last week for allegedly recruiting PKK members.
Italy mounted a similar action in late February.
Those detained in Belgium reportedly include Remzi Kartal and Zubeyir Aydar, regarded as central to PKK efforts in Europe.
Both are former deputies in the Turkish parliament.
Aydar is also on a US list of foreign drug traffickers and is thought to be raising funds for the PKK through narcotics smuggling.
The group has been waging a violent campaign for Kurdish independence since 1984, claiming some 45,000 lives in the process.
In comments Thursday, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said the operation sent a "clear message to those who provide resources to acts of terror".
"We really appreciate the responsible and determined stance of the Belgian authorities.
We hope that terrorists would not be able to find suitable platforms for their acts in Europe," the minister said.

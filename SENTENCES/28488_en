BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU issued a statement Wednesday (April 14th) criticising recent anti-gay demonstrations in Albania, sparked by a reality show contestant's announcement of his sexual orientation. 
Klodian Cela, a participant in Top Channel's "Big Brother" show, announced on TV that he is gay and asked for understanding. 
But demonstrators in his hometown, Lezhe, staged events insisting the town had no homosexuals and calling for his removal from the show.
In its statement, the EU said respecting human rights is a precondition for joining the EU and that the bloc opposes any discrimination based on sexual orientation.

TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Socialist Party (SP) formally launched its campaign for October's local elections by presenting its nominees for municipal posts at the weekend. 
The nominations followed the SP's failed efforts to seal strategic alliances with its traditional partners despite several rounds of talks. 
Meanwhile, tensions within the party leadership are deepening. 
Former Foreign Minister Ilir Meta has asked grassroots members to help him oust Prime Minister Fatos Nano, who is SP chairman.

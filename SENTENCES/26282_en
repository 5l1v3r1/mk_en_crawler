ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said on Sunday (October 11th) that constitutional changes should be made by the end of the year and urged the opposition to participate in a constructive dialogue.
Kosor planned to meet with opposition leaders on Monday to discuss the amendments, which she says are crucial to Croatia's EU integration process.
Earlier this month, the government approved a proposal for constitutional changes and forwarded it to parliament.
Opposition parties reject efforts to fast-track debate there, insisting that any changes to the constitution require much more detailed discussions.
They also insist the focus now should be on the economic crisis and reducing public spending.

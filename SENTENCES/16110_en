SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- International community High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling said on Thursday (18 May) that the stalemate over Mostar is unacceptable.
He said "Mostar's unification process is being held hostage by political parties and individual politicians more interested in advancing their campaign ambitions than the interests of the city." Schwarz-Schilling scheduled an emergency meeting of the mayor and members of the city council, among others, next week in Sarajevo.

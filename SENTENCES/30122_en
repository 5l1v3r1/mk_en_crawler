TIRANA, Albania -- The United States is urging Albanians to participate in the May 8th local elections, and encouraging political parties to engage in a political race.
Ambassador Alexander Arvizu said on Wednesday (February 23rd) that his country has allocated about 260,000 euros for a coalition of civil society organisations to monitor the process.
He told representatives of the organisations, "your work will be very important in helping to ensure that these elections are successful and that they represent the will of the Albanian people."
In other news Wednesday, President Bamir Topi said that the country urgently needs to overcome the political crisis and return to its EU accession course.
In a letter to the heads of political parties, he asked them to find a long-term solution and show willingness to co-operate for the sake of Albania's future.

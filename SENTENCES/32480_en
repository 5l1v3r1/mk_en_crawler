Erdogan assumed responsibility after President Ahmet Necdet Sezer endorsed the new cabinet presented to him Friday.
Erdogan noted that the number of members had been reduced by merging some ministries.
He added that the government's programme would be presented to parliament Tuesday or Wednesday, followed by a confidence vote late in the week.

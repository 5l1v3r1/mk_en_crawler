STRASBOURG, France -- Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica called for a diplomatic solution to Kosovo's final status, in a speech Tuesday (October 2nd) to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). 
He warned that a unilateral declaration of independence by Pristina could ignite a chain reaction of separatism elsewhere. 
The prime minister cited Romania, Slovakia and Spain as some of the countries that could face pressure from minorities.
Meanwhile, leaked sections of a report drafted by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon suggest he is concerned that the "apparently peaceful" situation in Kosovo is illusory -- calm on the surface, but with the potential for violence, "mostly because Kosovo Albanians are dissatisfied that the status process has been stalled".

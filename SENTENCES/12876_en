SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Council of Ministers held a session Tuesday (1 February), following an almost two-month break due to resignations and the refusal of the two ministers from the Serb Party of Democratic Progress to attend cabinet meetings. 
After repeated calls and warnings from the Office of the High Representative and BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic, all government members attended the session, ensuring the needed quorum for passage of three key bills under the EU Feasibility Study for BiH.

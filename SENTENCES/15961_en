TIRANA, Albania -- Justice Minister Aldo Bumci of the ruling Democratic Party called on President Alfred Moisiu to approve the dismissal of Chief Prosecutor Theodhori Sollaku, who is accused by the ruling coalition of links to organised crime. 
Moisiu has not yet acted on a report, prepared by an ad hoc inquiry commission and endorsed by parliament late last month, which recommends Sollaku's ouster. 
Later Tuesday, Moisiu's office issued a statement saying more time is needed to examine all the related documentation. 
Sollaku and the opposition insist the entire effort is politically motivated.

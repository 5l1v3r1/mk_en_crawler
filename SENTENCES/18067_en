PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The government's commission for implementing the strategy against corruption and organised crime held its constituent session on Friday (March 16th), adopting a plan for co-ordination with over 30 relevant institutions.
It is expected to present regular reports to the government and Parliament twice a year, beginning in June.
Also Friday, Parliament's panel for European integration said that the formation of a Montenegro-EU committee would be one of the first tasks, following the initialling of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Union.
The accord was sealed during Thursday's visit by EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn.

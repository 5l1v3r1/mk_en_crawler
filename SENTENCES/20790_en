SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The solution to issues in the Western Balkans is the European and Euro-Atlantic perspective of countries there, Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov said on Friday (October 5th), as he opened the 10th International Conference of the Balkan Political Club in Sofia.
Parvanov stressed the importance of the international community's engagement in regulating conflicts, through the UN and the OSCE and in close partnership with the EU.

TIRANA, Albania -- The police trade union demanded on Friday (August 14th) the resignation of Interior Minister Bujar Nishani citing suspicions that dangerous criminal Dritan Dajti, who killed four police officers, was tipped off about police raid aimed at his arrest last week.
Valentin Macaj, head of the local trade union, said someone should take responsibility for the death of the police officers, and Nishani is the obvious choice, as it appears some police officers are co-operating with crime groups.

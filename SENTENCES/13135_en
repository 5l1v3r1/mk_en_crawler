SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Early mayoral elections took place Saturday (29 October) in 11 Bulgarian cities and municipalities, but in only two of them were the results conclusive.
While the mayors of Sevlievo and Panagyurishte were elected in the first-round voting, runoffs will have to be held in all the other races -- including in Sofia, where former Interior Ministry chief secretary Boyko Borrisov, running as an independent, faces Bulgarian Socialist Party candidate Tatyana Doncheva.
All polling agencies recorded a very low turnout in Saturday's vote.

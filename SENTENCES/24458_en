ZAGREB, Croatia -- Foreign Minister Gordan Jandrokovic announced on Wednesday (June 10th) that representatives of Croatia, Slovenia and the EU will meet again next week to discuss the longstanding border dispute between the two countries.
He insists that Slovenia's blockage of Croatia's EU accession talks is unfair and should end immediately.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has proposed establishing an international panel to arbitrate a solution, something Zagreb accepts but Ljubljana has reservations about.
The maritime border dispute has slowed Croatia's EU membership bid.

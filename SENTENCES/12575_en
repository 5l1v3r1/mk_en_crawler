NEW YORK, United States -- Chief UN war crimes tribunal prosecutor Carla del Ponte says the lack of full co-operation by the former Yugoslav republics -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro -- is preventing the court from completing its work on schedule. 
In separate reports submitted to the UN Security Council on Tuesday (7 June), del Ponte said the main problem stems from these three states' failure to arrest and extradite high profile indictees. 
Del Ponte warned that this is a key obstacle to the tribunal finalising all cases by the 2008 deadline.

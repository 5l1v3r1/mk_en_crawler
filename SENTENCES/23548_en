PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK spokesman Alexander Ivanko said on Tuesday (March 24th) that the mission will reduce its presence in Kosovo by 90% by the end of June but that UNMIK will maintain some presence as long as UN Resolution 1244 is in place.
Kosovo leaders have asked UNMIK to terminate the mission.
During Monday's UN Security Council session on Kosovo, Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni said the time had come for more energetic support from EULEX.
"We invited them to be here, and they are here to support us in the areas of rule of law and police, and they also support us in the EU integration processes," Hyseni said.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci stressed that "the reality shows that UNMIK's role is outdated, UN Security Council Resolution 1244 is outdated, and Kosovo has its own legitimate state institutions".

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Joost Lagendijk, European Parliament member and rapporteur on Kosovo, said on Thursday (March 12th) that Brussels opposed Kosovo's ethnic partition and that the EU would do everything in its power to prevent it.
"This is the main reason why the EU continuously insisted that EULEX is deployed all over the territory of Kosovo," Koha Ditore quoted Lagendijk as saying Friday.
"Serbia will protest ...
but this will not lead to a partition of Kosovo, because Serbia knows that it would create a lot of problems for itself and" its European orientation, he added.

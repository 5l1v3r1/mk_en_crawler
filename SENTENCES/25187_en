PODGORICA, Montenegro -- More than 150 inmates at a prison in Spuz, outside Podgorica, launched a hunger strike late Wednesday (January 27th), claiming guards are abusing them. 
This is the second such protest in ten days. 
The previous strike was triggered by a decision to tighten security after a prisoner died of a drug overdose.

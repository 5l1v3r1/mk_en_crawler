PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Nobody can sign international agreements on behalf of Kosovo institutions, President Fatmir Sejdiu's office stressed on Monday (August 17th), in response to news that an agreement will be signed between EULEX and Serbia.
EULEX has said it can sign a protocol on police co-operation with Serbia, based on the mission's executive powers.
"It is part of our mandate, even though the core of our mandate is to monitor and advise the Kosovo institutions in the fields of justice, police and customs," EULEX spokesman Christophe Lamfalussy said.

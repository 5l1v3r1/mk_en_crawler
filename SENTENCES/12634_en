BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EU security chief Javier Solana has criticised the Republika Srpska (RS) government for the deadlock over crucial police reform.
In an interview in Tuesday's (7 June) edition of the Banja Luka daily Nezavisne novine, Solana said the RS government failed to persuade members of the Bosnian Serb parliament to choose the road to the EU over the path to isolation.
Police reform is a prerequisite to signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
In other news, High Representative Paddy Ashdown is expected to decide Tuesday on the new chief of the State Investigation and Protection Agency.
BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic asked Ashdown to intervene after the government failed repeatedly to agree on a nominee.
On Monday, Terzic attended ceremonies marking the 5th anniversary of the establishment of the State Border Service.
He predicted the service's success would eventually result in the lifting of the EU visa regime for BiH.

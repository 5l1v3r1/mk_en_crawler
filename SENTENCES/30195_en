PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi asked EULEX prosecutors on Monday (March 21st) to withdraw an arrest warrant against lawmaker Fatmir Limaj, arguing it violates the constitution and immunity laws that protect legislators from detention.
Limaj and 11 others are facing fresh accusations over 1999 war crimes committed in the village Klecke against civilians and Serb military officers.
EULEX confirmed on Monday that the issue of Limaj's immunity is being clarified.
Limaj himself says he will give up his immunity.

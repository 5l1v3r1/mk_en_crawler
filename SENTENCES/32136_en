NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council voted Friday (11 October) to extend for the last time its observer mission in the disputed Prevlaka peninsula until 15 December. 
The 15 members of the Council also voted unanimously for a resolution calling on Croatia and Yugoslavia "to accelerate efforts towards a negotiated settlement", and indicated it would pull the 27 observers out even earlier if the two countries reached a negotiated settlement before mid-December. 
The members were acting on a recommendation from Secretary General Kofi Annan. 
The current mission has been operating since 1996.

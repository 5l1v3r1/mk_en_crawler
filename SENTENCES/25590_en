ANKARA, Turkey -- On Tuesday (March 23rd), Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan asked opposition parties in parliament to add measures of their own to his government's 26-article constitutional reform package.
The amendments envision limiting the rights of judges, and changes in the way judges and public prosecutors are chosen.
It also seeks more rigorous procedures required to ban political parties.
Speaking at a ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) parliamentary group meeting, Erdogan said Turkey must not lose more time by delaying the amendments, which aim to pave the way for eventual EU accession and a higher standard of democracy.
Opposition parties are expected to provide contributions to the package by the end of the week, he added.
But Deniz Baykal, leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party, says the reforms only serve the ruling party's interests.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski says there are no immediate plans for a government reshuffle, but doesn't rule one out in the future. 
In an interview with MIA news agency published on Monday (January 17th), he said "Such an option could be considered only to speed up the government's reforms and expand the scope of our activities." Commenting on the opposition SDSM's call for early elections, Gruevski said his party would win again if snap elections are held. 
He stresses however that a vote is unnecessary. 
"We focus on projects and reforms, which were promised to citizens. 
We're willing and determined to fulfil these promises," he added.

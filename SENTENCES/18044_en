ANKARA, Turkey -- The US embassy in Ankara criticised on Monday (July 16th) a new deal on natural gas, sealed by Turkey and Iran at the weekend.
"We believe that considering an increased reliance on Iran as a source and transit country for natural gas is particularly unwise," Ankara media quoted embassy spokesperson Kathryn Schalow as saying.
The UN Security Council has imposed a partial trade embargo on Iran over its nuclear programme.

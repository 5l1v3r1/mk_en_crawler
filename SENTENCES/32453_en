ATHENS, Greece -- A war in Iraq could trigger a major international crisis and it should be executed only with the consent of the UN, said Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who spoke after an emergency government meeting on Tuesday (18 March).
Simitis voiced his government's support for the UN as the institution playing a leading role in developments related to Iraq.
While insisting Greece will not participate in a US-led war, he said the country will honour any obligations arising from existing treaties and does not intend to block the use of US military bases on its territory.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Reporter Domagoj Margetic, who has been in custody since Friday (4 August) at the request of the UN war crimes tribunal, has gone on a hunger strike, his lawyers announced on Monday.
Margetic was apprehended after he refused to accept a Hague tribunal injunction delivered to him via the Croatian judiciary.
The injunction came after Margetic listed the names of protected witnesses on his personal website.

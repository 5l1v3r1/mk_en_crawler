BELGRADE, Serbia -- Hunger-striking opposition leader Tomislav Nikolic agreed on Tuesday (April 19th) to an infusion but said he is not giving up his protest.
The head of the Serbian Progressive Party stopped food and liquids Saturday in order to push for early elections.
On the second day of his hunger strike, he was admitted to hospital, where his kidneys have deteriorated.
Meanwhile, demonstrations in support of Nikolic were held in several towns across the country amid demands for snap elections.

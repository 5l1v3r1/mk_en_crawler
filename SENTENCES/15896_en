BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian Education Minister Mihail Hardau is coming under pressure to resign following a scandal concerning leaked test copies. 
On Saturday (17 June), a journalist from the Adevarul newspaper, Florin Pupaza, pretending to be a teacher from a regional inspectorate, obtained from the education ministry a confidential set of copies for 22 June national history test. 
The National Liberals and the Democratic Union of Hungarians are urging the Democratic Party to replace the minister, who has so far declined to step down.

WASHINGTON, United States -- President George W. Bush is to meet with Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase on Wednesday (21 July), White House spokesman Scott McClellan said in a statement Monday.
The two leaders will discuss "the war on terrorism, Afghanistan and Iraq, NATO's agenda following the Istanbul summit, and international efforts to support reform in the broader Middle East," McClellan said.
Various initiatives at the UN will also be discussed, in light of Romania's presidency of the UN Security Council.
In other news, Romania and the United States signed an agreement Monday on collaboration in countering the proliferation of nuclear materials and technologies.
It is described as an excellent opportunity for the countries to work together to reduce the threat of terrorism through the removal of proliferation-attractive material.

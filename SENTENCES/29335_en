ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian Democratic Party of Slavonia and Baranja (HDSSB) criticised the Supreme Court's decision to uphold Branimir Glavas' conviction for war crimes against Serbian civilians during the 1991-1995 war. 
The presidency of the party held a meeting in Drinovci, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on Monday (August 2nd) to discuss the ruling. 
HDSSB founder Glavas saw his sentence cut from ten to eight years in prison under the Supreme Court's decision last week. 
In May 2009, he was sentenced to ten years in prison for war crimes against ethnic Serbs in the city of Osijek in 1991. 
His party argues that Glavas has been prosecuted because of his party affiliation. 
Before founding the HDSSB, he was a member of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A third round of elections in Prizren and Lipjan/Lipljane municipalities will be held on January 31st, the Central Election Commission (CEC) announced on Monday (December 28th). 
Serious manipulations were revealed in December 13th's second round, in the mayoral run-offs. 
However, the CEC has not set a date for a recount and investigation of votes in the municipality of Gjilan/Gnjilane, since it may engage international experts in that process. 
These municipal elections, the first round held last month, were the first Kosovo organised since declaring independence from Serbia in February 2008.

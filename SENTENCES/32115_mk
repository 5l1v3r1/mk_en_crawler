BUCHAREST, Romania -- EU Commissioner for Regional Policy Michel Barnier and EU Integration Minister Hildegard Puwak met Friday (11 October) with Romanian officials to discuss pre-admission funds that the EU will extend. 
Proposals to modify the structure of institutions involved in outlining regional development programmes were analysed, with an eye towards efficiency. 
"The way in which you will organise Romania's administrative division is up to you. 
It is important for us to move past local vanities and seek the best solutions for an efficient use of the structural funds,'' Puwak said.

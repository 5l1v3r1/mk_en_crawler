BUCHAREST, Romania -- The European Commission (EC) on Wednesday (September 17th) again warned Romania against changing procedures for nominating the chief prosecutor from those established by mutual agreement at the time of the country's EU accession.
The senate passed a measure last week, shifting nominating power from the president to the Supreme Council of Magistrates.
The ruling Democratic Liberal Party says it will challenge that decision before the Constitutional Court.

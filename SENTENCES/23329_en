PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The parliamentary committee on internal affairs and security asked the government Tuesday (May 26th) to sack police head Sheremet Ahmeti, following a theft in the police evidence room.
A total of 47kg of heroin and about 3,800 euros disappeared from police headquarters in Pristina late last month.
Committee Chairman Rrustem Mustafa urged the government and the interior ministry to ensure that the law on police is being implemented.

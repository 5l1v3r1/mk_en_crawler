ZAGREB, Croatia -- Following lengthy debate, parliament approved late Monday (July 6th) the new cabinet that will be led by Jadranka Kosor, of the senior ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party.
The composition is very similar to that of Ivo Sanader, who unexpectedly resigned as prime minister on July 1st.
A key difference is the addition of a new ministry of administration headed by Davorin Mlakar.
There will also be a new minister without portfolio, Bianca Matkovic.
Radovan Fuchs will serve as the new minister of education, science and sports, replacing Dragan Primorac, the HDZ official who resigned with Sanader.
HDZ lawmaker Tomislav Ilic will serve as minister of family, war veterans and intergenerational solidarity.

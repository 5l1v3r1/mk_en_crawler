ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Tens of thousands of people lined streets in Istanbul on Tuesday (January 23rd) to pay their respects to slain journalist Hrant Dink, as the hearse carrying his body drove from the offices of the Turkish Armenian newspaper Agos to the Armenian church where his funeral was held. 
His murder Friday shocked the country. 
Police are questioning seven men in connection with it, including Ogun Samast, 17, the alleged triggerman. 
He reportedly has confessed to killing Dink because of his statements regarding the massacres of Armenians during World War I. 
Dink's grieving family urged those attending the funeral not to turn it into a political event.
In other news, the Turkish army has renewed a major operation against Kurdish rebels in the province of Tunceli. 
Military helicopters are bringing in reinforcements to some 3,000 soldiers already on the ground. 
The operation, launched last week, had to be suspended briefly due to heavy snow.

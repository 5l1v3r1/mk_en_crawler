BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said at a news conference Sunday (19 September) that the next parliamentary elections in the republic should take place as soon as a new constitution is adopted. 
He added that Sunday's local elections represented a step forward in the process of building institutions and a democratic political system. 
That process, he said, would be completed when "Serbia gets a new main law and parliamentary elections are held".
In other news Sunday, Serbia-Montenegro's Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic said that the downsizing of the federal union's army staff is under way. 
He explained that at Podgorica's request, the number of military troops on the Montenegrin side would be downsized from 6,000 to 3,000.
Also Sunday, specialised units of the Serbia-Montenegro Army's Podgorica corps and Montenegrin police wrapped up a mine-clearing operation along the Montenegrin-Albanian border. 
Since August, they have cleared 81km for farming.

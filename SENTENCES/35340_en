BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian police knew of a plan to assassinate late Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic well before his death on 12 March 2003, according to Milan Veruovic, the head of the prime minister's security detail.
Testifying in court Tuesday (20 April), Veruovic, who was wounded in the shooting, indirectly accused former senior police officials of failing to properly boost measures to protect Djindjic, even after an earlier attempt on his life.
Prosecutors have charged Zvezdan Jovanovic, deputy commander of a special operations unit at the time, with the actual shooting.
Meanwhile, a court in Belgrade resumed the case against eight men accused of murdering Serbian warlord Zeljko "Arkan" Raznatovic in 2000.
Citing insufficient evidence, the Serbian Supreme Court overturned guilty verdicts returned in the first trial.
In other news, the new Serbian government has drafted an anti-corruption law which would require government workers to declare all assets, both before they are appointed and at the end of their terms.
This measure would also apply to lawmakers.

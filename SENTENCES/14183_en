THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte said on Wednesday (14 September) that Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic should be arrested by 5 October, the date Slobodan Milosevic fell from power in 2000.
She urged the Serbia-Montenegro government to live up to its promise to track down the indictee.
Del Ponte also asked the EU to delay the start of talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Belgrade until Mladic is handed over to the UN tribunal.
British Ambassador to Belgrade David Gowan, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, echoed that sentiment in separate commentsWednesday.

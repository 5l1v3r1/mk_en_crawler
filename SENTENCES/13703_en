TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament agreed on Thursday (20 October) to form a 15-member committee that will re-examine the application of electoral laws during the general elections in July.
The committee is to submit its report in three months.
The two largest Albanian parties, the Democratic Party and the Socialist Party, requested formation of a committee amid claims of irregularities and election fraud.
Also Thursday, US Ambassador to Tirana Marcie B. Ries praised democratic strides Albania has made in the past year, during a lecture she delivered in Thessaloniki, Greece.
She described the July elections as a turning point in the history of the country because they were most legitimate held so far in the post-communist period.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) and NATO have expressed their strong disapproval of a new proposal to change the Federation of BiH (FBiH) defence reform laws. 
OHR spokesman Mario Brkic told a news conference Tuesday (14 February) that if adopted, the draft amendments submitted by the BOSS party would actually reinstate the FBiH Defence Ministry, which was closed as part of defence reforms aimed at consolidating the sector and establishing a single, NATO-compatible military structure in BiH.
In other news Tuesday, BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic arrived in Zagreb for a two-day informal visit. 
The focus will be on border and free trade issues.

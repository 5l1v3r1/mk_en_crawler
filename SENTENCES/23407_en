ANKARA, Turkey -- Warplanes launched raids on suspected terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) positions in northern Iraq late on Wednesday (April 29th), the General Staff said in a statement on its web site. 
The operation continued through Thursday and affected PKK positions in Zap and Avasin-Basyan. 
The action began hours after two separate attacks killed ten Turkish soldiers Wednesday in southeast Turkey. 
Nine soldiers died in the morning in a roadside bombing near the town of Lice. 
Later, another soldier was killed in a shootout between Kurdish militants and a unit returning from operations in the southeast.
Meanwhile, a would-be suicide bomber detonated a small explosive at Ankara's Bilkent University during a visit by former Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk. 
The woman approached the minister as he prepared to participate in a colloquium in the law faculty of the private university. 
The explosion wounded the bomber but not Turk. 
He served as justice minister under Bulent Ecevit from 1999 to 2002.

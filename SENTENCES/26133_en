WASHINGTON, United States -- The State Department criticised Turkey on Tuesday (October 13th) for its decision to postpone a NATO military exercise due to Israel's participation. 
The routine drills, dubbed Anatolian Eagle, were supposed to start on Monday. 
Held every few years, they are aimed at boosting international co-operation. 
According to media reports, Ankara's decision was prompted by Israel's intention to send aircraft that may have been used in operations against Gaza last December. 
US State Department spokesperson PJ Crowley said Tuesday that it seems inappropriate "for any nation to be removed from an exercise like this at the last minute".
Meanwhile, Syrian Defence Minister Ali Habib Mahmud announced on Tuesday that his country is planning a joint military exercise with neighbouring Turkey. 
"We held our first joint land military exercise [with Turkey] last spring. 
And today we have agreed to do a more comprehensive, a bigger one," he told a press conference.

NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Wednesday (June 17th) that the security situation in Kosovo is relatively peaceful, though certain parts of the Serb-dominated north still operate separately and refuse to acknowledge Kosovo institutions.
In his quarterly report submitted to the UN Security Council, Ban said Kosovo has repeatedly requested the termination of UNMIK, now that EULEX is deployed.
Still, he insists UNMIK should remain in place, to help mediate the situation in the north.
He also reprimanded Kosovo for having blocked Serbian officials from visiting the area.
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic drew attention to the low level of return by Kosovo Serbs, and said the main reason is they are unable to recover illegally-seized property.
Jeremic said about 200,000 Kosovo Serbs are eligible to return to Kosovo, but only 500 have returned to their homes in the past year.
Kosovo Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni says this is because Belgrade is encouraging Kosovo Serbs to remain in Serbia.
In other news, NATO Commander of Allied Joint Force Command Naples, Admiral Mark Fitzgerald, visited Pristina on Wednesday and said ethnic violence is not the problem it used to be.
"The security situation continues to improve with few incidents that require a military response," Fitzgerald said.
"Security challenges facing Kosovo now are of criminal and economic nature," he added.
NATO plans to reduce the number of KFOR troops in Kosovo from 13,800 to 10,000 people by January.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Parliament voted unanimously Monday (14 July) to approve the divided island's accession to the EU.
While other countries approved accession in national plebiscites, the constitution of Cyprus contains no provision for such a referendum.
Cyprus will join the Union in May, along with the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia.
The EU accepted the whole of Cyprus as a member in April, with the provision that EU laws and membership benefits will not be extended to the Turkish-controlled north until after reunification.
In other news, Greek Cypriot government spokesman Kipros Chrisostomidis criticised a letter Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas sent to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.
Speaking Sunday at a reception in London, Chrisostomidis described it as a manoeuvre aimed at distracting the international community from the essence of the problems between the two communities on the island.
Denktas proposed that Turkish Cypriots were ready to give, under UN control, the closed area of Varosha to Greek Cypriots in exchange for reopening Nicosia International Airport for use by both communities.

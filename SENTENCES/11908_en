SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown criticised a bill Tuesday (15 February) boosting benefits for members of the BiH Parliament.
Debate on the measure is expected Wednesday.
He was particularly critical of a plan to boost average monthly pensions -- currently 100 euros -- to nearly 1,300 euros.
Also Tuesday, BiH Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic confirmed that war crimes indictees Ratko Mladic and Vinko Pandurevic received salaries from the Republika Srpska (RS) Army as late as 2002.
He added that six RS Army members face criminal charges related to protection of alleged war criminals, because of these payments.

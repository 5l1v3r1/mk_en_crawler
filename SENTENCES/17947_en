TIRANA, Albania -- The Interior Ministry announced on Sunday (December 17th) that police had seized five land-to-land missiles in an abandoned house in the northern Shkodra region the previous day. 
Authorities acted on the basis of a tip, but made no arrests. 
The Ministry said police are investigating what is believed to be a weapons smuggling scheme. 
According to local media reports, the missiles may have come from neighbouring Montenegro.
Also Sunday, the Interior Ministry announced that Albanian and Greek firefighters are working to control a fire in Shengjin, northwest Albania. 
Earlier in the day, a huge oil tank exploded, triggering blazes in two others and forcing an evacuation.

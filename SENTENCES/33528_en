BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia coalition on Tuesday (23 September) nominated Dragoljub Micunovic as its candidate for president of the republic. 
The 73-year-old philosophy professor is a veteran anti-Milosevic figure. 
He is now chairman of the Serbia-Montenegro Parliament. 
The two main opposition parties, Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia and Miroljub Labus's G17, have vowed to boycott the elections. 
They insist the vote would fail because the constitutional requirement for a 50 per cent voter turnout has not been removed.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Reform of the BiH defence system is an obligation of the state's institutions, said NATO Commander in Chief of Allied Forces Southern Europe Adm Gregory Johnson during a visit to Sarajevo on Tuesday (13 May).
Johnson and SFOR Commander Lt Gen William Ward met with Stjepan Pocrnja, chairman of BiH's Standing Committee for Military Matters, to discuss military reforms.
Johnson confirmed that NATO was prepared to assist BiH in resolving open issues and meeting the criteria for joining the Partnership for Peace programme.
Also on Tuesday, Johnson met with Macedonian Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski in Skopje.
The meeting focused in part on the activities of NATO's advisory team in Macedonia, and on implementation of army and defence sector reforms.
Johnson noted significant improvement in the security situation in the past two years.
In other news, villagers from Selce and Vejce in the Tetovo region decided to lift a blockade and allow relatives of Macedonian security force personnel killed in 2001 to hold a ceremony.
Villagers blocked the road Saturday.

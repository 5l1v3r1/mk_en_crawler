DURRES, Albania -- The process of destroying around 1,300 tonnes of unwanted ammunition at a military base in Durres wrapped up on Wednesday (August 20th) after two months of work. 
Defence Minister Gazmend Oketa helped oversee the process. 
On March 15th, a massive explosion of munitions in Gerdec killed 24 people, injured more than 300 and destroyed many houses. 
Since then, NATO has been conducting a special training programme for the Albanian military regarding demolition of old munitions and equipment inherited from the communist regime.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The first session of the new parliament will take place on January 8th or 9th, Croatian President Stipe Mesic said on Tuesday (December 25th), when the constitutional 20-day term for the formation of the new parliament began.
The constituent session will be convened by the president.
The new parliament, which is the sixth in the country's history, will have 153 members.
Mesic gave the mandate to form the government to the leader of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), Ivo Sanader, earlier this month.
On Monday,Sanader and Bosniak minority representative Semso Tankovic signed a coalition agreement, further strengthening HDZ's support in parliament.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- US Ambassador to Nicosia Frank Urbancic says his country will not force the two Cypriot communities to reunify the long-divided island.
He reiterated on Tuesday (October 28th) that the Cypriot people must find a solution suitable for themselves.
Washington closely follows and supports the ongoing reunification talks, Urbancic said, but urged an acceleration of the process.
Also Tuesday, Cypriot President Demetris Christofias called on Turkey to withdraw its troops from the island as soon as possible.
Ankara must allow for a solution in the best interests of both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, Christofias said.
Around 35,000 Turkish troops are stationed in the northern, Turkish part of Cyprus.

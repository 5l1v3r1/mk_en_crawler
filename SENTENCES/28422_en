ANKARA, Turkey -- Russian President Dmitry Medvedev capped an official visit to Ankara on Wednesday (May 12th) with aides signing an agreement to build the first nuclear power plant in Turkey.
The $20 billion deal involves the construction of a plant with four units, with planned capacity of 4,800MW.
It will be located in Mersin, southern Turkey.
The government has been working hard to diversify the country's power sources, and move away from heavy dependency on natural gas imports from Russia.
Despite strong domestic opposition, another nuclear plant will likely be built in Sinop, northern Turkey, with help from South Korea.
During Medvedev's visit, Turkey and Russia also agreed to allow visa-free travel for each other's citizens.

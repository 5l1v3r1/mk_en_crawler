BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Federal Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic, who also is chairman of the national council for co-operation with The Hague tribunal, said Monday (19 December) that prosecutors are demanding three items allegedly missing from Ratko Mladic's military file.
They include a postal receipt from June 2002, signed by Mladic, which prosecutors maintain would prove the Yugoslav Army was aware of his whereabouts at the time.
Ljajic says the army insists the three items were not part of the file and therefore, could not be provided from the archives.

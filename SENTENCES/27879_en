BELGRADE, Serbia -- A court in Belgrade convicted two men Monday (November 22nd) of war crimes committed in the Bosnian municipality of Zvornik in 1992. 
Branko Grujic got six years in prison and co-defendant Branko Popovic was sentenced to 15. 
The two former local officials were found guilty of illegal detention, inhumane treatment and the killing of about 700 Muslims. 
Prosecutors vowed to appeal, calling the sentences too lenient.

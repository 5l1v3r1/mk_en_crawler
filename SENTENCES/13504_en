PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Montenegrin police announced on Sunday (26 March) that they have detained a man in connection with the 2004 murder of Dusko Jovanovi, editor of the Dan newspaper.
The suspect, Armin Osmanagic, was detained as he tried to enter Montenegro from a border crossing between Serbia-Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Jovanovic, shot dead on 27 May 2004, had received several death threats over the opposition newspaper's reports on official involvement in corruption and crime.

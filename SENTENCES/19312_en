ATHENS, Greece -- The global environmental conservation organisation World Wildlife Fund (WWF) warned on Thursday (September 27th) that it would take at least two decades for forests to grow back in areas of Greece ravaged by recent fires.
WWF Greece President Dimitris Karavellas said the group has estimated that the summer's fires destroyed 173,000 hectares of rural land in the Peloponnese peninsula alone, more than half of it forests and protected nature reserves.
The group also said several rare animal species, including turtles, lizards and the golden jackal, had been affected.
Karavellas stressed that the WWF will closely monitor land rehabilitation projects and "will intervene legally if developers try to take advantage of the disaster, as they have done before".

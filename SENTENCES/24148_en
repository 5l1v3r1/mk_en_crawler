ANKARA, Turkey -- The government said Monday (June 15th) it will demand an investigation into an alleged military plot to discredit the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).
At a press conference, Deputy Prime Minister Cemil Cicek said the government will file a criminal complaint over a report published in the liberal daily Taraf last Friday, claiming that military circles prepared a plan "to break popular support" for the AKP and one of its influential supporters, Muslim preacher Fethullah Gulen.
The newspaper also published what is believed to be a document aimed at preventing the ruling party and Gulen's movement from "destroying Turkey's secular order and replacing it by an Islamist state".
"We have concluded that no units of the General Staff have prepared such a plan," the army said in a statement posted on its web site.
The AKP called the army investigation "unsatisfactory".

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament's legislation committee on Tuesday (November 9th) unanimously supported the government's proposal to hold a referendum on Croatia's EU membership after signing the accession treaty.
The current declaration on the fundamental principles of the country's accession negotiations envisions holding the popular vote prior to signing the document.
Depending on the results of the referendum, parliament would ratify the treaty.
Croatia aims to complete EU negotiations and sign its accession treaty by the middle of next year.

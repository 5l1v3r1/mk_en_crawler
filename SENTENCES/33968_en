WASHINGTON, United States -- Turkish Ambassador to Washington Osman Faruk Logoglu told reporters on Tuesday (4 November) that his country is awaiting an invitation from Iraq's Governing Council before sending troops to Iraq. 
"We want to be welcome and we want to be sure we can be helpful," he said. 
A US State Department spokesman said negotiations are under way with "other parties" to find a solution to the problem. 
He reiterated Washington's position that Turkey can play a constructive role in stabilising Iraq.
In other news, security has been tightened around Turkish representations in the Netherlands. 
Ankara requested the move Tuesday after an attack with a homemade bomb on Turkey's embassy in The Hague.
Also Tuesday, Bulgarian and Turkish armed forces launched a joint exercise focusing on patrols, roadblock operations and small arms firing. 
The location was not announced.

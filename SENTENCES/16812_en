SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The deputy head of the European Commission (EC) Delegation in BiH, Renzo Daviddi, says the EC supports a recent proposal by BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic to form two new ministries at the state level. 
According to Sunday's (7 May) edition of Dnevni avaz, Daviddi says the EC already has approved funding for the establishment of the new ministries, which are expected to deal with agriculture and science and technology, respectively. 
He says implementation could occur quickly, if there is political support in BiH and if parliament adopts draft constitutional changes soon.

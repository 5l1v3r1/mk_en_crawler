BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The search for war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic will soon be intensified, according to Serbian-Montenegro Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic, who also serves as president of the federal council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague.
Speaking Wednesday (27 April), Ljajic said authorities plan to add more resources to the effort to track down Mladic, one of the tribunal's three most-wanted indictees.
In other news, Serbia-Montenegro Army Officer Cedomir Brankovic remains in custody in Bulgaria, where he was detained Wednesday on an international arrest warrant.
Croatia had sentenced him in absentia to 20 years in prison for war crimes.
He travelled to Bulgaria earlier this week as part of an army delegation.

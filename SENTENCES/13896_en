BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Belgrade regional court's special unit for organised crime on Saturday (17 September) ordered that two senior judges be detained for one month. 
The pair were arrested last week: Serbian Supreme Court Judge Ljubomir Vuckovic is suspected of accepting a bribe, and Deputy Special Prosecutor for Organised Crime Milan Radovanovic is accused of violating official secrecy. 
Officials say charges have been filed against seven other people.

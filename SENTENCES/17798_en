SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Acting Speaker of the BiH Parliament's House of Representatives (HoR), Ekrem Ajvanovic, said on Tuesday (December 19th) that the HoR's constituent session could resume on January 7th. 
He said this is the earliest possible date, given the upcoming religious and New Year holidays and the fact that the main parties are still talking about forming a ruling majority. 
The lower house's founding session on November 20th was suspended after the parties failed to agree on a parliamentary majority and a nominee for HoR speaker.
Also Tuesday, High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling reiterated that it was unacceptable that the state-level government has not yet been formed. 
General elections were held on October 1st.

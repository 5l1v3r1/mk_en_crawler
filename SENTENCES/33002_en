SALZBURG, Austria -- Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic and Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski agreed Saturday (24 May) to organise a meeting of heads of state from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro. 
At the summit, set to take place in Ohrid on 2 June, the leaders will adopt a joint declaration on their desire for EU integration. 
The declaration will then be presented at the EU summit, scheduled to take place on 21 June in Greece.
Meanwhile, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Cedomir Jovanovic called for quick EU accession reforms Saturday. 
Speaking at the opening of a two-day conference of the EU and Serbia-Montenegro in Belgrade, Jovanovic predicted that Serbia-Montenegro could join the Union in 2007. 
He said the federal government would present an action plan next month for economic and legislative reforms, and expected a green light for starting accession negations with Brussels. 
EU officials, however, said the enlargement process depended on the speed of reforms in the region.
Miroljub Labus, president of the EU-oriented party G17 Plus, said he estimates the federation would not join the EU before 2015, at the current slow pace of reforms. 
He pointed to problems related to the Constitutional Charter and the status of economic relations between Serbia and Montenegro as continuing obstacles.

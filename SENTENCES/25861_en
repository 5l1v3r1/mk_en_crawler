BELGRADE, Serbia -- A Belgrade public prosecutor on Tuesday (February 16th) filed charges against six fans of the Partizan football team suspected of making death threats against Serbian journalist Brankica Stankovic.
At a match between Partizan and Shakhtar Donetsk in December, fans chanted threats against Stankovic after she published a series of reports on the criminal activities of Serbian football fan clubs and their leaders.

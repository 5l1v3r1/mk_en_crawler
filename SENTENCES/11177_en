ATHENS, Greece -- The government and some NGOs agreed late last week to establish an independent task force that would propose measures against red tape and bureaucracy. 
Interior Minister Prokopis Pavlopoulos says the panel will include experts in public administration and economics.
In other news, a bomb exploded outside the offices of the far right Popular Orthodox Rally (LAOS) party on Sunday (26 December), but caused no damage or casualties. 
Police say the device consisted of two small gas canisters used by campers. 
Left-wing groups or anarchists are suspected in the attack.

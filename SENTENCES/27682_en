PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The teenage son of the main opposition Movement for Change (PzP) leader Nebojsa Medojevic was slightly injured on Friday (June 25th) after he was physically attacked by three youths on a basketball court. 
Podgorica police arrested the suspected assailants immediately. 
On Sunday, Medojevic said he suspects the attack on his 16-year old may have been politically motivated, although police disagree. 
The PzP leader himself was attacked in February by a man who warned him to stop offending his family. 
The assailant warned the politician "to stop mentioning the name of Branislav Micunovic", a wealthy businessman that the PzP leader has described as "the most powerful person" in Montenegro.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The head of the EU delegation to Croatia, Paul Vandoren, confirmed o Sunday (November14th) that former Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader has sent a letter to European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso, complaining that he is a victim of politically-motivated prosecution.
In an interview with the Croatian Radio, Vandoren stressed that the letter is not a priority for Barroso and would be discussed in the coming days.
Sanader returned to parliament as a lawmaker in October saying "unbelievable and undemocratic developments" had prompted him to do so.
He was expelled from his ruling party Croatian Democratic Union when he first suggested that he might attempt a comeback in January.
Local media reported recently that he is under investigation for corruption.

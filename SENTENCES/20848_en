TIRANA, Albania -- Government spokeswoman Majlinda Bregu said at a press conference on Friday (August 3rd) that the cabinet is determined to open 100 files related to crimes that occurred in the chaos of March 1997, following the collapse of pyramid investor-schemes. 
Despite ten years of silence, Bregu said "it is never late to do justice". 
Looting and riots, particularly in the southern port city of Vlora, claimed 2,000 lives and forced the government to resign.
At the same press conference, Bregu said that Prime Minister Sali Berisha is determined to maintain the current coalition government and has no plans to broaden it, despite growing demands by right-wing parties.

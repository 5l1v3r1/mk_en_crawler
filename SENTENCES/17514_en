MOSCOW, Russian Federation -- US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Sunday (May 20th) that there is no consensus yet on the future status of Kosovo.
In a statement for the Russian TV station NTV, however, she stressed that former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari's plan for supervised independence protects the interests of all in the province.
The new draft resolution on Kosovo, submitted by the US and EU nations at the UN Security Council, envisions the possibility of an independent Kosovo but does not guarantee it, she said.
In related news, Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku reiterated that the Albanian majority would not make any unilateral moves.
"Our position will depend on the recommendations coming from the Americans, the Europeans and the UN secretary-general.
We will not declare independence without their consent," Ceku told the French magazine Journal du Dimanche.

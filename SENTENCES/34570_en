SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Belgrade and Sarajevo on Wednesday (1 October) resumed their regular air link, halted in 1999. 
BiH Transport and Communications Minister Branko Dokic said the reopening of service would strengthen bilateral relations. 
Flights were suspended at the start of the 1992-1995 war, but resumed in 1997 only to be stopped again during the NATO campaign against Yugoslavia. 
Serbian carrier JAT will fly between the two capitals five times a week.
In other news, the Bosnian Serb Parliament adopted a declaration on Wednesday, urging the central government in Sarajevo to withdraw a genocide suit it filed with the International Court of Justice against Serbia-Montenegro. 
BiH sued Yugoslavia in The Hague-based court in 1993, accusing it of aggression and genocide.
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the international community's representative in Sarajevo, Paddy Ashdown, told reporters that auditors have established that BiH's three telecoms were losing 50m euros a year as a result of mismanagement. 
The audit came on the heels of scandals involving corruption in the electricity companies of the two entities.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Parliament began a three-day session Monday (11 April) devoted to Bulgaria and Romania's planned entry in the EU in 2007.
On Wednesday, an endorsement of the two countries' accession treaties is expected.
That in turn would lead to treaty signings with Sofia and Bucharest on 25 April.
On Friday, meanwhile, the European Commission reported enormous interest in accession-related job openings.
An estimated 14,000 Bulgarians and Romanians submitted online applications for contract jobs last month.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) said on Saturday (April 2nd) that it sees no reason to restructure Greece's debt at the moment.
"All support measures are in place, and there is no reason now to start thinking of this possibility of restructuring Greece's debt," spokesperson Jens Mester said.
Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou also ruled out any such development.
The German magazine Der Spiegel reported on Saturday that IMF officials have urged Athens to restructure the debt.
The report did not identify its sources.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK and the Kosovo police announced at a news conference Tuesday (16 August) that the crime rate in the UN-administered province is falling and inroads have been made in fighting organised crime.
UNMIK says 51 people were arrested in the last two months as a result of criminal investigations.
A case involving 4m euros of misappropriation was resolved, and police action led to drug confiscations and the destruction of a marijuana farm.

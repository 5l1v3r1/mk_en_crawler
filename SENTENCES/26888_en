BELGRADE, Serbia -- The opposition Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) will take concrete steps to force early elections, leader Tomislav Nikolic said on Tuesday (January 5th).
He noted that one possibility would be to launch a nationwide petition to collect signatures for the move.
Nikolic added that his party will seek the early vote in order to receive the representation in parliament it truly deserves.
Another opposition party -- New Serbia -- says it expects early elections as well.
Deputy party president Dubravka Filipovski said Serbia needs changes and responsible rule that will fight corruption.

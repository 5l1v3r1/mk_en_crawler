SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Marinov brothers, popularly known as "the Margins", were acquitted on Monday (June 14th) by the Sofia city court of ordering the murders of three people.
The brothers, Krassimir and Nikolai, were arrested in 2005.
The judges agreed that an organised crime group was linked to the murders, but did not accept that the Margins were its leaders.
Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov criticised the ruling, saying the judiciary needs reforms.
Nikolay Kokinov, head of the Sofia prosecution office, vowed to appeal the verdict and predicted the brothers would be convicted in the end.

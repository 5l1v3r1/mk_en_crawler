WASHINGTON, United States -- Secretary of State Colin Powell met on Wednesday (15 October) with Bulgarian National Assembly Chairman Ognyan Gerdzhikov and Foreign Minister Solomon Passy. 
Afterwards, Powell said Bulgaria would be interested in hosting US military bases if both countries decided it was in their mutual interest. 
That decision, he said, would be made in discussions between the Pentagon and the Bulgarian military.

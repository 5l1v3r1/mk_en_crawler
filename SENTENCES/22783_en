BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) announced on Tuesday (May 6th) it is sending an official notification to Bulgaria requesting more information about collecting taxes on dividends paid by and to foreign companies operating in the country. 
These taxes may be higher than their equivalent imposed on Bulgarian companies. 
A similar step has been taken against Romania. 
The EC said that higher dividend taxes for foreign companies might constitute an infringement of the free movement of capital.
The commission has also sent Bulgaria an official warning regarding its failure to issue new or updated permits for several industrial installations. 
According to the EC, Bulgaria was bound to issue new or updated permits for industrial installations by its EU accession on January 1st 2007, in line with the directive on integrated pollution prevention and control.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Government officials are done debating any future EULEX-Serbia protocol on police co-operation, as of Thursday (August 27th).
Local institutions have objected to the agreement EULEX said it would sign with Serbian police, arguing that Pristina should be part of it too.
President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci have met with EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon and International Civilian Office (ICO) head Pieter Feith to express their opposition to the protocol.
Vetevendosje (Self Determination) leader Albin Kurti said that halting discussions is not enough and urged Kosovo to instead terminate all co-operation with EULEX.
Serbia's Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic added fuel to the fire Thursday, saying the protocol will confirm that the EU has not recognised Kosovo's independence.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Two Bosniak formations -- the Party of Democratic Action (SDA) and the Party for BiH (SBiH) -- along with the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) of BiH -- reached an agreement on Saturday (January 13th) to form the entity cabinet in the Federation of BiH (FBiH). 
SDA leader Sulejman Tihic announced the agreement after a meeting of the three parties' leaders in Sarajevo. 
Still unclear is whether the other main Croat formation, HDZ 1990, will participate in the ruling coalition. 
Under the deal struck Saturday, Bosniaks are to hold the posts of FBiH prime minister and speaker of the FBiH House of Representatives, while the FBiH president and the speaker of the FBiH House of Peoples would be Croats.

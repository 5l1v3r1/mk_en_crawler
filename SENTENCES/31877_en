BUCHAREST, Romania -- Former monarch Mihai kicked off a lobbying campaign for Romania's integration into NATO and the EU with an unofficial visit to the United Kingdom on Wednesday (30 October).
He maintains that military reforms Bucharest has undertaken, involvement in the global anti-terrorist coalition and participation of Romanian troops in the mission in Afghanistan prove that Romania shares the values of Alliance members.

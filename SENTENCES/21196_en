TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha said on Wednesday (October 31st) that the chances of Kosovo's final status being finalised by December 10th are slim. 
At a conference dubbed Albanian Ambassadors in the World, he urged Serbs and Kosovo Albanians to build a conciliatory process similar to the Franco-German one. 
"Kosovo independence will free Serbia from its past and will turn it towards its European future," Basha said.
At the same event, Albanian President Bamir Topi vowed to continue to push for judicial and electoral system reforms, which he says are crucial to Albania's integration in the NATO and EU structures. 
He added that Kosovo's final status issue is the focus of Albanian foreign policy.
Interviewed by the BBC in London on Wednesday, former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari said he believes his plan still offers the best solution to the status issue. 
Talks between Belgrade and Pristina resume on Monday in Vienna.

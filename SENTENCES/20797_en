SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Central Elections Commission announced on Wednesday (February 6th) that it has vetted the last six ministerial candidates, and that all six are eligible to join the government.
The process was required after BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric resigned in November to protest changes ordered by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak that were aimed at facilitating decision-making.
The ruling coalition nominated Spiric to his old post after they managed to agree on new voting rules in parliament and in the Council of Ministers, as well as on key police reform.

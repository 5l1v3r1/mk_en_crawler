BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, leader of the National Liberal Party, called on Saturday (September 1st) for a constitutional amendment that would give the government more power. 
Tariceanu explained the current constitution gives executive powers to both the president and to the government, thus leading to conflicts. 
He instead wants to see a parliamentary republic, in which the president would be elected by parliament. 
Both the Hungarian Democratic Alliance of Romania and the Conservative Party back the idea, while the main opposition Social Democratic Party and the Liberal Democratic Platform reject it.

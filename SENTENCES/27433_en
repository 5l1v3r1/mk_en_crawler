BUCHAREST, Romania -- The opposition National Liberal Party and Social Democratic Party will file a fresh joint no-confidence motion against the government, to prevent the government from turning education reform into law, bypassing parliament, senior opposition leaders said on Thursday (October 28th).
Prime Minister Emil Boc, whose government just survived a no-confidence vote Wednesday, addressed parliament Thursday, insisting on launching an accountability procedure on the education law, which would enable the cabinet to adopt it without parliamentary debate or voting.
The law could enter into force in two weeks, during which time parliament could propose amendments.

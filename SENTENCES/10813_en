BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) is recommending starting talks with Turkey on EU membership, while insisting on strict conditions and safeguards meant to ensure the country does not backtrack on required reforms.
Briefing European Parliament leaders Wednesday (6 October) on a key set of reports on candidate countries, EC President Romano Prodi said commissioners had decided on a "qualified yes" for negotiations with Turkey.
"It's flanked with a whole series of recommendations for monitoring and verifying what the situation is actually like," Prodi said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul hailed the recommendation as a "historic step", while Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he hoped accession talks would begin during the first half of 2005.

BLAGOEVGRAD, Bulgaria -- Foreign Minister Solomon Passy said on Sunday (30 March) he hoped the new Ilinden checkpoint on the border with Greece would be opened before the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics. 
He called on Greek authorities to speed up implementation of the project, which began in July 2000 with funds provided by the EU's PHARE programme. 
Passy added that Bulgaria would like to open more checkpoints along its border with Greece.

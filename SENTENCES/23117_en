THE HAGUE, the Netherlands -- The war crimes trial of former Yugoslav National Army (JNA) chief Momcilo Perisic began at The Hague after all on Thursday (October 2nd), despite word Wednesday by tribunal spokesperson Nerma Jelacic that it had been "delayed until further notice, pending the naming of judges". 
Perisic has pleaded not guilty to 13 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed when he was JNA chief of staff between August 1993 and November 1998. 
The charges include murder; persecution on political, racial or religious grounds; extermination; inhumane acts and attacks on civilians. 
Many of the charges relate to the siege of Sarajevo, in which thousands of civilians died, and the 1995 massacre in Srebrenica.

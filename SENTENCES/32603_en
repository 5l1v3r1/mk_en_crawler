SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed Saturday (1 March) that Russia and Bulgaria have not been able to reconcile their differences over Iraq.
"Each country defines its foreign policy according to its national interest.
We have no problem with that," Putin said.
Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov pointed out the need for "the quick and unconditional disarmament of Saddam Hussein's regime".
The two heads of state signed several memorandums on bilateral relations, especially in the energy sector.
They also agreed to increase the quantity of Russian natural gas shipped through Bulgaria to Turkey, Greece and Macedonia.
An agreement was also reached on repayment of Russia's $88.5m debt.

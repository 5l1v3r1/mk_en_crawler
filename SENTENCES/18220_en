NEW YORK, United States -- UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker repeated a call for a fast settlement of the Kosovo status issue, telling a UN Security Council session on Wednesday (December 13th) that any further delay would only raise tensions and encourage extremists.
Ruecker presented his regular three-month report on the situation in the province.
It concludes that since UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari decided to postpone his proposal for future status until after January elections in Serbia, tensions have increased.
The head of the Serbian government's co-ordination centre for Kosovo and Metohija, Sanda Raskovic-Ivic, also address the Security Council.
She reiterated Belgrade's stance that a hasty decision on status could have negative consequences on the region and said the security situation for Serbs in the province is catastrophic.
Meanwhile, members of the Kosovo negotiation team in the UN-mediated status talks decided on Wednesday to begin preparing for an eventual state constitution, in hopes of independence for the province.

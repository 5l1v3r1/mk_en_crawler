ATHENS, Greece -- Workers at Piraeus and Thessaloniki, the two main commercial ports in Greece, were due to start a 48-hour strike on Wednesday (January 30th) against the government's plans to privatise container terminals.
They also oppose a government decision to announce an international tender for the ports.
The issue was discussed at a cabinet session Tuesday, chaired by Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis.
The government authorised the Marine and Island Policy Minister to submit a bill to parliament aimed at protecting the rights of workers at the two ports.
In other news, an earthquake measuring 5 on the Richter scale was recorded around 50km southwest of Athens on Tuesday.
No injuries or damage were reported.

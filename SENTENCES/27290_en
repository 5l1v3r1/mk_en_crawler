THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The war crimes trial of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic is to continue Monday (November 2nd) with the prosecution wrapping up its opening statement even though Karadzic is not expected in court.
He has been boycotting the proceedings, insisting he needs more time to prepare his defence.
One of his legal advisers, Marko Sladojevic, says Karadzic will be in court Tuesday.
He faces 11 charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the Bosnian conflict.

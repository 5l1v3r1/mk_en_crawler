TIRANA, Albania -- Ilir Meta, who resigned last week as foreign minister, lashed out Wednesday (30 July) at Prime Minister Fatos Nano. 
In his first public speech since leaving the cabinet, Meta accused Nano of trying to resurrect authoritarian rule in Albania, eliminate democracy and destroy the major achievements made by the ruling Socialist Party over the last 13 years. 
Meta also implied Nano has links to criminal organisations.
Meanwhile, Nano used his constitutional right to call an extraordinary session of parliament on Thursday to appoint the seventh member of the Central Electoral Commission. 
Lawmakers failed to approve any of the candidates Wednesday, during their last session before the summer recess. 
Local elections are scheduled for October.

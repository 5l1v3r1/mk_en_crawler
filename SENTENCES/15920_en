ANKARA, Turkey -- Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew said in an interview published on Sunday (November 19th) that he would defend Turkey's bid to join the EU at his upcoming meeting with Pope Benedict XVI. 
"It is not wrong for Turkey to become a member of the EU as a Muslim country â¦ The EU should not remain as a Christian club," Bartholomew said. 
He warned, however, that any incidents during the pope's visit would be a setback for Ankara's bid. 
Benedict is to arrive in Ankara in a week.

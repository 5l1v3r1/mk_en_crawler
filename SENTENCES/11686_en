SIRNAK, Turkey -- Authorities said Sunday (17 July) that security forces have killed 10 terrorists in an operation against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in the southeast part of the country late last week.
Weapons and 25kg of explosives reportedly were seized.
Meanwhile, the governor of Aydin, Mustafa Malay, said Saturday's deadly blast in the resort area of Kusadasi was caused by a remote-controlled bomb or a time bomb, not a suicide bomber.
Investigators examining the wreckage of a minibus carrying tourists found that explosives had been planted under one of its seats.
Five people were killed in the blast.
A Kurdish militant group calling itself Kurdistan Liberation Hawks reportedly has claimed responsibility for the attack.
The PKK has denied any responsibility for it.
Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis sent a letter to Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday, expressing condolences and condemning all acts of terrorism.

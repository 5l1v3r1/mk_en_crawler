SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The European Commission (EC) is asking the finance ministry to provide a list of companies caught violating EU funding procedures, as well as of companies suspected of doing so. 
On Tuesday (May 13th), the government released the full text of a letter sent last week by Michael Leigh, director general of the Enlargement Directorate General with the EC. 
Leigh wrote to Deputy Finance Minister Dimitar Ivanovski, who also serves as the national authorising officer for EU funds. 
The EC says measures undertaken so far fail to meet requirements outlined in a letter by Leigh on February 28th, and provide insufficient basis to conclude that contracts for EU financing are legal and correspond to respective regulations. 
He also recommended the firing of managers of programmes for the utilisation of pre-accession funds. 
The EU suspended payments to the finance ministry and the ministry of regional development and public works in January.

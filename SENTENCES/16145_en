SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin announced at the weekend that his ministry is drafting a new law on diplomatic service.
The bill envisions a 10 per cent limit for political and party appointments in the system, and tightens criteria for the appointment and promotion of diplomats.
For example, the new legislation would provide for the foreign ministry's chief secretary, currently a political appointee position, to be filled by a candidate with a minimum of 20 years experience.

OSIJEK, Croatia -- Parliament member Branimir Glavas was taken into custody again on Tuesday (April 17th), a day after the Osijek court officially charged him and six other individuals with war crimes.
Glavas arrived in the local Osijek detention unit alone, after refusing to be taken there by police.
He is charged in connection with the torture and murder of ten ethnic Serb civilians in the eastern Croatian region in 1991.
Last autumn, after hearing of the probe against him, he spent time in custody but was released after staging a month-long hunger strike.

TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament decided on Thursday (22 July) to approve a decree by President Alfred Moisiu that calls for changing the property bill.
The decree specified that the controversial measure should return to parliament for revision.
The bill has come under fire because the majority Socialist Party approved it after the major opposition Democratic Party had left the chamber.

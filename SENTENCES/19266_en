SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A group of MPs that were expelled from or left Simeon Saxe-Coburg's smaller ruling coalition partner, the National Movement for Stability and Progress (NDSV), may form their own party next week.
According to statements Thursday (November 29th) by some of the former NDSV members, the group may call itself the European Liberal Initiative.
A total of 12 MPs left the NDSV over the past couple of days, and more may follow.
Saxe-Coburg expelled five himself, saying they were working against the party.

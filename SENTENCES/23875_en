SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The State Agency for National Security on Wednesday (March 18th) searched Agriculture Ministry offices and seized documents as part of an investigation of illegal land swaps. 
"The prosecution is investigating the swapping of 1,000 hectares of high-quality arable state-owned land and forests for low-quality private lands, which took place this year and last year," Sofia prosecutor Nikolay Kokinov announced, but refused to elaborate. 
Land swaps are one of the biggest sources of corruption in Bulgaria over the past several years because of a real estate boom that significantly increased the price of state-owned lands along the coast and in mountainous areas. 
The prosecution announced on Wednesday that it planned to file charges against specific individuals, once it collects sufficient evidence.

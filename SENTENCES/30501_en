WASHINGTON, United States -- Media in most Balkan countries remain partly free, according to the latest Freedom in the World 2011 report published by US-based watchdog Freedom House on Thursday (January 13th).
Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Turkey are all in the group with partly-free media, characterised by some restrictions on political rights and civil liberties, often in context of corruption, weak rule of law, ethnic strife or civil war.
Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, Cyprus, Greece, Bulgaria and Romania are classified as countries with free media, where there is a broad scope for open political competition, a climate of respect for civil liberties and independent media.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Raffi Gregorian, political adviser to the NATO HQ in Sarajevo, said in an interview in Tuesday's (5 September) Nezavisne novine that BiH and Republika Srpska authorities must act decisively against the network supporting war criminals.
Gregorian, who will assume a top international post in Brcko next month, said that although a number of steps were made in BiH in the past 18 months to ensure full co-operation with the UN tribunal, a lack of co-ordination remains between the central and entity governments.
He also criticised domestic authorities for failing to act against the relatives of the top indictee Radovan Karadzic.
Membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace programme hinges on war crimes co-operation, Gregorian noted.

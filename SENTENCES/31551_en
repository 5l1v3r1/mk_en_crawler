CLUJ-NAPOCA, Romania -- Attending a seminar Saturday (18 January), President Ion Iliescu said state authorities should refocus efforts from establishment of institutions to improved co-operation.
He said the country has broadly met EU requirements to set up democratic and functioning institutions but the overall administrative capacity would depend on efficient forms of inter-state relations.
Meanwhile, a delegation from the European Commission is to arrive in Bucharest Tuesday to review progress the country has made in implementing accession reforms.
Receiving special attention will be judicial reforms and the utilisation of EU pre-accession funds.

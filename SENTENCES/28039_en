ATHENS, Greece -- A parliamentary committee investigating the Vatopedi monastery real estate scandal decided on Tuesday (September 21st) to summon former Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis to testify as a witness.
No date has been set for his appearance.
Karamanlis governed the country between 2004 and 2009.
The investigation aims to reveal whether five of his former cabinet ministers should be charged in connection with land swap deals between the state and the rich Greek Orthodox monastery.
Investigators say the deals, that benefitted the Vatopedi monastery in northern Greece, cost taxpayers over 100m euros.

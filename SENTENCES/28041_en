ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament debated and approved three more constitutional amendments Wednesday (April 21st), part of the package of measures proposed by the ruling Justice and Development Party.
The most critical one puts party closures in the hands of parliament, rather than the Constitutional Court, as is now the case.
The prosecutor-general would be the one to launch the process, however.
This makes eight of the 30 articles in the package approved.
Since there is no session Friday due to a public holiday, parliament is expected to resume debate on constitutional reforms Saturday.
Opposition parties are generally united against the whole package.

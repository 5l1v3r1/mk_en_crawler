BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Though the date might be considered ambitious, negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement could begin next month, according to Josep Lloveras, head of the European Commission Delegation to Serbia-Montenegro. 
In a newspaper interview published Wednesday (31 August), Lloveras said the state union must first meet the requirement for full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, as well as make progress in judicial, economic, legislative and administrative reforms. 
He added that Serbia-Montenegro should strengthen the protection of human and minority rights.

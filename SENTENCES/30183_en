TIRANA, Albania -- The office of the general prosecutor has denied allegations of human organ trafficking on Albanian territory as alleged by Swiss senator Dick Marty.
"According to a joint verification between Albanian experts and Hague investigators, there was no substantial data found, therefore the prosecution has not initiated a case," office spokesman Plator Nesturi said on Monday (December 20th).
Marty's report was adopted unanimously by the Council of Europe last week.
The prosecutor's office also downplayed allegations circulating in the media that it prevented investigations in the case.

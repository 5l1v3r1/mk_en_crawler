SKOPJE, Macedonia -- In an interview Sunday (20 July), Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski praised the public's growing ethnic tolerance.
He told Radio Free Europe that ten months ago there were concerns that segments of the population might support incidents of ethnic violence, but that actions have proved those concerns wrong.
Crvenkovski acknowledged that the government had failed to meet all expectations, but suggested those expectations had been excessively high.
He said the cabinet would focus on economic issues next year, and stressed that growth could only be achieved in an environment of stability and security.
The prime minister praised the work of the interior ministry but criticised the judiciary, which has seen a serious decline in public trust.

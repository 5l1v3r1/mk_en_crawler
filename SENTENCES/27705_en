ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Friday (May 21st) that Turkey will open its ports to Cypriot ships if a trade embargo on Turkish Cypriots is lifted in return.
"The world will open three ports to Turkish Cypriots, and in return we will open all Turkish ports to Greek Cypriots.
I promise," Davutoglu said after a meeting in Istanbul of the political committee of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.
Turkey has been insisting that it will only open its ports and airports to Greek Cypriot vessels once the economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community ends.

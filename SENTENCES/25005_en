BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic said on Sunday (August 30th) that his country's main priority remains EU membership, adding that strategic partnerships with Washington, Moscow and Beijing do not affect this goal. 
Serbia has four pillars of its foreign policy -- the EU, Russia, the US and China --Tadic said in an interview with Belgrade-based daily Politika. 
He added that Serbia has no intention of joining the Non-Aligned Movement, which eschews membership in any major power bloc.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Just days before the 25 June parliamentary elections, new polls suggest nationalists have a good chance of meeting the 4 per cent election threshold necessary for seats in the new legislature. 
The results of the latest poll by Alpha Research were presented Tuesday (21 June). 
They suggest the coalition Bulgarian National Alliance, which includes the nationalist VMRO, could win 5 per cent of the votes, while another formation -- a newly-established extreme nationalist movement called "Attack", led by a local journalist Volen Siderov -- may grab 4.5 per cent. 
A separate survey conducted by the APHIS agency had largely similar results.
In other news, a Bulgarian soldier was critically injured when his armoured personnel carrier overturned and sank in an Iraqi canal last week has died. 
Two others in the vehicle were killed.

TIRANA, Albania -- The main parties in parliament forged a consensus Wednesday (16 April) on the EU's report on the country. 
After two days of hectic debate, lawmakers with the ruling party and the opposition agreed to draft a joint resolution. 
The document will stipulate the actions to be taken in line with EU conclusions and recommendations on Albania's progress in the Stabilisation and Association Process. 
The parliamentary commission on foreign affairs is to prepare the draft resolution and submit it for debate Thursday.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Police on Monday (March 16th) prevented a group of eight parliament members from Serbia from entering Kosovo, allegedly because the group failed to follow procedures.
The lawmakers are members of Serbia's Parliamentary Committee on Kosovo.
They were on their way to a session in the village of Ranilug to discuss self-government structures in Kosovo's Serb-dominated areas.
The event was cancelled.
Kosovo authorities say the delegation informed UNMIK's office in Belgrade of their visit but failed to inform Kosovo's foreign ministry about their plans.
Meanwhile, representatives of minorities and opposition political parties criticised the government on Monday for giving privileges to the Serb community but not to other minorities.
In a debate, representatives of the minorities accused the government of failing to integrate all communities into society, a pre-condition for EU integration.

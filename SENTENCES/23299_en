BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police announced the arrests Friday (December 26th) of ten ethnic Albanian guerrillas, suspected of kidnapping scores of Serbian civilians and killing more than 50 people shortly after the 1998-1999 conflict in Kosovo. 
The suspects were arrested in an operation in the southern town of Presevo. 
Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said police searched 17 locations there, finding weapons and evidence that the suspects were members of the former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). 
They were transferred to Belgrade late Friday and will appear before a magistrate shortly.
War crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic's office says the ten were part of the so-called "Group of Gnjilane" that kidnapped 159 Serbian civilians and killed at least 51 people in Gnjilane between June and October 1999. 
The suspects are also wanted for the alleged "rape, incarceration, mutilation, torture, and looting" of Serb and non-Albanian civilians, the office said. 
Dacic said the leaders of the group remain at large and are believed to be in Kosovo.
On Saturday, Kosovo called on Serbia to free the ten suspects. 
The arrests were "intended to make Albanians and Serbs enemies and provoke the Kosovo authorities," Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniq said in a statement.

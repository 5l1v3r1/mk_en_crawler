BELGRADE, Serbia -- More than 10,000 state employees protested in Belgrade on Friday (March 25th). 
Teachers, doctors, police officers and other public workers gathered at the central square in Belgrade to demand higher salaries and better working conditions. 
They insisted on immediate talks with the government to secure payment of all delayed salaries by March 28th, revision of wages in the sector, and amendments to the current education law by September 30th.
The protestors held a march down the capital's streets, reaching the presidency building where they submitted a letter outlining their demands to President Boris Tadic. 
After that, they moved on to the government and education ministry buildings to deliver similar letters.

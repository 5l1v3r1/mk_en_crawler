SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria is awaiting the ruling by Libya's Supreme Court in a case involving five nurses sentenced to death in Benghazi.
The Bulgarian medics, along with a Palestinian doctor, were convicted in May 2004 on charges they deliberately infected hundreds of children in a local hospital with the HIV virus, supposedly as part of an international conspiracy against Libya.
Leading international medical experts have said the allegations are unfounded.
The Supreme Court ruling is expected Tuesday (15 November).
In other news, more than 500 people have been arrested an ongoing police operation against organised crime.
The effort was launched after the murder late last month of Emil Kyulev, the country's most powerful banker.

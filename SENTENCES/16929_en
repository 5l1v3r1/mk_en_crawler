BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Former Yugoslav Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic, now a senior official with the Stability Pact, believes the case of Ratko Mladic will be resolved by the end of April. 
In an interview in Wednesday's (5 April) edition of the Podgorica daily Republika, Svilanovic predicted that Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica would make good on pledges to arrest and extradite Mladic to The Hague by the end of this month.
On Tuesday, Rasim Ljajic, the human and minority rights minister in charge of Serbia-Montenegro's co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, said Belgrade must keep its word regarding Mladic. 
Failure to deliver the former Bosnian Serb military commander to The Hague would ruin the country's credibility, said Ljajic.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling criticised the House of Representatives' rejection Monday (18 September) of crucial amendments to the law on pharmaceuticals and medical devices. 
He said the new legislation was key to creating a single pharmaceuticals market in BiH, regulating the import, manufacture and sale of medicines, improving the standards of safety and accessibility and ending the monopoly currently enjoyed by certain firms on the market.
Bosniak deputies opposed the measure. 
Lawmakers did, however, pass a separate piece of legislation Schwarz-Schilling described as crucial, this one envisioning the establishment of an economic planning unit in government.

VIENNA, Austria -- Zeljko Komsic, member of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH)'s presidency, and Sven Alkalaj, the country's foreign minister, visited Bosnian Army General Jovan Divjak on Monday (March 7th). 
He is in custody in Korneuburg, after being detained last week at the Vienna airport based on a warrant issued by Serbia. 
He is wanted in connection with a May 1992 attack in Sarajevo against a Yugoslav National Army convoy, which left more than 40 soldiers dead. 
Komsic is to meet with Austrian President Heinz Fischer on Tuesday.

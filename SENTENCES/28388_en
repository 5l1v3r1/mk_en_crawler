ANKARA, Turkey -- Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew celebrated an Orthodox liturgy on Sunday (August 15th) to mark the Assumption of the Virgin Mary.
The liturgy, at the Panagia Sumela Monastery in northeast Turkey, was the first allowed at the site by Turkish authorities in 88 years.
The centuries-old monastery was closed in 1923 and transformed into a museum.
Attempts to hold the liturgy there last year were thwarted as authorities upheld a ban on religious services at various historic sites.
Several thousand people from Istanbul, Greece, Russia, Ukraine and Georgia were in attendance Sunday.
The Turkish government's move also cleared the way for a liturgy to be held at the Armenian Holy Cross cathedral on the island of Akhmatar in the country's east.
Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou welcomed what he described as an "historic and important event", reflecting a "spirit of co-operation and peace between us and our neighbours".

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prosecutors reportedly will indict Lyudmil Stoykov, a donor to President Georgi Parvanov's re-election campaign, on charges of money laundering. 
According to media reports Friday (December 12th), the indictment will likely be issued early next year, as the investigation is winding down. 
Stoykov, along with another local businessman, Mario Nikolov, are among those named in a July report by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) that revealed abuses regarding 32m euros allocated to Bulgaria under the SAPARD programme. 
OLAF's report hinted that both Stoykov and Nikolov received political protection at the highest level of government.

STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament adopted a progress report Thursday (July 12th) on Macedonia, drafted by Dutch MEP Erik Meijer. 
It praises recent reforms in the country and recommends the start of actual accession negotiations as soon as possible. 
The report also mentions Macedonia's name dispute with Greece, stressing "the contested issue ... 
cannot form part of the conditions for EU membership".

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- British Ambassador to BiH Matthew Rycroft expects leaders of the eight largest political parties to agree on crucial constitutional reforms within days. 
In an interview in Thursday's (23 February) Dnevni avaz, Rycroft said ongoing talks are moving in the right direction. 
He added that the time for introducing key changes -- making BiH a state with functional institutions -- is now, ahead of elections later this year.
On Wednesday meanwhile, Federation of BiH (FBiH) Minister for Urban Planning and Environment Ramiz Mehmedagic submitted his resignation. 
Local media reports suggest he wants to assume a post at the BiH energy-regulating agency. 
His departure leaves a third vacancy in the FBiH cabinet.

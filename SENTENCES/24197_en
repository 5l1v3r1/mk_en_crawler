THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal rejected a request by former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to drop the charges against him Wednesday (May 13th).
Karadzic insists the tribunal is hindering the process and his defence preparations by constantly raiding the homes of his relatives.
He argued that these searches prove prosecutors lack enough evidence and amount to witness intimidation of those from Bosnia and Herzegovina who are to testify at his trial.
In its ruling Wednesday, the tribunal said Karadzic had not provided enough evidence to prove either claim.

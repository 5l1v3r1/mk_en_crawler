ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey has accelerated preparations in advance of the EU summit at the end of this year, in an effort to launch accession negotiations, according to a report by the Anadolu news agency. 
Once Turkey gets a starting date for negotiations, the government will assign a chief negotiator for the process. 
For now, its primary task is to finish adjustment studies and demonstrate progress in implementing EU-compatible reforms, passed late last year. 
This needs to be completed before the EU starts drafting its next progress report on Turkey, over the summer.
In other news, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan assured South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun Monday (9 February) that Turkey supports a peaceful resolution to the crisis caused by North Korea's nuclear ambitions. 
Erdogan is on a three-day official visit to Seoul.

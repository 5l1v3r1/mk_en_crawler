ATHENS, Greece -- Greek and Turkish authorities have reached an agreement to open new air corridors over the Aegean in order to ease air traffic congestion during the Olympic Games in Athens next year. 
Responding to media speculation, Greek Defence Minister Yiannos Papantoniou on Thursday (18 September) rejected charges that the deal compromises national security, saying that it concerns passenger planes and not military aircraft.The two Aegean neighbours have long been at odds over airspace issues.(ANA, MPA - 18/09/03; Reuters - 17/09/03)

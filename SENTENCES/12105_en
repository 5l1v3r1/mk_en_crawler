ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Authorities closed the Bosphorus Straits after a cargo ferry sank late Saturday (12 March). 
Ships were kept out of the area as rescue crews battled to save the eight seamen aboard and remove tanks full of propane from the sunken vessel. 
Officials said an explosion was narrowly averted.

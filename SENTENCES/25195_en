PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The most powerful international official in Kosovo -- International Civilian Office (ICO) chief Pieter Feith -- will have his mandate reviewed by representatives of the 25 states in the International Steering Group (ISG) next month.
The February 8th review will be conducted in accordance with former special envoy Marti Ahtisaari's comprehensive proposal for resolving Kosovo's status.
The ISG must review the responsibilities of the ICO chief to gradually reduce them, within two years of implementing the Ahtisaari Plan in February 2008.
Feith also serves as EU special representative to Kosovo.

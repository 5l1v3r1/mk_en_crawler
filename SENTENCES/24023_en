SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The state court released Branimir Glavas on Friday (May 15th).
He was detained on Wednesday on an international arrest warrant issued by Croatia, after fleeing to BiH to avoid serving a ten-year sentence in Croatia for war crimes.
Earlier, a lower BiH court decided to place Glavas in extradition custody for a month.
The state court concluded Glavas holds valid BiH citizenship documents and there are no grounds to keep him in detention.
However, the extradition process will remain in force, a court spokesperson said.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica insisted on Sunday (March 23rd) that the NATO bombings against the former Yugoslavia nine years ago were aimed at turning Kosovo into the world's first NATO state. 
During a speech to commemorate the anniversary, he said "The illegal establishment of the huge US military camp Bondsteel and Annex 11 of the Martti Ahtisaari plan, which says that NATO is the supreme authority of the government in Kosovo, reveal the true purpose of Serbia's mindless destruction and provide an answer to the question of why a NATO state was declared illegally on February 17th," Kostunica said, reiterating that Kosovo is an integral part of Serbia. 
He plans to attend a memorial service Monday for the victims of the NATO bombings. 
Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac will meet pilots who helped defend Serbia during the conflict.

TIRANA, Albania -- The two largest political parties, the ruling Democratic Party and the opposition Socialist Party (SP), approved changes in the election code Thursday (November 13th), transforming the election system from a majority to a regional proportional system.
The electoral reform committee made no changes to the proposal despite strident opposition from smaller parties, some of whose members even staged a hunger strike.
The SP representative on the committee, Fatmir Xhafa, said changes in the code will guarantee more transparency.
Electoral reform is one of the main prerequisites that Albania must meet for eventual EU integration.
In other news Thursday, the health ministry announced it plans to file lawsuits against ten hospital directors suspected of fraud.
Ministry official Gerta Picari says auditors have found serious violations in terms of procurement procedures, allocation of budgetary funds to third parties and recruitment.
Audits continue at other hospitals around the country.

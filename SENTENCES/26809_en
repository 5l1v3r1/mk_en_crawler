ATHENS, Greece -- The Defence Ministry announced on Friday (November 6th) that it will abolish mandatory naval marine and air force service in 2012 in an effort to limit defence costs.
Defence Minister Evangelos Venizelos said that in the transit period, these two units of the armed forces will be looking for recruits with special skills, including doctors and chemical engineers.
Military service in Greece is mandatory for all men aged between 18 and 45.

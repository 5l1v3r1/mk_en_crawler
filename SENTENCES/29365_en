TIRANA, Albania -- Edi Rama, leader of the main opposition Socialist Party (SP), said on Sunday (May 2nd) that ongoing anti-government protests in Tirana represent all citizens across the country. 
"This battle is not an attempt by a political party to get to power, but represents the people who seek democracy," Rama told hundreds of supporters. 
Organisers say that the protests will continue until a solution is found. 
According to them, about 200,000 people have joined the action, although no official figures were announced. 
Opposition parties insist some ballot boxes from the June 2009 general elections should be opened, as this would prove violations occurred. 
The government, however, defends the vote as the "best ever held in Albania".
Meanwhile, parliament members from the SP and the ruling Democratic Party travelled to Brussels on Sunday to discuss the political crisis with the EU's Stabilisation and Association Inter-parliamentary Committee.

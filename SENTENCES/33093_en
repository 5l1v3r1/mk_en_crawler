BRUSSELS, Romania -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen said on Monday (19 May) that the European Commission would make all necessary efforts to finalise accession talks with Bulgaria and Romania by October of next year. 
The closing of all negotiation chapters by the end of the Commission's mandate would allow the countries to meet their target entry dates in 2007. 
Romanian Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana welcomed the statement, saying the closing of the accession talks next year and full EU membership in 2007 would be the country's two most important targets.

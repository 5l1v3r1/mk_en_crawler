ANKARA, Turkey -- Two politicians from the far-right Nationalist Action Party (MHP) resigned on Tuesday (May 10th) after secretly filmed videos reportedly showing them having extramarital affairs hit the internet.
Bulent Didinmez and Ihsan Barutcu's resignations came only a month after similar tapes forced two other members of the party to step down.
MHP leader Devlet Bahceli blames supporters of the ruling Justice and Development Party for the release, as the videos emerged only a month ahead of the June 12th general elections.

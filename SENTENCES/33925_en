SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Boris Trajkovski said on Saturday (8 November) that he saw no economic improvement during the government's first year in office, adding that economic stagnation had resulted in closed production facilities and lost jobs. 
Trajkovski urged the now reshuffled government to undertake more decisive measures to tackle these problems and improve living standards. 
The cabinet, with new ministers of finance, economy, justice and transport and communications, meets for first the time Monday.

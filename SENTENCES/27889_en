ANKARA, Turkey -- Rescue teams have found the bodies of 28 of about 30 miners who were trapped in a shaft after an explosion in Zonguldak province earlier this week. 
Energy Minister Taner Yildiz announced the grim discoveries on Thursday (May 20th) and said that efforts to find the remaining miners continue. 
Preliminary investigations suggest the victims died of carbon monoxide poisoning.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- EU Commissioner for External Affairs Chris Patten arrived Thursday (10 June) on a two-day visit to Croatia. 
He first stopped in Dubrovnik before going to Zagreb for meetings Friday with President Stipe Mesic, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and Minister of Foreign Affairs Miomir Zuzul. 
Patten's visit comes days ahead of the European Council meeting in Brussels, at which Croatia will likely be given candidate status and a date for starting accession talks with the EU in early 2005. 
Zagreb hoped to open negotiations by the end of this year. 
Patten will also visit the Petrinja municipality, to which the EU has provided 4.3m euros for mine clearing and reconstruction of houses under the programme for refugee return.

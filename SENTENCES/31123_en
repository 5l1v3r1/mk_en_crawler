BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Romanian President Traian Basescu said on Saturday (February 5th) that Romania will not ask to be decoupled from Bulgaria in its bid to join the Schengen Zone, even though his country has met the technical criteria while Bulgaria has not.
"We do not want a split from Bulgaria and we will not seek one," Basescu said in Brussels, where he attended a European Council.
According to EU expert reports, Romania is technically ready to join the border-free area while Bulgaria is not yet prepared because of its failure to secure the border with Turkey.
The two countries are hoping to join Schengen in March.

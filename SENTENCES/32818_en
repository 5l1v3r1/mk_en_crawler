WASHINGTON, United States -- The US administration qualified the International Crisis Group (ICG) report on Yugoslav illegal arms trading as inaccurate and speculative. 
US State Department spokesman Philip Reeker said Wednesday (4 December) that Washington cannot endorse the call for suspending international aid to Belgrade. 
He also stressed that investigations continue, implying that ICG's findings are premature. 
Earlier this week, ICG said that Yugoslav authorities failed to suspend arms trading with countries under UN embargo - deals that began during the Milosevic era. 
Both Yugoslav and Serbian government officials dismissed the report.

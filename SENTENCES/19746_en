VIENNA, Austria -- In a speech to the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna on Thursday (October 25th), High Representative to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Miroslav Lajcak stressed the need for a new dynamic in BiH politics.
He cited, in particular, a status quo that resulted in failing to achieve consensus that would have led to signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
The road to European integration would ensure long-term regional stability, he said.
He also urged the international community to change course and focus on implementing the Dayton Peace Accord, and he briefed the Council about the latest measures he has imposed in this regard.

PRIJEDOR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) authorities have submitted their formal report on the Orao affair to SFOR, a day before the Friday (3 January) deadline. 
During a visit to Prijedor on Thursday, Paddy Ashdown, the international community's high representative in BiH, said the sheer size of the report means it will take weeks to assess. 
RS officials launched their probe last autumn, amid evidence that Orao was involved in trading arms with Iraq, in violation of UN resolutions.

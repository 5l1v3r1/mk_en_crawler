BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prosecutors at the National Anti-corruption Agency pressed charges Tuesday (December 28th) against two employees of the National Housing Agency, accusing them of causing losses worth 2.4m euros to the state.
Daniel Robert Negulescu will be tried for serious abuse of office against the public interest, while Sandra Laura Diaconu is charged with negligence.
Prosecutors say that between 2007 and 2009, Negulescu signed several documents for construction that never began, while Diaconu signed two documents on construction site supervision that were never implemented.
Two other former state officials, meanwhile, face corruption charges for allegedly giving a church a 1m-euro property that was seized.
Attila-Gabor Marko, a former undersecretary for ethnic relations, and Silviu Clim, a former adviser at the justice ministry, along with a representative of the Reformed Church, were members of a committee tasked with returning property confiscated from minorities during the communist regime.
Prosecutors say that in 2002, the pair drafted a document for a property worth 1.3m euros that falsely claimed it belonged to the church, instead of returning it to its actual owners.

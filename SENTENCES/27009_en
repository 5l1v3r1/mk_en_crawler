PRISTINA, Kosovo -- KFOR halted its co-operation with the Kosovo Security Force (KSF) on Saturday (March 6th) after members of the newly established force carried weapons during a ceremony Friday marking the 12th anniversary of the Kosovo Albanian resistance against Serb forces. 
As a result, KFOR has suspended all support and training activities with the KSF until further notice, the mission announced in a statement. 
The International Civilian Office (ICO) is supporting the decision, suggesting the KSF had overstepped its bounds. 
By law, "The KSF is responsible for crisis response, explosive ordnance disposal, civil protection and other security functions," ICO spokesman Kai Mueller-Berner said on Sunday.

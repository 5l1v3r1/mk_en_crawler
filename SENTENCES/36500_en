ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia will dispatch a new peacekeeping contingent to Afghanistan in late August, the Croatian Army's deputy chief of staff said Sunday (8 August).
Colonel General Slavko Baric added that the contingent would be the country's fourth and would comprise 50 troops.
He also said the task of this platoon would be more complex, given the upcoming general elections in Afghanistan.
According to Baric, Croatia has received proposals to expand its medical and training staff in Afghanistan and is preparing, although parliament has not yet made a decision.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- The state security court on Sunday (7 December) indicted three more people in connection with the series of bombings in Istanbul last month.
The men were charged with being members of an illegal organisation.
The government has so far indicted 30 people for the terrorist attacks, most of whom reportedly played minor roles in the plot.
Four others were questioned by prosecutors over the weekend and released.
Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu said a key conspirator is thought to have fled to Syria.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Several individuals and groups filed petitions Monday (September 13th) calling for the prosecution of former President Kenan Evren, over his role in a 1980 coup. 
The moves came only a day after a package of constitutional amendments was approved during a public referendum. 
The package includes reforms that annul Evren's immunity. 
The former general is now 93 years old. 
He became president in the wake of the 1980 coup that he led, and held the post until 1989. 
The petitions, calling for criminal trials against Evren and at least two other coup leaders, were filed in Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir and Bursa.

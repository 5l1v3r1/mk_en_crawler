SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Twenty-one Macedonians from Kocani broke new ground Thursday (21 November) by joining former National Liberation Army leader Ali Ahmeti's Democratic Union for Integration (DUI).
The move was particularly surprising since the town has no Albanian residents.
The group visited DUI headquarters in Tetovo to receive membership cards.
Party spokesman Agron Buxhaku told reporters that there are more "intellectuals from eastern Macedonia willing to join.
We are not a party only for ethnic Albanians, we favor ethnic integration, co-existence and making Macedonia a truly multiethnic state." (AP - 21/11/02)

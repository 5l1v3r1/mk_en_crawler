BUCHAREST, Romania -- A court in Constanta on Wednesday (December 8th) sentenced two Romanians and a Spanish citizen to prison in the biggest cocaine smuggling case in the country's history.
Antonio Alvarez Cano was sentenced to 24 years for smuggling 1.2 tonnes of cocaine from Brazil to Romania, hidden in a timber shipment bound for Spain.
The two Romanians, Adrian Vasile Chiribau and Elena Ramona Cioroaba, received sentences of over 22 years in prison each.
The three were arrested in January 2009.
In other news Wednesday, the foreign ministry announced that a court in Indonesia has approved the extradition of Romanian Nicolae Popa, who had fled the country in 2002.
Four years later, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison for involvement in an investment scheme that collapsed.
He was arrested in Indonesia in 2009.
Sorin Ovidiu Vantu, owner of the influential Romanian TV channel Realitatea, is charged with helping Popa escape the country, and is suspected of helping him while he was abroad.

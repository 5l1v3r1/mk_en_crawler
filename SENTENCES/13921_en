SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Information gathered by the Republika Srpska (RS) Interior Ministry suggests that war crimes indictee Stojan Zupljanin is hiding in Montenegro and that Ratko Mladic is still protected by senior representatives of the RS and Serbia-Montenegro armies. 
Speaking on Wednesday (16 November), RS police chief Dragomir Andan said he hopes Mladic would be detained and extradited to the war crimes tribunal in The Hague by the end of this year.
In Belgrade, Serbian President Boris Tadic issued a statement Wednesday, saying intelligence reports suggest Mladic is hiding somewhere in the forests along Serbia's borders.

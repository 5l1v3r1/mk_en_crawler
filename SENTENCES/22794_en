BELGRADE, Serbia -- Authorities have begun dismantling a network of people who helped two top war crimes suspects, former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his ally Stojan Zupljanin, while they were in hiding, Bruno Vekaric, spokesman for Serbia's war crimes prosecutor's office, said on Wednesday (October 8th).
"We have detained and begun questioning several people suspected of being members of the network," Vekaric said, adding 30 people are under investigation.
The network includes several former top local government officials who were in power until elections in May, as well as police officials and one university professor.
"We hope [the questioning] will lead us to the system that's hiding [former Bosnian Serb commander] Ratko Mladic," Vekaric said.

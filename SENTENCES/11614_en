SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EUFOR Commander General David Leakey said in a press interview Wednesday (20 July) that BiH's potential entry in NATO would end any risk of conflict or war, not only in BiH, but throughout the entire region. 
Speaking to the Sarajevo daily Dnevni avaz about the recent agreement on defence reform laws, Leakey said implementation of the new legislation was essential to fulfil BiH's aspirations for eventual NATO membership. 
He urged the BiH parliaments to pass the drafts as soon as possible.
Also Wednesday, representatives of the BiH and Canadian governments sealed a bilateral agreement on co-operation in the defence sector. 
The document provides for the training of BiH soldiers in Canada.

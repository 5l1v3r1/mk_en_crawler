ANKARA, Turkey -- A soldier and five members of an extreme leftwing group were killed in a gun battle in the Tokat province early Thursday (30 September). 
The fighting broke out when troops surrounded several militants belonging to the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front. 
In the late 1980s, the group targeted current and retired Turkish security and military officials and is blamed for the deaths of more than 180 soldiers and civilians. 
It is on the list of terrorist organisations compiled by the EU and United States.

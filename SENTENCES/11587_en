BRUSSELS, Belgium -- During a meeting in Brussels Wednesday (23 March), the EU member states' prime ministers decided to form a monitoring team which would be sent to Croatia to assess Zagreb's co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
Last week, the EU foreign ministers delayed the start of membership negotiations with Zagreb, citing insufficient co-operation.
An evaluation report is expected in May.
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader welcomed the decision and reaffirmed his government's commitment to enhance ties with the tribunal.
In other news, Croatia extradited former Macedonian Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski to The Hague on Thursday.
He was detained in Croatia months ago and faces charges stemming from the murders of ethnic Albanian civilians during the 2001 conflict in Macedonia.

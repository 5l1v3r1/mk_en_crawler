BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Separate statements Monday (October 30th) from the EU and the United States welcomed the adoption of a new Serbian Constitution, replacing the one from the Milosevic era.
At the same time, both stressed that the new legislation, approved during a weekend referendum, would have no impact on efforts to resolve Kosovo's final status, despite texts describing the province as an integral part of Serbia.
"The issue of the future status of Kosovo is a different matter that is being dealt with by [UN envoy] Martti Ahtisaari," said European Commission spokeswoman Krisztina Nagy.
In Washington, the US State Department's spokesperson Janelle Hironimus said Washington fully backs the efforts of UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari to reach a compromise solution to the status issue.

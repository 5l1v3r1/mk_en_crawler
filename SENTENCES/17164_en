PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Parliament Speaker Ranko Krivokapic confirmed on Wednesday (31 May) that Montenegro will proclaim its independence from Serbia during a special parliamentary session on Saturday. 
His announcement came shortly after the republic's Referendum Commission announced the final results of the 21 May ballot, in which 55.5 per cent of participating voters backed the split from Serbia.
On Wednesday, the head of the ODIHR monitoring mission in Podgorica, Jorgen Grunet, congratulated Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic on the success of the referendum, saying it would advance Montenegro's EU integration process.

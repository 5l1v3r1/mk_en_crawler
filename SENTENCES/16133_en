ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Interior Ministry announced on Wednesday (November 15th) that Croatia would grant asylum for the first time ever.
It is being granted to a woman from Africa, although neither her name nor her home country has been disclosed.
Officials say she sought sanctuary in Croatia because she suffered persecution for her Christian beliefs and was threatened with female circumcision.

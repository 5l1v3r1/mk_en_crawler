SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Political leaders in Macedonia on Wednesday (26 April) denounced a recent statement by Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku regarding the legality of the border between Macedonia and the province.
Earlier this week Ceku said that Pristina does not recognise the 2001 agreement on interstate border demarcation sealed between Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro, adding that resolving the border issue with Macedonia is not a priority right now.
Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski described that as a "blow" to the international community's policy in the region.
He added that Skopje is "neither intending nor interested in re-negotiating the issue".
Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski described Ceku's statement as counterproductive, while the leader of the main opposition VMRO-DPMNE, Nikola Gruevski, said the Albanian majority in Kosovo is trying to use the border issue as a trump card in ongoing negotiations on the province's final status.

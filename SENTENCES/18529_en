THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague opened the trial Thursday (January 11th) against former Bosnian Serb General Dragomir Milosevic, who is charged with directing a 44-month siege of Sarajevo that resulted in more than 10,000 deaths during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
Prosecutor Alex Whiting says Milosevic was well aware of the situation, of his actions and the consequences from them when he took over command from predecessor Stanislav Galic in August 1994. 
Milosevic surrendered to The Hague tribunal in December 2004. 
Galic was initially sentenced to 20 years in prison, but that was later changed to life in prison.
In other news Thursday, Serbian ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj told Reuters that he is recovering quickly from the debilitating hunger strike he staged late last year to protest the appointment of defence lawyer for him. 
He went 28 days without food, forcing a suspension of his war crimes trial at The Hague.

TIRANA, Albania -- In his first visit to the Zall Herr Commando Regiment as the new chief commander of the military, President Bamir Topi promised on Tuesday (August 7th) to boost military spending to 2% of total GDP in 2008, up from the current 1.35%.
Topi also said Albania would meet the standards required to join NATO and urged military personnel to boost their efforts in this regard so Albania receives an invitation to membership during NATO's April summit in Bucharest.
Topi also backed the establishment of a new, professional military force in Albania by 2010, one he said that would be better in both quality and quantity.

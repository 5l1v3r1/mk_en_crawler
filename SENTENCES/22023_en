ANKARA, Turkey -- One soldier reportedly died and 13 were wounded in fighting between the Turkish army and members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in a mountainous area of Sirnak province Wednesday (April 16th). 
According to Turkish media, the fighting began after troops demanded the guerrillas' surrender. 
Instead, they opened fire on the soldiers. 
No information is available on PKK casualties. 
The operation is said to be ongoing.
Meanwhile, police in Diyarbakir say they arrested two men Wednesday for carrying explosive devices. 
Investigators say the pair planned to bomb a local railway station that the army uses to transport soldiers and military equipment.

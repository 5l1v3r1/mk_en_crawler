SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH House of Peoples adopted three amendments Thursday (21 October) intended to facilitate the domestic prosecution of war crimes.
Changes were made to the laws on courts, the prosecutor's office and transfer of war crimes cases from The Hague to the Court of BiH.
According to local media, different versions of the three laws were adopted by the House of Peoples and the House of Representatives, and must be harmonised before being implemented.
Earlier this week, BiH High Representative Paddy Ashdown and UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte urged parliament to adopt the necessary legislation to ensure that a war crimes chamber in BiH becomes fully operational by January.

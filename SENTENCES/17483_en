ANKARA, Turkey -- Retired General Joseph Ralston, the US special envoy for countering the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terrorist organisation, met with senior officials in Ankara on Tuesday (January 30th) to discuss strategy. 
Ralston met with his Turkish counterpart, retired General Edip Baser, and Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul. 
At a news conference later, Ralston said the United States is focused on fighting PKK members on Iraqi territory. 
Turkey, concerned that the group is using northern Iraq as a base for attacks on Turkey, has warned it could launch cross-border operations.
In other news Tuesday, the European Court of Human Rights rejected an appeal against Turkey's high 10% election threshold, submitted by a pro-Kurdish political party, DEHAP. 
Its candidates failed to win any seats in parliament during the 2002 elections, despite its popularity in the southeast. 
DEHAP claimed the threshold amounted to a human rights violation.

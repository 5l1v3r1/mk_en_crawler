BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The former prime ministers of Italy, Sweden and Belgium and the former president of Germany have written a letter to EU leaders, urging them to continue with the Union's enlargement in the Balkans. 
"Europe can survive the crisis with the European constitution. 
What Europe cannot survive is a new Srebrenica," Giuliano Amato, Carl Bildt, Jean-Luc Dehaene and Richard von WeizsÃ¤cker wrote in their message, addressed to the upcoming EU summit. 
They argued that Europe's problems must not allow the "quest for peace" to pause.

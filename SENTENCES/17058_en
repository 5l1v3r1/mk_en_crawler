BUCHAREST, Romania -- Deputy Prime Minister George Copos resigned from the government Thursday (1 June), citing his disagreement with the new fiscal code, adopted by the cabinet Wednesday.
According to Copos, who represented the Conservative Party in the coalition cabinet, his proposals related to the business climate were excluded from the draft, particularly his suggestion to set the tax rate for micro enterprises with profits of up to 100,000 euros at 3 per cent, instead of the current flat tax level of 16 per cent.

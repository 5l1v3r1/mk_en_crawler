SOFIA, Bulgaria -- On Thursday (6 February), Bulgaria's Cabinet of Ministers approved a US request for military support against Iraq. 
The cabinet will ask the National Assembly to permit overnight and transit passage of US and allied troops through Bulgaria for a period of six months. 
It will also ask parliament to authorise the deployment of some 300 soldiers to Iraqi borders, to participate in rescue operations in case civilians are attacked with chemical or biological weapons.
Also Thursday, Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) Interior Ministry issued a statement supporting the US stance on Iraq. 
Sarajevo says it is time Iraq implements the UN resolution on disarmament, a position echoed Thursday by Croatia's Foreign Ministry. 
Zagreb says it has not yet received a US request for military support.

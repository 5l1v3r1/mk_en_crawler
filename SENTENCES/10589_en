SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The head of the European Commission's (EC) enlargement directorate, Fabrizio Barbaso, confirmed that Bulgaria is expected to sign the EU accession treaty this spring.
Following talks with Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister in Charge of EU integration Plamen Panayotov on Wednesday (13 October), Barbaso also reaffirmed that for the time being, the EC envisions a common treaty for Bulgaria and Romania.
He noted, however, that Bucharest must complete talks on three negotiation chapters by the end of this year.

TIRANA, Albania -- The leader of the opposition Social Movement for Integration (SMI), Ilir Meta, on Saturday (December 20th) invited the main opposition Socialist Party (SP) to discuss co-operation ahead of next year's parliamentary elections.
Meta stressed opposition parties must join forces against the ruling Democratic Party (DP).
Relations between the SMI and the SP have been tense since the SP reached a consensus with the DP on the newly adopted election code, which excludes small opposition parties from election committees.

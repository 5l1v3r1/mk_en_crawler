TIRANA, Albania -- The OSCE praised on Thursday (28 September) the sealing of a national media ethics code and the establishment of a related council in Albania, describing the moves as a major step towards better ethical and professional standards.
On Wednesday, three leading Albanian journalists' and media associations agreed to the code, which was drafted by a group of local experts with the assistance of the OSCE and USAID.
A seven-member Council on Media Ethics was set up to intervene in media-related disputes.

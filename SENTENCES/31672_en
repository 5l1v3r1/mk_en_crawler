TIRANA, Albania -- Negotiations for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Albania and the EU will be opened before the visit, later this month, of European Commission President Romano Prodi. 
So says Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou, who arrived in Tirana on Monday (13 January), accompanied by EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and the Director for Western Balkans at the Directorate General for External Relations of the European Commission, Reinhard Priebe. 
At a press conference later, Papandreou insisted that Albania would receive Greece's full support in its EU integration efforts. 
Athens currently holds the rotating presidency of the Union.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government is expected to form a team this week for talks with the IMF and the World Bank expected within a couple of months. 
The announcement followed a meeting Saturday (8 January) between Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski and the ministers in charge of economic issues. 
Local media has reported that the international financial institutions as well as the European Commission have criticised authorities for the delay in liberalising the domestic telecommunications sector. 
The process should have been launched on 1 January but was stalled by problems associated with the telecom law.

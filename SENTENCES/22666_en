LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel said on Monday (September 8th) that his country will back an interim trade deal between the EU and Serbia.
"If the EU wants its policy on Serbia to be successful, it needs to make a decision to implement the interim agreement," Rupel noted in an interview with the daily Dnevnik.
He said Slovenia's experience during its EU presidency in the first half of this year proved that "the policy of trust and understanding is the one that works best." After implementing the interim trade deal, the EU should continue Serbia's integration process as fast as possible, he added.
"This move is of strategic significance for the EU, and it will give a major boost to pro-EU forces in Serbia," Rupel stressed.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov publicly confirmed on Friday (23 June) that the Communist-era State Security (DS) service had opened a file on him, but stressed that he was never involved in any intelligence or counterintelligence activities. 
He said that he had been contacted by an agent, who pretended to be a representative of the foreign ministry, for a history project -- later abandoned -- intended to lead to his recruitment. 
He rejected calls by the opposition for his resignation, which followed media reports suggesting he may have helped the DS.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- VMRO-DPMNE, the winner of Macedonia's 5 July parliamentary elections, is discussing possible coalition scenarios for the future government, according to party spokesman Antonio Milososki.
On Friday (7 July), he said VMRO-DPMNE was generally ready to negotiate with any formations but the previously ruling Social Democratic Party of Macedonia and the Liberal Democratic Party.
Milososki stressed that sharing common views about the economy would be the major condition for future coalitions.
Meanwhile, the State Election Commission says it received a total of 46 appeals by the Saturday deadline.
It has 48 hours to determine the legitimacy of the claims.
In a joint statement Friday, the International Election Observation Mission reiterated that the voting largely met international standards, though isolated irregularities occurred.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Delegations of the former Yugoslav republics will meet in Sarajevo Monday (7 October) to discuss the distribution of assets that belonged to the Yugoslav Central Bank and Yugoslav commercial banks. 
The funds were blocked in US-based accounts over the past decade, following the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. 
According to official data, commercial banks established in the former Yugoslavia have approximately $225m in the United States, while the former central bank has nearly $129m in deposits. 
Recently the US Congress decided to release these assets and return them to the former Yugoslav republics. 
The delegations will also discuss clearing the former Yugoslavia's debt to Russia.

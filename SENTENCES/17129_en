SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH presidency failed to ratify a crucial law related to defence sector reform by the required Saturday (1 July) deadline, despite warnings that the delay might jeopardise BiH's Euro-Atlantic integration bid.
The law, passed by the BiH Parliament last December, called for the tripartite presidency to endorse a plan -- developed with assistance from NATO -- for the size, structure and stationing of the BiH armed forces.
NATO HQ Sarajevo Political Adviser Raffi Gregorian described the failure by the presidency as a big step backwards.

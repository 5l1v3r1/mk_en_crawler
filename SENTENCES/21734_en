BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik downplayed possible assassination threats against him Saturday (April 19th). 
"I have full trust in the RS Ministry of Interior, Police and other RS security services," Dodik said. 
On Friday, Bjelina Chief Prosecutor Novak Kovacevic confirmed ongoing investigations of RS media claims that former Zemun Clan members are planning to kill several prominent BiH politicians. 
According to local media, Dodik is the most probable target.
In other news, the Dnevni Avaz newspaper reported on Saturday that Dodik is considering an extensive government reshuffle. 
The newspaper said he will use the recent resignation of RS Industry and Energy Minister Rajko Ubiparips to implement changes. 
Other ministers rumoured to be replaced are Agriculture Minister Radivoje Bratic and Health Minister Ranko Skrbic.

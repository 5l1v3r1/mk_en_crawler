BUCHAREST, Romania -- French Ambassador to Romania Philippe Etienne has urged the government to impose strong sanctions against those convicted of corruption. 
Following similar statements from the US and British ambassadors to Bucharest, Etienne said in an interview with the local news agency Mediafax that France "has no understanding for corruption, no matter who is behind it -- Romanian or foreign citizens". 
He urged less talk and more action.

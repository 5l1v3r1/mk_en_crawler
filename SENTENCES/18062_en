ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government adopted a report Friday (March 16th) on the situation of the Croatian armed forces in 2006, and then forwarded the document to Parliament for final approval.
Defence Minister Berislav Roncevic says the report concludes that the military was prepared to carry out all obligations stipulated by the country's Constitution and laws.
It also began implementing a long-term programme to reach EU and NATO standards in the defence and security sectors, including participation in international peacekeeping missions and military drills.
Next year, Croatia hopes to receive an invitation to join NATO.

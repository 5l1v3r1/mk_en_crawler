BELGRADE, Serbia -- Two senior officials sent conflicting messages on Wednesday (September 5th) regarding Belgrade's possible reaction if Kosovo declares independence from Serbia.
Dusan Prorokovic, Serbia's state secretary for Kosovo and a senior member of Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia, said his government was considering up to 16 measures, including a return of Serbian troops to the province.
But in an interview published on Thursday, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic ruled out any military move.
"All legal, diplomatic and practical resources, short of security and defence resources, will be used," he said.

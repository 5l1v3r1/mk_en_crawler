BUCHAREST, Romania -- Foreign Minister Mihai-Razvan Ungureanu leaves on Tuesday (3 May) for a three-day visit to the United States.
His first stop will be New York for a meeting with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.
Ungureanu then travels on to Washington to meet with US counterpart Condoleezza Rice, members of Congress, and others.
Talks will focus on bilateral ties and on Romania's military presence in Iraq.
In other news, people across Romania continue to hold vigils for three Romanian journalists and their Iraqi-American interpreter, abducted in Iraq more than a month ago.
As many as 1,000 people have been standing with lit candles in University Square in downtown Bucharest, the site of one ongoing vigil.

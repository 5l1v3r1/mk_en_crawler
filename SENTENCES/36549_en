NEW YORK, United States -- Envoys of the United States, the UN and the EU urged Kosovo's Serbs to vote in the 23 October parliamentary elections. 
"A boycott by any community would be a mistake . 
Participation in elections and acting within institutions of representative government are the best way for a community to defend its interests," US envoy Stuart Holliday told the UN Security Council on Thursday (5 August). 
The message was echoed by Hedi Annabi, the UN assistant secretary general for peacekeeping operations, who said participation would lead to eventual normalisation.
Speaking on behalf of the EU's 25 members, Dutch Ambassador Dirk Jan van den Berg said it would be in the interest of the Serb community to vote in the elections.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria and Croatia held another round of economic talks on Wednesday (18 February). 
This was the fourth session of the Joint Bulgarian-Croat Intergovernmental Commission for Economic Co-operation; members discussed opportunities for developing ties in chemical, oil, metal processing and electro-technical industries. 
The sides agreed that this could be done through establishment of free zones such as the ones in Rieka, Osiek and Vukovar along the Danube.

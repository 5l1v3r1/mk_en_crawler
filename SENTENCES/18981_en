BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Masoud Barzani, the president of Iraq's Kurdistan region, told reporters on Sunday (June 3rd) that Turkish forces have shelled a Kurdish-dominated area in northern Iraq.
He made it clear, however, that Turkish troops did not enter Iraqi territory during or after the incident.
Iraqi President Jalal Talabani condemned the attack and said Baghdad would not accept any interference in Iraq's domestic affairs.
According to media reports, the shelling targeted the Haji Umran region next to the border with Turkey.
No casualties were reported.
Officials in Ankara said on Monday that the government was writing a report on the PKK's use of Iraqi territory for attacks on Turkey.
The document will be given to the UN with a request for assistance.

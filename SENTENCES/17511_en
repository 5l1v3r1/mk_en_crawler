TIRANA, Albania -- The government is working hard to gain an invitation to join NATO next year, cabinet spokesperson Majlinda Bregu said during a news conference late last week.
She said that ministers are drafting a package of reforms that would aim to accelerate preparations, in addition to the official Action Plan.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha is expected to visit Brussels soon to report on NATO integration-related reforms.
In other news, the ruling Democratic Party (DP) said on Sunday (May 20th) that DP's Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli could temporarily act as president of the country, should the various parties fail to elect a consensus successor to President Alfred Moisiu, whose term expires on July 24th.
Topalli's deputy, Fatos Beja, noted that the constitution clearly states that when the office becomes vacant, the Parliamentary speaker assumes it temporarily.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu issued a decree Monday (September 22nd) suspending Labour Minister Paul Pacuraru for alleged corruption.
The central political bureau of the ruling National Liberal Party is expected to discuss nominees to replace Pacuraru on Tuesday.
He was summoned to the National Anticorruption Department on Friday and informed of the charges against him.
Prosecutors say his son's company was awarded a contract with a state-owned company in return for Pacuraru keeping one of the heads of the Gorj Labour Inspectorate at his post.

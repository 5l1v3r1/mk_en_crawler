BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The son of Slobodan Milosevic offered the Serbian mafia 5m German marks for the murder of Zoran Djindjic, Belgrade media reported Wednesday (14 April). 
A protected witness, Zoran Vukojevic, reportedly testified during a closed court hearing in Belgrade that Marko Milosevic made the offer in late 2000 shortly after his father's fall from power. 
He fled the country at the end of that year. 
Djindjic, then Serbia's prime minister, was assassinated in March 2003.

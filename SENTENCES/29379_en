SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serbs are marking the 18th anniversary of an attack against a Yugoslav National Army (JNA) convoy that left more than 40 soldiers dead.
A peaceful march and services are planned in Sarajevo on Monday (May 3rd), despite strong opposition from the city council and Mayor Alija Behmen.
Police say they are doing all they can to prevent any incidents during the gathering.
Zeljko Komsic, the Croat member of BiH's tripartite presidency, called the commemoration an attempt at provocation by Republika Srpska.

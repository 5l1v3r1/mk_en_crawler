NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus toughened its position Sunday (19 February) on Turkey's bid for EU membership, warning that it could veto Ankara's EU accession.
Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos said in an interview that a veto was among his government's options, and could be used as a last resort if Turkey fails to open its seaports and airports to Cypriot ships and planes.
This was one of Ankara's commitments when it launched accession talks with the EU in October.
Papadopoulos meets with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan next week to discuss the Cyprus reunification process, blocked now for months.

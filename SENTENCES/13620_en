BERLIN, Germany -- Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk said on Saturday (22 October) that he stands behind his remarks that nearly a million Armenians were killed in the Ottoman Empire during World War I. He also contended that some 30,000 Kurds have died in modern Turkey.
Pamuk was indicted for these statements and is due to go on trial in December, charged with "insulting and weakening Turkish identity".
The writer, in Frankfurt to receive Germany's highest literary award, said he had never characterised the killings of the Armenians as genocide because only experts could decide what term was appropriate.

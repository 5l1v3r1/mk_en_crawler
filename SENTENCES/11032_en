PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The head of the European Parliament's (EP) committee for Southeast Europe, Doris Pack, has urged Serbia and Montenegro to reach an agreement on their future relationship through dialogue. 
Following weekend talks with Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, Pack said Podgorica's recent proposal for forming a commonwealth of independent states underscored Montenegro's willingness to avoid an independence referendum.
In other news, prosecutors in Montenegro and Croatia signed a crime-fighting agreement on Friday. 
It is expected to result in better exchange of information and collection of evidence.

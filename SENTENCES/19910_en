SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The war crimes tribunal at The Hague ordered former Bosnian Muslim army commander Rasim Delic placed under house arrest Wednesday (December 19th), just days after his provisional release for the holidays.
The tribunal says Delic has violated restrictions placed on that release, including a controversial meeting with BiH presidency member Haris Silajdzic at which details of Delic's trial were discussed.
His lawyers say health and family matters were discussed.
Delic went on trial in July, charged with allowing the rape, torture and murder of dozens of Croats and Serbs by his subordinates between 1991 and 1995.
In other news Wednesday, the BiH war crimes court confirmed an indictment against former Republika Srpska Prime Minister Gojko Klickovic, who is charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Prosecutors say Klickovic, 52, organised the banishing of Muslims from the Bosanska Krupa area during the BiH conflict.
He is currently under arrest in BiH.

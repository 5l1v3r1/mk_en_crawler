STRASBOURG, France -- The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled on Tuesday (October 26th) that Turkey should pay 15m euros in compensation for damages caused by violations of property rights in Cyprus. 
The money must be paid out within three months. 
The court convicted Turkey in September and October 2009. 
The cases were filed by 19 applicants between 1990 and 1999. 
Each of them is entitled to between 30,000 and 5m euros for being unable to return to their homes after the 1974 Turkish invasion of the island. 
Turkey was also sentenced to pay about 160,000 euros in court costs and related fees.

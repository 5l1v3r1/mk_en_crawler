ZAGREB, Croatia -- A court in Osjek on Monday (July 7th) sentenced former police officer Antun Gudelj to 20 years in prison for a triple murder at the start of the Croatian-Serbian conflict in July 1991.
The court convicted Gudelj, who holds dual Croatian-Australian citizenship and was extradited from Australia in June 2007, of the murder of the former police chief in Osjek, Josip Reihl Kir, and two municipal councillors, Milan Knezevic and Goran Zobundzija.
All three victims were working to reduce ethnic tension in Osjek.

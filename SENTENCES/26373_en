SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Rail traffic throughout the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) ground to a halt again Monday (March 15th), due to a strike by union engineers.
The drivers warned that they will stage a general strike on March 31st unless they receive back wages by the end of the month.
Trains in FBiH have stopped three times in the last two and a half months due to problems with back wages.

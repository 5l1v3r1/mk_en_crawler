SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski told Reuters on Wednesday (May 28th) that Macedonia will not compromise on the name dispute with Greece for the sake of EU and NATO membership.
"We can't do that at the cost of losing our identity, our language and our nation," Gruevski said.
He added that all political parties are committed to Euro-Atlantic integration and realise there is no alternative for Macedonia.
Last month, Greece vetoed NATO's membership invitation to Macedonia at the Alliance's summit and threatened to block Macedonia's EU entry as well if the name dispute is not resolved.

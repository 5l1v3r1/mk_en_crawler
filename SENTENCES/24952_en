SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The opposition Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) lost four parliamentary members on Tuesday (March 31st).
Members of the Union of Free Democrats, a right-wing party -- formerly a faction within the UDF -- and the only representative of the Agrarian People's Union (ZNS), which represents farmers, decided to leave the UDF caucus rather than join a right-wing coalition combining the UDF and the Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria.
As a result, the UDF will shrink to 14 seats in parliament, making it the second largest opposition party, after the Bulgarian New Democracy.

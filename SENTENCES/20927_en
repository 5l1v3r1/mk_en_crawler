ANKARA, Turkey -- The military confirmed on Monday (February 4th) that air strikes were conducted against 70 suspected Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) targets in northern Iraq.
In a statement posted on the Turkish General Staff website, the military said that only PKK targets were hit and great care was taken to ensure the safety of civilians.
On Tuesday, members of the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) met in Diyarbakir to protest the air strikes.
DTP members say they will climb the Gabar and Cudi mountains -- an operational region being targeted -- to serve as human shields.

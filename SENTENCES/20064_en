TIRANA, Albania -- Economy, Trade and Energy Minister Genc Ruli said during a plenary session Monday (December 17th) that the energy situation in Albania has improved dramatically and that higher imports would result in fewer power cuts. 
But representatives of the opposition Socialist Party (SP) rejected that view, insisting the energy situation remains critical.
In other news Monday, the SP asked that Prime Minister Sali Berisha answer questions in plenary sessions this month related to corruption, pensions and identity cards. 
The SP says it wants to hear more about these "important issues".

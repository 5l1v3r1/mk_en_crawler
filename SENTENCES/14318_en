BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy called for a solution to the Kosovo status problem that would ensure stability and respect for minority rights and enable the return of Serbs to the province, during a visit to Serbia-Montenegro late last week.
Douste-Blazy visited Belgrade on Friday (9 December) and met with Serbia-Montenegrin counterpart Vuk Draskovic before traveling to Pristina on Saturday.
He and Draskovic also discussed the importance of full co-operation between Serbia-Montenegro and the UN war crimes tribunal.

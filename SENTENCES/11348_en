BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian government is returning the remains of 64 Kosovo Albanians to their families on Friday (27 May). 
Slobodan Milosevicâs security forces murdered the victims and then tried to cover up the evidence by taking the bodies to Serbia. 
They were later exhumed from a police training ground outside Belgrade. 
More than 800 bodies were found in mass graves in Serbia during 2001, with about 500 identified so far.
In other news, a UN official working in Kosovo has been charged with sexual abuse of minors and human trafficking, a UNMIK spokesman said Thursday. 
Rashidoon Khan, a Pakistani national employed by the UNHCR, was arrested earlier this year for unspecified crimes committed between September and December 2004.

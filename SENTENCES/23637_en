ZAGREB, Croatia -- Sea, Tourism, Transport and Development Minister Bozidar Kalmeta has submitted his resignation after Friday's train accident which killed six and injured at least 50 of the 91 people aboard.
The ministry's spokesperson, Marina Haluzan, announced on Saturday (July 25th) that Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor has not accepted the resignation.
Also Saturday, the state-run railway company denied that track conditions were to blame.
Local media speculated that this type of train, launched in Croatia in 2004, was involved in a similar accident in Germany, after which all such carriages were discontinued.
Experts have warned that Croatia's railway system is not suited for them.
A national day of mourning for the victims will be observed Monday.

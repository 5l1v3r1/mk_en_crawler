PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Outgoing Minister of Public Administration Edita Tahiri is calling on Kosovo Serbs to take part in the census scheduled for April 2011. 
At an informal meeting with NGOs and civil society representatives to discuss the headcount Wednesday (November 17th), Tahiri said the Serb community should be part of it since this is not a political issue. 
The head of Operations at the European Commission Liaison Office, Kjartan Bjornson, promised the census will be conducted in line with international standards. 
The last one was 30 years ago.

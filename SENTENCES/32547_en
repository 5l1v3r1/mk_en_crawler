BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Foreign Minister Laszlo Kovacs says Hungary will likely provide military equipment to Turkey to help it defend its borders in case of war in Iraq.
The defence ministry will vote Monday (10 March) to formally approve the NATO request and determine how many weapons it could provide.
At the end of February, the Hungarian government authorised US troops and equipment to pass through its territory in preparation for a possible war.

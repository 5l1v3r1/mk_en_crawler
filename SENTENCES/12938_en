SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Four candidates are being considered to succeed Interior Ministry Chief Secretary Boyko Borisov, according to Interior Minister Georgi Petkanov.
Borisov is one of the country's most popular public figures, with an approval rating above 70 per cent.
However, he must step down in line with his nomination for parliament by the ruling party NMS-II.
Speaking Friday (29 April), Petkanov added that there is one favourite for the chief secretary post, but declined to elaborate.
The replacement may be temporary, however, since Borisov has said he may return to the job after the elections.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The finance ministry and the central bank agreed Wednesday (28 January) to pass a law cutting four zeros from the national currency. 
Finance Minister Mihai Tanasescu said the draft law will be ready in two weeks but will most likely take effect in spring of next year. 
According to the latest exchange rate quotes, one euro equals slightly more than 40,000 Romanian leu. 
After re-denomination, one euro will cost between four and five leu, placing Romania's currency roughly on par with the Polish zloty.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Representatives of Proxima, the EU police mission to Macedonia, noted several flaws Wednesday (24 March) in the criminal code, as well as in laws relating to internal affairs and the work of the police. 
According to Proxima, legislation against human trafficking is inefficient and should be amended. 
The EU experts also recommended better guidelines concerning co-operation between police, the other security services and counter-intelligence. 
Proxima also suggested police receive regular weapons training and more modern equipment.

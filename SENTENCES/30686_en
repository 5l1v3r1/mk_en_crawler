ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor reiterated on Wednesday (April 6th) that June remains the target date for completing EU accession talks. 
She added that calling parliamentary elections right now, as requested by the opposition, would mean prolonging negotiations with the bloc. 
On the eve of a visit by European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso and EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele to Zagreb, the government adopted the first report on meeting benchmarks needed for the provisional closure of Chapter 23 on Judiciary and Fundamental Rights. 
The report was in response to EC demands that Croatian authorities show more determination to achieve requirements needed for closing the chapter. 
The next report assessing Croatia's performance in the area will be approved by the end of April.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The UN Security Council is scheduled to discuss UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's quarterly report on Kosovo on Friday (November 12th).
One of the conclusions in the report concerns northern Kosovo, where the situation remains unstable and tense after the International Court of Justice's opinion on the legality of the country's independence.
According to the document, UNMIK continues to encourage parties to refrain from violence.
Through UNMIK's facilitation, Belgrade and Pristina have continued their co-operation on missing persons, mediated by the International Red Cross.
However, the issue of missing persons remains a key challenge in reconciling various communities and continues to hinder the process of returnees, the document noted.
A report by former EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon is added as a separate chapter, covering the rule of law between July and October.

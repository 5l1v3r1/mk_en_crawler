PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The situation in the major cities of Kosovo is generally calm, UNMIK spokesman Derek Chappell said Friday morning (19 March), though Reuters reports that about 300 French troops and gendarmes with KFOR raided Albanian apartment blocks in the flashpoint city of Mitrovica on Friday after apparently coming under fire from the location.
Heavily armed troops began raiding three buildings and setting up rooftop gun positions.
Two days of violence across the province claimed the lives of 31 people and left more than 500 injured
NATO has decided to send 1,000 more troops to Kosovo.
There were reports of exchanges of fire between the peacekeepers and demonstrators in Lipljan.
NATO's commander for Southeast Europe, Admiral Gregory G. Johnson, said the pattern of events suggested that the ethnic violence may have been organised.
The United States, meanwhile, temporarily closed its embassy in Belgrade as a security precaution.
Meeting in New York, the UN Security Council issued a statement saying "the establishment of a multiethnic, tolerant, democratic society in a stable Kosovo remains the fundamental objective of the international community." (AFP, Reuters - 19/03/04;

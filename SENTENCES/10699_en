BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Chamber of Deputies adopted new laws Tuesday (7 September) on electing members of the two parliamentary houses. 
The opposition National Liberal Party and Democratic Party did not support the amended bills, rejecting a provision allowing the president to run on a party list for a parliamentary seat before completing his term. 
The parties said they would bring the issue before the Constitutional Court if President Ion Iliescu signs the new legislation.
In other news Tuesday, UNICEF and the EU urged the Romanian government to adopt measures against discrimination in schools. 
UNICEF complained that only 60 per cent of children with AIDS complete their education, due to prejudice from teachers and classmates' parents.

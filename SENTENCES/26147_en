TIRANA, Albania -- Mayors and senior municipal officials in the opposition Socialist Party (SP) protested outside Prime Minister Sali Berisha's office Sunday (November 15th), citing government threats to reduce the authority of local leaders.
SP leader Edi Rama, who is also the mayor of Tirana, slammed Berisha for "systematically striking" local leaders by interfering with their competencies.
He invited all Albanians to sign a petition urging Berisha to stop his "anti-democratic, anti-constitutional and anti-legal policies".
Rama also announced a series of conditions the government must meet by December 5th, or face more radical protests.

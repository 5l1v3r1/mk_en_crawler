BELGRADE, Serbia -- Government official Slobodan Homen announced on Tuesday (April 14th) that Serbia has asked Italy to extradite Goran Davidovic, a neo-Nazi leader sentenced to prison by Belgrade, who managed to escape the country. 
A court found that Davidovic incited national, ethnic and religious hatred at an anti-fascist rally in Belgrade in 2005 and harassed participants in it. 
Serbia issued an arrest warrant for him after he failed to begin serving his one-year prison sentence.

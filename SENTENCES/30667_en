TIRANA, Albania -- Water finally receded from homes in Shkodra on Sunday (December 12th) after days of severe flooding.
Efforts are now under way to determine the extent of damage to foundations and the cost of repairs.
Most people would rely on government compensation to rebuild.
Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli visited with families who have spent the past several days in shelters to discuss their living conditions.
Meanwhile, the opposition Socialist Party is accusing the government of downplaying the full extent of the damage caused by the floods.
According to the party, the agriculture sector has suffered losses of about 71m euros.
Floods hit the region late last month, forcing thousands of people out of their homes and leaving thousands of hectares of land under water.

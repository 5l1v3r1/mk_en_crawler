BUCHAREST, Romania --President Traian Basescu on Wednesday (22 December) officially named National Liberal Party (PNL) leader Calin Popescu Tariceanu as Prime Minister-designate, giving him a mandate to form a new cabinet.
Tariceanu now has ten days to do so.
It is still not clear whether the PNL and Basescu's Democratic Party, which have received promises of support from the ethnic Hungarian UDMR party, have managed to obtain the necessary parliamentary majority.
The Social Democrats (PSD), who won the most seats in parliament, have also reportedly been conducting negotiations on a possible coalition government.
Adrian Nastase, the PSD's candidate in the presidential vote, officially resigned as prime minister Tuesday to become speaker of the chamber of deputies.

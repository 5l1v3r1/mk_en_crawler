SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The minor ruling coalition ally, the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA), has decided to leave the government, deputy party leader Menduh Thaci announced on Saturday (May 26th). 
He said the level of dialogue within the ruling coalition has been low and that the ruling VMRO-DPMNE party has not fulfilled pledges it made to DPA about the rights of ethnic Albanians.
The DPA's announcement came a week after another ethnic Albanian party, the Party of Democratic Prosperity, announced that it would join the government. 
Meanwhile, VMRO-DPMNE and the largest ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic Party for Integration, have said they were about to reach an agreement. 
Thaci acknowledged DPA's decision is due in part to these developments.

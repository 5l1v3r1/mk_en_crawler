SKOPJE, Macedonia -- European Parliament member Doris Pack says the boycotts by opposition parties in Macedonia and Albania put into question their countries' ability to meet EU standards of democracy, local media reported on Thursday (February 3rd).
She said that a lawmaker's place is in parliament, where he or she should defend positions.
She specifically urged the Macedonian opposition led by the SDSM to return to work.
Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Zoran Stavrevski said on Thursday that the ruling VMRO-DPMNE is not considering early elections.
The junior ruling coalition partner Democratic Union for Integration took a more middle ground, saying political dialogue should resume and the opposition should return to parliament before any discussion about early elections.

THESSALONIKI, Greece -- The situation is returning to normal following clashes Saturday (21 June) between police and 200 self-styled anarchists who smashed shop and caf√© windows. 
They also set ablaze a McDonald's and a Goody's fast food restaurant. 
The anarchists were part of a larger group of about 25,000 protesters who marched through the centre of the city, west of the site of the EU summit. 
At least 19 arrests were reported, while 50 people sought medical help.

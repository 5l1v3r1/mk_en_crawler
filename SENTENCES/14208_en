PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- President Ibrahim Rugova announced on Tuesday (13 September) that he would lead the Kosovo team in anticipated negotiations on the province's final status.
Rugova, who recently confirmed he has lung cancer, also presented his team, which includes Prime Minister Barjam Kosumi, Parliament Speaker Nedzat Daci and the leaders of the two largest Kosovo Albanian opposition parties -- Hashim Thaci of the Democratic Party of Kosovo and Veton Suroi of ORA.
Later Tuesday, the leader of the Serb Ticket for Kosovo and Metohija, Oliver Ivanovic, told the Beta news agency that since Rugova's team is composed solely of Albanians, Kosovo Serbs would insist on forming their own team in potential negotiations.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Defence Minister Lazar Elenovski said Tuesday (March 27th) he is confident the country would receive an invitation to join NATO next year. 
He made the statement during a visit to Tetovo barracks, where he observed preparations by soldiers that are about to join the country's peacekeeping contingent in Afghanistan.
In related news, US Undersecretary for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns told radio Deutsche Welle that the United States would like to extend the same level of support to Macedonia and Albania regarding their NATO bids as it has to Croatia, but the two countries must deserve it. 
While he did not elaborate, a Macedonian diplomat says it suggests the countries need to step up reforms.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Launching a two-day visit to Mostar Tuesday (27 January), the international community's High Representative to BiH, Paddy Ashdown, said he might impose a decision on the status of the city Wednesday. 
He added that his decision would depend on the results of his meeting with leaders of the political powers involved in the process of reorganising the ethnically divided town. 
Noting that the deadline for reaching consensus is expiring, Ashdown said he would not tolerate more delays in efforts to get BiH, including Mostar, on the road to EU integration.

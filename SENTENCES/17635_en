ZAGREB, Croatia -- US Ambassador to Zagreb Robert Bradtke denied on Tuesday (March 27th) media allegations that a former Yugoslav army general, Veljko Kadijevic, who is sought by Croatian prosecutors for war crimes, was an adviser to the US-led coalition in Iraq. 
Kadijevic, 82, made the claim in an online interview published at the weekend. 
Bradtke explicitly rejected it.
Last week, the Croatian government issued an international arrest warrant for Kadijevic, whose whereabouts are unknown. 
He is charged along with nine other people in connection with war crimes in Vukovar between 1991 and 1995.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat met on Wednesday (January 28th) to discuss several thorny issues related to property, as part of reunification talks between the two communities on the divided island. 
The property dispute affects thousands of Cypriots who stake a claim on houses, hotels and businesses seized by Turkish forces during the 1974 hostilities, which left the Mediterranean island divided. 
UN Special Envoy Taye-Brook Zerihoun said after the meeting that the two officials exchanged papers containing their views on ways to resolve the issue and will meet again next week to discuss their reactions. 
Christofias describes the property issue as one of the most complicated topics in the negotiations.

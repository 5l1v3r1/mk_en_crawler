BELGRADE, Serbia -- US Ambassador to Belgrade Michael Polt said on Tuesday (June 26th) that a compromise solution for Kosovo's future status has already been found. 
That solution, he said, comes in the form of supervised independence, as proposed by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari, complete with monitoring by the international community. 
Belgrade, with backing from Moscow, has been urging continued talks aimed at reaching a compromise palatable to both sides.
Polt also urged Serbia to view its past with a critical eye, and not to allow its failures to limit its future. 
"Do this now, so that Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic move away from your lives and surrender in the hands of justice. 
Let Kosovo go," the US envoy said.

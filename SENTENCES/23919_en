BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prosecutors from the National Anti-Corruption Directorate on Tuesday (January 20th) indicted former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase and five others on corruption charges. 
They allegedly siphoned state funds -- as much as 1.55m euros -- to finance Nastase's 2004 presidential campaign. 
Previous attempts to prosecute Nastase for corruption failed, as they failed to gain parliament's approval. 
This time, prosecutors do not need parliamentary backing, as the allegations stem from a time when Nastase was not a cabinet member.

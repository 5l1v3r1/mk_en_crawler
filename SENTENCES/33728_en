ZAGREB, Croatia -- Investigators from the UN war crimes tribunal interrogated retired Croatian General Mirko Norac on Monday (1 September), in connection with two incidents in which at least 150 ethnic Serb civilians were executed.
In March, a local court sentenced Norac to 12 years in prison for the deaths of 50 Serbs in Gospic in 1991.
Now UN investigators want to know more about his involvement as a senior officer in the "Storm" operation in 1995, when more than 100 Serbs were killed and thousands of others were forced to leave the so-called Medak Pocket.

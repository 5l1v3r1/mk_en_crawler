THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte asked the war crimes tribunal on Wednesday (20 July) to allow the prosecution to present 49 documents and question six new witnesses in the case against former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. 
The new evidence will include a video from 1995 showing Serbian paramilitaries executing Muslims in Srebrenica. 
Del Ponte said the move would add just six days to Milosevic's trial. 
Prosecutors wrapped up their case in February 2004, sending the case on to the defence phase.

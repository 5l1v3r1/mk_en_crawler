NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council voted unanimously on Friday (11 July) to extend the mandate of the NATO-led peacekeepers in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) by 12 months. 
In a resolution, the 15 Council members reminded nations of their obligation to turn war crimes suspects over to the international tribunal in The Hague and to assist international prosecutors in their investigations. 
SFOR was established in 1996 under the framework of the Dayton Peace Agreement that put an end to the BiH conflict. 
The Council also underlined its full support for the continued role of the international community's High Representative in BiH in monitoring the implementation of the peace deal.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Clifford Bond told the SRNA news agency that Washington wants top war crimes suspects Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic to be arrested by June. 
Bond specified that the two should be arrested before the NATO summit in Istanbul so neither BiH nor Serbia-Montenegro are thwarted from joining the Partnership for Peace programme.
In other news, Branko Stevic, a lawyer and deputy mayor of Bijeljina Municipality, was formally nominated to the post of BiH's first state defence minister. 
His nomination and that of the deputy defence ministers must be approved by international community High Representative Paddy Ashdown before being sent to parliament for approval.

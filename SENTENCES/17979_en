SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The latest round of talks on the crucial issue of police reforms, attended by leaders of the main political parties in Sarajevo on Tuesday (February 20th), failed again to result in any agreement.
Republika Srspka (RS) continues to insist on retaining the entity police forces.
Principal Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian is proposing the establishment of five police regions in RS and five or more in the Federation of BiH.
Gregorian also proposed that a six-member ministerial council be formed to handle appointing police agencies' chiefs and police budgets.
Unless the parties reach an agreement by March 2nd, the signing of Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU will be postponed until next year.

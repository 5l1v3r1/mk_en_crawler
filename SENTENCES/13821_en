ZAGREB, Croatia -- The international community has called on Croatian authorities to take immediate action to prevent a Serb returnee from losing his home.
In a press statement Friday (16 December), the OSCE, the European Commission and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees voiced their strong concern about a local court's ruling concerning the home of returnee Stevo Zabrdac.
The court decided to put up the home for auction because Zabrdac could not pay compensation to the former temporary occupant for investments made in the property.
In their statement, the international organisations called for 24 similar cases to be settled and for legal adjustments to be made in order to prevent such situations in the future.

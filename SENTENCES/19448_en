SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The EU strongly encourages the Greek and Macedonian governments to continue talks aimed at resolving their longstanding name dispute, Erwan Fouere, head of the European Commission's delegation to Macedonia, said on Thursday (March 27th). 
He added that the EU is making every effort to find a mutually acceptable solution. 
Fouere met with Ali Ahmeti, leader of the Democratic Union of Integration, the largest ethnic Albanian party in Macedonia.
Separately Thursday, Macedonia's representative in the talks, Nikola Dimitrov, returned to Skopje to brief officials behind closed doors on the latest round in New York, involving the most recent proposal by UN mediator Matthew Nimetz.
Meanwhile, Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis again warned Macedonia that "without a mutually acceptable solution on the name dispute, FYROM's way to membership in NATO will be closed." Skopje hopes to receive an invitation at the Alliance's summit in Bucharest next week, something NATO member Greece can veto.

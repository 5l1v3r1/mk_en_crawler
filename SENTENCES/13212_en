BUCHAREST, Romania -- One person died after heavy floods again hit Romania, bringing the death toll to seven in the past days.
According to local authorities, at least one person was killed Friday (23 September) in the southern village of Barbulesti and hundreds had to be evacuated from the area.
The latest flooding came as the Romanian government's national emergency committee decided to allocate extra humanitarian assistance to the counties that have been worst hit by the ongoing disaster.
The government also endorsed a decision to give up to 9,000 euros in aid to the families of flood victims.
In neighbouring Bulgaria, the emergency situation is still continuing in several municipalities, following torrential rains that lasted almost the whole week.
According to the latest reports, the situation in the northern Bulgarian coastal town of Shabla, hit Thursday by an up to 4-metre wave, is gradually beginning to normalise.
Electricity and water supply has been restored and the local authorities have started reviewing the damage.

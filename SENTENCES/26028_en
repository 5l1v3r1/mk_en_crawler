BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu on Thursday (December 17th) chose Emil Boc as the new prime minister-designate.
Boc is currently heading the outgoing cabinet, after losing a vote of no confidence in parliament last month.
Basescu noted that this would be considered a Liberal Democratic Party (PDL)-led cabinet, with the participation of the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians.
By law, Boc has one week to present his proposed cabinet.
Basescu wants the new government at work by the end of the year.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Federal Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic said on Wednesday (28 September) that his country will end up in a precarious situation if it fails to arrest Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic soon.
Referring to a meeting with US Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns, Draskovic said he was told that continued freedom for Mladic, one of the UN war crimes tribunal's most wanted indictees, would become an increasingly large obstacle to Belgrade's attempt to emerge from international isolation.
Draskovic mentioned 20 November, the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Dayton Accords, as one possible deadline.
In other news Wednesday, former Serbian Justice Minister Vladan Batic was arrested for suspected abuse of office.
He reportedly intervened to free Nenad Jovanovic, a member of a criminal gang, from custody during the state of emergency imposed after Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's assassination in March 2003.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic announced on Tuesday (May 10th) that authorities will undertake a series of strict measures to stop abuses of the EU visa-free regime.
After a meeting with interior ministry and police officials, Dacic said that measures will include the introduction of a database of bogus asylum applicants that will be created with the help of affected EU member states.
Another measure could be to deprive people who have abused the visa-free regime of their passports for a certain period of time, and to make organising illegal migration a criminal act.

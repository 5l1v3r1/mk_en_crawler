STRASBOURG, France -- The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted a report on Albania Thursday (January 25th).
It welcomed progress achieved so far, but urged continued monitoring of reforms, particularly in the areas of electoral legislation, administration and local government reform, judicial reform, combating corruption and organised crime, prevention of torture and respect for minority and children's rights.
It also reiterated that next month's local elections would be a test of the local authorities' ability to organise a free and fair vote.

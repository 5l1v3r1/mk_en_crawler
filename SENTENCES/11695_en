SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The UN envoy tasked with the Greece-Macedonia name dispute, US Ambassador Matthew Nimitz, received Macedonia's official proposal for solving the 12-year disagreement on Thursday (19 May).
Nimitz met with Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski, Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski and Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva in Skopje.
The official proposal is the well-known dual formula approach, in which the Republic of Macedonia would keep its constitutional name in international organisations, but use the name "Republic of Macedonia -- Skopje" in bilateral dealings with Greece.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Progress made in talks to reunify the divided island will not be lost, UN envoy Alexander Downer said on Monday (May 3rd) after his first meeting with newly elected Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu. 
According to Downer, Eroglu, who won the April 18th elections in the north, promised to continue what predecessor Mehmet Ali Talat had started. 
Greek Cypriots had feared hardliner Eroglu's election could put up serious roadblocks in the effort. 
At his meeting with Downer, however, Eroglu said he would be happy to proceed based on what has been already agreed. 
Talks are expected to resume later this month or in June. 
Downer meets with Cypriot President Demetris Christofias on Tuesday.

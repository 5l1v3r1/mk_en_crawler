SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov gave the mandate for forming the new government to Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) leader Sergey Stanishev on Monday (18 July). 
By law, the prime minister-designate now has seven days to present the new cabinet. 
The BSP won the most votes in the 25 June parliamentary elections, but needs allies to obtain a stable parliamentary majority.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament approved another reform related to Turkey's EU accession process on Wednesday (February 20th). 
Article 68 of a bill returning property confiscated from non-Muslim minority foundations, was finally adopted despite strong opposition from the nationalist and secular members of parliament. 
The measure is regarded by the EU as essential to Turkey's bid to meet standards for minority rights.

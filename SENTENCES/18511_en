VIENNA, Austria -- Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader praised the OSCE's role in the post-war recovery and transformation of his country, during a speech to the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna on Tuesday (July 10th). 
"Co-operation with the OSCE was extremely important and helpful in institution building, in dealing with transition issues and in enhancing the democratic environment," he said. 
Sanader said he backed a recent proposal by OSCE's chairman-in-office, Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos, to close down the organisation's mission in Croatia by the end of this year.

ATHENS, Greece -- Greece will make minimum cuts in defence spending next year, Minister of Defence Yiannos Papantoniou said Wednesday (20 November) after a meeting with Prime Minister Costas Simitis. 
Papantoniou stressed the need for modern military equipment, adding that the armament programme adopted in 2001 would be completed despite cuts in the military budget for 2001 and 2002. 
He wants Athens to decrease its contribution to NATO's common budget, since it has already reached its spending limit. 
Most of the funds went to protecting Greece's eastern border.

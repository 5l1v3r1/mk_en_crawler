ZAGREB, Croatia -- A two-day police operation aimed at locating the so-called "artillery diaries", documents related to 1995's Operation Storm, resulted on Thursday (December 10th) in the finding of more that 10,000 classified documents and maps.
Police raided 20 houses and interrogated 25 people.
UN war crimes tribunal prosecutors at The Hague want to use the "diaries" in trials involving a handful of retired generals.

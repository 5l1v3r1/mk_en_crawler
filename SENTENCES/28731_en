BUCHAREST, Romania -- After meeting with an IMF mission Sunday (May 9th), Finance Minister Sebastian Vladescu confirmed previously-announced cuts of 25% in public sector wages, and a 15% cut in pensions and unemployment benefits.
The measures were first announced by President Traian Basescu on Thursday, but the IMF wanted to ensure strict implementation.
Basescu says that if these measures are not imposed, Romania would likely have to negotiate a new loan from international financial institutions, after its current 20 billion-euro agreement -- 13 billion from the IMF and 6 billion from the EU -- expires next year.
As for the budget deficit target, the figure is 6.8% of GDP.
Jeffrey Franks, head of the IMF's mission to Romania, said the Fund will release its next loan instalment of 850m euros only after the government implements planned spending cuts.

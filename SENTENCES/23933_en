ATHENS, Greece -- Athens and Nicosia have reacted sharply to Turkey's decision authorising the Turkish Petroleum Corporation to launch an oil exploration project in the Mediterranean Sea, Greek media reported on Monday (July 20th). 
Last week, Ankara announced that a Turkish vessel will start exploring hydrocarbon resources in four areas off the coast of Cyprus. 
Officials in Athens and Nicosia say the move is designed to counter a similar project by the Greek Cypriot administration. 
In May, the Cypriot government announced plans to hire a US company to start oil exploration in its exclusive economic zone in the Mediterranean.

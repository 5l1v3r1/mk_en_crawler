ANKARA, Turkey -- Israel announced on Sunday (June 6th) it is banning its soldiers from travelling to Turkey amid tensions that followed Israel's deadly May 31st raid on a Turkish-led flotilla carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza. 
The ban applies particularly to reservist troops planning holidays in Turkey.
Meanwhile, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan reiterated on Sunday that Ankara will not stop working to make Israel lift its blockade on Gaza. 
He also urged Israel and the Palestinians to start serious peace talks.

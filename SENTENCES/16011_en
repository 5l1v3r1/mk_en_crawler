BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said on Monday (17 April) that a special commission must be formed in the Federation of BiH (FBiH) to establish the fate of Sarajevo Serbs missing since the BiH conflict, similar to the one formed in RS to investigate Srebrenica.
Dodik insisted that it is the responsibility of the FBiH government since RS authorities cannot oversee the other entity's internal affairs.
Separately, relatives of the missing Serbs again warned on Monday that they would stage protests in front of the Office of the High Representative in Sarajevo, if such an investigation commission were not formed.
They plan to approach the BiH Constitutional Court in an effort to force the FBiH cabinet to establish the panel.
In other news, Dodik said he has sacked Deputy Transport Minister Miroslav Cicic for suspected bribery.
He said a private carrier had complained that he had to pay a bribe in exchange for an international transport licence.

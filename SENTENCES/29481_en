BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Israeli Trade Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer secretly met with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu in Brussels on Wednesday (June 30th), the first high-level meeting since the killing of nine Turkish activists in an Israeli raid against a Gaza-bound aid flotilla in May. 
Reportedly, there were no substantial agreements during the talks and Turkey's demands for compensation and an apology, as well as for an international investigation, were not met. 
Israeli TV Channel 2 broke the news of the meeting, which was later confirmed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. 
Both sides say the other initiated the talks.

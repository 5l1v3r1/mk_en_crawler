ANKARA, Turkey -- Prosecutors on Tuesday (July 24th) ordered the release of a prominent Kurdish activist after she won a seat in parliament Sunday.
Sebahat Tuncel had been indicted on charges of belonging to the Kurdistan Workers' Party terrorist group.
She was released because the law grants her immunity from prosecution while she is a lawmaker.
The indictment could be re-issued when her term in parliament ends.
In other news, the leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) says he has no intention of stepping down, despite the shellacking CHP took in Sunday's election.
Deniz Baykal says he sees no reason to resign as party chief, even though some in the party have urged him to step down.

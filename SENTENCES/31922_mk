BRUSSELS, Belgium -- In a late change to their final statement on Friday (25 October) the 15 EU leaders announced support for the candidacies of Bulgaria and Romania for membership of the Union in 2007. 
They called the enlargement programme "irreversible" and assured the two countries that they would not be left out after the admission of 10 new members in 2004. 
Though no date was given for starting accession talks with Turkey, the leaders promised to issue detailed roadmaps to Bulgaria and Romania at the summit in Copenhagen in December and to provide the funding they need to join. 
An earlier version of the statement made no mention of a date. 
The two countries also hope to be invited to join NATO at the November summit in Prague.

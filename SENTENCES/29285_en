TIRANA, Albania -- The head of the State Police Hysni Burgaj is calling for heightened efforts to combat drug trafficking, saying the problem could block Albania's future prospects.
"A village or a municipality cannot keep the whole country and visa liberalisation as its hostage," Burgaj said Sunday (April 4th) during a speech near one of the biggest drug cultivation havens in Albania, the village of Lazarat.
He urged local police chiefs to identify cultivation parcels and intervene.
In the last month, police have seized hundreds of kilograms of drugs from Lazarat, with Greece and Italy as the apparent destinations.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The trial against two Syrian nationals, suspected of links to al-Qaeda and terror plots in Turkey, is scheduled to open in Istanbul on Monday (20 March), according to local media reports. 
Loa'i Mohammad Haj Bakr al-Saqa, 32, and Hamed Obysi, 21, were arrested in Turkey last summer after an alleged plot to attack Israeli cruise ships in the Mediterranean failed. 
Al-Saqa is also a main suspect in the 2003 suicide bombings in Istanbul that killed 58 people.

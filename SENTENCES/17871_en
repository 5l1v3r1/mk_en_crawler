BELGRADE, Serbia -- The OSCE Mission in Belgrade on Monday (April 16th) denounced the bombing of a journalist's home in Belgrade, describing the incident as an attack on freedom of expression.
Unknown assailants threw a hand grenade Saturday at the home of Dejan Anastasijevic, an investigative reporter covering organised crime.
It caused damage but no injuries.
OSCE Ambassador Hans Ola Urstad urged local authorities to arrest those responsible as soon as possible.
On Monday, members of the public put up roadblocks to protest the attack.

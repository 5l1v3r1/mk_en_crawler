SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonians celebrated the country's newly obtained EU candidate status Saturday (17 December) with a festival in downtown Skopje. 
Addressing his fellow citizens, President Branko Crvenkovski said Macedonia had obtained clear recognition of its progress and acknowledgment of its capacity for democracy. 
At the same time, he warned that the new status represents "an exclusive responsibility to continue with even greater commitment on the same road". 
Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski also stressed the importance of moving forward on the reform path.
EU leaders made the decision on Macedonia's status Friday, after hammering out a deal on the 25-member bloc's 2007-2013 budget. 
They agreed that Skopje has made substantial progress, but warned that the EU's absorption capacity will be taken into account when making a final decision on the country's bid. 
The actual accession talks are considered unlikely to start until after the EU holds a debate on its future enlargement, most likely in 2006.

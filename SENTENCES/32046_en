SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The UN mission on Thursday (17 October) fired 11 local police officers who frequented brothels and abused prostitutes. 
Some of them had extorted services from women at brothels they raided. 
"It is particularly appalling that these 11 ... 
were directly or indirectly condoning human trafficking.Some of them, in a particularly despicable way, undermined the relentless efforts of their colleagues ... 
by forewarning club owners of incoming raids," UN spokeswoman Kirsten Haupt said in comments on the officers' dismissal. 
The UN mission has fired more than 200 officers since it started a review of the local police force in 1999.

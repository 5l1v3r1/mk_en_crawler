TBILISI, Georgia -- Croatia and Georgia sealed two agreements Sunday (7 May) aimed at boosting bilateral ties, as part of a visit by Croatian President Stipe Mesic.
One of the accords regulates co-operation between the two countries' foreign ministries, while the other provides for collaboration in the area of EU integration.
Mesic and Georgian counterpart Mikheil Saakashvili noted that the two agreements were the first sealed since Croatia and Georgia established diplomatic ties in 1993 and that they demonstrate the strong mutual desire for co-operation.

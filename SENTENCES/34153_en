BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Belgrade must arrest fugitive war crimes suspect Gen Ratko Mladic if it is serious about eventually joining NATO, a US expert said Monday (14 July). 
Serbia-Montenegro won't be considered as an applicant for membership in the Alliance until it demonstrates full compliance with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, said Bruce Jackson, president of the US Committee on NATO, a Washington-based pro-expansion think tank. 
"There is frankly only one issue that remains outstanding, and that is Gen Mladic," he said. 
Jackson met Monday with Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic, who has repeatedly rejected UN prosecutors' claims that Mladic is hiding in Serbia.

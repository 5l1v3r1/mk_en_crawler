PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The next European Commission (EC) Progress Report on Kosovo could be more favourable if concrete achievements are made, EC official Domenica Bumma noted on Wednesday (June 9th). 
Speaking at the fifth Ministerial Council for European Integration, Bumma made clear that the 2010 Progress Report -- expected in October -- will not focus on draft laws or political plans. 
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci expressed confidence that there will be clear improvement in this year's progress report.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia will not require an international military presence next year, according to Parliament Speaker Nikola Popovski.
Visiting the headquarters of the EU military mission Concordia on Thursday (19 June), Popovski said he believes Macedonia will be fully capable of managing its own security, though a European police force might succeed Concordia.
In other news, A1 TV reported that pressure from the international community will prompt the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) to suspend its two-month boycott of parliament on Friday.
DPA members walked out in April, protesting what they described as slow implementation of the Ohrid peace accord.

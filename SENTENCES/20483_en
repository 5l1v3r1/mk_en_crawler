BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Police reform is a key requirement for the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU and without it, BiH will not initial the SAA this year, EU Commissioner for Enlargement Olli Rehn reiterated on Monday (September 10th). 
During a meeting with High Representative Miroslav Lajcak, Rehn stressed his full support for a police reform proposal presented by Lajcak to party leaders two weeks ago. 
He insisted BiH politicians should consider the draft and strike a compromise without delay.
The outcome "will be a clear indication of the political maturity of the country's leaders and their readiness to lead Bosnia and Herzegovina towards the European Union", Rehn said. 
Talks between Lajcak and EU security chief Javier Solana struck the same chord.

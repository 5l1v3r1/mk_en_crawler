BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government said Thursday (October 16th) that Serbia would start to unilaterally apply the interim trade agreement with the EU in 2009, as part of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA).
The agreement would gradually reduce customs rates for imports from the EU, Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic said.
He acknowledged the move "won't bring anything ground-breaking in terms of prices" for the public but will enable the country to "get accustomed to applying the agreement" and would boost investor confidence.
Djelic said with faster implementation of the accord, Serbia would shorten its path to the EU candidate status the country hopes to obtain in 2009.
The EU froze both the SAA and the interim trade agreement, pending full war crimes co-operation by Serbia.

HABUR, Turkey -- A concentration of Turkish armed forces was reported Sunday (29 December) near Habur, the only official border checkpoint on the Turkish-Iraqi border.
Between 80 and 90 armed vehicles reportedly arrived in the region Saturday and even more were seen Sunday.
In addition, local army regiments are building walls around a compound, most likely for use as a humanitarian centre.
Turkey fears a massive refugee influx, consisting mostly of Kurds, if a military operation takes place in the near future.
Local authorities have declined official comment.

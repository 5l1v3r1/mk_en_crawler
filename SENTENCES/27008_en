PRISTINA, Kosovo -- European Parliament (EP) Member Doris Pack is urging EULEX to invite the Kosovo government to sign a planned agreement on police co-operation between the EU mission and Belgrade, local media reported on Thursday (September 3rd). 
"If this does not happen, then we don't need this protocol, since without the Kosovo government the protocol is not valid," Pack said.
EULEX officials announced on Thursday that they are preparing two more agreements with Serbia in the field of justice and customs. 
Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci reiterated that only local institutions have the authority to sign regional agreements.

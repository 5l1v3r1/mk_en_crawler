PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- President Fatmir Sejdiu said Monday (June 4th) that Kosovo Albanian leaders have agreed to hold a contest for choosing new national symbols and anthems. 
Officials say the main criteria for these state symbols will be made public this week and would comply with UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's roadmap for Kosovo's future status.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Local Self-Government Minister Milan Markovic said on Tuesday (June 19th) that Serbia's next local elections will be held by the end of the year. 
He added that before setting an exact date, parliament should adopt the new laws on local self-government and local elections, by mid-October at the latest. 
Still unclear is whether mayors would be appointed by city assemblies or elected by direct vote.

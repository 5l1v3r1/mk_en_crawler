TIRANA, Albania -- Leaders of the Socialist Party (SP) officially decided on Saturday (October 17th) to boycott the November 15th local elections. 
The country's main opposition party has long insisted that the government and parliament approve its request to investigate what it describes as the "manipulated" June elections process. 
The November elections will be held in five areas to fill vacancies left after that June 28th vote.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- This year has been a failure for Macedonia regarding the country's strategic Euro-Atlantic goals, President Branko Crvenkovski said on Wednesday (December 19th) in his annual speech to parliament.
"Our goals this year were to obtain a date for starting EU accession talks and to implement all criteria, which would allow us to receive a NATO invitation.
Today, shortly before the end of this year, we have to acknowledge that the objectives we targeted have not been fulfilled," the president said.
He called for an end to political infighting, which he says has slowed reforms and damaged Macedonia's image abroad.
Crvenkovski also touched on the Kosovo status issue, stressing that Macedonia's interest lies in building good relations with both Pristina and Belgrade.

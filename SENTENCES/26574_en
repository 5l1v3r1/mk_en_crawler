BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina -- Republika Srpska's (RS) parliament approved on Wednesday (February 10th) a bill on referendums and initiatives.
The vote was 46 to 16.
Six lawmakers abstained.
Bosniak members boycotted the vote, insisting the bill violates both the constitution and the Dayton Peace Accords.
The new measure covers technical issues related to referendums, but does not specify which questions will be asked.
Lawmakers rejected changes proposed by the opposition regarding mandatory referendums in specific cases, such as joining military pacts or amending the constitution.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Incumbent Filip Vujanovic has a good chance of re-election in the first round of presidential elections next month, according a new poll by the Centre for Democratic and Human Rights (CEDEM) published on Tuesday (March 25th). 
The results suggest that Vujanovic, of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), would win 52.8% of the vote. 
None of the other three candidates would come close to that. 
Andrija Mandic of the Serbian List, is second with 19.1%, followed by Movement for Change leader Nebojsa Medojevic with 18.3% of voters. 
Socialist People's Party candidate Srdan Milic trails with 9.8%. 
The opposition parties say since the DPS ordered the poll, results were manipulated to favour Vujanovic, something the CEDEM, an NGO, denies. 
The election will take place on April 6th.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- All seven Croatians on board the hijacked merchant ship Benty are reportedly safe and in good health.
Liberian soldiers captured the ship Sunday (18 May), forcing the crew to take on board and transfer about 1,000 refugees to the Liberian capital of Monrovia.
Afterwards, the soldiers robbed the crew and left the ship.

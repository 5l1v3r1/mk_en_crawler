BELGRADE, Serbia -- Five people have been arrested for suspected involvement in firebombing the Greek Embassy in Belgrade late last month, police announced on Friday (September 4th). 
The suspects, four men and one woman, have been questioned over the incident in which two firebombs caused minor damage to the building. 
A group called Crni Ilija assumed responsibility shortly after the attack, claiming its actions were on behalf of its "friends in Greece and everywhere in the world". 
It demanded the release of a Greek national who was arrested in last year's Athens unrest, spurred by the killing of a 15-year-old boy by a police officer.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- In their closing statement in the so-called Tuzla Column trial on Monday (September 21st), war crimes prosecutors asked the court to convict and sentence Bosnian national Ilija Jurisic for crimes committed during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
Jurisic is accused of ordering an attack against a former Yugoslav National Army convoy in Tuzla in May 1992, which killed 92 soldiers and wounded 33. 
The trial began in February 2008. 
Prosecutors say Jurisic was responsible for the attack.

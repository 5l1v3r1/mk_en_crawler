BELGRADE, Serbia -- Former President Milan Milutinovic, who was acquitted last week by The Hague tribunal after six years in custody, arrived back in Belgrade late Friday (February 27th). 
The tribunal found he was not responsible for war crimes committed in Kosovo during the first half of 1999. 
"I am very happy to be back in Serbia. 
I feel a bit tired and my feelings are mixed," he told reporters at the airport. 
Milutinovic, 66, served as Serbian president from December 1997 to December 2002. 
A close ally of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, he surrendered to the UN tribunal in January 2003.

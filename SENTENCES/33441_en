BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic said on Wednesday (30 April) that authorities expect Russia to extradite Mirjana Markovic, wife of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, and Marko Milosevic, his son.
The Serbian Interior Ministry issued an international arrest warrant for Markovic, who is wanted for suspected involvement in the 2000 assassination of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic.
She went to Russia in late February, shortly before her immunity from prosecution as a member of the old federal assembly expired.
According to Russian media, she and her son have been staying in a private house in the Moscow suburb of Barviha.

ATHENS, Greece -- A devastating wildfire that raged for six days on the Greek island of Rhodes caused an ecological catastrophe and delivered a huge blow to the local tourism industry, Greek media reported on Sunday (July 27th). 
The blaze destroyed a major part of the island's wild forest, reducing more than 40,000 sq m of pine forest to ashes. 
Ecologists say the disaster has caused immense damage to the island's ecosystem. 
Hotels on the south of the island evacuated staff and guests for precautionary reasons. 
Authorities transferred about 3,000 tourists to the main city of Rhodes. 
Firefighters contained the blaze late Sunday.

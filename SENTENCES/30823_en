TRIPOLI, Libya -- A Turkish humanitarian ship rescued 250 wounded people from the rebel-held city of Misrata in Libya on Sunday (April 3rd). 
However, the vessel left behind thousands who had gathered, pleading to be evacuated. 
The ship arrived with cover from ten Turkish air force F-16s and two navy frigates. 
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu ordered the vessel to enter Misrata after it spent four days at sea waiting in vain for permission to dock.

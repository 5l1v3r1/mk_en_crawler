ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Zeljko Joksimovic and the Ad Hoc Orchestra of Serbia-Montenegro won second place in the Eurovision contest in Istanbul on Saturday (15 May).
Greece's Sakis Rouvas, the favourite for the top spot, took third place.
The winner of the night was Ukraine's Ruslana.
Turkey's youthful Athena band, which plays a mixture of ska and punk music, placed fourth.
Other Balkan nations that did well in the finals were Cyprus (fifth place), Albania (seventh place), Bosnia and Herzegovina (ninth), Croatia (13th), Macedonia (14th), and Romania (18th) out of 24 finalists.
In a sign that times are changing, Turkey gave its votes to the representative of former archrival Greece, while Croats voted for the entry from Serbia-Montenegro.

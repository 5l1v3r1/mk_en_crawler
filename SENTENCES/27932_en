LISBON, Portugal -- Turkish President Abdullah Gul on Saturday (November 20th) said he is pleased with the decisions made on the first day of NATO's summit in Lisbon, particularly concerning an agreement to build a missile defence shield over Europe. 
The agreement "was within the framework of what we wished", Gul told journalists in Lisbon.
Turkey, which has been fostering diplomatic and economic ties with Iran, is reluctant to see NATO name Tehran as a threat, and the document adopted in Lisbon does not explicitly mention any potential enemy. 
It envisions setting up a limited system of anti-missile interceptors and radar equipment that would include installations in Romania, Poland and possibly Turkey.

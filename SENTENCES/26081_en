BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu used his constitutional authority on Thursday (October 15th) to nominate Lucian Croitoru as prime minister-designate, rather than approve Klaus Johannis, the candidate nominated by a coalition of opposition parties. 
Johannis, the mayor of Sibiu, confirmed on Wednesday that he had accepted the nomination, proposed by the Social Democratic Party, the National Liberal Party, the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians and the Conservative Party, along with representatives of ethnic minorities. 
The parties had notified Basescu of their decision. 
But Basescu chose Croitoru, an adviser to the central bank governor and Romania's former representative to the IMF. 
Johannis' nomination would have sailed through parliament as parties supporting him control 65% of the seats there. 
Basescu concedes Croitoru's nomination will be a tough sell. 
Romania's minority government, led by Prime Minister Emil Boc, lost a no confidence vote in parliament Tuesday.

LUXEMBOURG -- The EU foreign ministers agreed on Tuesday (October 17th) to enhance the Union's role in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) after the office of the UN-appointed international high representative is closed and power is transferred to local authorities.
A report drafted by security chief Javier Solana and Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and approved by the Council of Ministers said the transition of power should be completed by the end of June 2007.
The EU will then increase its diplomatic presence in BiH and appoint a special representative to encourage police reform and guide the country towards meeting EU standards.
At the same time, the Union will continue to cut its military presence in BiH.

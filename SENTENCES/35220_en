SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Bulgarian government on Friday (20 February) sold the Bulgarian Telecommunications Company (BTC) to Viva Ventures, a subsidiary of US equity fund Advent International.
The deal was stalled for nearly two years by disputes and litigation.
Under the deal, the US investor will pay 230m euros for the stake and is committed to boost the company's capital with an additional 50m euros.
Viva Ventures also pledged to make a 700m euro investment in the upgrade of BTC's fixed-line network in the next five years as well as spend 45m euros on a social programme for the planned downsizing at the telecom.The new owner will receive a licence to develop a third GSM operator in the country.
Privatisation Agency chief Iliya Vasilev described the sale as the most important privatisation deal in Bulgaria's history.
However, the opposition in Sofia urged the government to stop the sale, arguing that BTC's assets are worth more than $1 billion.

NEW YORK, United States -- Democracy in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans remains strong, despite setbacks in some countries, the NGO Freedom House said in its annual report on civil freedom and political rights Monday (January 12th).
The report, which studies the level of freedom and democracy in 193 countries worldwide, qualified Albania as partly free, saying some laws adopted in the end of 2008 -- including the controversial new election code -- had negative consequences.
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) also made the list of partly free states, along with Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey, the last of which fell into this group despite keeping its status as an electoral democracy.
Macedonia received criticism for increased violence and threats against local politicians during last June's elections.
Croatia made the list of free countries, as did Serbia, which won praise for its progress in fighting corruption and improving co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal.
On the same list were EU members Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Greece, although the report outlined a negative trend in the state of democracy in Greece.
Bulgaria absorbed criticism for its inability to cope with corruption and organised crime but is still among the countries that respect civil rights.

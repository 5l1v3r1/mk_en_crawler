PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The judiciary is the weakest institution in Kosovo, the Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a report quoted by local media Wednesday (January 20th).
According to it, EULEX struggled last year to fully deploy throughout Kosovo and to execute its task of building a functioning justice system.
Despite optimism that the EULEX rule of law mission brought to Kosovo, the judicial branch remains the weakest institution, the HRW said.
Also, it said a lack of international consensus on Kosovo's status as a sovereign state continues to impede efforts to protect human rights.
The Roma, Ashkali, and Egyptian communities remain the most vulnerable groups, the report added.

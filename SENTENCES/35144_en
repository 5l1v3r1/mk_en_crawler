ATHENS, Greece -- The government is appealing for pubic support to make the August Olympics successful.
Deputy Culture Minister Fani Palli-Petralia urged citizens to help plant trees, fill in potholes, and paint buildings.
Amid concerns are a slump in tourism and that a spike in unemployment will follow the Olympics.
Labour Minister Panos Panayiotopoulos told reporters the government is developing plans to address the problem.
Hotel occupancy rates for the games are lagging, as are ticket sales.

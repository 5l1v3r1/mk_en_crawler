PRISTINA, Kosovo -- More than 200 officials have failed to declare their wealth to the Kosovo Anti-Corruption Agency, Kohavision TV reported on Sunday (April 17th).
The deadline to declare property was the end of March, said agency chief Hasan Preteni, adding that he had forwarded many cases to prosecutors.
"We will ask for legal sanctions for non-declaration of property or false statements," Preteni said.
He acknowledged public officials won't be obliged to declare assets until a number of laws are adopted, particularly anti-mafia measures and ones on property confiscation.
Preteni expressed concern about fast enrichment of officials, adding there are discrepancies between the property declared at the Central Election Commission and that declared at the agency.

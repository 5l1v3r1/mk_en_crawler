NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat is in Nicosia on Tuesday (13 April), seeking support from the two largest Greek Cypriot parties for the UN plan to reunify the island.
In a further setback to efforts to solve the 30-year-old problem, the powerful AKEL party called on Greek Cypriots to reject the deal at the referendum on 24 April.
The party wants the vote to be delayed by a few months to give politicians more time to turn public opinion around.
Latest polls suggest Greek Cypriots would reject the plan, while 59 per cent of Turkish Cypriots would support it.
If either side rejects the deal, only the Greek Cypriots will join the EU on 1 May.

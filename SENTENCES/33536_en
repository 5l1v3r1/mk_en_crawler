BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic on Sunday (21 September) praised government efforts to co-operate more fully with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
He said that co-operation is no longer a political issue, as the government has demonstrated its political will and is doing all it can to bring all indictees to justice. 
He added that current authorities are working to alleviate the task of successive governments. 
Asked about efforts to apprehend the UN court's most wanted indictees, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, the minister refused to provide specifics.

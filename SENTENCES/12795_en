BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu issued a statement Tuesday (4 January) saying the IMF has given its stamp of approval to his tax reform package.
The new Romanian government's first move was to put in place a flat rate of 16 per cent for income and corporate taxes.
Previously, personal income taxes had ranged from 18 per cent to 40 per cent, while corporate taxes were set at 25 per cent.
Also Tuesday, President Traian Basescu visited a series of Romanian security facilities and institutions.
He said the country's communications systems are fully compatible with NATO's, but urged that the Special Telecommunications Service be further modernised.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The leading ethnic Albanian party in the country, the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), plans to submit a proposal Tuesday (April 8th) to dissolve parliament and hold early elections.
"Macedonia is going through a very important period during which rational actions are necessary.
All that is happening, and in particular the need to settle the name dispute with Greece, as well as the country's NATO bid, require all state institutions to work with absolute devotion," DUI leader Ali Ahmeti said after meeting with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski.
On Monday, President Branko Crvenkovski spoke by phone with NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, about the conclusions drawn at last week's summit in Bucharest.
The unresolved name dispute between Skopje and Athens was the reason NATO opted against inviting Macedonia to join the Alliance.
De Hoop Scheffer told Crvenkovski that NATO members will automatically activate Macedonia's membership invitation as soon as the dispute with Greece is settled.

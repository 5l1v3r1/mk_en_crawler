ZAGREB, Croatia -- After winning a second term in Sunday's (16 January) runoff, Croatian President Stipe Mesic said Monday that he plans to initiate changes to the country's election laws as soon as possible.
Mesic said he is particularly determined to adjust legal provisions relating to expatriate voters.
Only those expatriates who pay taxes in Croatia should be allowed to participate in elections, he said.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu announced on Saturday (October 3rd) that he will seek another term in the November 22nd election.
"Yes, I will run," Basescu said during a visit to the town of Sannicolau Mare, in western Romania.
On Friday, Mircea Geoana, leader of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), announced his candidacy.
A day earlier, all PSD members in the cabinet resigned, following the sacking of fellow party member Dan Mica as interior minister.
Their decision led to the break-up of the ruling coalition between the PSD and Prime Minister Emil Boc's Democratic Liberal Party.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The country's most prominent human rights activist, Natasa Kandic, said on Tuesday (October 23rd) that Serbia's intelligence agency knows where war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic is hiding and is considering his arrest. 
According to Kandic, the Security Information Agency has precise information on the whereabouts of the former Bosnian Serb military leader, one of the four remaining indictees sought by the UN tribunal at The Hague.
While there was no official comment, Rasim Ljajic, head of the Serbian national council for ties with The Hague, said security forces searched military barracks and an army club in eastern Serbia on Tuesday.

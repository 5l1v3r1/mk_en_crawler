SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The IMF says Macedonia generally has managed to maintain macroeconomic stability, even in critical moments, over the past years but that the country should work harder to complete lagging structural reforms. 
IMF mission chief Franek Rozwadowski issued a statement to that effect Thursday (20 May), after two days of talks with the government focusing on performance under the current $28m stand-by arrangement with the Fund. 
They also discussed the possibility of signing a new agreement after this one expires in June.

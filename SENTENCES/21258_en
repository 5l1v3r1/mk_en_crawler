ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday (May 29th) that the EU is applying "double standards" in its membership talks with Turkey.
"The union requests Turkey to do things that have never been put on the table for other members or candidate countries, and we can see that double standards are imposed on Turkey," Erdogan told a press conference at the opening of the 19th general meeting of the European Foundation Centre in Istanbul.
At the same time, Erdogan reiterated Ankara's resolution to join the bloc.
In other news, Turkey's army announced new air strikes Thursday against 16 suspected bases of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in northern Iraq.
The military says it used precision in an effort to avoid civilian areas.

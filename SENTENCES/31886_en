THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A former Serbian intelligence officer who appeared before the UN tribunal on Tuesday (29 October) testified that Slobodan Milosevic controlled Croatian Serbs during the 1991-1995 war and blocked efforts to bring the conflict to an early end.
Slobodan Lazarevic, who served with the Yugoslav Army intelligence service for more than 30 years, testified that Croatian Serbs had acted upon Milosevic's explicit instructions and were supplied by the Yugoslav Army.

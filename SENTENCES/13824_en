ANKARA, Turkey -- A bomb exploded on a rail line as a train passed in the southeast province of Gaziantep on Friday (19 August), according to local authorities. 
The bomb, activated by a remote controlled device, caused damage but no injuries. 
Authorities blamed the outlawed separatist Kurdistan People's Party (PKK). 
The same day, Belgian authorities banned -- at Turkey's request -- a scheduled news conference in Brussels by PKK leader Zubeyir Aydar, who was to announce a one-month ceasefire in Turkey.

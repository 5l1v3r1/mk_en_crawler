PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier says relations between the UN mission and Pristina have improved, though differences remain on some issues, including "the strategy in the north", Zannier was quoted as saying on Sunday (April 18th), in an interview with the Belgrade based daily Politika.
Government spokesperson Memli Krasniqi, disagrees however, about the status of ties, saying "Relations between Kosovo institutions and UNMIK have neither improved nor worsened."
Zannier says UNMIK supports implementing the strategy in the Serb-dominated north through dialogue and by involving all concerned parties, adding that the rule of law is the key to improvements.
He believes conditions for dialogue will be more favourable after the International Court of Justice renders its opinion on the legality of Kosovo's unilaterally declared independence.

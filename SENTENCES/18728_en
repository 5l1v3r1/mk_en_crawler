ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police smashed a Croatian-Dutch drug trafficking gang, reportedly monitored since early June, when a 2.5- kilo heroin shipment was intercepted at the border with Slovenia. 
Vecernji List reported on Thursday (July 5th) that eight Croatians and two foreigners have been arrested. 
The latter reportedly bought the drugs in Rotterdam, while the Croats handled transportation and distribution.

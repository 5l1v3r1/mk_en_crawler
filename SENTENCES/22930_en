SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik met with High Representative Miroslav Lajcak on Sunday (May 4th) to discuss changes in the country's electoral legislation, including a proposal by the Srebrenica City Council to put the town under special status, outside the jurisdiction of RS.
Dodik said he opposed such a move.
He insisted all Srebrenica residents have the right to vote in local elections scheduled for this autumn.

TIRANA, Albania -- About 10,000 supporters of the opposition Socialist Party (SP) joined a peaceful rally in Tirana on Friday (January 28th) in memory of three demonstrators who were killed in violent clashes with police during an anti-government protest on January 21st.
SP leader Edi Rama, who led the 90 minute march down Tirana's main boulevard, urged supporters to remain calm and avoid provocations.
He vowed, however, to "continue our peaceful protest to call for the end of this regime [of Prime Minister Sali Berisha] and open a new chapter".

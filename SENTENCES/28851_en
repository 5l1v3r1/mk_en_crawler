SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The foreign ministry announced on Thursday (September 9th) that Somali pirates have freed a Bulgarian tanker hijacked in May with 15 Bulgarian crew members onboard.
The Panega, which was seized in the Gulf of Aden, is being towed eastward, out of Somali territorial waters, the ministry said.
All crew members are described as in good health.
The Panega is the only Bulgarian-flagged vessel hijacked by Somali pirates so far.

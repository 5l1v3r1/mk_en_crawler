ZADAR, Croatia -- Pope John Paul II will complete a taxing five-day visit to Croatia on Monday (9 June), celebrating Mass before an expected crowd of 100,000 worshipers in the coastal town of Zadar, where signs of lingering nationalism have resurfaced.
Prior to his arrival, officials rushed to remove posters expressing support for Ante Gotovina, the fugitive army general indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal.
Despite concerns about his health, the 83-year-old pontiff is still expected to visit Bosnia and Herzegovina later this month.
On Sunday, the pope met with Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan, who thanked him for his support of the country's bid for EU membership.
"His message and support in that sense is without reservation and is very precious to us," said Racan.

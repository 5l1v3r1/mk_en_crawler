BELGRADE, Serbia -- A nationalist SRS-DSS-NS-SPS ruling coalition is taking shape, Serbian Radical Party deputy leader Tomislav Nikolic said on Thursday (May 29th) after the latest round of negotiations.
He said there is an agreement in principle according to which the leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia, Vojislav Kostunica, would become prime minister.
As for his own future role, Nikolic said that he would become parliament speaker.
He added there would be "no rough or brutal annulment" of the recently signed Stabilisation and Association Agreement, though Kostunica -- for one -- has been a vocal critic of it.

ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Simitis presented the government's new plan for promoting development of specific domestic regions on Saturday (6 September). 
At the traditional dinner marking the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair, Simitis said the new policy would include all geographical regions, as they all offer significant potential for production and employment. 
Priority, however, would be given to the regions that lag behind in terms of EU living standards. 
The government plans to establish investor support centres in every prefect; five such centres are already in operation. 
It also plans to establish business and development centres around the country to co-ordinate and integrate regional initiatives.

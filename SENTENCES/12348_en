BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic was tapped on Thursday (7 July) to lead a state-level team during negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
Predrag Ivanovic, Serbia-Montenegro's international economic relations minister, and Rasim Ljajic, the state minister for human and minority rights, were also chosen as delegates.
The SAA has six parts, four of which will be negotiated with republican-level teams under the dual path (twin track) approach, while foreign affairs and defence and the harmonisation of legislation will be negotiated with the federal team led by Draskovic.

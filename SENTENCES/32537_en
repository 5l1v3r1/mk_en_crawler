TIRANA, Albania -- On Sunday (9 March), the government approved the deployment of military forces in case of operations against Iraq.
The United States would likely ask for auxiliary, probably logistical, support.
The decision was taken in the context of providing support to the anti-terrorism coalition.
The government said it was also ready to provide naval, land and airspace for a possible attack and to establish training facilities for the international coalition forces.

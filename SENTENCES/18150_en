BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader is in Belgium on Friday (December 15th), taking part in the summit of the European People's Party (EPP) in Meise. 
He also met with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso to discuss Croatia's EU membership perspectives. 
In his address at the EPP forum, Barroso reportedly described Croatia as the next country that would join the EU after Bulgaria and Romania. 
Sanader also held talks with other officials, including Slovene counterpart Janez Jansa, about Croatia's controversial decision to activate an Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone in the Adriatic.
In other news, the Appeals Chamber of UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague on Wednesday rejected Croatia's request for "friend of court" status in the trials of three Croatian Army generals -- Ante Gotovina, Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac. 
Croatia earlier lost a bid for such status in the trial of six wartime Bosnian Croat military officials and politicians. 
The court ruled then it would be inappropriate, and not in the interest of justice.

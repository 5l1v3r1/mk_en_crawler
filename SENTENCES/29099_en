ZAGREB, Croatia -- Authorities issued an international arrest warrant Friday (November 5th) for a businessman convicted of fraud. 
In September, a court in Zagreb upheld Miroslav Kutle's verdict and sentenced him to two years and eight months in prison for corruption, stemming from illegal privatisation deals that reportedly netted him millions of euros. 
Kutle, who also holds Bosnian citizenship, fled to neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina.

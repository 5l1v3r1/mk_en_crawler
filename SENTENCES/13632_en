ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian government endorsed draft changes in the law on state assistance on Friday (21 October) and forwarded them to parliament for adoption.
The amendments, aimed at bringing Croatian legislation in line with EU standards, envisage gradual reduction of the number of beneficiaries of state subsidies.
The only exceptions will be agriculture and forestry.
In other news, Croatian authorities announced Saturday that culling of poultry has started around the Zdenci fish pound in eastern Croatia after samples from dead swans in the area tested positive for avian flu.
Additional samples have been sent to Britain to establish whether it is the deadly H5N1 virus strain.
Results are expected early next week.

ATHENS, Greece -- Citizen Protection Minister Christos Papoutsis said on Tuesday (May 3rd) that Athens opposes any amendments to the current Schengen border treaty. 
His statement came amid demands by some countries to reintroduce border controls in the EU's border-free zone after Italy faced a wave of illegal immigrants from turmoil-hit North Africa. 
Italy issued temporary residence permits to many of the immigrants last month, allowing them to travel across Schengen. 
Paris opposed that move, as France is believed to be the ultimate destination for many of the immigrants. 
Athens, an entry point for thousands of illegal immigrants seeking better lives in the EU, insists that EU regulations -- stipulating that immigrants should be handled by the country in which they arrived -- should be changed. 
According to Greek authorities, that burden should be shared by all EU members.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- British Minister of State for the Armed Forces Adam Ingram reiterated on Wednesday (19 April) that BiH's bid for membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme depends primarily on the country's full co-operation with the UN tribunal.
Ingram visited Sarajevo as part of a regional tour.
Following a meeting with BiH Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic, Ingram stressed that BiH's Euro-Atlantic integration process would be speeded up if top fugitives Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic were arrested and handed over to The Hague.

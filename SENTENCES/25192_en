SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko said on Thursday (January 28th) that BiH should take advantage of this year's general elections to accelerate the EU integration process. 
After meeting with a European Parliament delegation in Sarajevo, Inzko said local political parties should concentrate on programmes related to EU topics instead of nationalistic rhetoric. 
He also criticised challenges to the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement while insisting that the main priority should be visa liberalisation.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Court issued a one-month detention measure Monday (21 November) for two terror suspects detained by Federation of BiH police last week. 
The two men, BiH citizens, are charged with committing a terrorist act and jeopardising people under international legal protection. 
Police say they are linked to the October arrests of two people accused of planning a terrorist act.

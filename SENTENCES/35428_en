SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Top international officials in BiH have jointly warned that the country risks losing its potential membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace programme and the EU, if reforms are not implemented. 
The warning came Thursday (12 February), during a meeting Principal Deputy High Representative Donald Hays and Senior Deputy High Representative Werner Wendt held with representatives of the BiH and Federation of BiH administrations. 
A similar meeting with Republika Srpska government representatives is expected shortly.
In other news, a spokesman for High Representative Paddy Ashdown called Thursday for urgent implementation of Ashdown's decision on the status of Mostar, warning a delay would mean a clear obstruction of law.
Also Thursday, BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic made it clear that he expects to receive formal nominations for the posts of state defence minister and deputy defence minister by Friday, so they can be appointed by the end of the month, with Ashdown's approval.

BOROVETS, Bulgaria -- A survey of Bulgarian Turk expatriates abroad suggests a lack of support for the current policies of the major minority party and junior government partner in Bulgaria, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms. 
During a meeting of expatriates' associations in Borovets on Monday (15 November), it was announced that 85 per cent of the respondents -- most of whom left Bulgaria following the so-called "Revival" process in the 1980s -- suggested they would seek an alternative party to back during the 2005 parliamentary elections.
Also Monday, Bulgaria's Supreme Administrative Court rejected a joint appeal submitted by ecological associations against government plans to build a second nuclear power plant in Belene. 
The Bulgarian NGO Ekoglasnost and the international organisation Greenpeace say they will continue to fight construction of the plant.

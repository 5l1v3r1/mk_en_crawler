TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi said on Wednesday (November 4th) that the beating of journalist and publisher Mero Baze is unacceptable in a democratic state. 
"There is no democracy without free media," Topi said, in response to Baze's beating Monday night at a Tirana bar. 
Oil entrepreneur Rezart Taci is believed to have orchestrated it, following a series of reports accusing him of corruption.
Also Wednesday, dozens of journalists and publishers protested outside Prime Minister Sali Berisha's office in Tirana. 
They accused Berisha of protecting Taci and threw shoes at the building. 
They also sarcastically announced a 10,000-euro reward for information on Taci's whereabouts. 
Police say he is at large and is being sought, while Taci maintains he is continuing his daily routine in plain view.

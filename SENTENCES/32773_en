SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria must intensify its fight against corruption and strengthen the rule of law in preparation for NATO membership, says US Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs Elizabeth Jones. 
She visited Sofia on Tuesday (10 December), meeting with President Georgi Parvanov and others. 
Foreign Minister Solomon Passy and Jones discussed Bulgaria's contribution to possible military action against Iraq.
In other news, Parvanov met Tuesday with World Nuclear Association (WNA) Director General John Ritch in Sofia. 
At issue, EU demands for the early closure of two reactors at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant. 
Ritch vowed that the WNA would support efforts to keep the reactors running, should inspections prove them safe.

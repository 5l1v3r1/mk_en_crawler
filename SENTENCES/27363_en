ATHENS, Greece -- Three members of a group of 25 Iranian asylum seekers who have been staging hunger strikes for 17 days were hospitalised in Athens on Saturday (October 30th).
The group launched the strike to protest procedural delays in responding to their asylum applications, setting up tents in front of the university building in downtown Athens.
The government promised on Saturday to speed up their applications, but the strikers said they would continue their action until their demands are met.

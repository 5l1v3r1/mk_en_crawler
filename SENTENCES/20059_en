TIRANA, Albania -- An electricity blackout left most of Albania in the dark for 45 minutes early Wednesday (January 16th).
A representative of the national grid operator, KESH, blamed it on a problem at a station in the south.
Albanian authorities have been forced to impose strict restrictions on the electricity supply due -- in part -- to a major drop in water levels in most local rivers last summer.
The country relies heavily on hydro-power.

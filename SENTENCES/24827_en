PRISTINA, Kosovo -- New video footage shot by Klan Kosova aired Wednesday night (June 3rd) and shows masked men swearing an oath to the rebel Albanian National Army.
The recruits vow to fight for the "unification of Albanian territories".
Other footage shows them armed and allegedly patrolling the border with Serbia, to defend ethnic Albanians from the "danger" in Serb-dominated northern Kosovo.
In other news Wednesday, police arrested three suspects in a theft that occurred at the police evidence room in Pristina in late April.
The suspects were arrested at the Hani and Elezit border crossing with Macedonia.
Stolen from the evidence room were 48kg of heroin, 4,000 euros and other valuables.

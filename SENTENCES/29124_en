ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou announced a sweeping government reshuffle early Tuesday (September 7th) in an effort to speed up economic recovery and within hours, the ministers had taken their oaths of office.
The newly expanded government has 48 members, including 17 ministers, compared to 36 in the previous one.
The move was announced the same day EU finance ministers are due to approve the next tranche of the 110 billion-euro EU/IMF aid package for Greece.
It also comes two months before the November 7th local elections, which are seen as a crucial test of the PASOK-led government one year after it came to power.

Former Economy Minister Louka Katseli takes over the labour portfolio, while Labour Minister Andreas Loverdos moves to head the health ministry.
Former Health Minister Mariliza Xenogiannakopoulou becomes deputy foreign minister.
Agriculture Minister Katerina Batzeli is replaced by Costas Skandalidis.
Police Minister Mihalis Chrysochoidis gets the economy portfolio.
Alternate Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas becomes foreign minister, a post Papandreou held.
The maritime affairs, islands and fisheries ministry is back in business, headed by Yiannis Diamantidis.
The new cabinet holds its first meeting later this week.

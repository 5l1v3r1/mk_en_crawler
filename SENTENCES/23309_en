ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament adopted a law Friday (June 26th) limiting the powers of military courts, in a bid to comply with related EU requirements, media reported.
The bill, proposed by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), paves the way for civilian courts to try military personnel in peace time for anti-government activities, threats to national security, constitutional violations and organised crime.
The law also transfers the power to try civilians in peace time for offenses currently under the military penal code.
The opposition criticised the bill saying it aims to "influence" ongoing probes into alleged plots to discredit or topple the AKP's government.
In other news Friday, General Kenan Evren, who led a military coup in 1980, said he would rather commit suicide than stand trial.
In an interview with the daily Hurriyet, Evren said this would be his choice if parliament adopts constitutional amendments proposed by the main opposition Republican People's Party.
Article 15 of the Turkish constitution prevents the 1980 coup leaders from ever going to trial over their actions.

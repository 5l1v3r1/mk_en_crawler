PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The second biggest opposition party, the Vetevendosje Movement, is accusing Prime Minister Hashim Thaci of "luxurious" governance and uncontrolled spending. 
Vetevendosje member Shpend Ahmeti said on Wednesday (May 11th) that the government has opted to spend money on unnecessary luxury instead of focusing on economic development. 
"The increase of the number of ministries puts Kosovo on the top list of the most inefficient countries in Europe. 
The prime minister's salary along with that of his six deputy prime ministers, 30 deputy ministers and 120 advisers alone carry an annual cost of more than 2m euros," Ahmeti said. 
Vetevendoje noted that Thaci had promised to cut expenditures.

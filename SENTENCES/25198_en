PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Kosovar Institute for Policy Research and Development (KIPRED) said in a report Wednesday (December 23rd) that the increased participation of Kosovo Serbs in local elections this year is a sign that their political behaviour has "softened". 
Serbs also returned to their most moderate political parties -- such as the Serb Liberal Party, Serb Progressive Party and Serb Democratic Party, according to the KIPRED. 
As for the future of the three newly established Serb-dominated municipalities, the institute said that Serbia's parallel structures remain a challenge to stability. 
The institute recommended that decentralisation should continue and that the international community should dissolve Serb parallel structures, while EULEX and the Kosovo Police should establish the rule of law in the north to overcome these challenges.

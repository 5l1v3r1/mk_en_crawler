SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH House of Representatives elected Ivo Miro Jovic as the new Croat member of the BiH tripartite presidency on Wednesday (4 May). 
Jovic was nominated by the country's leading Croat party, the Croatian Democratic Union. 
He is a member of the party's parliamentary caucus. 
Jovic takes over the position from Dragan Covic, who was sacked by High Representative Paddy Ashdown a month ago after being charged with embezzlement.

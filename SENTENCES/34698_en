SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Fires raged in the mountains of southern BiH on Tuesday (19 August). 
An estimated 2,700 hectares of forest have been destroyed in the last week alone. 
The fires have scorched a total of 6,000 hectares of land since June. 
The difficult terrain further complicates firefighting efforts.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic has asked the groups that backed Serb Radical Party (SRS) deputy leader Tomislav Nikolic for parliament speaker to let him know by Friday (May 11th) if they have agreed on a candidate for prime minister. 
The parliamentary parties involved are the SRS, the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS)-New Serbia (NS) coalition and the Socialist Party of Serbia. 
Tadic indicates that despite months of negotiations, no candidate proposed so far could secure the necessary majority. 
The deadline for electing a new government expires on Monday.
Separately, Mladjan Dinkic, the leader of G17 Plus, says his party would not participate in any negotiations on forming a new coalition government until Nikolic is replaced as speaker.

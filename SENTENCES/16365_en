ZAGREB, Croatia -- During a visit to Zagreb on Wednesday (12 April), European Parliament President Josep Borrell urged Croatia to prevent any form of discrimination against EU citizens attempting to buy or sell real estate in Croatia and to fully implement its commitments under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU. 
Borrell's call came two days after the EU Stabilisation and Association Council warned that Zagreb was not abiding by SAA terms requiring non-discriminatory treatment for those purchasing property.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- There will be no delay in paying the next tranche of Greece's massive bailout loan, EU Monetary and Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Wednesday (November 17th).
The decision to pay the third tranche of the 110 billion-euro loan that the European Commission, European Central Bank and IMF extended to Greece is due in December.
The actual transaction, however, will be made in January, Rehn explained.
His comments came after Austrian Finance Minister Joseph Proell said earlier on Wednesday that the eurozone member states have decided to postpone until January the payment of the tranche.
On Tuesday, Proell said Austria will not provide its 190m-euro share of the tranche, arguing Greece has failed to meet its obligations.

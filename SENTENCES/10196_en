SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The security situation in Macedonia is stable, Interior Minister Siljan Avramovski told RFE on Sunday (26 September).
He described the recent attacks on police members as the result of a stepped-up fight against crime groups.
Avramovski added that measures would be taken to ensure the November referendum on the new decentralisation laws is safe and democratic.
Meanwhile, the opposition ethnic Albanian Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDP) re-elected Abdulmenaf Bexheti as its leader on Saturday.
PDP has urged ethnic Albanians to boycott the referendum.

ATHENS, Greece -- Recep Tayyip Erdogan, leader of the new ruling party in Turkey, launched a tour of western European capitals Monday (18 November) to lobby for EU integration. 
His first stop was Greece. 
Athens will likely be the strongest opponent to opening EU negotiations with Turkey, now led by Erdogan's Islamic-rooted Justice and Development Party. 
After discussing bilateral issues, including Cyprus, with Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, Erdogan flew to Madrid where he met Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar. 
Afterwards, Erdogan said he was very optimistic that both Spain and Greece would support a possible start date for accession negotiations during next month's European Council of Ministers summit in Copenhagen. 
Erdogan added that Italy would likely support the notion as well, given prior conversations with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. 
But European Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen disagrees, telling the German daily Der Tagesspiegel that Turkey has not yet met the political criteria for EU membership.

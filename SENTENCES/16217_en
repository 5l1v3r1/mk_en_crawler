ANKARA, Turkey -- Alparslan Arslan, the main defendant in the 17 May attack on the Turkish Council of State, attempted to escape during the Friday (11 August) opening of the trial, according to media reports.
He reportedly tried to flee after the presiding judge rejected his request to attend the traditional Friday prayers, coinciding with the time of the court proceedings.
Authorities prevented the attempt.
In other news, six people were injured in an explosion near an internet cafe in Istanbul on Saturday, according to local media reports the next day.
According to police, the cause of the blast is still under investigation.
Media reports, however, said it was caused by a device put into a waste container in front of the cafe.

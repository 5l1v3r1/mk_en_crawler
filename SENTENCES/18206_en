NEW YORK, United States -- The United States and EU nations distributed their new draft resolution on Kosovo Friday (July 13th) among members of the UN Security Council. 
British UN Ambassador Karen Pierce says it will be debated on Monday.
On Friday, US Ambassador to the UN Zalmay Khalilzad urged Russia not to veto the draft resolution, which calls for the Security Council to take a decision if 120 days of new talks between Belgrade and Pristina fail to yield progress. 
Russia says this draft differs very little from previous versions and would again lead to implementation of former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for supervised independence. 
On Friday, Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Titov indicated Russia may skip Monday's debate.
In other news, Kosovo police officers came under fire Saturday when they went to investigate reports that uniformed men had been spotted in the northwestern village of Radisevo. 
The policemen returned fire but no injuries were reported.

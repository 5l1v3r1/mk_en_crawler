BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative to BiH Christian Schwarz-Schilling warned on Tuesday (15 August) that the Office of the High Representative (OHR) will not shut down next year, if a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between BiH and the EU is not signed.
During a visit to Banja Luka and meetings with Republika Srpska (RS) President Dragan Cavic and Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, Schwarz-Schilling said there must be progress in crucial police and constitutional reforms before steps to close the OHR and transform it into the EU Special Representative's office are made.
According to local media, however, Dodik reiterated on Tuesday that Bosnian Serb authorities would not allow the Bosnian Serb police force to be merged into a centralised national police force.
He insisted the entity force should remain a separate organisational unit with clear authority.
RS objections to police reform have been a major stumbling block in the SAA talks.

TIRANA, Albania -- A senior US official Monday (25 November) urged the Albanian government to push ahead with political and economic reforms if it wants to join NATO.
Assistant Secretary of State Elizabeth Jones told local leaders that the doors of the alliance remain open to new members, but the road to membership could be difficult and long.
Jones, who is in charge of European and Eurasian Affairs at the State Department, met President Alfred Moisiu and Prime Minister Fatos Nano.

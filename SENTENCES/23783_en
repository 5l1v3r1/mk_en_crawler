ANKARA, Turkey -- A day after it opened, the country's second Ergenekon trial was postponed on Tuesday (July 21st). 
The court decided to delay the second hearing until August 6th in light of a separate indictment filed against other defendants Monday. 
In Tuesday's proceedings, two retired generals -- Sener Eruygur and Hursit Tolon -- as well as 54 businessmen, journalists and lawyers are charged with organising and running a criminal network that plotted coups to overthrow the ruling Justice and Development Party government. 
This trial is separate from yet another one, involving a total of 86 defendants, which began in October.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) decided on Friday (July 25th) to release 66m euros from Croatia's pre-accession aid that were frozen due to concerns related to the fund management.
Croatia has made significant progress in improving its EU pre-accession aid administrative management capacity, an EC spokesperson told AFP.
The country hopes to wrap up its talks in 2009 and join the EU in 2010.

TIRANA, Albania -- Three Kosovo Albanians have been detained in Albania on international arrest warrants, a police spokeswoman announced Tuesday (8 June).
Florim Ejupi, 25, is wanted by UN police in Kosovo for the murders of 11 Serbs and a KFOR soldier in February 2001.
He had been on the run since escaping from prison.
The other two detainees -- Faik Shaqiri, 22, and Xhevat Kosuni, 36 -- are wanted in Germany for terrorism and murder.
Also Tuesday, the OSCE Presence in Albania and the Swedish International Development and Co-operation Agency signed a project agreement to build Civil Society Development Centres in Kukes and Korca.
That would make a total of six in the country.
Meanwhile, Albanian Defence Minister Pandeli Majko met with Dutch counterpart Henk Kamp in Tirana, seeking firm support for Albania's aspirations to join NATO.
Kamp praised the progress Albania has made in advancing relevant reforms.

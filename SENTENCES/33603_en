SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia has asked the EU to provide help in reforming its police force, international media reported on Monday (15 September). 
The government has drawn up a plan for EU experts to be sent to the interior ministry and a number of police stations in the north of the country. 
Their job would be to enhance the efficiency of the Macedonian police in dealing with militants and organised crime groups and to show them how to improve their image with the local ethnic Albanian population. 
The experts are expected to arrive in January after the departure of the 400-strong EU mission.
In other news, UEFA, European football's governing body, is expected to punish Macedonia for failing to control its fans in a recent match with England. 
Some spectators chanted racist slogans during the match, which England won 2-1.

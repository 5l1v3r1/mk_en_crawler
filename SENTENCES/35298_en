LOS ANGELES, United States -- Runners are passing the Olympic Flame across the United States.
The first stop on Wednesday (16 June) was Los Angeles, where actor Sylvester Stallone described carrying it as "the most important moment of my life".
It went next to St. Louis, and will arrive Saturday in New York.
A reception is planned there in the city's Greek quarter.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has criticised the pace of ongoing talks to reunify the divided island of Cyprus, warning negotiations could suffer a major setback if no agreement is reached by the second quarter of next year. 
In a report to the UN Security Council -- quoted by media on Thursday (November 25th) -- he says that negotiations can not last forever. 
Ban urges the two sides to seize the opportunity and reach a deal before elections in Turkey and Cyprus due in mid-2011. 
"I fear a critical window of opportunity is rapidly closing â¦ there is a serious risk that the negotiations could founder fatally," he warned. 
The report is to be presented to the UN on Tuesday.

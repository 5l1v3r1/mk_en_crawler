SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The OSCE mission in BiH welcomed recent commitments by the defence ministries of the two entities to downsize the number of professional armed forces.
On Tuesday (26 August), OSCE spokeswoman Zinaida Delic described them as steps in the right direction, noting that her organisation has frequently warned of excessive military costs.
"It brings BiH closer to the aim of affordable armed forces, and it could free financial means to address the grave social, economic and financial problems confronting the country," she added.
The OSCE believes personnel cuts should be accompanied by efforts to destroy or sell arms in compliance with its document on small arms and light weapons.

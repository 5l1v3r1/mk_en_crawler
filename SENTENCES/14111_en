BERLIN, Germany -- Chancellor Angela Merkel said Wednesday (15 March) that joining the EU is not "the next question" for the Western Balkans; rather, political stabilisation should be a top priority. 
The EU now plays a much more important role in the region than ever before by providing financial aid, keeping peacekeeping troops there, and pursuing economic development programmes, Merkel said. 
These undertakings go "above and beyond classical membership negotiations" conducted by the EU, she added.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament adopted a declaration Wednesday (27 April) commemorating the signing of the EU Accession Treaty. 
The declaration describes the event as historic and crucial to future development.
Meanwhile, Romanian Foreign Minister Mihai-Razvan Ungureanu met with Belgian counterpart Karel de Guch on Wednesday and praised Belgium's help in preparing for EU accession, particularly in terms of decentralising the local public administration, as well as boosting border security and fighting illegal trafficking.
Also Wednesday, parliament voted to further streamline the government by shifting some responsibilities to other ministries and doing away with a couple of minister-delegate positions. 
A more sweeping cabinet reshuffle is expected this summer.

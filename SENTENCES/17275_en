TRIPOLI, Libya -- The Tripoli regional court's next and possibly last session in the slander case against six foreign medics -- already sentenced to death in a controversial HIV infection trial -- will take place on May 6th.
The judges convened on Sunday (April 29th) for the sixth time, to consider an appeal submitted by seven Libyan police officers against the five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor.
The medics were charged after insisting police had tortured them into confessing to charges in the HIV case.
If convicted, they face jail time and may be forced to pay millions in compensation.

TIRANA, Albania -- Police in Durres arrested a man Monday (October 12th) suspected of inciting terrorism and of involvement in terrorist activities. 
Artan Kristo, also known as Muhamed Abdullai, is a representative of the Al Haramain foundation, an alleged sponsor of international terrorism. 
It had its assets frozen by the government in 2004. 
Kristo had been under investigation for more than three months for allegedly spreading and inciting terrorism-based propaganda, via a subscription-based website that encouraged young Muslims to engage in terrorist attacks.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The EU is expected to recommend visa liberalisation for Kosovo but under certain conditions, according to an internal document of the European Commission (EC) quoted by local media on Monday (October 5th).
The draft of the report that looks into progress in Kosovo, also says that the EU will ask for everybody's commitment to helping Pristina on its Euro-Atlantic integration path.
"Preventing Kosovo from participating in some regional initiatives due to Serbia's objection is to be criticised, "the report notes.
It also makes a point of the unsatisfactory situation of journalists and media in Kosovo and asks that this issue be addresses urgently.
In other news, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said Monday that the rule of law in Kosovo is a precondition for peace, stability and economic development.
Attending a meeting of the Joint Rule of Law Co-ordination Board, Thaci said that institutions should be more committed to fighting corruption at customs, which according to him, is the main problem for the state.
Thaci noted that organised crime and other negative occurrences can be fought only in close co-operation with the international civil mission in Kosovo.

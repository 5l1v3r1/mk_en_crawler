BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government reported an outbreak of bird flu at a small farm in Tulcea, eastern Romania on Wednesday (November 28th).
About 80 birds were culled there to stop the spread of the disease.
The Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Russia and the United Kingdom have all reported bird flu cases so far this year.
Bulgaria reacted immediately to the news from Romania by banning farmers from keeping poultry outdoors in the northeastern parts of the country.
The sale of live poultry in open-air markets has also been prohibited.

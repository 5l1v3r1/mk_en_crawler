BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The next round of Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks between the EU and Serbia-Montenegro will not be held if Belgrade fails to meet an end-of-April deadline for extraditing Ratko Mladic to the UN war crimes tribunal, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told reporters Friday (28 April). 
He spoke after a meeting in Belgrade with Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic. 
According to Rehn, the European Commission will make a final decision on the matter on 3 May, when it is due to receive a report from the UN chief prosecutor.
On Sunday, the Belgrade daily Politika published an article by Rehn calling on Serbs and their leadership not to allow the Mladic case to further block the EU integration process. 
The Serbian people deserve a European future, Rehn wrote.

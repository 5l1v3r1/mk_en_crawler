BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Adrian Nastase says Romania may renegotiate its agreement with the United States on immunity from the International Criminal Court (ICC). 
According to the original agreement, US citizens would not be subject to ICC jurisdiction while on Romanian territory. 
Nastase spoke after the EU, in a compromise, allowed certain US citizens to be exempted from ICC authority. 
He added that the US agreement has not been ratified by Romania's parliament, and is therefore still subject to amendment.

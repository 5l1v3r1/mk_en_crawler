ANKARA, Turkey -- Security forces killed a suspected member of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) during clashes in the southeastern province of Batman on Saturday (December 11th). 
The incident happened when an army patrol came across a group of Kurdish rebels and called on them to surrender. 
The PKK members responded by opening gunfire. 
The PKK has extended its unilateral ceasefire with Turkey until next summer's general elections.

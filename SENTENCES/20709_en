PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Parliament's Constitutional Committee approved the draft law on implementing the new constitution Tuesday (August 7th).
It is the final step before the constitution and accompanying legislation can be forwarded to the full parliament for debate.
Once again, the opposition boycotted the committee proceedings.
It has been staging a boycott since July 30th, after its request for an open session was ignored.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The prosecutor's office in Zagreb pressed charges Monday (June 21st) against seven former army officers suspected of war crimes against Bosnian Serb soldiers in 1995 in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
The seven allegedly participated in the killing of six soldiers in the area of Mliniste, under the order of their commander, Ivan Korade. 
The court, however, decided to release the accused from custody, where they have been held since October 2009.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The alleged commander of the infamous Omarska detention camp during the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina surrendered to Serbian police on Monday (30 June). 
The interior ministry said Zeljko Meakic, a Bosnian Serb, is in custody pending an extradition procedure that would eventually clear the way for a trial by the international war crimes tribunal. 
He was indicted in 1995. 
An estimated 3,000 Muslims and Croats were held at the Omarska camp in 1992. 
The reformist Serbian government has already transferred three war crimes suspects to The Hague since May. 
A fourth indictee, former Col Veselin Sljivancanin, was arrested in June and is awaiting extradition proceedings.

BELGRADE, Seriba/PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbia is ready to start dialogue with Kosovo "immediately", Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said in an interview with Vecernje Novosti on Friday (October 29th). 
"We are ready to start dialogue and as far as we are concerned, it can start immediately. 
Representatives of Brussels, which will have a mediating role, are also ready," Jeremic said.
Meanwhile, Kosovo Parliament Speaker and Acting President Jakup Krasniqi told Deutsche Welle on Saturday that political parties in Pristina are not ready at the moment. 
"If we'll have early elections, then it would be right for the dialogue to start after the construction of the new institutions that will arise from these elections," he said, echoing a statement by Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci. 
On Thursday, Kuci said that actual dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade will start after general elections in Kosovo, which are scheduled for February 13th.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A Skopje court ruled on Thursday (15 June) in favour of Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski in his slander lawsuit against Fokus weekly publisher Nikola Mladenov. 
Crvenkovski launched the suit due to a Fokus article claiming that he has foreign currency accounts in Swiss banks. 
The court charged the writer with a fine of around 5,000 euros for slander, and an additional 25,000 euros for immaterial damage.

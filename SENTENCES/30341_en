SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament elected Boris Kondarko as president of the State Election Commission (DIK) on Tuesday (April 12th).
His nomination was backed by 80 out of 120 lawmakers.
Kondarko was nominated by the main opposition SDSM party, which did not attend the vote due to its parliamentary boycott.
Electing a DIK president was the last condition parliament had to meet for early elections, as lawmakers had already passed electoral code changes.
Parliament will be dissolved on Thursday, ahead of the June 5th election.

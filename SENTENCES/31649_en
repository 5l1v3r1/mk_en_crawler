SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR has successfully completed its re-structuring into a smaller, more robust and agile force, said spokesman Lt Cdr Yves Vanier at a news conference Tuesday (14 January).
Since the transformation, SFOR has been divided into ten battle groups, each including around 750 soldiers.
In general, the restructuring was conducted with a focus on potential trouble spots identified by past experience and careful analysis of the current situation, according to Vanier.
Meanwhile, EU security chief Javier Solana arrived in Sarajevo late Tuesday to attend Wednesday's official ceremony inaugurating the start of the EU Police Mission.

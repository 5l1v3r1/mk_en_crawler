ANKARA, Turkey -- Six people were injured on Saturday (November 1st) in an explosion at the office of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in southeastern Hakkari province. 
The wall of a building was destroyed by the blast, which also shattered windows in nearby buildings. 
The incident happened amid massive protests by Kurds in the region against the government's policy towards them.
In the neighbouring city of Diyarbakir, thousands of Kurds staged a strike demanding the government stop its military action against members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and offer them jobs instead. 
Turkish media reported dozens of private cars were torched during the protests. 
Demonstrators threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, who used tear gas to disperse them. 
All this occurred as Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited the province of Van. 
He addressed a crowd only 150m from scene of clashes between police and protesters. 
Erdogan promised the government will work to improve the living standards of Kurds in the region. 
He is to visit Hakkari province on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the General Staff said Friday that 124 PKK members have left the ranks of the organisation during the past 17 days, following a significant offensive by the Turkish military against PKK positions in northern Iraq. 
The army says it has launched a total of nine cross-border attacks in the past month.

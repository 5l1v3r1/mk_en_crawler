ANKARA, Turkey -- The General Staff announced on Monday (June 9th) that it will establish six temporary security zones in southeast Turkey to fight members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
The measures begin on Thursday and will continue for three months in uninhabited mountainous areas in the Siirt, Sirnak and Hakkari provinces near the Iraqi border, as well as in parts of the Van province that border Iran.
Meanwhile, a group of London-based Kurdish lawyers announced on Monday that they have filed a lawsuit against Turkey in the Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights.
They are filing on behalf of peasants affected by Turkish air strikes last October and December.
Separately Monday, Turkish police announced a project to train officers to demonstrate more compassion.
Clashes between police and demonstrators in Istanbul on May Day led to allegations of excessive force against the police.

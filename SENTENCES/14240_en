VIENNA, Austria -- The UN mediator of the upcoming negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo said on Thursday (12 January) that talks are expected to begin on 25 January.
Martti Ahtisaari said he hopes representatives of the two sides will meet in Vienna to discuss first the decentralisation of Kosovo's administration.

Responding to criticism from the Council of Europe, a spokesman said detainees had been kept at the base until 2004 and that Red Cross and Amnesty International representatives were regularly granted access to them.

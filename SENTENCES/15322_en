PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- At the end of his four-day visit to Pristina on Friday (25 August), UN special envoy for Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari said that talks were successful, and there has been progress on issues of decentralisation and protection of minority rights. 
The UN envoy said both Belgrade and Pristina should prepare to make compromises. 
Local media suggested that everything has been agreed on except for Mitrovica, the ethnically divided town in northern Kosovo.
On a related note, newly-appointed UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker said in an interview with German Die Welt on Friday that the UN solution for Kosovo can be predicted. 
Ruecker did not mention specifics, but hinted that independence would be the most likely outcome. 
Ruecker reiterated that the international community had determined the three no-goes in the process of finding a solution for the final status -- the province cannot return to its pre-1999 status, it cannot be annexed to another state and it cannot be divided. 
He also stressed that it is important that Kosovo Serbs take part in the political and economic life of the province and its institutions.

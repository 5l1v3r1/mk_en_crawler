SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Deputy Prime Minister Radmila Sekerinska met with the management board of the Macedonian Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday (5 April) to discuss EU integration-related tasks facing the country. 
She told the group that eventual EU entry would mean new markets and opportunities but would also require solid preparation and adequate reaction to new conditions.
In other news Tuesday, rightist opposition candidate Kiril Trendafilov withdrew from the mayoral race in Ohrid, ahead of Sunday's voting. 
Several polling stations are holding a revote, due to irregularities in last month's runoff. 
Trendafilov, however, had wanted the runoff results completely invalidated.

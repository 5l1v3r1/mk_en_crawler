ZAGREB, Croatia -- The state election commission said Thursday (23 December) it had received complaints from three more candidates -- Djurdja Adlesic of the Croatian Social Liberal Party, independent candidate Doris Kosta and the candidate of the Croatian Christian Democratic Union, Anto Kovacevic -- about media coverage. 
Several other candidates had already raised objections about what they say is media favouritism towards the two front-runners, incumbent President Stipe Mesic and his opponent from the ruling HDZ party, Deputy Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor.

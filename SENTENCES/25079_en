PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Another body was recovered from the Tisza River on Wednesday (October 28th), a presumed member of a group of Kosovo Albanians that tried to cross the river and enter Hungary illegally from Serbia earlier this month.
That makes six known dead and ten missing.
One survivor told a Pristina network Thursday "We did not know that we would have to travel through the river.
They betrayed us;
they lied to us," said Blerim Rama, who managed to save his two children.
His wife was among those who drowned when the boat capsized and sank.
She was buried in Pristina on Thursday.

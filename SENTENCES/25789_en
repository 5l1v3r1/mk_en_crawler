THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- As requested, UN war crimes prosecutors shortened the indictment Monday (October 19th) against Radovan Karadzic and filed it with the tribunal, in an effort to streamline proceedings against the former Bosnian Serb leader. 
His trial is set to begin on October 26th. 
The final document still consists of 11 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. 
However, the number of crime sites, incidents and municipalities has been reduced.

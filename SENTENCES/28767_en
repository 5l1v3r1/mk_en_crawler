BELGRADE, Serbia -- War crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic announced on Saturday (September 11th) charges have been filed against nine former members of "The Jackals" paramilitary unit, for the brutal killing of over 40 civilians during the 1999 war in Kosovo. 
The nine are suspected of committing war crimes against ethnic Albanian civilians in the western Kosovo village of Cuska in May 1999, to drive them from their homes. 
"The accused [showed] particular brutality, ruthlessness and insensitivity," Vukcevic noted in a statement.

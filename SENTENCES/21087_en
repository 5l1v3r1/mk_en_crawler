BUCHAREST, Romania -- Former union leader Miron Cozma, who spent ten years in prison for organising the 1991 miners' revolt in Romania, was released on Sunday (December 2nd). 
The riots, sparked by government plans to close a number of money-losing mines, led to the toppling of Romania's first post-communist government. 
Three people were killed and dozens were injured during three days of clashes between miners and supporters of the reformist government. 
Cozma led several other skirmishes, as well. 
"I spent ten years in jail because I did my job as a union leader and I was brave enough to oppose the corrupt politicians and to fight for the rights of the workers," he said as he left the Rahova prison in Bucharest's suburbs.

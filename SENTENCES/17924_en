BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) will not change its constitution and grant Srebrenica -- a city where genocide against Bosniaks was committed in 1995 -- special status, RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik reiterated on Tuesday (March 20th) during a meeting with municipal leaders.
However, Dodik promised that the RS cabinet would step up efforts to implement social and economic projects in Srebrenica to improve the quality of life there, adding that 7.5m euros will be earmarked this year to finance return projects, rebuild the power network and build two new main roads.
Municipal leaders say they will continue to insist on receiving special status, outside RS's jurisdiction.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- An appeal chamber of the BiH Court on Wednesday (May 5th) overturned the conviction of Bosnian Serb commander Milos Stupar. 
Convicted of committing genocide in Srebrenica in 1995, Stupar, 47, was sentenced to 40 years in prison in July 2008. 
On appeal, the court concluded he lacked effective control over forces that committed the crime. 
More than 1,000 Bosniaks were killed by Bosnian Serbs in the Bratunac municipality on July 13th 1995. 
Stupar, however, took command of the Bosnian Serb special police unit operating in the region a day later, replacing an injured commander.
In other news, police announced on Wednesday the arrest of three men suspected of war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
The suspects, identified only by their initials, are believed to have killed 15 Bosnian Muslims in 1995. 
They were arrested in Banja Luka.

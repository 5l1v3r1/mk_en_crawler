CRETE, Greece -- Foreign Minister George Papandreou and his Turkish counterpart, Abdullah Gul, signed an agreement Monday (26 May) on three confidence-building measures.
They include mutual visits of high-ranking Turkish and Greek military staff and mutual visits of military academy members.
During a news conference in Ankara, however, Turkish Chief of General Staff Gen Hilmi Ozkok said relations between the two countries have been damaged by airspace disputes.

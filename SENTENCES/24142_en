BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu on Tuesday (April 14th) denied accusations by Moldovan officials that Romania was behind last week's anti-government protests in the capital, Chisinau.
"Lately, there have been ungrounded and unacceptable accusations towards Romania on Moldova's part ...
Moldovan authorities are trying to justify the failure of their policy by blaming someone else," Basescu said to parliament.
He stressed that Romania has no territorial claims on neighbouring Moldova.
"It is in Romania's best interest to be the neighbour of a prosperous and stable country," he said.
Basescu criticised the "repressive actions" by Moldovan authorities and said using weapons against citizens is a crime.
The president also expressed concern about "aggression and illegal measures" against Romanian nationals in Moldova.
Last week, Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin accused Romania of meddling in his country's affairs and attempting to stage a coup, following anti-communist riots in Chisinau touched off by the April 5th elections.

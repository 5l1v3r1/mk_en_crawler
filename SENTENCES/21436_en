BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Tuesday (June 24th) that Croatia could complete its accession negotiations with the EU in the autumn of 2009. 
Speaking at a policy conference dubbed "A Balkan Balance Sheet", Rehn reiterated that Ireland's recent "no" vote during a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty would not affect the negotiating process. 
He added there would be plenty of time to resolve the EU's institutional crisis by then. 
France, which assumes the rotating EU presidency on July 1st, has said its goal would be to open all negotiating chapters and close as many as possible, paving the way for the completion of talks next year.
At that meeting in Brussels, Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci noted that a pro-European government in Serbia will have a positive influence on his young country. 
"The closer Serbia gets to the EU, the closer Kosovo Serbs will get to Pristina," Thaci said. 
The prime ministers of Montenegro and Albania also attended the conference.

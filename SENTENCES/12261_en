ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader says local elections would likely be held in April 2005, a month earlier than expected.
The mandate of the current regional governments expires in May, but Election Day is being shifted at the request of municipalities along the Adriatic coast.
They want the new administration to have at least a month to focus on the tourist season, which starts in June.
In other news Sunday (12 December), Raccardo Illy, president of the autonomous Italian region of Friuli-Venezia-Giulia, says Italy believes Croatia could join the EU in 2007, but would more likely do so in 2009.
Italy would advocate speedy accession, he said.

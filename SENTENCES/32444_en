WASHINGTON, United States -- According to the Pentagon, organised crime, trafficking, ethnic tensions in Kosovo and the substantial amount of small and light weaponry held by civilians are the major threats to the security and stability of Macedonia.
These were the conclusions of a report Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz presented to visiting Macedonian Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski on Tuesday (18 March).
The report praised co-operative efforts launched by Macedonia and its fellow NATO aspirants, Albania and Croatia.
It also emphasised that the Alliance's doors remain open.
In other news, at a roundtable discussion Wednesday in Skopje, President Boris Trajkovski said the process of weapons collections should be accelerated, with the help of international organisations already in Macedonia.

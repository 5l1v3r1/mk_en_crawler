SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Interior Ministry Secretary-General Iliya Iliev resigned on Wednesday (November 28th) citing both health problems and evidence that he was "terribly misled" into signing documents that may violate ministry rules. 
Interior Minister Rumen Petkov thanked Iliev for his work and nominated National Police chief Valentin Petrov to serve as interim secretary-general.

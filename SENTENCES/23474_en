BELGRADE, Serbia -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz arrived in Belgrade on Thursday (March 26th) to review efforts to find remaining fugitives. 
He met with President Boris Tadic and Interior Minister Ivica Dacic ahead of talks Friday with War Crimes Prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic. 
One topic of discussion is Belgrade's recent proposal to allow convicted Serb war criminals to serve their sentences in Serbian prisons. 
In his latest report, Brammertz acknowledged progress in Serbia's level of co-operation with The Hague, but refused to describe it as full, insisting Serb authorities must arrest remaining fugitives Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic. 
Mladic's arrest is the main condition set by the EU in order to unblock ratification of its pre-membership agreement with Serbia.

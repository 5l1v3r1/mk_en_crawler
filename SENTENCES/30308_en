ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Several thousand people gathered in Istanbul on Sunday (May 15th) to rally against internet censorship.
The protest was triggered by the planned introduction of new filtering rules in August, as part of the country's "Safe Internet Service" initiative, aimed at protecting children from indecent online contents.
Critics, however, say that just how the filtering system will work is not clear.

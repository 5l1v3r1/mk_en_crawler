BELGRADE, Serbia -- Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a message to Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica on Sunday (May 4th) reassuring him of Moscow's unchanged position on the Kosovo issue.
"We think that the unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo was a heavy blow to international law," Putin said in the note, published by the Serbian government press office."We are ready to launch joint efforts to counter this dangerous trend.
You can firmly rely on our solidarity and support."
The Russian leader also said Russia is ready to develop its relations with Serbia on a wide range of issues, in the interest of peace and stability in the Balkans and the establishment of a Europe without any separation lines.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Federation of BiH (FBiH) police have arrested a man identified as Muamer Basic, 24, on charges of terrorism.
The FBiH interior ministry said on Saturday (March 8th) that he had been detained in the town of Kiseljak Thursday, with two bombs in his car.
On Sunday, FBiH prosecutors ordered Basic held for a month until an investigation is complete.
The Nezavisne Novine newspaper reports he told police he planned to sell the explosives rather than attack any particular target himself.

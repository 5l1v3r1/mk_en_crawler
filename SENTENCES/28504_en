BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik told High Representative Valentin Inzko on Tuesday (May 11th) that his entity is willing to resolve state and military property issues but others are not.
At a meeting in Banja Luka, Dodik also said that while RS is ready to comply with December's ruling by the European Court of Human Rights -- that the constitution discriminates against minorities -- conditions for fundamental constitutional reform are lacking.
The Bosnian Serb official downplayed expectations from the EU-Western Balkans conference that Sarajevo will host next month, but does expect the EU to announce that BiH has met conditions for visa liberalisation.

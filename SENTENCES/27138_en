WARSAW, Poland -- Bulgaria might give up one of the major energy projects currently in the works with Moscow, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday (September 1st), during his first meeting with new Bulgarian counterpart Boyko Borissov. 
This was on the sidelines of commemorations marking the beginning of World War II in Gdansk, Poland. 
Borissov has said he would pull the plug on all projects that are too expensive, including those with Russia. 
Putin said that aborting one would not harm bilateral ties. 
Currently, there are three projects under way -- construction of a second nuclear plant, the South Stream natural gas pipeline, and the Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline, in co-operation with Greece.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Tens of thousands of people gathered on Saturday (February 5th) in front of the parliament building in Belgrade at a rally organised by the opposition Serbian Progressive Party (SNS). 
Its leader, Tomislav Nikolic, gave the government two months to call early elections or face the risk of continuous protests. 
SNS Deputy President Aleksandar Vucic criticised the cabinet for its economic policy while New Serbia (NS) leader Velimir Ilic blamed the ruling coalition for failing to meet promises for opening new jobs and securing EU membership in 2013.
According to opposition party estimates, 85,000 people attended the rally. 
Police said the protestors numbered around 55,000. 
The demonstration brought together supporters of the SNS, NS, Socialist Movement and Power of Serbia Movement, and ended without incident.

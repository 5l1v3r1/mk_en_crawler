BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Parliament (EP) rapporteur on visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans, Tanja Fajon, said on Tuesday (September 7th) that EU visa requirements for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Albania could be scrapped by the end of the year. 
She refused to mention a deadline, but voiced hope it could happen before Christmas. 
The two countries have met the technical requirements, as confirmed by the European Commission. 
Fajon says she expects the EP to vote on the issue later this month or in early October. 
The EP Foreign Affairs Committee adopted a draft report Monday that recommends lifting the EU visa regime for Albania and BiH. 
The draft moves next to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for approval.

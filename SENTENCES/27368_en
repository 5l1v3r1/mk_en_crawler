BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen announced on Friday (October 29th) that the Alliance plans to downsize its peacekeeping mission in Kosovo by half. 
Over the next few months, the force will be reduced from 10,000 to 5,000 soldiers. 
According to Rasmussen, the decision is based on the improved security situation in the country and the increased capacity of local institutions to deal with security tasks. 
According to the plan, the presence will be further reduced to 2,500 soldiers by 2012. 
NATO has been present in Kosovo since 1999.

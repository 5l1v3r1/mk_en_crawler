NEW YORK, United States -- Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic urged the UN Security Council on Thursday (February 14th) to oppose the expected declaration of independence by Kosovo Albanians. 
He also asked UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to declare any such act null and void. 
Jeremic warned that Kosovo's independence would set a grave precedent that could trigger numerous claims for secession, an argument backed by Russia.
After Jeremic's speech, US Deputy Ambassador to the UN Alejandro Wolff accused Serbia of increasing tensions between ethnic Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo. 
"There is clear evidence that Serbian officials have been engaged in intimidating ethnic Serbs in Kosovo, forbidding them from co-operation with Kosovo and international authorities, and threatening their livelihoods,'' Wolff told the Security Council.
Also on Thursday, the Serbian government adopted a decision "to annul all illegal acts of Kosovo provisional self-governing organs whose aim is the declaration of unilateral independence". 
Parliament is expected to endorse the decision next week. 
Serbia insists that any unilateral declaration of independence would violate its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
In other news, Boris Tadic was sworn in for a second term as Serbian president on Friday. 
He won a run-off against Serbian Radical Party candidate Tomislav Nikolic earlier this month.

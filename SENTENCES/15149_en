ATHENS, Greece -- Amid continued protests by primary and pre-school teachers in Greece, Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis indicated on Thursday (28 September) that his government plans no concessions that would divert it from the planned course of education sector reforms. 
The protesters have warned that unless their request for a 40% salary hike is met, they would continue strikes next week.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Pero Bukejlovic scheduled a new round of talks on the BiH police reform issue for Wednesday (17 August), the RS government said Friday.
The meeting is expected to include senior representatives of the central and entity governments.
The latest convention on police reform resulted in an agreement that the negotiations would be taken from the political to the institutional level, and that international officials will take part only upon request and in the explicit necessity of technical assistance.
Reaching an agreement on the crucial police reform in BiH is a major condition by the EU for Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with BiH.

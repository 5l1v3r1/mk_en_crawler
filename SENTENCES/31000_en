NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot trade union members and supporters of left-wing parties joined a march in the northern part of Nicosia on Monday (February 7th) against what they described as "belittling" statements by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
On Sunday, he urged authorities there to track down participants in a big rally on January 28th against the government's austerity policy, which stems from a protocol with Turkey.
Some protesters held banners criticising Turkey's -- particularly Erdogan's -- intervention in their affairs.
Organisers of Monday's march outside the Turkish Embassy in northern Nicosia and the office of leader Dervis Eroglu promised a mass demonstration is coming.

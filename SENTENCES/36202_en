TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister Kastriot Islami said Saturday (6 March) that political stability is key to implementation of reforms on the road to Euro-Atlantic integration. 
During a press conference about Albanian diplomacy in the first two months of the year, he said the foreign ministry had intensified activities aimed at accelerating reforms needed to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. 
Referring to an earlier comment by European Community President Romano Prodi, Islami said Albania has been advancing in the field of political reforms. 
Prodi had urged an improved political situation saying it "should reflect no more destabilising moments".

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The third round of negotiations between Croatia and the EU in Protocol 7 starts Monday (5 April) in Brussels. 
Part of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, the protocol stipulates the trade terms between Croatia and EU countries -- including the ten that are to join the Union in May.
In other news, Croatia's EU bid will be the focus of talks in Lisbon between Croatian President Stipe Mesic and his Portuguese counterpart, Jorge Sampaio. 
It will be the first such visit by a Croatian head of state since 1998.

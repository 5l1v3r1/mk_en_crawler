SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Police arrested war crimes convict Branimir Glavas on Tuesday (September 28th) after a local court upheld his sentence. 
In July, the Croatian politician and former lawmaker was sentenced in Croatia to eight years in prison for war crimes against Serbian civilians during the 1991-1995 conflict. 
Glavas, who holds both Croatian and Bosnian citizenship, left Croatia last year and escaped to BiH to avoid prison.

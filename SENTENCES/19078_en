SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski on Thursday (March 1st) invited Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki to meet next week, to settle differences over major foreign policy issues.
Crvenkovski said he wants to discuss EU and NATO integration, Kosovo's status and the appointment of new ambassadors.
Relations between Crvenkovski and the cabinet have grown tense recently amid accusations of election fraud.
Also on Thursday, Parliament member Gjorgji Orovchanec announced plans to leave the VMRO-Narodna Party and become an independent.
Though he offered no explanation, media reports suggest he may join the Democratic Alternative, and perhaps run for leader during a party congress later this month.

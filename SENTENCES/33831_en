ZAGREB, Croatia -- The two main political parties wrapped up their election campaigns with rallies in Zagreb on Thursday (20 November). 
An estimated 10,000 people gathered to hear Prime Minister Ivica Racan of the Social Democrats say that the election is not about the country moving to the right or left, but rather about stepping forward or backward. 
A victory Sunday for his party would guarantee integration in the EU, Racan said.Another 1,000 people gathered at a rally by the opposition Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). 
Its leader, Ivo Sanader, sent the same message, indicating once again that his party is trying to shake off its nationalist image. 
Polls have put the HDZ in the lead, but suggest no single political party will win by the margin needed to form a government on its own.
In other news, Justice Minister Ingrid Anticevic Marinovic and her Austrian counterpart, Dieter Boehmdorfer, signed a bilateral agreement regarding co-operation on criminal prosecution procedures Thursday in Zagreb.

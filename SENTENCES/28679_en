NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou on Monday (April 12th) urged the government in Nicosia to continue talks aimed at reunifying the divided island, regardless of the outcome of the upcoming presidential election in the Turkish-dominated north. 
Progress reached over the past 19 months of talks should not be lost even if current Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat loses Sunday's election to hard-liner Dervis Eroglu, Papandreou said after meeting with Cypriot President Demetris Christofias in Nicosia. 
Recent polls suggest Eroglu, who supports a two-state settlement of the issue, is the frontrunner. 
Papandreou reiterated Athens' support for the talks despite the economic difficulties his country is facing.

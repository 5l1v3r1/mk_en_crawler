DUBLIN, Ireland -- Kosovo's government should transform words into actions when it comes to fighting corruption at the highest level, International Civilian Representative Pieter Feith said on Wednesday (April 14th) during an appearance in Dublin.
During a lecture at the Institute of International and European Affairs, he said that addressing corruption-related issues would not only affect Kosovo's image in the world, but also impact the expectations of its people.
They "feel that no sufficient measures have been taken to fight corruption and they expect more", Feith said.
He also noted that the latest EU progress report is raising a number of concerns regarding corruption.

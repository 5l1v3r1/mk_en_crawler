PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier announced on Thursday (July 31st) a plan to create special autonomy within the Kosovo police for its Serb officers. 
Zannier said he will present to both Pristina and Belgrade his proposals for implementing UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's plan to reconfigure UNMIK. 
"If the two sides do not agree, I have the power to impose them," he stressed. 
Zannier's proposals envision the customs authority in northern Kosovo resembling the Hong Kong model, where one territory has two customs areas. 
The same arrangement is planned for the judiciary. 
Zannier said the Contact Group backs the idea.

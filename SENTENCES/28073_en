PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The level of access minorities have to the justice system is unsatisfactory, the Humanitarian Law Centre in Kosovo concluded in a report published on Tuesday (April 20th).
Project Co-ordinator Drita Vala blames a low level of awareness among minorities of their rights as well as a failure to recruit minority candidates for jobs in the justice system.

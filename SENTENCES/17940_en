SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev told a local radio station Saturday (December 16th) that no changes in the coalition cabinet are envisioned for now.
There have been media reports lately suggesting a cabinet shuffle would occur after Bulgaria's EU accession next month.
Stanishev said he expects EU membership would result in more advanced economic development.
In other news, Ahmed Dogan, leader of the ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms, a junior partner in the coalition cabinet, suggested in a media interview Sunday that he might retire from politics next year.
He told state TV BNT that EU accession would mark a new stage in Bulgaria's development, and that he would no longer be needed.

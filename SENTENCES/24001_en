BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Bucharest People's Tribunal decided on Thursday (June 18th) that newly elected European Parliament (EP) member George Becali -- accused of kidnapping three men who he says stole his car -- cannot leave the country.
The decision will prevent Becali from assuming his duties at the EP.
The businessman, who owns the Steaua Bucharest football team, ran on the nationalist Greater Romanian Party's ticket.
In other news, former President Ion Iliescu was acquitted on Thursday in connection with a criminal investigation into the events of June 1990, when a civil protest was suppressed with the help of a group of miners.
Iliescu had been charged with propagating war, genocide, inhumane treatment and complicity in torturing.
He was president from 1990 to 1996 and again from 2000 to 2004.

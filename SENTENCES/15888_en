ZAGREB, Croatia -- The 15th anniversary of the referendum on Croatia's independence was marked on Friday (19 May) with a formal reception at parliament.
Addressing the guests, Parliament Speaker Vladimir Seks recalled that the poll paved the way for the declaration of Croatia's independence from Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991 and the de facto separation on 8 October 1991.
Seks added that modern Croatia is committed to pursuing policies of peace and co-operation and to achieving its strategic goal of EU membership.

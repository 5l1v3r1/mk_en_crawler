PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) leader Ramush Haradinaj is certain that parliamentary elections will occur next year and that his party will win.
Speaking in the town of Kacanik on Sunday (November 2nd), Haradinaj said he is "working on creating a government that will 'press' the EULEX, the International Civilian Office and UNMIK to carry out the tasks for which they have come to Kosovo".
Elsewhere, the Social Democratic Party of Kosovo sharply criticised the government over healthcare and the privatisation of the state-owned telecom firm, PTK.
The party stressed that the global financial crisis is the wrong time to privatise large assets such as PTK.
In other news Sunday, Serbian border police announced they seized 14.4kg of a substance suspected to be heroin at the Merdare crossing with Kosovo.
Authorities said the drugs were in a car with foreign license plates.
The two people inside the car held Austrian passports.
The vehicle came from the direction of Pristina on Saturday.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- UN war crimes tribunal President Patrick Robinson voiced concern Tuesday (September 28th) that the two remaining war crimes fugitives -- Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic -- remain at large.
He supported recent criticism by tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz concerning Serbia's failure to track down and arrest the two, but voiced hope that Belgrade will make every effort to co-operate.
Robinson pointed out that if Mladic and Hadzic are not in custody by the time the tribunal shuts down, mechanisms will be kept in place to prosecute them.
Robinson was in Belgrade for the launch of an EU-funded project aimed at helping national judiciaries in the Balkans deal with war crimes cases.
The 4m-euro project will be implemented in co-operation with the OSCE and the UN Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute.

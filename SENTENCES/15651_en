PARACIN, Serbia -- The local authorities of Paracin, Cuprija and Krusevac will ask the government and army to relocate current military depots from their municipalities, following last Thursday's (October 19th) blasts at the Paracin base that injured over 20 people and damaged thousands of buildings.
According to statements by Cuprija and Krusevac officials Tuesday, the three municipalities would request that the arms and munitions depot currently based in Krusevac be moved away from inhabited areas.
Investigators are working to determine the cause of last week's blast.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Zagreb and the UN war crimes tribunal are still at odds over the whereabouts of fugitive Croatian General Ante Gotovina. 
Croatian Deputy Prime Minister Goran Granic met with UN war crimes chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte at The Hague on Thursday (25 September) to discuss issues related to Croatia's co-operation with the tribunal, particularly the case of the indicted general, who has been in hiding for two years. 
Following the meeting, Granic told reporters that del Ponte insists Gotovina is in Croatia, while Zagreb's intelligence insists he is not. 
The issue is crucial to Croatia's plans to start accession talks with the EU next year.
In other news from The Hague, a spokesman said Thursday that the trial of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has been suspended until the end of this month, while the defendant undergoes treatment for high blood pressure. 
Prosecutors say such delays affect their ability to present their case.

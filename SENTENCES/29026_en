PARIS, France -- Authorities started dismantling illegal Roma settlements on Friday (August 6th), following an order by President Nicolas Sarkozy.
The first targeted camp, inhabited by 100 Romanian gypsies, was in the central city of Saint-Etienne.
Paris announced last month its plan to remove 300 unauthorised gypsy camps within three months and to repatriate Roma who have committed crimes.
The move came after a violent clash between Roma and police in early July.

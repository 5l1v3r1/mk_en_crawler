ZAGREB, Croatia -- Two MiG-21 fighter jets that may have collided in air crashed during an exercise in central Croatia on Thursday (September 23rd).
The defence ministry says both pilots ejected safely, though a woman working in a nearby field was slightly injured by falling debris.
An investigation into the incident near the town of Plaski is under way.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Institutions in Kosovo would not accept the signing of any agreement on police co-operation between EULEX and Serbia unless Pristina is a signatory of it with clear state authority, Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci was quoted as saying by local media on Sunday (August 23rd). 
Kuci also ruled out the possibility of Pristina preparing its own version of the protocol, which it would propose to EULEX as an acceptable option. 
Government officials and opposition representatives reject the agreement, arguing it violates Kosovo's constitution and sovereignty.

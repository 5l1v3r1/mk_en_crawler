ATHENS, Greece -- The Paralympic Flame was lit in Athens Thursday (9 September), beginning the countdown to the 12th Paralympic Games, which will be held in the Greek capital from 17 September through 28 September.
"In a few days, all attention turns to Athens again, in order to honour the power of will, indomitable effort, the ethos of people with a disability," Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said at the lighting ceremony.

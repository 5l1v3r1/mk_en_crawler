ZAGREB, Croatia -- Regional elections are being held Sunday (15 May), which analysts expect will confirm the conservative ruling party's strength, despite a recent decline in support. 
The popularity of Prime Minister Ivo Sanader's Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) has faltered in their 18 months in power, due to growing social and political grievances. 
The opposition Social Democrats, by contrast, have rebounded in opinion polls. 
But analysts also note that the HDZ, which has worked hard to distance itself from the hard-line nationalist image it had in the 1990s, maintains firm grassroots support among the more than 4 million voters. 
Some 3,000 Croatian Serb refugees were to arrive from Serbia to cast ballots as well.
The latest polls suggest the HDZ would win in at least ten of the 21 counties, with the Social Democrats set to win four, including Zagreb. 
Polls project their coalition partners to win another four. 
A variety of wide coalitions is likely in most of the 426 municipalities across the country.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) on Tuesday (April 8th) supported its embattled member, Interior Minister Rumen Petkov, after he presented a report requested by Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev on his ministry's performance over the past 18 years. 
The report, on which corruption fighting measures could be based, was sought after a huge scandal involving questionable contacts between shadowy businessmen and high-ranking ministry officials, including Petkov, shook the ministry. 
The BSP says that removing Petkov would prevent the ministry's reform.

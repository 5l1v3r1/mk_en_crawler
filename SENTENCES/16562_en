BUCHAREST, Romania -- The main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) is demanding the resignation or replacement of Defence Minister Teodor Atanasiu, blaming him for what SDP sees as a critical situation in the ministry. 
At a weekend news conference, spokesman Cristian Diaconescu said the party holds Atanasiu responsible for using army counterintelligence agents to spy on politicians and journalists. 
It also blames Atanasiu and his National Liberal Party for the recent controversy over a proposal to withdraw Romanian troops from Iraq. 
The proposal jeopardised Romania's interests abroad, according to SDP.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ali Babacan presented Turkey's proposal to Georgia for establishing a Caucasian countries' co-operation group, in a bid to stabilise the region following the conflict between Russia and Georgia.
Babacan outlined the specifics during a meeting Sunday (August 31st) with Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili, who paid an official visit to Turkey.
Babacan said the proposed group will include Turkey, Russia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia.
Tkeshelashvili said Georgia will consider joining only after Russian forces leave her country.
In line with Turkey's efforts to promote peace, a Turkish delegation will visit Armenia to convey the proposal for a Caucasus alliance, Babacan told a joint press conference.
He plans to discuss the matter with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, who will visit Turkey on Tuesday.

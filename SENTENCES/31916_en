ANKARA, Turkey -- On Wednesday (27 November), the government announced plans to lift emergency rule in Diyarbakir and Sirnak. 
The two provinces have been under emergency authority since 1987 due to constant terrorist threats from the Kurdish Workers' Party. 
Originally, rule was imposed on 13 provinces, but was lifted in the others in 1991, as Diyarbakir and Sirnak continued to take the brunt of the attacks. 
Since 1987, security forces have captured over 30,000 terrorists, while 10,000 people have lost their lives, including over 500 children.

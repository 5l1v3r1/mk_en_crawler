ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament voted on Wednesday (November 22nd) to lift MP Branimir Glavas' immunity from prosecution, so he can be tried for war crimes.
Glavas is accused of ordering the execution of Croatian Serb civilians in the Osijek area at the beginning of the 1991-1995 conflict.
He was arrested on October 26th and has been on a hunger strike ever since.
Glavas is the first Croatian lawmaker to be arrested for war crimes.
In other news Wednesday, Serbian ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj refused to appear for a pre-trial hearing at the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
The leader of the Serbian Radical Party has been on a hunger strike for ten days, demanding unrestricted visits by his spouse, full rights to defend himself and the right to appoint his own legal counsel.

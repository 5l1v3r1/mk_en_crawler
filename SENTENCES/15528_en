BERLIN, Germany -- Germany's upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat, unanimously voted on Friday (November 24th) to ratify the EU accession treaty of Bulgaria and Romania, removing the last obstacle to their admission on January 1st. 
"This finalises the last legal step for the accession of the two countries. 
Thus, I welcome Bulgaria and Romania as new member states in our Union," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said shortly after the vote. 
The German parliament called for the adoption of safeguards to ensure both countries meet the EU's stringent criteria for membership.
Also Friday, the European Parliament's (EP) external relations commission approved changes in the new draft report by EP rapporteur for Romania Pierre Moscovici, in advance of a vote by the full parliament. 
The changes refer primarily to the situation facing orphans and minorities. 
Meanwhile, the Bulgarian and Romanian nominees for commissioners -- Meglena Kuneva and Leonard Orban -- are due to appear before the EP on Monday. 
The EP will vote on their candidacies next month.

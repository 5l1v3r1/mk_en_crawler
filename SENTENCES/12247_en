ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Justice Minister Cemil Cicek called for public calm Thursday (12 May) after the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that Kurdish terrorist leader Abdullah Ocalan did not receive a fair trial in Turkey six years ago.
Ocalan was convicted for his role in a separatist campaign that claimed 30,000 lives.
Erdogan and Cicek said that no one doubts the rule of law in Turkey and that the ECHR decision did not question the outcome of the trial but was concerned, rather, with procedural failings.
The decision came as Turkey works to improve its human rights record, ahead of scheduled EU accession talks in early October.

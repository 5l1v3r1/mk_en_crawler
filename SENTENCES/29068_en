TIRANA, Albania -- Albania is now implementing a programme to integrate repatriated illegal immigrants from EU countries, one of the criteria it must meet for visa liberalisation. 
Authorities announced on Tuesday (September 7th) that the initiative is being applied at all borders. 
For several weeks now, illegal immigrants arrested in Greece and handed over to Albanian police have been given a meal and transportation from the border to the nearest town. 
In addition, all repatriated citizens can register in their municipality for job skills training. 
About 60 to 70 illegal immigrants arrested in Greece are repatriated to Albania every day.

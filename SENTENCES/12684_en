PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- At least three blasts rocked downtown Pristina on Saturday (2 July) causing damage but no injuries. 
One went off in the parking lot of UNMIK headquarters, setting several UN vehicles on fire. 
The second explosion occurred near the OSCE headquarters, while the third appeared to target the main Kosovo government building. 
A UN spokesman said that an investigation is under way, and that it is too early to speculate about motives. 
The incident came amid preparations for the launch of a UN review on the future status of the province. 
The UN envoy who will lead the assessment, Norway's Kai Eide, arrived in Pristina earlier on Saturday.

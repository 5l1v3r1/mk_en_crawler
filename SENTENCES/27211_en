ANKARA, Turkey -- Police have smashed an apparent organ trafficking group, arresting 40 people in an operation in northern and western Turkey, local press reported on Wednesday (September 30th).
The operation was launched following a tip from a resident of the western town of Kilacik, who told police that a significant number of people had donated their kidneys.
The traffickers allegedly paid over 10,000 euros to each donor, then sold them to recipients for 25,000 euros.
Police rounded up both donors and traffickers alike.

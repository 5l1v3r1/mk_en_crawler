BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian Parliament voted Wednesday (25 February) to eliminate the required 50 per cent voter turnout which had voided three attempts to elect a new president. 
The republic has been without a head of state since late 2002. 
Lawmakers also instructed the speaker of the house to call a new presidential election by early June. 
Serbs living abroad would be allowed to participate in elections for the first time since the end of World War II. 
Lawmakers also waived the 5 per cent minimum requirement for ethnic parties to elect members of parliament.
Parliament also voted to appoint Radovan Jelasic, 37, as the new governor of Serbia's Central Bank. 
His predecessor, Kori Udovicki, was fired because of irregularities in her appointment.

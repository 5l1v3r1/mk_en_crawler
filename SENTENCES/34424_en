ATHENS, Greece -- The government and the organising committee for the 2004 Summer Olympics announced on Thursday (16 October) that the security budget will be increased to 677m euros, roughly 10 per cent of the total costs of staging the Games. 
The government had previously intended to spend 538m euros on security. 
According to the newly unveiled security plans, about 41,000 police and coast guard officers, soldiers, and other security personnel will guard the Olympic Village and event sites.
In other news, Greece's Central Bank expressed concern Thursday with the public deficit level and its possible deterioration in view of increased spending planned before the spring elections. 
In its annual economic report to parliament, the Bank noted that inflation remains high, though the rate is falling.

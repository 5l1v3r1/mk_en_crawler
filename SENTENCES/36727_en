BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Work has started on a highway linking Republika Srpska's capital with Croatia, the Bosnian Serb entity government announced Monday (26 July). 
The 132m-euro project is seen as crucial to the economy of BiH as a whole. 
A recent feasibility study showed that 25,000 cars travel between Banja Luka and the Croatian border each day, making it the busiest road in the country. 
The 37.5km road is expected to be finished in 2008.
In other news, SFOR has released a former aide to Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic. 
Rajko Banduka was detained Friday for questioning. 
A spokesman for the peacekeepers said investigators have found no evidence suggesting he is helping Mladic evade justice.

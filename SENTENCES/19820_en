SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament Speaker Ljubisa Georgievski and visiting Albanian counterpart, Josefina Topalli, stressed their support Thursday (December 20th) for former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan, calling it the best possible solution for Kosovo's final status.
"We hope that the Kosovo solution would contribute to regional stability.
We agreed that the issue has grown from bilateral into an international issue, because all possible efforts to come to a bilateral agreement have been exhausted," the officials said at a joint press conference after their meeting in Skopje.
Georgievski and Topalli also stressed that their countries share strategic goals for integration into NATO and the EU and again expressed hope that the Adriatic Charter countries -- Macedonia, Albania and Croatia -- will receive an invitation to join the Alliance at its Bucharest summit in April.

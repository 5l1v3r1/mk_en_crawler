SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The southern town of Krumovgrad is in mourning Monday (December 7th) following the deaths of three children killed Friday when a homemade bomb exploded in their room at a group home. 
The children were 13, 15, and 16 years old. 
Police have already made six arrests, including a man who worked at the facility. 
Authorities believe he gave the teens an item that looked like a radio speaker but was actually an improvised home-made bomb constructed from an old mine.

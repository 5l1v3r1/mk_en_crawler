THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal announced on Thursday (March 24th) it would deliver its verdict in the case of Serb Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj on May 4th. 
During a hearing about two weeks ago, Seselj sought 10m euros in compensation for spending eight years in custody. 
He said prosecutors have failed to prove his involvement in war crimes committed against non-Serbs in Croatia, Vojvodina and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 1993.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Justice Minister Anton Stankov acknowledged Monday (28 October) that his country is battling political corruption.
Speaking at a two-day international workshop on counteracting bribery, he referred to certain state administrators as "soldiers of their parties" and noted that the problem affects Bulgaria's judiciary and diplomatic corps.
Stankov also announced that the anti-corruption strategy adopted by the government a year ago is being updated.
Vladimir Phillipov, co-ordinator of the Stability Pact for Bulgaria, says levels of corruption in any country pose a threat to national security and help finance terrorism.

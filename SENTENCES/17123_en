TIRANA, Albania -- The US Embassy in Tirana issued a statement Thursday (29 June) announcing an equipment donation to the Albanian Interior Ministry, designed to support the fight against terrorism and organised crime.
The donation includes vehicles, computers and software, bulletproof vests and office equipment.
Earlier this month, Washington donated equipment to computerise prosecutors' offices.
In other news, Dutch Defence Minister Henk Kamp reaffirmed his country's support for Albania's NATO and EU bids, during a meeting with Albanian counterpart Fatmir Mediu, at The Hague on Friday.
Mediu, in turn, reiterated expectations that NATO's November summit in Riga would provide a clear signal regarding Albania's membership aspirations.

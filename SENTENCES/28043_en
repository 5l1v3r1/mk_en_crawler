SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Spain has decided to postpone extradition of war crimes suspect Veselin Vlahovic, known as the "Monster of Grbavica", to Bosnia and Herzegovina, local media reported on Thursday (August 19th). 
The security ministry says it was informed of the decision by Interpol. 
"Vlahovic is accused of several crimes in Spain and that is the reason why Spanish authorities have decided to postpone his extradition," according to a ministry statement. 
Born in Montenegro, Vlahovic was arrested in Spain in early March on suspicion of war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. 
He is accused of the murder, rape, and torture of non-Serbs from 1992 to 1993. 
Spain approved BiH's extradition request last month and was supposed to hand Vlahovic over to Sarajevo next week.

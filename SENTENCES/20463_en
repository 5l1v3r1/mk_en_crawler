SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) - Rear Admiral Hans-Jochen Witthauer, who heads EUFOR personnel in BiH, is warning against withdrawing international peacekeeping missions from BiH too early. 
According to the Tanjug news agency, he told reporters in Austria Sunday (August 12th) that he "would be very cautious" regarding troop levels until the situation in BiH is stable. 
A significant drawdown took place this spring, though Witthauer noted that those forces could be re-deployed to BiH immediately if warranted. 
He said the future of EUFOR depends mostly on the reform process.

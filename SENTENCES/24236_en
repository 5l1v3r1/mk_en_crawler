ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian Peasant's Party (HSS), a member of the ruling coalition, said Saturday (June 13th) it will leave the cabinet if the government does not make good on pledges to protesting farmers.
HSS leader Josip Friscic said at a party meeting that if the promised funds for milk producers are not guaranteed, Agriculture Minister Bozidar Pankretic of the HSS will leave his post.
Farmers ended their protest on Thursday after the government accepted most of their demands.
One of them related to the minimal buy-out price of milk, which will be increased from the current 0.26 euros to 0.30 euros per litre.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Privatisation Agency of Kosovo (PAK) urged Serbia and Montenegro on Monday (February 7th) not to attempt to sell Kosovo's employee-owned companies and their assets. 
Public auctions are held to sell property in and outside Kosovo's territory, according to the agency. 
The PAK claims that attempts to privatise Kosovo's enterprises and their assets by institutions of neighbouring countries are not supported by Kosovo or international law.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Political leaders meeting on Thursday (October 16th) agreed to withhold any official response to the latest UN proposal for resolving the long-standing name dispute with Greece.
President Branko Crvenkovski and Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski will hold another round of talks before adopting a final stance.
"Considering the agreed dynamic of the negotiation process, Macedonia's answer is not to be expected this week," a statement read.
Earlier, both Crvenkovski and Gruevski said the latest set of ideas was unacceptable without "major changes".
UN mediator Matthew Nimetz's latest proposal envisions the name "Republic of Northern Macedonia" being used internationally and a shortened variant -- "North Macedonia"-- for use at the UN.

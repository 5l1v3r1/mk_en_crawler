BELGRADE, Serbia -- The ministry of religion declared Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) Grand Mufti Mustafa Efendija Ceric persona non grata, media reported on Saturday (May 23rd). 
Last Monday, the grand mufti criticised a decision by Serbian police to ban a meeting of the Islamic community in Serbia that Ceric was supposed to attend. 
Ceric told media that Serbia violates "human rights, particularly those of Muslims". 
The Serbian ministry rejected the allegation, saying it financially supports Muslims' religious, cultural, educational and other needs. 
It also accused Ceric of supporting "Kosovo Albanians' secession".

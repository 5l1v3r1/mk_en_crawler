ATHENS, Greece -- Justice Minister Anastassis Papaligouras said on Friday (24 June) that authorities are investigating allegations that Greek volunteers fought on the side of Serb forces in BiH and might have been involved in the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
Answering a question from an opposition deputy in parliament, Papaligouras for the first time did not rule out the possibility, but stressed that no member of the Greek Army had been involved in the massacre.
Also Friday, the Greek government submitted to parliament a new draft law on immigration, seeking to simplify the complex migration legislation, reduce bureaucracy and regulate the status of thousands of illegal immigrants in the country.
It also tightens penalties for illegal immigration and human trafficking.
Illegal immigrants make up an estimated 10 per cent of the population.

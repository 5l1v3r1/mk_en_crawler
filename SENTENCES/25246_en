LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- President Boris Tadic said on Tuesday (September 29th) that Serbia could apply to become an official EU candidate this year. 
During a press conference in Ljubljana, where he is making an official visit, Tadic said authorities are weighing the best possible timing. 
External factors include the outcome of elections in Germany and Greece and the outcome of an Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, a document key to further EU enlargement.
On Tuesday, Tadic met with Slovenian counterpart Danilo Turk and attended a business conference, where he urged Slovenian companies to invest in Serbia.

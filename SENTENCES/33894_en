THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal announced Wednesday (12 November) that it would hear the appeal associated with its first Srebrenica verdict on 26 November and 27 November. 
Bosnian Serb General Radislav Krstic was sentenced to 46 years in prison for leading the troops who overran the enclave and murdered more than 7,000 Muslims. 
Both the defence and the prosecution are appealing the sentence. 
Prosecutors want to see Krstic sentenced to life in prison. 
Defence attorneys seek a new trial, citing new evidence that suggests he did not issue orders to carry out the atrocity.
In other news, Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic has accused UN prosecutors of not honouring an "understanding" that former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic would be granted provisional release because he surrendered voluntarily. 
The prosecution argued against his release at a recent hearing because he used his immunity from prosecution to evade justice for four years.

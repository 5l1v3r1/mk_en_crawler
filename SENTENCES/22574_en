BELGRADE, Serbia -- The European Commission (EC) will offer its first appraisal of whether to abolish visas for Serbian nationals next month, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Sunday (October 12th). 
He told the daily Blic that he welcomed progress made so far in visa liberalisation talks between Belgrade and Brussels, stressing further progress will depend mostly on the pace of reforms in Serbia.
He also encouraged Belgrade to start implementing its obligations under the Interim Trade Agreement, which is part of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU. 
Though signed in April, the accords remain frozen until Brussels deems Serbia is co-operating fully with The Hague war crimes tribunal.

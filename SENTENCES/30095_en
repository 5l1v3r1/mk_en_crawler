SKOPJE, Macedonia -- EU Representative to Macedonia Peter Sorensen said on Wednesday (May 18th) that the European Commission's assessment of implementing the visa-liberalisation regime in the region will become clear in June.
He was commenting on speculation that the visa-free regime could be suspended because of the influx of asylum applicants, mainly from Macedonia and Serbia.
Both were included in the so-called Schengen White List in late 2009.

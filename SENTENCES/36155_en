SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The central court in Sarajevo on Friday (12 March) convicted four Bosnian Serbs of forcing women into prostitution.
Milorad Milakovic was given nine years in prison.
He owned a bar and brothel in Prijedor where police found six girls from Moldova and Romania locked up in a room with bars on the windows.
SFOR troops had raided Milakovic's bar repeatedly during a campaign to root out human smuggling and prostitution.
He and the other suspects were arrested by the Bosnian Serb police last year.
Six others are awaiting trial in the same case.
Several other suspects, including Milakovic's wife and sons, have gone into hiding.

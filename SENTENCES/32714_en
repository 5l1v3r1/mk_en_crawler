SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in BiH, is warning newly sworn-in lawmakers that they need to reform the economy or "risk sleepwalking into disaster." Citing high unemployment, low growth and non-existent domestic investment, Ashdown said the influx of more than $5 billion in foreign aid since 1995 has not resulted in a boosted economy. 
He told politicians in Sarajevo that they had two to three years to make their country independent of foreign aid.
In other news, Ashdown is expected to intervene and impose a new BiH bill on dual citizenship after the BiH Parliament's House of Representatives rejected a draft Tuesday (17 December). 
The international community warns that failure would cause many BiH citizens living abroad to lose their citizenship.

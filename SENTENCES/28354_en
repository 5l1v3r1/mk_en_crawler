PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A prosecutor with EULEX, with the help of Kosovo police, has taken over the investigation of an attack against Kosovo Serb lawmaker Petar Miletic earlier this month, EULEX spokeswoman Karin Limdal said on Tuesday (July 13th).
Miletic was shot and wounded outside his house in Mitrovica on July 5th.
EULEX is also investigating the explosion that killed one man and injured 11 other people during a Serb protest in the divided town, prior the attack against Miletic.
Meanwhile, EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon said on Tuesday that no deadline has been set for the return of Serbian and Albanian judges and prosecutors to the Mitrovica District Court.
The court was originally expected to resume work in mid-July.
It closed more than two years ago, after Serbs clashed with international security forces and looted court files, following Kosovo's February 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia.

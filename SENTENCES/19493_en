PALE, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EU and NATO forces searched the homes of fugitive Radovan Karadzic's wife, daughter and neighbour on Thursday (March 27th). 
The raids, in the Bosnian town of Pale, were aimed at "putting pressure on networks" suspected of helping protect suspects, a EUFOR spokesman said. 
The Bosnian Serb wartime political leader, indicted in connection with the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of Muslim men and boys, has been on the run for 12 years now.
In the Serbian town of Nis, meanwhile, police and Intelligence and Security Agency staff conducted an operation Wednesday aimed at nabbing war crimes fugitive Stojan Zupljanin. 
The action ended without any arrests.

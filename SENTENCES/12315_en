ZAGREB, Croatia -- German and French ministers for European affairs Hans Martin Bury and Claudie Haignere stated that accession talks between Croatia and EU will not begin on 17 March unless fugitive war crimes indictee General Ante Gotovina is arrested and transferred to The Hague tribunal by then.
The ministers met on Thursday (10 February) in Zagreb with Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, President Stipe Mesic and Parliament Speaker Vladmir Seks.
They both acknowledged the progress Croatia has made in EU integration, but stressed that full co-operation with the war crimes tribunal remains a key issue.
In other news, the newspaper Vecernji List reported on Friday that Deputy Health Minister Neven Ljubicic would likely replace Health Minister Andrija Hebrang, who resigned last month after undergoing cancer surgery.

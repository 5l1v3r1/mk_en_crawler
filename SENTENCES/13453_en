ANKAR, Turkey -- A Turkish court on Thursday sentenced a writer and a journalist to pay heavy fines for insulting "Turkishness" and the state.
Zulkuf Kisanak received a five-month prison sentence, which was immediately converted to a fine of $2,200.
Aziz Ozer, editor of the monthly magazine Yeni Dunya Icin Cagri, received a ten-month sentence, which the judge later replaced with a $4,400 fine.
Also Thursday, Turkey continued the crackdown on smuggling and corruption at its border checkpoints.
In a sweeping move, officers arrested 86 customs officials and policemen at Kapikule, on the border with Bulgaria.
They will be charged with aiding an organisation that smuggles alcohol and cigarettes.

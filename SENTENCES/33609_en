PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova and KFOR Commander General Fabio Mini spent three hours Saturday (13 September) watching exercises carried out by units participating in Dynamic Response 2003 (DR03) at Camp Monteith, Gjilan.
The manoeuvres were aimed at increasing the rapid reaction capabilities of NATO troops in critical situations.
As a part of this exercise, German troops led by Major Jurgen Britz were stationed in the metal factory in Klina, setting up checkpoints and searching vehicles.
"Through DR03, NATO wants to demonstrate its commitment to peace and stability in the Balkans," Britz said.

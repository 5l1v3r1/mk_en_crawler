ZAGREB, Croatia -- Extraordinarily high waves caused floods in towns along the northern Adriatic coast Monday (December 1st).
Bakar, close to the Rijeka port, reported the highest waves since 1929.
Local authorities say the situation is under control.
The central coastal towns of Novigrad and Zadar also suffered flooding.
In other news, media reported on Monday that Croatian lawmakers are drafting a bill that will allow foreigners to buy property under the same conditions as local residents, effective in February.
The bill is part of Croatia's effort to bring its laws in line with European legislation.
The only exclusion would involve agricultural land situated in rural or forest zones.

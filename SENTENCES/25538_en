PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Election Complaints and Appeals Commission (ECAC) decided on Saturday (December 19th) that a revote must be held in three municipalities, after a large number of irregularities were confirmed.
ECAC chairperson Tahir Rrecaj said the panel has found falsification of voter lists, a larger number of votes than the number of registered voters, and family voting, a practice in which family members vote on behalf of relatives.
A revote will take place in Prizren, Gjilan and Lipjan where irregularities where confirmed at 50% of the polling stations, though no date has been announced.

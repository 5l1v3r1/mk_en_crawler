PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The leader of the main opposition Serb List political alliance, Andreja Mandic, was hospitalised on Saturday (October 25th) after nearly two weeks on a hunger strike. 
He launched it in the National Assembly building to protest recognition of Kosovo by Podgorica on October 13th. 
He and other opponents had demanded a referendum on the issue, something Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic rejects.

TIRANA, Albania -- The High Justice Council (HJC) announced on Sunday (March 9th) it is launching a personal assets declaration process that will apply to all judges in Albania, in an effort to uncover possible corruption.
Declarations will be submitted by March 31st.
The legal director of the HJC, Ana Shkembi, urged judges to fill out the asset declaration forms accurately since the council will verify them.
"At first it will shed a light on judges' assets and will then confirm any wrongdoing," Shkembi said.
Experts say if corruption is addressed, it will begin to change the common public perception that the justice system is corrupt and incapable of fighting crime.

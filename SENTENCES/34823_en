ZAGREB, Croatia -- Representatives of the Vatican, the local Catholic Church and the Croatian Ministry of Defence opened the building of the Military Ordinariate in Zagreb on Tuesday (5 August).
The Vatican and local authorities established the ordinariate in 1996 to provide spiritual counselling to Catholics in the Croatian armed forces and the police.
The Vatican's Secretary of the Congregation of Bishops, Archbishop Francesco Monterisi, blessed the building and unveiled a monument of Pope John Paul II.
A message from the Pope and statements of local defence officials stressed the importance of the initiative for promoting co-operation between the state and the church.

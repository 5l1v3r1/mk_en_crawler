NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias has sent a letter to all EU member states warning that Cyprus will be forced to block Turkey's bid to join the bloc unless Ankara meets all its commitments regarding Nicosia, the government announced on Wednesday (November 25th), confirming earlier media reports.
In particular, Nicosia wants Turkey to recognise all ten countries that became members in 2004, including Cyprus.
Christofias sent his letter ahead of a European Council summit next month, which is expected to assess Turkey's progress in meeting its obligations.
Earlier media reports suggested that Christofias urged Turkey in his letter to contribute to finding a solution to the long-standing Cypriot issue.
Responding to the letter Wednesday, Turkish President Abdullah Gul said that Ankara's stance is perfectly clear -- "all restrictions should be lifted simultaneously." "Turkey will lift all restrictions it has currently imposed on Greek Cypriots only after the restrictions imposed on Turkish Cypriots are removed." (Financial Mirror - 26/11/09;

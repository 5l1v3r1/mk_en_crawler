BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus said Monday (27 March) that it is uncertain whether negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU will continue after 5 April. 
Brussels has made full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal -- including the handover of top indictee Ratko Mladic -- a condition for going on with the process, Labus noted. 
The government must do everything possible to fulfil the condition as "Serbia's place is in Europe", he said.
Visiting Sweden on Monday, Serbian President Boris Tadic said the Mladic case is difficult and that Belgrade needs the international community's "understanding" and "support".
Also Monday, Defence Minister Zoran Stankovic confirmed that a group of about 50 defence officials has conspired to protect Mladic from arrest. 
The findings were included in a secret intelligence report prepared for the government in January.

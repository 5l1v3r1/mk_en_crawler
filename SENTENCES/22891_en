In The Hague, meanwhile, former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic testified on Wednesday on behalf of his former ally, Momcilo Krajisnik, who is appealing a 27-year prison sentence handed down by the UN war crimes tribunal.
It convicted him of involvement in an ethnic cleansing campaign that killed an estimated 100,000 Bosnian Muslims and Croats and banished 2.2 million from their homes in Bosnia during the 1992-1995 conflict.

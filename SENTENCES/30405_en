TIRANA, Albania -- Economy and Trade Minister Ilir Meta resigned Friday (January 14th) after a local television channel broadcast video footage that purportedly showed him trying to influence a government tender.
"This is my personal choice and it is irrevocable.
I cannot present myself as deputy prime minister or minister at the prosecution," Meta said, announcing the decision.
Meta became economy minister last September, replacing Dritan Prifti, who resigned amid corruption allegations.
In the controversial video, broadcast by Top Channel on Tuesday, he appeared to be shown pressing Prifti to grant a public tender for a hydropower plant to one of his friends.

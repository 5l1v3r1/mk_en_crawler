SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski says he will not accept the resignation tendered by Transport Minister Mile Janakievski over the deadly incident on Lake Ohrid, local media reported Wednesday (September 9th).
Janakievski resigned shortly after an overloaded boat sank on Saturday, killing 15 Bulgarian tourists.
According to Gruevski, Janakievski is not directly responsible for the tragedy.
Hundreds of people paid their final respects Wednesday to the victims.
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Rumyana Zheleva and her Macedonian counterpart, Antonio Milososki, attended a ceremony in the Bulgarian town of Pirdop.
Ohrid Mayor Aleksandar Petreski and other local authorities were also on hand.

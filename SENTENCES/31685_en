ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS) held a news conference Sunday (12 January) and urged state authorities to call immediate early elections.
The party left the ruling coalition and moved into opposition in July over the government's relations with the UN war crimes tribunal and joint ownership with Slovenia of the Krsko nuclear plant.
HSLS leader Drazen Budisa said the political situation will worsen in coming days and that labour unions might stage a general strike protesting the ruling coalition's social policy.
He presented a plan for establishing a fund to manage state-owned properties and to run privatisation deals.

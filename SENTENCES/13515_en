ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia's President Stipe Mesic on Saturday (25 March) denied media allegations about a drastic increase in the staff employed in his office.
According to Mesic, reports which said the number of personnel had nearly doubled since 2000 were "pure speculation" and an attempt to discredit him.
On the contrary, Mesic said, the size of the presidential staff has been halved during his term.

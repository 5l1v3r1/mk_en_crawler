SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia's ruling VMRO-DPMNE has selected the largest ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic Union of Integration (DUI), as its partner in the future Macedonian cabinet, the VMRO-DPMNE press office said on Saturday (July 5th).
DUI rival, the Democratic Party of Albanians, will remain in opposition.
The VMRO-DMPNE and DUI agreed their priorities would be attaining NATO membership, currently blocked by the name dispute with Greece, and EU candidate status.

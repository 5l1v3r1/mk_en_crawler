NEW YORK, United States -- Martti Ahtisaari, the chief UN mediator in the Kosovo status talks, said on Friday (14 July) that he is planning a summit later this month between the government leaders of Serbia and Kosovo. 
The focus of the meeting would be to set the stage for the discussions on the future of the province -- talks have so far focused on technical and security issues.
EU security chief Javier Solana and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn are due to brief the Union's foreign ministers on the situation in Kosovo on Monday. 
The ministers are expected to express concern over the slow pace of the talks on the province's future status.
In other news, Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku presented a report to parliament Friday, summarising his government's first 100 days in office. 
As main priorities he cited the status negotiations, the realisation of internationally set standards and confidence building measures. 
The opposition accused Ceku of claiming achievements made over the past three to four years as his own.

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- EU security chief Javier Solana told Slovenia and Croatia on Tuesday (28 September) that they must engage in dialogue to settle their dispute over territorial waters in Piran Bay. 
Speaking just a few days after Ljubljana formally withdrew its support for Zagreb's EU membership bid, Solana assured Balkan nations that the way to the EU remains open for them. 
He also reminded Slovenia that as the first country in the Balkans to join the EU and NATO, it is obliged "to show the way to other states from the region".
The Croatian town of Pula meanwhile is hosting a meeting of the Southeast Europe Emergency Planning Council. 
Representatives from 11 countries are attending.

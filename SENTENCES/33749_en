ZAGREB, Croatia -- Leaders of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) held talks with the Croatian Pensioners' Party Saturday (29 November) seeking support for forming a new coalition government. 
HDZ deputy leader Jadranka Kosor told reporters the meeting would continue Monday and might result in a partnership agreement. 
HDZ, which won the country's general elections a week ago, hopes to get a majority vote in the parliament by teaming up with the Croatian Peasants' Party (HSS). 
HSS leader Zlatko Tomcic refuted allegations that party members might leave due to a possible coalition with HDZ.
On a related note, President Stipe Mesic said the recent parliamentary elections were a major step forward in the democratic development of the country.

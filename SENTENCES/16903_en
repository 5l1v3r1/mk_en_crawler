KOMOTINI, Greece -- Officials say border police arrested 38 Indian immigrants and two men suspected of smuggling them into the country near the Turkish border on Thursday (3 August).
The immigrants, all young men, were hidden in a truck with Albanian plates.
The drivers, one Albanian man and one Greek, allegedly received nearly 90,000 euros to get the immigrants to Athens.
They were arrested 10km from the border near Sapes, in the northeast, during a routine check.
Greece is a popular entry point for thousands of would-be immigrants from Asia seeking access to Western Europe, mainly through Turkey.

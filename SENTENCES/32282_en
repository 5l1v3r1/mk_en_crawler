SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament locked horns with the government Thursday (3 October) after adopting a declaration on the decommissioning of old nuclear units at the Kozloduy nuclear plant. 
Lawmakers insist that the reactors be closed only after Bulgaria becomes a member of the EU, which is likely in 2007 at the earliest. 
But earlier this week, the cabinet announced that it would agree to the EU's deadline of 2006 as the closure date, in a bid to close the energy chapter in accession negotiations and eventually open it at a later stage, if it is able to negotiate better terms. 
The opposition in parliament has threatened to hold a no confidence vote if the cabinet does not change its view.

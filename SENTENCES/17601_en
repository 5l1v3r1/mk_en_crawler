PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Croatian prosecutors submitted evidence Wednesday (March 28th) to Podgorica regarding alleged war crimes committed by ten Montenegrin citizens at the Morinj camp in late 1991. 
The Montenegrin prosecutor's office says the charges followed an investigation by Dubrovnik county authorities and refer to the detention and torture of Croats in Morinj. 
Prosecutors in Podgorica must now decide whether there are grounds for criminal proceedings.
In other news, the trial against five former Croat paramilitary members, accused of war crimes against ethnic Serb civilians, opened at the Vukovar court on Wednesday. 
They are charged in connection with the 1992 murders of a Serb couple and their two children in Vinkovci. 
One defendant pleaded guilty to not preventing the murder, while the other four pleaded not guilty.

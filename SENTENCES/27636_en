ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Monday (October 25th) that the government might be forced to organise snap elections amid the budget crisis if his PASOK party loses next month's local elections.
Saying he, personally, "has no intention of organising national elections", Papandreou noted in a televised interview that "if the situation prevents the government from implementing the necessary reforms, then the Greek people should make a decision." Papandreou urged the public to support his austerity measures when they vote on November 7th.
"If we don't continue the necessary reforms, all efforts will be in vain and we will return to the past, and things will get even worse.
We were only several days, maybe hours away from bankruptcy, but this did not happen and we saved the country," he added.

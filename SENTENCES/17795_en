TIRANA, Albania -- Ben Blushi was appointed as the new chairman of the main opposition Socialist Party's (SP) parliamentary caucus, during a SP meeting Tuesday (April 17th). 
Blushi, who was SP political secretary, fills the spot left by the resignation of Pandeli Majko. 
He stepped down as both SP caucus head and SP secretary general earlier this month amid a continuing party rift.

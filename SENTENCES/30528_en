ATHENS, Greece -- Public transport workers launched a 24-hour strike Thursday (January 13th) in defiance of a court order that ruled the action illegal. 
About 2,000 people joined a rally in front of the parliament building, which ended peacefully. 
The protest, which halted most transport services in the city, was prompted by government plans to restructure money-losing companies via job cuts and higher fares. 
As of February 1st, the price of a ticket for public transport will rise from 1 euro to 1.40 euros.
In other news Thursday, police arrested four people suspected of links to the terror group Conspiracy Nuclei of Fire. 
The group is believed responsible for several attacks, including a blast in front of a court house in Athens last month and a series of parcel bombs that were sent to embassies across Europe. 
As part of Thursday's operation, police raided several apartments and garages in Athens and Thessaloniki looking for weapons and explosives.

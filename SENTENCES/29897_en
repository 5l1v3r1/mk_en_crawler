ATHENS, Greece -- The government announced on Monday (January 24th) it will take legal action against the German electronics giant Siemens over allegedly bribing officials.
"Greece will seek compensation for the damage it has suffered from the corrupt practices that have been used by your company in the past," Investment Minister Haris Pamboukis wrote in a letter to the German company's Greek subsidiary, Siemens Hellas.
A parliamentary investigation spanning 11 months concluded that Greek taxpayers suffered losses worth 2 billion euros because of the alleged bribery between 1997 and 2002.
Last year, former Transport Minister Anastasios Mantelis admitted receiving one bribe of 100,000 euros in 1998.
Other ministers who allegedly took bribes may be identified soon.

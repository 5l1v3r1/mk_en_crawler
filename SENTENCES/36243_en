ATHENS, Greece -- Greek Foreign Minister Tassos Giannitsis expressed optimism about the prospects of resolving the dispute over Cyprus before the Greek part of the island officially becomes EU member on 1 May. 
Giannitsis made the statement on Tuesday (2 March) after a meeting with US State Department Special Co-ordinator for Cyprus Thomas Weston. 
The officials did not comment on specifics, as UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has asked all sides involved to avoid doing so during the sensitive negotiations process.

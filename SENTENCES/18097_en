BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki told the Turkish ambassador to Baghdad that his government is concerned about attacks by the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and is determined to stop them. 
Ambassador Derya Kanbay met with Maliki on Sunday (June 17th) to deliver a letter from Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, inviting his Iraqi counterpart to visit Ankara. 
No date has been set yet.
Also Sunday, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, a Kurdish member of the government, urged Turkey not to launch any military operation against the PKK in northern Iraq. 
He said military intervention could destabilise what he described as the only relatively peaceful region of the country.
Meanwhile, in an interview published by The Guardian Monday, a top PKK commander warned that Turkey faces "a political and military disaster" if launches a campaign against the terror group's bases. 
Such a campaign could become a "quagmire for them and create space for Iran to interfere in Iraq also", said Bayik, speaking from a hideout in the Qandil mountains.

VILNIUS, Lithuania -- The Lithuanian Parliament on Thursday (30 March) ratified the EU Accession Treaty with Bulgaria and Romania, sealed last April. 
The document was approved with 85 votes in favour and one against, with three abstentions. 
Lithuania is the 15th EU member state to formally endorse the accession of the two Balkan states, scheduled for 1 January 2007.
Also Thursday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn announced that he will present on Monday a preliminary assessment of the level of preparedness of Bulgaria and Romania for EU accession. 
Rehn is expected to address the European Parliament's external relations committee. 
He will introduce the preliminary conclusions of the European Commission, including its recommendation on whether to apply a safeguard clause that would delay EU entry by one year.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- About 100 Serbs demonstrated on Monday (September 7th) in the northern part of divided Mitrovica against the reconstruction of Albanian houses and against the EULEX mission. 
The crowd, organised by the Kosovo Serb National Council, dispersed peacefully after staging a 30-minute protest.
In other news Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said that the announced police co-operation agreement between EULEX and Serbia has been discussed at a meeting of parliament's committee on foreign affairs. 
"I think that we will always say 'no' to the current form of the protocol. 
It is about protection of the national interest," Kuci stressed.

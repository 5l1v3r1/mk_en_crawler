TIRANA, Albania -- The outcome of the May 8th mayoral election in Tirana took a turn after the Central Election Commission (CEC) decided on Wednesday (May 18th) to count ballots cast in other boxes by mistake. 
With 20 boxes opened, ruling Democratic Party (DP) candidate Lulzim Basha has taken the lead from incumbent Edi Rama, head of the opposition Socialist Party (SP). 
As of Tuesday, he had been clinging to a razor thin ten-vote lead.
The CEC meeting turned into a marathon session, with police blocking the entrance of the building to prevent unauthorised people, including SP lawmakers, from participating in dsicussions. 
Later, Rama urged the public to join a mass protest to protect the vote, which he says was "stolen by the CEC". 
SP lawmaker Gramoz Ruci said the CEC broke the law by counting the misdirected votes and suggested the only solution is for the people to hit the streets. 
Police filed a suit against him and another MP, Erion Brace, for issuing a "public call for violent actions".
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton issued a statement Wednesday, urging politicians to complete the election process in a peaceful and constructive manner.

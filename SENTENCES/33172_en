BUCHAREST, Romania -- The intelligence service reported on Thursday (15 May) that it thwarted plans for Iraqi terrorist attacks involving grenade launchers in the months before the start of the US-led campaign against Saddam Hussein's regime.
The service did not provide further details, but a senior lawmaker told a local TV station that the US and Israeli embassies were among the targets.
Bucharest responded to the threat by expelling ten Iraqi diplomats and 31 other people, and by tightening security at the country's nuclear plant and at diplomatic missions in the capital.

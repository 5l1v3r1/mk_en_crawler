PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The European Commission (EC) Liaison Office in Pristina will support the government in conducting a national census, head of mission Renzo Daviddi said on Wednesday (May 5th) after a meeting with Minister of Public Administration Edita Tahiri. 
They discussed the technicalities of the census, which is planned for spring 2011. 
"We will be committed to reaching results which will also be internationally recognised," Tahiri said. 
In 2000, the Statistical Office of Kosovo conducted a census that Serbia refused to recognise. 
The last census recognised by both Albanians and Serbs was held during the 1980s.

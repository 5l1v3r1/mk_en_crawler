STRASBOURG, France -- The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) endorsed a resolution Tuesday (21 June) calling on Belgrade and Pristina to open a true dialogue on the future status of Kosovo. 
The document, parts of which were cited by the Serbian media, urged the Serbia-Montenegro authorities and the Kosovo interim institutions as well as Kosovo's Albanian and Serb parties to start discussions and achieve a mutually acceptable solution. 
It was emphasised that compromise would be possible only with concessions from each side. 
The resolution also voiced PACE's concern about the continued lack of trust among the separate ethnic communities in the province.

ATHENS, Greece -- Officials said that three bomb blasts in downtown Athens Wednesday (5 May) were the work of anarchists and other local extremists, and had no bearing on the Olympics. 
Public Order Minister George Voulgarakis, who discussed Olympic security during a meeting in Washington with Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, said the incident would not affect preparations in Athens. 
Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis called the blasts an "isolated incident", while the International Olympic Committee said there is nothing to suggest that the bombings were related to the Games.

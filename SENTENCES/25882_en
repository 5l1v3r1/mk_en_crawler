ANKARA, Turkey -- Police used tear gas and water cannons Wednesday (August 19th) to disperse a group of Kurdish protesters in the town of Nusaybin, in Mardin province. 
Around 100 people, most of them children, had gathered to protest the recent arrest of seven members of the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party. 
They set tires on fire and threw stones at the police. 
Two minors were detained and police are searching for other participants in the demonstration.
Meanwhile, President Abdullah Gul on Wednesday dismissed any "roadmap" imprisoned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan plans to offer, saying he is not a partner for peace. 
The document was initially supposed to be released on August 15th to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the Kurdish insurgency, but Ocalan has postponed its publication.

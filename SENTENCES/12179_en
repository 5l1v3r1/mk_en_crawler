ATHENS, Greece -- Karolos Papoulias, 75, was sworn in as president on Saturday (12 March). 
The former Socialist foreign minister and lawmaker was nominated by the ruling conservatives and won an unprecedented 279 votes in the 300-seat parliament when he was elected last month. 
Papoulias succeeds Costis Stephanopoulos. 
In a rare move, some deputies boycotted the ceremony to protest the presence of Archbishop Christodoulos, leader of the Greek Orthodox Church, which has been heavily criticised following a spate of sex and corruption scandals.

NEW YORK, United States -- UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte urged the UN Security Council to force Yugoslavia to arrest 11 suspects believed to be hiding on its territory. 
During an address to the UN's top body on Thursday (31 October), she called on the EU to make co-operation with the tribunal a condition for Yugoslavia's accession and asked NATO not to admit the country into its Partnership for Peace programme until it complies with the court's orders. 
Del Ponte also urged NATO to form a special task force to track down and arrest Radovan Karadzic in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
She described the Council's response as "very positive." A resolution against Yugoslavia did not appear likely in the immediate future, however, as both the Russian and Chinese ambassadors expressed reservations.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Justice Minister Drazen Bosnjakovic meets on Wednesday (January 12th) in Zagreb with Serbian counterpart Snezana Malovic to discuss the case of Tihomir Purda. 
The war veteran was arrested in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) last week, based on a warrant issued by Serbia for alleged war crimes committed in Vukovar in 1991. 
The two justice ministers will chair a meeting of a joint commission dealing with issues involving war crimes suspects. 
A decision on whether to request Purda's extradition will be made after Wednesday's meeting. 
His lawyer says Purda opposes extradition to Serbia as he does not believe he could receive a fair trial there.

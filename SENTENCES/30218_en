TIRANA, Albania -- EULEX prosecutor Isabelle Arnal was in Tirana on Monday (January 17th) for a series of meetings about starting an investigation into allegations of human trafficking in Kosovo and Albania. 
Arnal met with state prosecutor Ina Rama to discuss a report by Council of Europe Rapporteur Dick Marty alleging incumbent Prime Minister Hashim Thaci led illegal activities during the 1990s. 
Arnal and Rama agreed to co-ordinate their investigations.
In other news Tuesday, Marty said in an interview with RTK that his report does not claim Thaci was directly involved in trafficking. 
He added however that people close to Thaci participated in it and it would be hard to believe that Thaci never heard about it. 
Marty also rejected allegations that his report was based on investigations and information provided by Serbia.

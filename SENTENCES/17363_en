ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government sailed through a no confidence vote Thursday (June 28th).
The two main opposition parties, the Social Democratic Party and Croatia's People's Party, filed the motion citing what they described as a total failure of supervision at the Croatian Privatisation Fund (HFP).
Vincent Degert, head of the European Commission (EC) delegation in Croatia, says the EC is watching ongoing corruption investigations closely, including the so-called Maestro operation that uncovered issues at the HFP.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Kosovo and Serbia can talk only as two sovereign states and only on issues related to inter-state interests, leaders in Pristina said on Monday (September 21st). 
Reacting to a statement from Belgrade on possible future talks, held after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) delivers its verdict on the legality of Kosovo's independence, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said the ICJ's ruling should not be politicised. 
He also voiced confidence in Pristina's case. 
"We have a strong and professional team made up of locals and internationals that will represent Kosovo's right and this right will win," Thaci said.

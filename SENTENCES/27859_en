BELGRADE, Serbia -- IMF mission head Albert Jaeger praised the government's prudent fiscal policy on Monday (August 23rd), and stressed the importance of adopting a law on fiscal responsibility. 
However, Jaeger rejected Economy Minister Mladjan Dinkic's proposal to raise public wages and pensions as early as next month due to the lower than expected government deficit. 
He urged that instead, Serbia's agreement with the IMF regarding public wages should be respected until it expires in April 2011 -- a position shared by Finance Minister Diana Dragutinovic and National Bank of Serbia Governor Dejan Soskic. 
Talks between government officials and the IMF on the fifth review of the 2.9 billion-euro stand-by agreement started on Monday and will continue until the end of the month.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Dirk Lange, head of the Romanian Unit of the European Commission Enlargement Directorate General, said Thursday (22 April) that completing EU accession negotiations with Romania by the end of this year remains an achievable goal.
Lange met with European Integration Minister Alexandru Farcas and with Romania's chief negotiator with the EU, Vasile Puscas.
Lange said his optimism is due largely to the public sentiment towards EU accession and a perceived willingness to implement necessary reforms.

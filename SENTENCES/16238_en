SOFIA, Bulgaria -- EU spokesman Ferran Tarradellas said on Tuesday (November 14th) that the European Commission (EC) should have the final word regarding Bulgaria's plans to build a second nuclear plant in Belene. 
Tarradellas explained that, under the EURATOM treaty, the construction of any nuclear plant must be approved by the EC three months before construction begins. 
The issue arose when Bulgaria announced recently that it had chosen the Russian firm Atomstroyexport as the contractor. 
Tarradellas stressed that if all EU requirements are met, the EC would likely grant approval.

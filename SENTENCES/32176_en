ANKARA, Turkey -- The leader of Turkey's new ruling party headed for Rome on Wednesday (13 November) to meet with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and others. 
Justice and Development Party (AKP) leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan says he will assure Italian officials of his country's commitment to pursuing political and economic reforms that will bring it closer to EU membership. 
He also warned that a refusal by the Union to set a date for the start of accession talks would cause widespread disillusionment and scepticism among his fellow countrymen. 
EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen said Tuesday that Turkey would be eligible for membership after meeting its criteria.
In separate news, The New York Times reported Tuesday that Iraqi officials approached a Turkish company about buying a large quantity of atropine, a chemical that has common medical applications, but can also be used as an antidote for certain types of nerve agents. 
US Secretary of State Colin Powell and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan want Iraq prevented from purchasing amounts greater than those deemed medically necessary. 
The Turkish company insists it has had no contacts with Iraq. 
Meanwhile, acting CIA Deputy Director John E. 
McLaughlin travelled to Turkey this week to discuss possible US action against Iraq and the use of Turkey's air bases.

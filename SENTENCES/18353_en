LONDON, Great Britain -- A new report by Amnesty International has criticised Greece for failing to efficiently tackle the problem of sex trafficking involving women and children. 
The document, officially released on Tuesday (June 12th), suggests trafficking increased tenfold from 1990 to 1997, with thousands of victims brought from Eastern Europe and Africa to Greece. 
Authorities then failed to provide them with protection and support, the report said. 
It urged Athens to strengthen protection mechanisms and remove a current requirement that obliges victims to testify against traffickers in order to receive aid.

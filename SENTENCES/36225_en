SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR announced Thursday (4 March) that its troops have arrested a Bosnian Serb general as part of a large-scale clampdown on the network allegedly supporting fugitive Radovan Karadzic. 
General Bogdan Subotic was a military aide to the former Bosnian Serb leader. 
He briefly held the post of Bosnian Serb defence minister and is now an adviser to the Bosnian Serb presidency. 
The peacekeepers said they were acting on information collected in raids over the past few weeks. 
Subotic's bank accounts were blocked because of suspected ties to Karadzic.
In other news, US Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Pierre-Richard Prosper told the Bosnian Serb parliament that Republika Srpska faces international sanctions if it fails to arrest Karadzic and his wartime commander, Ratko Mladic. 
"There are persons in political structures, and probably persons sitting in this very chamber, who have the ability to end this problem now by bringing Karadzic and Mladic to justice," he said.
Meanwhile, SFOR conducted a surprise inspection of Telecom Srpske's premises in Banja Luka on Thursday. 
SFOR said it was a routine operation, in line with its mandate.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Newly appointed Supreme Court Chairwoman Vesna Medenica has issued a June 1st deadline for judges in all courts to finalise trials related to corruption and organised crime. 
She sent a personal note to the courts Thursday (January 17th), saying any judge who fails to meet the deadline must explain in writing the reasons for the delay. 
Medenica hopes this will unblock the huge backlog of cases, some of which have dragged on for years.

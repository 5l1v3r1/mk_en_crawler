PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government is working with its international partners to get more countries to recognise its independence, as well as to drum up political support in the UN General Assembly. 
This support would derail adoption of a draft resolution proposed by Serbia, which aims to open new talks on Kosovo's status. 
"We hope that additional recognitions will happen before the UN General Assembly meeting in September. 
But this process is also linked to the political support that we might get from countries which have already recognised Kosovo," Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said on Monday (August 9th). 
Ted Carpenter, vice-president for defence and foreign policy studies at the Washington-based Cato Institute, told the BBC that the United States will try to prevent the adoption of the resolution submitted by Serbia, though the move would affect relations between Washington and Belgrade.

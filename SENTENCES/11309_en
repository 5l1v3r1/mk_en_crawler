ZAGREB, Croatia -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte repeated in a statement for Austrian TV on Wednesday (23 February) her belief that war crimes indictee General Ante Gotovina remains in Croatia. 
She said certain circles there are helping him evade justice.
According to press reports, Croatian President Stipe Mesic and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader sent letters Wednesday to the leaders of France and Germany, reiterating that Croatian authorities were doing their best to locate and detain Gotovina. 
He must be in custody by 17 March for the EU to launch membership talks with Croatia as scheduled.

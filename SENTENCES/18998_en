SOFIA, Bulgaria -- New EU Commissioner Meglena Kuneva, who is in charge of consumer protection, suggested on Wednesday (January 3rd) that the recent closure of two reactors at the Kozloduy nuclear plant could be reconsidered, if there is support within the EU.
Her comment came during the opening of the new European Commission (EC) Representation in Sofia, which replaced the former EC Delegation after Bulgaria's EU entry earlier this week.
According to Kuneva, the issue could be reviewed as early as February 15th, when the EU Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council holds its first meeting of the year.
Kozloduy's two older units were switched off the last day of 2006, in line with Bulgaria's pre-accession deal with the EU.

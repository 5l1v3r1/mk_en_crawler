BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police in Belgrade seized 120kg of pure heroin Friday (October 22nd) and arrested two suspected drug traffickers. 
The drugs' estimated value is about 10m euros. 
At a press conference, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic described it as the biggest single drug seizure in Belgrade so far and said the police operation continues and new arrests are possible. 
The heroin, apparently headed for markets in Western Europe, was found in a truck travelling from Istanbul to the Czech Republic.

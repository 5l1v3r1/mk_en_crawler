PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Transport and Telecommunications Minister Fatmir Limaj accused Serbia on Tuesday (December 16th) of violating Kosovo's sovereignty by operating a rail line between Lesak in Serbia and Zvecan in northern Kosovo.
Limaj said he sent a letter to EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon to request immediate measures to stop the "illegal trains coming from Serbia".
EULEX says overseeing the railway connections falls outside its responsibilities, as it is only a technical mission.
UNMIK says it is no longer responsible for this matter.
In other news, EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon visited the divided town of Mitrovica on Tuesday.
He vowed EULEX would not interfere with issues related to Kosovo's status, as they are of political nature and are unrelated to the mission's technical character.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The OSCE says courts in Kosovo are failing to appropriately judge cases involving divorce and foster children.
Harold Dampier, head of the OSCE's Legal System Monitoring Section, said at a roundtable Tuesday (March 22nd) that this failure violates the legal framework in Kosovo.
Dampier warned that it may also violate international standards for human and children's rights.
Peja/Pec District Court judge Ymer Jahmurataj disputes the criticism, saying that out of 1,600 such cases submitted to the court, 654 were resolved successfully.

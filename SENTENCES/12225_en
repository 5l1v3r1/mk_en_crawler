SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Thousands of people lined Sarajevo's streets on Saturday (9 July) to pay their last respects to 610 Bosnian Muslims whose remains were taken to Srebrenica for burial. 
The victims, aged between 14 and 75, will be laid to rest in a memorial cemetery on Monday, during a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre. 
Some 1,300 of the victims of Europe's worst atrocity since World War II have already been buried at the site. 
Some 50,000 people are expected to gather in Srebrenica, including British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and Serbian President Boris Tadic, the first senior Belgrade official to go there.

MADRID, Spain -- NATO has positively assessed efforts by Serbian authorities to fight crime and political extremism while advancing armed forces reform.
During the NATO summit in Madrid Tuesday (3 June), the Alliance's foreign ministers spoke highly of military restructuring, especially the transfer of army control to civilians.
The ministers said military reforms and the successful fight against organised crime are paving the way towards accession into NATO's Partnership for Peace programme as well as other Euro-Atlantic structures.
NATO also praised the increased war crimes co-operation efforts, but said more is needed.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Popular folk singer Ibrahim Tatlises on Thursday (April 21st) withdrew his candidacy from the June 12th general elections citing health problems. 
The singer issued a statement from a hospital in Germany, where he is being treated after being shot in the head last month. 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan had invited him to join the race from the ranks of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). 
Later, however, the singer said he would run as an independent because the AKP's lists were already full.

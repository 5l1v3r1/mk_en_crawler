SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The opposition Union of Democratic Forces nominated Plamen Oresharski on Sunday (25 May) to run as its candidate for mayor of Sofia. 
Oresharski is a deputy chairman of the party and a former deputy finance minister. 
The only other official candidate is incumbent Stefan Sofiyanski, who is completing his second term. 
The leftist opposition Socialist Party has not yet nominated a candidate.
In other news, Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg returned Sunday from a three-day trip to Italy, where his counterpart Silvio Berlusconi pledged to support Bulgaria's EU integration efforts. 
Italy's support could be crucial, Saxe-Coburg indicated, since the country is next in line to assume the Union's rotating presidency.

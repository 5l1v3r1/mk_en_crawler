TETOVO, Macedonia -- On Wednesday (23 April), Democratic Union of Integration leader Ali Ahmeti met with Arben Xhaferri, leader of the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA). 
The topic was DPA's decision to boycott parliament, in protest of what it described as the stalled implementation of the Ohrid peace accord. 
Ahmeti failed to convince Xhaferri to reconsider, but said he believes political dialogue will continue.

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- The two candidates who will advance to Sunday's (13 October) presidential run-off election will hold a televised debate Wednesday night. 
Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica and Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister signed an agreement Monday. 
Kostunica had refused to debate until now, despite repeated invitations from Labus.
In other news, Belgrade's co-ordinator on Kosovo, Nebojsa Covic, proposed changes Monday to UNMIK chief Michael Steiner's plan to stabilise Mitrovica. 
The plan has been widely accepted by the international community and ethnic Albanians, but faced objections from Belgrade. 
Covic proposed the incorporation of eight principles, focusing primarily on decentralisation and local autonomy.

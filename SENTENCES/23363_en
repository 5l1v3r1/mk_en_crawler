TIRANA, Albania -- About 3.1 million eligible voters are set to vote in the parliamentary elections in Albania today (June 28th). 
Some 3,400 candidates from 34 political parties are vying for 140 parliamentary seats. 
Political analysts expect a tight race between Prime Minister Sali Berisha's ruling Democratic Party and the main opposition Socialists, led by Tirana Mayor Edi Rama. 
Both the United States and the EU urged Albania to hold fair elections to boost its chances for closer ties with the West.

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Serbian Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic said Wednesday (30 October) that authorities have uncovered a "terrorist network" that plotted to kill Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic and opposition figure Vojislav Seselj as part of a plan to destabilise the country.
It also targeted two senior interior ministry officials and a former security chief.
According to Belgrade media sources, some 30 suspects have been arrested so far.
The network started to unravel after the assassination of police chief Gen Bosko Buha on 10 June.
The group reportedly had close ties to senior figures of the Milosevic regime and to paramilitary groups responsible for atrocities in Bosnia and Kosovo.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A ferry with around 100 people aboard sank near Turkey's northwestern port of Bandirma, killing at least one person. 
About 25 are missing, authorities said on Monday (September 15th). 
Officials said 76 people have been rescued, nearly half of them injured. 
The ferry went down in the Sea of Marmara shortly after leaving Bandirma for Istanbul, Bandirma Governor Selahattin Hatipoglu told reporters. 
Most of the passengers jumped into the sea, but authorities fear others may have been inside their vehicles when the ferry sank. 
Strong waves and winds are hindering search efforts.

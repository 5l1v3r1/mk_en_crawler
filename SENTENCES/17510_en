NOVI SAD, Serbia -- The head of the European Parliament's (EP) Committee for Southeast Europe, Doris Pack, called on Serbian President Boris Tadic to fulfil pledges made regarding co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
Pack, who attended an event called "European Parliament of Youth" in Novi Sad on Sunday (May 20th), said co-operation is even more Tadic's responsibility now that he is also the chairman of the Serbian Council for National Security.
On Saturday, Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic insisted that the police hunt for war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic last week was not for show. 
Some opponents in Parliament have questioned its legitimacy, as it coincided with a session to elect the new government.

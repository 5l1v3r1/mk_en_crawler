NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Pope Benedict XVI leaves on Friday (June 4th) for a historic three-day visit to Cyprus, the first pope to visit the island in modern times.
During the trip, Benedict will deliver a working document ahead of a Rome meeting of Middle Eastern synods in October.
The week has been a tense one in the region, starting with Monday's Israeli raid on a flotilla of ships carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza and followed by Thursday's deadly stabbing of a Catholic priest in Turkey.
Authorities on Friday charged the bishop's driver with the murder.
They say he battles severe depression.

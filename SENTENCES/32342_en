SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Council of Ministers expressed deep concern Thursday (31 October) over indications that there were other companies besides Orao involved in violations of the UN embargo. 
According to some reports, arms and military equipment were exported not only to Iraq, but to other countries under UN embargo, said Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations Azra Hadziahmetovic. 
The government insisted that all institutions in the country should investigate the issue by the end of the year and publish preliminary findings by 15 November. 
Burma and Libya were two other countries mentioned.

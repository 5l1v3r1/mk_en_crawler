THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Serbian nationalist politician Vojislav Seselj pleaded not guilty Tuesday (25 March) to 14 counts of crimes against humanity and violating the laws and customs of war, stemming from atrocities his volunteers allegedly committed in BiH, Croatia, and Vojvodina between 1991 and 1995.
Seselj, who is a lawyer, refused to hire defence counsel or accept a court-appointed attorney.
In other news, Slobodan Milosevic's trial has been delayed until Thursday because of a dispute over medicines prescribed to him.
Milosevic had refused to take them on the advice of his personal doctor in Belgrade.

TIRANA, Albania -- Sofia-based Belgian Ambassador to Albania, Marc Michielsen, whose country assumed the EU's rotating presidency on July 1st, told journalists in Tirana on Monday (July 12th) that politicians should work to overcome the longstanding stalemate before November, when the EU is expected to publish its progress report on Albania. 
"We have expressed our concern about the political situation in Albania, as well as the failure to resolve issues left from last year's elections ... 
I call on politicians to look into these issues in a transparent and constitutional way. 
The majority and the opposition should work together to get out of this situation," Michielsen said during a press conference, where he presented the priorities of Belgium's EU presidency. 
He reiterated his country would continue to make the EU integration of the Western Balkans a top priority.

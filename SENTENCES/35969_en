SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- International community High Representative Paddy Ashdown has issued three provisional decisions on Mostar, aimed at preventing the misuse of public property and resources until the status of the city is determined.
During a visit Friday (9 January), he said the decisions included an interim ban on the allocation of publicly owned land, temporary freezing of administrative appointments, and a ban on any activities that could damage the integrity of the city.
Ashdown reiterated that the political powers in Mostar should reach an agreement on the final status of the re-integration of the ethnically divided town by the end of January.

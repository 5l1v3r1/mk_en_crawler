SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Constitutional Court annulled several provisions Wednesday (22 September) in Republika Srpska's (RS) laws. 
The clauses in question relate to the names of 12 settlements, which include the prefix "Srpski" (Serb). 
The move followed the RS Parliament's failure to meet a court-ordered three-month deadline for removing the prefix, which the constitutional judges found to be in violation of BiH's main law.

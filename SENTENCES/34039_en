THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Judge Richard May, who is presiding over the trial of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, cancelled hearings on Monday (28 July) because the defendant was ill.
A court spokesman announced later in the day that the session would not continue on Tuesday either.
Still unclear is whether Milosevic would be able to appear in the courtroom Wednesday.
His high blood pressure and other medical conditions have resulted in frequent delays since his war crimes trial started in February 2002.

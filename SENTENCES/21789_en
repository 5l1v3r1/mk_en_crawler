BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic suggested on Monday (August 18th) that authorities in Belgrade send a request to The Hague war crimes tribunal urging it not to appoint an attorney for Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj. 
"Each appointment of an attorney and violation of Vojislav Seselj's rights or the rights of any other indictee who wants to conduct his own defence are a violation of the basic human rights," Dacic said in an interview with Beta. 
Seselj is on trial for inciting nationalism and ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia during the early 1990s, along with murder, torture, imprisonment and deportation.

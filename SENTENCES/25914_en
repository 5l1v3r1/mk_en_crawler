PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Election Complaints and Appeals Sub-Commission (ECAC) has received over 150 complaints since October 15th, when campaigning began ahead of Kosovo's municipal elections. 
Roughly half of them pertain to alleged manipulations on Election Day, which was November 15th. 
ECAC Chairperson Tahir Rrecaj said on Wednesday (November 18th) that during the next week, those complaints will be the top priority. 
According to the law on elections, the ECAC has the right to annul results or to ask the Central Election Commission to repeat voting at certain polling stations if violations that have direct impact on certification are revealed. 
The European Network of Election Monitoring Organisations says the elections "generally met" international standards.

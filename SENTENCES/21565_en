SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Economic growth, jobs, higher living standards, NATO and EU integration and resolving the long-standing name dispute with Greece are the main goals of Macedonia's new government, the formation of which parliament approved Friday (July 25th).
"The programme that we present will not resolve all problems, but it will bring a better future," Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski told reporters Saturday.
Asked to comment on the absence of opposition lawmakers at Friday's parliamentary session, Gruevski said it was their decision, but added, "It is not a good choice to be absent or to boycott the election of a government." (Dnevnik, MIA, Vecer, MRT, Utrinski Vesnik - 28/07/08)

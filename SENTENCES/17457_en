SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The unofficial leader of the centre-right opposition GERB, Boyko Borisov, called on Monday (May 21st) for early parliamentary elections this fall, to coincide with regular municipal elections. 
At a news conference following his party's narrow victory in the first elections for European Parliament (EP) members, Borisov said the ruling coalition lacks political responsibility and has made little progress in fighting corruption. 
He also described the very low voter turnout as an expression of the public's support for early parliamentary elections. 
Borisov also hinted GERB may team up with other right-wing opposition parties in the future. 
The leader of one of them, the Union of Democratic Forces' Petar Stoyanov, resigned from his post Tuesday, following the party's poor showing in the EP elections.
The three ruling coalition partners -- the Bulgarian Socialist Party, the predominantly ethnic Turk Movement for Rights and Freedoms and NMS-II -- reject the notion of early general elections.

ATHENS, Greece -- Talks on resolving the long-standing name dispute between Athens and Skopje have made little progress, UN envoy Matthew Nimetz acknowledged on Thursday (June 26th) after meeting in Athens with Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis and Greece's representative in the talks, Adamantios Vassilakis. 
Nimetz was pessimistic about prospects for compromise in the near future. 
On Friday, he visits Skopje for talks with President Branko Crvenkovski, Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and other officials.

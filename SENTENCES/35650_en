SOFIA, Bulgaria -- European Affairs Minister Meglena Kouneva said Saturday (5 June) that closing of the last, 15th chapter of EU accession negotiations before 15 June would be extremely difficult. 
The chapter concerns competition. 
Kouneva says the major obstacle to closing it was the lack of a common stance within the European Commission on the issue. 
Bulgaria closed four of the most controversial negotiations chapters -- Agriculture, Regional Policy, Co-ordination of Structural Instruments, and Financial and Budgetary Provisions -- on Friday.
In other news, Foreign Minister Solomon Passy said Saturday that Bulgarian and Greek authorities would work together to open one more border crossing, possibly near Ivailovgrad, in southwest Bulgaria. 
Passy stressed that new border crossings are a foreign policy priority.

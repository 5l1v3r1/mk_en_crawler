SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Speaking on Friday (22 April), High Representative Paddy Ashdown welcomed NATO foreign ministers' latest assessment of BiH's progress towards membership in the Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme. 
At their informal summit in Vilnius, the ministers said BiH is moving in the right direction. 
Ashdown said the assessment was "significant and encouraging", but reiterated that the major obstacle to PfP membership remained co-operation with The Hague tribunal, particularly the arrest and transfer of Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. 
He called on Bosnian leaders to ensure that BiH goes the final mile toward PfP membership.
In separate news, Republika Srpska (RS) Defence Minister Milovan Stankovic said Friday that the ceremonial oath giving of RS army recruits in two military bases would be repeated within five days. 
During the previous ceremony, recruits at the bases swore to defend RS instead of BiH, thus violating the new BiH defence law.

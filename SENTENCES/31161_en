WASHINGTON, United States -- The State Department published its annual International Narcotics Control Strategy Report on Thursday (March 3rd) assessing countries' efforts to fight drug trafficking and money laundering.
Albania made progress during 2010 in the fight against illegal drugs, according to the report, spurred on by efforts to meet the EU-set requirements for visa liberalisation.
Despite the improvements, drug smuggling continues to be a major challenge, as Albania serves as transit country between Asia and the European countries.
According to the document, Kosovo is part of drug trafficking to Europe and is becoming a producer of certain drugs.
Authorities face challenges like weak border control and corrupt officials, in a place where fighting the phenomenon is not a priority.
A national anti-drug strategy adopted in 2009 has had no funds allocated to it.
Kosovo is considered a transit point for heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
The report says that Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro are considered transit countries for drug trafficking but not major producers.
Macedonia is neither a major producer nor a major regional transit point.
Part of Turkey, the report notes, "is affected by three main heroin drug trafficking routes".

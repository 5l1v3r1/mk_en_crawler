OTTAWA, Canada -- Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism Minister Jason Kenney announced on Sunday (March 29th) that his country has decided to remove the mandatory temporary resident visas for visitors from Croatia. 
"In Canada we have hundreds of thousands of people with Croatian ancestry," Kenney said. 
"This new change means that people wanting to visit their family or come as tourists to take in the sights of this country are able to do so without a visa," he added. 
The measure becomes effective immediately.

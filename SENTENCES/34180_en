THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Veselin Sljivancanin, a Serbian Army colonel charged in the 1991 Vukovar hospital killings, took up his own defence before the UN war crimes tribunal Thursday (10 July). 
He pleaded innocent to all six counts and refused a court-appointed lawyer. 
His own lawyers were denied permission to appear, in part because they could not speak either of the court's two official languages, French or English.
Meanwhile in Belgrade Thursday, Serbian Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic told reporters the underworld group that assassinated Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic is planning a second round of killings that could include a prominent politician and a police official. 
He says members of the Zemun Clan have left Serbia and are hiding in the Balkans with the help of local mafia groups.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- NATO has welcomed the new Annual National Programme of Croatia for 2004-2005, HINA reported Thursday (21 October), citing Croatia's national co-ordinator for NATO, Pjer Simunovic.
The programme, which will guide preparations for membership in the Alliance, was presented in Brussels earlier this month.
According to Simunovic, NATO experts assessed it as the best, most complete and most effective programme drafted so far.
They urged Croatia to intensify efforts with regard to return of refugees and property restitution, reform of the judicial and defence systems, privatisation and regional co-operation.

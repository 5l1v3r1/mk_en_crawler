SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- International Community High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling is ready to engage in negotiations on constitutional reforms if the political parties resume the process, a spokesman for Schwarz-Schilling's office, Mario Brkic, said on Tuesday (9 May).
He reiterated that the amendments, aimed at strengthening the BiH state institutions, are crucial to the country's future.
He added that before re-opening talks, the parties must analyse the vote by the BiH House of Representatives, which failed to muster the required two-thirds majority.

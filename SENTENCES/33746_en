ATHENS, Greece -- Greece's troubled Olympic Airways reported sharply lower losses for 2002 and promised a stable, balanced budget in the future. 
Transport Minister Christos Verelis said on Sunday (31 August) that the company had lost 3m to 4m euros in 2002, compared to 144m euros in 2001. 
Olympic owed 500m euros at the end of 2001. 
Verelis told local media that efforts are under way to save the carrier from bankruptcy and layoffs. 
On Friday, the cabinet approved and sent to parliament a plan to rehabilitate the ailing national carrier. 
Verelis and Economy and Finance Minister Nikos Christodoulakis said it involves the creation of a new national carrier, Olympic Airlines, which would assume air transportation activities, while ground services would remain the responsibility of Olympic Airways (AFP - 31/08/03; ANA, MPA - 29/08/03)

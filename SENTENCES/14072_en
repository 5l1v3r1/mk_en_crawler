TIRANA, Albania -- A new incident involving the National Guard raised tensions further Thursday (16 March) between the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and the main opposition Socialist Party (SP).
National Guard members tried to stop the SP caucus deputy chairman, Petro Koci, from entering the legislature on Thursday, citing a decision by Deputy Parliament Speaker Fatos Beja to ban him and three other opposition deputies for 15 days, due to inappropriate behaviour.
After protests by the SP, which objected to Beja's move, Koci was finally allowed to enter.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- EU spokeswoman Irena Gjuzelova confirmed on Wednesday (17 September) that Macedonia's amnesty law applies only to participants in the 2001 military conflict.
She emphasised that it does not cover the leader of the Albanian National Army, who calls himself Commandant Breza.
Gjuzelova also said that the law has been correctly implemented in cases unrelated to war crimes, adding that over 900 people have been pardoned.
Her comment was in response to one by the Democratic Union for Integration, which voiced dissatisfaction with the implementation of the amnesty law.
In other news, Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski met Wednesday with NATO's senior military representative in Skopje, Major General Bernardo Alvarez del Manzano.
It was part of an initiative for regular meetings to improve communication and co-operation with the Alliance.

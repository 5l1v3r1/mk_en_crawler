BUCHAREST, Romania -- About 75,000 teachers affiliated with the Federation of Unions in Education "Spiru Haret" staged a warning strike Monday (November 3rd) to protest the government's postponement of a 50% pay raise parliament approved for them. 
The three other education federations in the country will stage a warning strike in a week. 
All four federations will start a full-scale general strike on November 18th. 
Last week, President Traian Basescu asked the unions to postpone protests until after the November 30th general elections.
On Sunday, Finance Minister Varujan Vosganian reiterated the government would not bow to the unions' demands, saying no government would implement the controversial pay hike in its current form, as no party wants to take responsibility for its budgetary impact. 
"Any government that will come will search for a way to postpone its application or to change it," Vosganian told a seminar in the central town of Sinaia.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A Kurdish militant group claimed responsibility Tuesday (June 22nd) for a bomb attack against an army bus in Istanbul that left five people dead earlier in the day.
According to the Firat news agency, the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons, an organisation believed to be linked to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party, said it was behind the attack and warned civilians to steer clear of military targets.

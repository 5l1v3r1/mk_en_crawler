NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greek Cypriot officials condemned on Sunday (July 20th) the visit of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to the northern part of the divided island.
Erdogan attended a ceremony to mark the arrival of Turkish troops in the north on July 20th 1974.
"Erdogan's illegal visit to the occupied areas of Cyprus does not help the creation of the best possible conditions for a Cyprus solution," Cypriot President Demetris Christofias said on Sunday.
He and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat are scheduled to meet on Friday for a final review of preparations for reunification talks.

ATHENS, Greece -- Ministers from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Croatia, Serbia-Montenegro, Macedonia and Turkey agreed Monday (8 December) to deregulate their domestic energy markets, as recommended by the EU. 
The countries would also follow the EU deregulation schedule, though they anticipate delays due to domestic factors. 
Businesses across the EU will be free to choose their electricity supplier as of July 2004. 
Three years later, this measure would apply to households as well. 
EU Energy Commissioner Loyola de Palacio called the step "momentous". 
Greek Development Minister Akis Tsokhatzopoulos and Turkish Energy Minister Hilmi Guler also signed an agreement in principle for construction of a natural gas pipeline between their two countries (AP, BTA, ATA, Anadolu Agency, MPA, NTV - 08/12/03)

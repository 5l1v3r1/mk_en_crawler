ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, who leads the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), said Friday (22 April) that the party still enjoys a stable majority in parliament, despite the departure of three deputies from the party last week. 
He also confirmed that the HDZ national council has decided to expel three members from the regional party branch in Osijek for non-compliance with the party's platform, after they decided to run in the May 15 local elections as independent candidates.

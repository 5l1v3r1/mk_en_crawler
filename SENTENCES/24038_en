SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The ruling coalition partner National Movement for Stability and Progress (NDSV) on Sunday (March 15th) officially ruled out any possibility of a future coalition with its current partner, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), for the European Parliament elections in June.
The NDSV issued a press release in response to widespread rumours of a possible coalition with the ethnic Turkish party.
According to the rumoured scenario, MRF leader Ahmed Dogan had offered NDSV Chairman Simeon Saxe-Coburg an alliance to guarantee NDSV's survival.
Polls in the past few months suggest the NDSV has lost support and now has no chance of winning seats either in the Bulgarian parliament or the EP.

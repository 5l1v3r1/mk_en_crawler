TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition parties on Sunday (November 11th) criticised the government's decision to build the first nuclear power plant in Albania, insisting it would not resolve the power crisis.
Socialist Movement for Integration leader Ilir Meta said Prime Minister Sali Berisha's decision to build a plant makes Albanian politicians look ridiculous in the eyes of the international community.
Socialist Party official Erion Brace said it may threaten public security, citing the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine.
In other news, the Republican Party of Albania re-elected Fatmir Mediu as leader on Saturday.
The congress also approved changes in the party's statute.

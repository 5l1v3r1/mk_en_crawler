MITROVICA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- KFOR troops on Monday (4 April) dismantled sandbag barricades and removed armoured personnel carriers blocking the bridge that links the Serb and ethnic Albanian quarters of Mitrovica. 
A spokesman for the NATO-led force said the aim is to restore normal life in the area. 
However, he added, security restrictions would be eased gradually. 
The bridge was the scene of heavy fighting during riots in March 2004.
In other news, French police reported Monday that they have seized 100kg of a plastic explosive known as semtex. 
Officials say it was smuggled into the country from Bosnia and Herzegovina and may have come from Bosnian Army warehouses.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- "We are not ready to become a member of the EU tomorrow, but we are prepared to start negotiations.
I think that this year we will be given a chance," Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki told a news conference in Brussels on Tuesday (June 10th).
Milososki said he is upbeat Macedonia will receive a date to start accession talks later this year.
He assured EU officials the government would investigate the violence that marred recent parliamentary elections to quell any doubts.
Milososki meets with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn on Wednesday.
In other news, Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski and Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski talked strategy Tuesday with their country's negotiator in the name dispute with Greece, Nikola Dimitrov.
Negotiations resume Thursday in New York under the auspices of the UN.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK police began returning to Serb-dominated northern Mitrovica on Wednesday (March 19th) after Kosovo Serb leaders promised the troops would not be attacked. 
About 40 UN police officers will resume their duties alongside 80 members of the local police force. 
UNMIK police pulled out of the area Monday, amid clashes with Serbs that turned out to be the worst violence since Kosovo declared independence last month. 
It left one officer from Ukraine dead and about 60 other UN police and KFOR soldiers injured, along with 70 Serb protestors.
The regional police commander for Mitrovica, David McLean, said he expects the mission to be restored "as quickly as possible''. 
Ukraine, meanwhile, is asking whether UNMIK police and KFOR had adequate preparation and communication during Monday's clashes.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev said on Thursday (June 18th) that Bulgaria plans to support Jose Manuel Durao Barroso's bid for a second term as president of the European Commission (EC).
The EU's regular summit, marking the end of the Czech presidency, wraps up on Friday in Brussels.
One item on the agenda is choosing the next EC president.
Barroso has already received the support of the European People's Party, as well as left-wing parties in Spain and the United Kingdom.
Stanishev pointed out that Barroso has always backed Bulgaria's EU membership.
In other news, the parliamentary caucus of the radical nationalist party Attack split on Thursday, just days before the parliament term ends.
Members disagreed over the distribution of candidates on the party's ticket nationwide.
As a result, Attack is left with only nine members in parliament, not enough for its own caucus.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Federal Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic says Serbia-Montenegro could enter NATO's Partnership for Peace programme as early as this summer, according to a report in the Politika newspaper published Monday (17 May). 
However, he noted that the country still must meet the top condition: arresting and handing over former Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic. 
Serbia continues to maintain he is not in the country.
In other news, the sister of the late Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic was attacked in her home late Saturday. 
Officials say two men burst into her house in Valjevo and asked for a certain list she knew nothing about, and then injected her with an unknown substance. 
Gordana Djindjic-Filipovic, 54, was in hospital Sunday undergoing tests. 
Doctors do not think her life is in danger.

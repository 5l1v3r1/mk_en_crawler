THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Tuesday (September 15th) rejected recent Serbian media speculation that it is mulling the transfer of some cases currently under way in Serbia or other countries from the former Yugoslavia.
Tribunal spokeswoman Nerma Jelacic said that no such option is being considered.
She denied speculation that the transfer of legal proceedings will be discussed at a November 1st meeting of prosecutors from the region.
"The Tribunal would continue to support the courts in the region and help build their capacities to hear war crimes cases once The Hague court closes," she added in a written statement.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A man who hijacked a plane Tuesday (October 3rd) during a regular flight from Tirana to Istanbul forced it to land at Brindisi, Italy and surrendered to police.
None of the 113 passengers aboard was injured.
Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler said the suspect was a deserter from the Turkish Army who had fled to Albania and was seeking asylum in Italy.
The governor and other officials denied earlier reports that the hijacking was in protest of the pope's planned visit to Turkey.
Passengers said the man apologised to them for the inconvenience before releasing them in Brindisi.

BEIJING, China -- Greece on Friday (August 8th) filed a complaint with the Olympic Games organisers in Beijing over the listing of its northern neighbour as Macedonia on the official Games website.
Greek Olympic Committee President Minos Kyriakou also said organisers plan to allow the country to enter Olympic Stadium under the name Macedonia during Friday's opening ceremony.
Greece says use of the name Macedonia implies territorial ambitions, as Macedonia is also the name of Greece's northern province.
Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said its neighbour should go by the name used by the UN, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

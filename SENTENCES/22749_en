TIRANA, Albania -- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) assured observers on Thursday (October 9th) that Albanian banks would not suffer ill effects from the ongoing international financial crisis, as Albania's banking sector lacked integration with the world economy, IMF representative in Tirana Ann-Margret Westin said.
"It is a fact that banks in Albania are not exposed to the so-called 'toxic' financial instruments that have been the source of the crisis," Westin noted.
She advised the government to follow careful fiscal policies to guarantee investors it is capable of maintaining macro-economic stability.

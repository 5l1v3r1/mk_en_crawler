BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Army authorities confirmed plans to build a security base near Bujanovac, in southern Serbia. 
Maj Gen Mladjen Cirkovic announced groundwork would be laid in the spring, since the feasibility study has been completed. 
The base, nicknamed Serbian Bondsteel, after the KFOR base in Kosovo, would accommodate 1,000 army and police officers. 
Belgrade's co-ordinator on Kosovo, Nebojsa Covic, played down fears that the increased army and police presence in the region reflect possible security concerns, saying planning began two years ago.

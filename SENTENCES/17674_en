BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs implied on Thursday (January 25th) that Bulgaria should not try to reopen discussions on reactors 3 and 4 of the Kozloduy nuclear plant.
The two units were closed on December 31st, the day before Bulgaria's EU entry, in line with a pre-accession treaty.
Piebalgs noted that the shutdown -- for safety reasons -- had been agreed on between Brussels and Sofia and that altering Bulgaria's position would send a bad signal.
His statement was in response to word that Economy and Energy Minister Roumen Ovcharov proposed -- and the government endorsed -- an action plan aimed at re-activating the units.
Closing the reactors has contributed to a power shortage in the Balkans.

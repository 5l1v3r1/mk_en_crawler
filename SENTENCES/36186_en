BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The trial of six Serbs accused of executing 192 war prisoners in the Croatian town of Vukovar started in Belgrade on Tuesday (9 March). 
Prosecutors had initially charged eight men with the crime, but one of them agreed to testify for the state, while a second defendant committed suicide. 
Only one of the accused entered a plea during the first hearing, claiming he was not involved in the executions. 
A spokeswoman for UN prosecutors at The Hague confirmed that the international tribunal had provided some evidence. 
In Belgrade, a spokesman for the special prosecution office called the opening of the trial a "historic moment" for Serbian justice. 
It "will show the ability of our courts to handle war crimes cases, important for further transfers of cases from The Hague," he explained.

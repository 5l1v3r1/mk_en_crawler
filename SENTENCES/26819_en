LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- President Danilo Turk said on Friday (November 6th) that he supports holding a consultative referendum in Slovenia over the agreement with Croatia to settle outstanding border issues through arbitration. 
He added the referendum should be held before parliament ratifies the deal.
"The agreement is a good basis for settling the border dispute based on the second proposal of EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, which includes Slovenia's remarks. 
However, prior to its ratification in parliament, it should undergo a consultative referendum to pass the test of the public," Turk said in an interview with Slovenian Public Radio. 
The vote he is proposing would not have any binding power.
By contrast, opposition parties say they will collect signatures for a binding referendum, which could lead to the agreement being annulled or blocked for at least one year. 
Turk said Friday that the text of the agreement will be published in all media outlets to allow the public to get familiar with it.

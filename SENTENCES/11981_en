BUCHAREST, Romania -- President-elect Traian Basescu started to appoint his presidential administration Thursday (16 December), four days after his victory in the runoff election. 
Key figures include Vasile Blaga, who will head the presidential administration and serve as adviser on defence and security issues, and Andrei Plesu, who will be the foreign affairs adviser. 
Meanwhile, Basescu will step down as head of the Democratic Party at its national conference Saturday. 
By law, the president cannot hold a party post at the same time.
In other news Thursday, the European Parliament (EP) approved a report on Romania's progress for EU entry. 
The report, prepared by EP rapporteur Pierre Moscovici, recommends that an accession treaty be signed in 2005 and accession scheduled for January 2007. 
The non-binding document is seen as an important expression of support.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative on Friday (23 July) welcomed the BiH government's move to enhance arms control.
Earlier, BiH Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic issued instructions setting 1 January 2005 as the deadline for local authorities to specify their exact amount of surplus small arms and light weapons, as well as banning the further sale of surplus weapons.
According to the document, around 370,000 pieces of small and light arms are currently available.
BiH armed forces' legally recognised needs are estimated at about 92,000 pieces.
Radovanovic's statement noted that Western donors have explicitly conditioned financial support for defence reform on arms control and the prevention of illegal weapons exports.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic vowed on Thursday (May 20th) that authorities will conduct a thorough investigation into a possible mass grave near Raska, in southern Serbia. 
He stressed that if a crime is proved, those responsible will be punished. 
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac urged media not to speculate about the number of victims or perpetrators, saying it appears the Yugoslav Army was not involved. 
The grave in Raska is believed to contain the remains of 250 Kosovo Albanians allegedly killed during the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict. 
Their bodies were moved later from Kosovo to Serbia.
In other news, prosecutors announced on Thursday that police have arrested a man suspected of war crimes in Kosovo. 
He is suspected of membership in a paramilitary group called The Jackals that killed 41 people in the village of Qyshk/Cuska in 1999.

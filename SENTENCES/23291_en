SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Court of BiH on Monday (June 29th) acquitted Ferid Hodzic of committing war crimes against Serb civilians and prisoners of war near the eastern town of Vlasenica between May 1992 and January 1993. 
Hodzic was charged with ordering the illegal detention of civilians and subjecting them to inhuman treatment in an illegal detention centre. 
Judges concluded there was not enough evidence proving Hodzic's command responsibility. 
"The evidence about who, or what authority, was responsible for the detention of the prisoners was mixed and contradictory," the court said. 
Prosecutors vowed to appeal.

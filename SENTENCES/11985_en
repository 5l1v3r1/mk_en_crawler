BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Serb Party for Democratic Progress said Monday (14 February) it would back the proposed new Republika Srpska cabinet during Tuesday's (15 February) parliamentary vote in Banja Luka.
However, the party stressed that its support hinged on a deal with Prime Minister-designate Pero Bukejlovic's Serb Democratic Party over the future composition of the state-level BiH Council of Ministers.
In other news, the BiH presidency's Croat member, Dragan Covic, said the five main parties will start discussions next week about possible amendments to the BiH Constitution.
He told the Zagreb daily Vecernji list that the goal was for parliament to adopt the changes by year's end.

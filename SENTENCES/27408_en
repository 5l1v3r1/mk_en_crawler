ANKARA, Turkey -- The government returned control of a historic building to the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople on Monday (November 29th), after a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights.
The building, a 19th-century orphanage, is one of the largest wooden structures in the world.
The government took it over to maintain it in 1997, after the building was abandoned by a Greek Orthodox foundation.
In June, however, the European Court ruled that since the land on which the building is situated is registered to the church, the church owns the building.
An attorney for the Patriarchate praised the ruling.
"It is an important development to show respect for law, democracy and minorities," Cem Murat Sofuglu said, adding that Patriarch Bartholomew I plans to restore the former orphanage and turn it into an institute for the environment.

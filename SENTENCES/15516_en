SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney said on Monday (24 April) that the BiH Parliament faces a historic step forward in the country's reform process and Euro-Atlantic integration.
The lawmakers are to vote this week on a key package of constitutional reforms.
Last week, leaders of the six main parties agreed on new wording in some texts, which should assure parliamentary approval.
Also Monday, the Office of the High Representative urged acceleration of police sector restructuring in BiH.
OHR spokesman Oleg Milisic noted that it is crucial to the Stabilisation and Association Process with the EU.

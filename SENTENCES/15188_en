SKOPJE, Macedonia -- VMRO-DPMNE, the senior partner in Macedonia's ruling coalition, announced on Wednesday (27 September) that it reached an agreement with its ethnic Albanian partner, the Democratic Party of Albanians, on additional changes to the new draft law on police.
Parliament is to debate the bill Friday.
It is considered key to both the EU integration agenda and to implementation of the Ohrid agreement.
However, the country's major ethnic Albanian opposition formation, the Democratic Union for Integration, says it will oppose the measure during Friday's vote.
It claims that even with the amendments, the bill would not sufficiently protect the interests of the ethnic Albanian minority in Macedonia.

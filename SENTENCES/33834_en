BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission adopted the Feasibility Study for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on Tuesday (18 November), concluding that the country is ready to take further steps in the EU integration process and start negotiations on the Stability and Association Agreement. 
The assessment is conditional: BiH must first meet a series of obligations to prove it can function as a self-sustainable state. 
BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic welcomed the adoption of the study, dubbing it a great success for the government and the international community.
In other news, international donors and local authorities in BiH will open a military training centre Thursday in Butmir, near Sarajevo. 
SFOR says the institution will train local and international army staff for participation in peacekeeping, stabilisation missions and humanitarian operations.

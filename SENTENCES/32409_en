ZAGREB, Croatia -- The index of political, social and economic stability in Croatia improved by one point in March, reaching 59, according to a regular monthly survey of the Lehman Eurasia Group.
The overall assessment ranks the country on a scale of 0 to 100.
Analysts credit the resolution of disagreements within the ruling coalition, reforms in the army, amendments to the labour law, and plans for major state investments in the infrastructure.
The report welcomes Croatia's application to join the EU but notes relations with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague could be a problem.

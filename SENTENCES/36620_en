BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Croatia is progressing faster towards EU membership than other countries in the region and is therefore responsible for helping them with their accession efforts, European Commission President Romano Prodi said Monday (3 May).
In an interview for Croatian Television, Prodi noted that when Slovenia started accession negotiations, he told Lubljana that it must pave the way for Croatia.
Now, Prodi said, he is delivering a similar message to Croatia.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The UN deputy envoy for the Kosovo status talks, Albert Rohan, said on Friday (15 September) that negotiations could drag on for another ten years without achieving anything.
"The prospect of progress in these talks is increasingly slim," he observed.
Rohan signaled that the UN Security Council might soon have to decide the matter.
His comments followed another fruitless round of talks between Serb and ethnic Albanian representatives on the issue of decentralisation.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- All flights to and from the Pristina International Airport were cancelled on Tuesday (April 20th) due to volcanic ash expected to reach Kosovo's airspace.
Eight of 13 planned flights lifted off before the order came.
The ash cloud from Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano will be re-evaluated Wednesday.

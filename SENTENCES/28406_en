TIRANA, Albania -- The Constitutional Court published a decision on Thursday (April 15th) rejecting a treaty that delineates the continental shelf with Greece in the Ionian Sea.
According to the court, the government went beyond its powers to negotiate the deal.
It said the document is both incomplete and in breach of both the Albanian Constitution and international conventions on water boundaries.
The agreement also bypassed the president who, under the constitution, should lead and sign such agreements.
The court said the decision also ignored some islands in the new delineation.
The controversial deal was signed a year ago by the prime ministers of the two countries.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Florence Hartmann, the spokeswoman for UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte, denied Wednesday (20 April) that del Ponte has criticised Croatian State Prosecutor Mladen Bajic for inadequate co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
A Croatian newspaper reported that del Ponte, in remarks to the EU, accused Bajic of having information about fugitive indictee Ante Gotovina's whereabouts, but doing nothing to facilitate his arrest.
Hartmann said prosecutors fully trust Bajic and his professionalism.

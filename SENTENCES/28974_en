BUCHAREST, Romania -- French Immigration Minister Eric Besson and Secretary of State for European Affairs Pierre Lellouche arrive in Bucharest on Thursday (September 9th) for talks with officials amid the controversial ongoing repatriation of Bulgarian and Romanian Roma from France. 
Ahead of their arrival, Romanian President Traian Basescu accused Paris of neglecting European norms by deporting the immigrants. 
Furthermore, he said the visit by Besson and Lellouche would be "useless" if their goal is to "lecture" Romania. 
If they are coming to find a solution, however, a solution will be found, Basescu added. 
Although criticising the French government, he conceded the Romanian government and the Roma share some responsibility for the current situation.

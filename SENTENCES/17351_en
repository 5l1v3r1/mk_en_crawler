ATHENS, Greece -- Wildfires raged through parts of Greece on Thursday (28 June), killing two people and burning dozens of homes.
Authorities evacuated a hotel and casino resort and an air force radar station as a fire raged out of control through the Mount Parnitha national park, outside Athens.
The two victims, volunteer firefighters, were trapped by flames in their truck near Larissa.
Up to 130 fires have been reported in forests and mountain areas, prompting states of emergency in several districts in central Greece.
Italy, France and Portugal are sending aircraft to help contain the blazes.

ATHENS, Greece -- Riots spurred by a police officer's fatal shooting of a teenage boy continued through Sunday (December 21st), affecting the capital and other big cities. 
Thousands of anarchists in Athens threw stones and Molotov cocktails at police, who used tear gas to disperse them. 
The young people barricaded the streets surrounding the Polytechnic University, where anarchists are concentrated. 
Protesters also torched several cars in central Athens and threw Molotov cocktails at the finance ministry's building. 
They threw garbage at the Christmas tree in Athens' main square and tried to set the tree on fire before police intervened.
In Thessaloniki, anarchists seized a radio station and a movie theatre Saturday before police dispersed them with tear gas. 
Property damage following two weeks of riots is estimated at hundreds of millions of euros.

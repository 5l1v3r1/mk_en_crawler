TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament on Friday (27 December) approved the Rome Agreement that establishes a permanent International Criminal Court (ICC).
According to the national news agency ATA, the decision to approve the agreement was made after lawmakers agreed to incorporate the statutes into domestic law.
The Rome Agreement was signed by 139 states but ratified by only 87 so far.
The ICC was established in July but does not yet function.

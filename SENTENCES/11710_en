SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH will not be given the green light to start negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the director of the EU's Western Balkans office, Reinhardt Priebe, said during his visit to Sarajevo on Thursday (19 May). 
The sixth meeting of the EU/BiH Consultative Task Force, held in Sarajevo, recognised that progress has been made in numerous fields, but noted that the country has fallen short of requirements concerning police reform and the adoption of a law on the national broadcaster RTV. 
The Bosnian Serb government has resisted plans for the consolidation of the police departments of the two entities, while Bosnian Croats have stalled the adoption of the new broadcast legislation.
High Representative Paddy Ashdown, meanwhile, reiterated that the three EU-proposed principles for police reform will not be changed. 
According to Ashdown, the damage can be limited by the Republika Srpska Parliament if it accepts those principles.

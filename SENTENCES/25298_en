PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The EU opened an office in Serb-dominated Mitrovica on Friday (March 26th).
The EU "facilitator" for Northern Kosovo, Italian Ambassador to Pristina Michele Giffoni, said that one of the main goals is to make the EU presence visible and enable EULEX to work efficiently throughout Kosovo, including in the north.
Giffoni said the office will handle property, the return of displaced persons, economic development and social issues.

CAIRO, Egypt -- The Arab League will consider Libya's request to suspend all diplomatic ties with Bulgaria, Oman's Foreign Minister Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah said before the organisation's meeting in Cairo Monday (July 30th).
Libya called on the 22 Arab League members to cut all diplomatic relations with Bulgaria after five Bulgarian medics and a Palestinian doctor, who was given Bulgarian citizenship, were pardoned by the Bulgarian president.
Tripoli insists the pardon breaches a bilateral agreement on the exchange of prisoners.

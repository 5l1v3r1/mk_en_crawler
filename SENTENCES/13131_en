PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The EU's envoy for the Montenegrin independence referendum, Miroslav Lajcak, is in Podgorica for the new, fourth round of political negotiations on the issue. 
The session began Monday (30 January). 
In a weekend interview, Lajcak said the referendum could be held in April, but only if the ruling coalition and opposition agree on its terms by 7 February, when parliament is to take up the matter.
Separately at the weekend, Serbia-Montenegrin Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic voiced hopes that the referendum would fail and the federal union would be preserved. 
Draskovic, however, stressed that if the majority of Montenegrin citizens back the independence idea, their decision must be respected, as long as the referendum meets European standards.

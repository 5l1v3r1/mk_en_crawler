SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament Speaker Trajko Veljanoski survived a no confidence vote Saturday (July 10th) with 68 lawmakers backing him and 14 opposed, after marathon debates. 
The motion was filed by the main opposition party SDSM over a July 1st incident at the parliament building. 
The SDSM accuses the police of spying on their activities after a police agent tried to record their conversation with a group of disgruntled workers. 
That led to verbal exchanges, pushing and shoving. 
The SDSM accused Veljanoski of failing to defend the institution and of preventing the establishment of an inquiry committee to investigate the incident.

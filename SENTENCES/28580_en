THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The first witness of the prosecution took the stand Tuesday (April 13th) at the resumption of Radovan Karadzic's war crimes trial. 
The former Bosnian Serb leader attended the hearing. 
Ahmet Zulic of the Bosnian town Sanski Most told the court about crimes committed against non-Serbs in his town, which was under the control of the Bosnian Serb army until October 1995. 
Prosecutors say between 1,500 and 1,600 people were held in detention centres there. 
The trial continues with cross-examination by Karadzic.
In a related note Tuesday, the UN tribunal announced that the Netherlands has decided to declassify a document requested by Karadzic for his defence. 
The document will be handed over by Friday. 
The Netherlands had provided all requested documents except this one.

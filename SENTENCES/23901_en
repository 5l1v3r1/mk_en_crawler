SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government filed documents at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Monday (July 20th), to support its case against Greece.
Skopje says Athens violated the 1995 Interim Accord between the two countries when it vetoed Macedonia's NATO membership bid last year.
Greece now has until January 20th to file its counter-case.
After this deadline expires, the court will consult with both sides and decide on further proceedings.
Macedonia filed a complaint against Greece at The Hague-based court last year over Athens blocking Skopje's NATO entry at the Bucharest summit, due to the long-standing bilateral name dispute.

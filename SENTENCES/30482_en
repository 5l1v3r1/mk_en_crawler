BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Britain's Richard Howitt, a member of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (EP), has been appointed as new rapporteur on Macedonia. 
He's replacing Zoran Thaler, who resigned in March amid a corruption scandal. 
In a statement published on Wednesday (May 11th), Howitt said that Skopje has made significant steps in its EU integration process, adding that next month's parliamentary elections will be crucial to that process. 
He called on all parties to guarantee free and fair elections. 
Howitt said he will also insist that the EU sets a date for start of accession talks with Skopje.

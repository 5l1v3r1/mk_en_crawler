BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Supreme Defence Council decided Tuesday (6 May) to place the general staff of the Serbia-Montenegro Army under civilian control. 
Thus the military leadership would become an organisational unit within the defence ministry. 
The cabinet would be responsible for appointing top military officials, based on the recommendations of the defence minister. 
Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Boris Tadic described the decision as a major step in advancing military reform, in light of the country's aspirations to enter NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.
Also on Tuesday, US President George W Bush authorised the government to export arms and military material to Serbia-Montenegro. 
During his visit to Belgrade last month, Secretary of State Colin Powell pledged to help the country fight organised crime and extremism.

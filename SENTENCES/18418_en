LAGOS, Nigeria -- Security forces have rescued two Croatians and a Montenegrin who had been held as hostages in Nigeria for about a month. 
A spokesman for the Nigerian Special Forces reported that the three oil workers were freed after a quick operation in Port Harcourt, which encountered only minimal resistance from the kidnappers.

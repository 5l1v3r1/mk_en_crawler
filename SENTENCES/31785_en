SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The working group for tax reform in BiH has proposed the creation of a single customs administration in BiH.
The group held a news conference Monday (6 January), to discuss an official report it will file shortly with the international community's High Representative in BiH, Paddy Ashdown.
The task force, chaired by EC Mission Chief in BiH Renzo Daviddi, recommended that a single customs administration be formed by merging the three separate administrations.
It is estimated that up to 300m euros are embezzled annually due to the current, inefficient system.
In other news, the EU and the government of BiH signed an agreement Monday under which the Balkan nation will get some 60m euros in financial assistance.
The funds will be conditional on reforms in public administration, the financial sector and the business environment.

PRAGUE, Czech Republic -- Several EU member countries expressed their dissatisfaction with Slovenia's blockade of Croatia's EU accession talks on Friday (March 27th). 
At an informal meeting of the EU foreign ministers, officials agreed that the EU accession process should not depend on bilateral relations, urging Slovenia to separate the border conflict from Croatia's accession negotiations. 
On Monday, Slovenia and Croatia are expected to present their responses to the latest compromise proposal tabled by EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn regarding their long-standing maritime border dispute.

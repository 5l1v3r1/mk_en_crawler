ANKARA, Turkey -- As expected, parliament voted late Tuesday (5 September) to send troops to Lebanon as part of the UN peacekeeping force.
The vote was 340 to 192, with one abstention.
The vote coincided with a visit by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, who has been touring the region to drum up support for the effort.
Still unclear is how many Turkish peacekeepers would be deployed in Lebanon, but Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said it would be less than 1,000.
Thousands who oppose Turkish participation staged a protest before the vote in downtown Ankara.
Earlier Tuesday, a 10-year-old boy and two members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party were killed in a clash between troops and rebels in Turkey's southeastern Batman province.
The local governor says it began when a military post came under fire from a vehicle.
The soldiers returned fire, killing two rebels and the boy in the car.
The boy's mother was wounded.

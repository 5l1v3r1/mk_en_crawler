SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Three political parties -- the LIDER party founded by businessman Hristo Kovachki, the nationalist Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation (VMRO) and the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union -- formed a new centre-right coalition Sunday (November 2nd) called Movement Napred (Forward).
At a conference in Sofia, party leaders called for a new approach to politics.
Kovachki, who is LIDER's informal leader, said the coalition's aim is to make Bulgaria a prosperous country and worthy member of the EU.
He promised a more expert-oriented and technocratic approach to government affairs.
In terms of economic policies, the focus will be on uniting the Danube-Black Sea region, with Bulgaria taking a lead role, Kovachki said.
The new coalition says it will also encourage business and economic growth, adequate subsidies for agricultural producers, high-quality education, accessible and efficient healthcare and an efficient judiciary.

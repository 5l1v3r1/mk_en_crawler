BUCHAREST, Romania -- Former football player Gheorghe Popescu denied on Monday (June 29th) media reports claiming he collaborated with the communist-era secret police Securitate in the 1980s.
Earlier, the daily Adevarul described Popescu as an informer between 1986 and 1989.
He dismissed the report and explained that during the communist regime, all football players participating in international competitions were obliged to sign a declaration to "defend national interests".
He also suggested Adevarul is working to derail his bid to head the Romanian Football Federation.
Captain of the national team in the 1990s, he remains one of the Romania's most popular sports figures.

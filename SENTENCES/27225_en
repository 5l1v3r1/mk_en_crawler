TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling coalition of the Democratic Party (DP) and the Socialist Movement for Integration is ready to support a parliamentary inquiry into the June 2009 general elections, DP parliamentary group member Astrit Patozi said Tuesday (February 2nd).
Patozi confirmed that the DP -- the largest group in parliament -- will assist with the probe.
He noted, however, that the investigation will not affect a court decision declaring the DP the winner.
The opposition Socialist Party (SP) has been boycotting parliament for months, demanding a recount of ballot boxes.
The boycott has hampered passage of EU-related reforms.

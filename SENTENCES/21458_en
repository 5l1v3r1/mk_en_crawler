BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said in an article published in Milliyet on Monday (August 25th) that he welcomes calls in Turkey to modernise the country through strengthening reforms related to EU membership.
Rehn said these reforms are also necessary to overcome yearly political crises that consume much of Turkey's energy.
He noted however that despite calls by the European Commission, Turkey has done nothing to change its law on political parties and other legislation.
He expressed hope that the adoption of a national programme for reforms aimed at EU membership will speed up implementation of such measures.
Rehn also pointed that the EU-aimed reform process is wide-ranging and includes many issues, such as relations between the army and the civil society, the judiciary, the rights of women and freedom of expression.

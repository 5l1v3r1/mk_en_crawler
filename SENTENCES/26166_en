TIRANA, Albania -- A final report by the OSCE on the June 28th general elections in Albania notes that while there were major improvements in the process, the vote failed to meet the highest standards of democracy, local media reported on Monday (September 14th).
According to the document, the improvements were overshadowed by politicising technicalities and campaign violations.
The OSCE recommended that local parties work to avoid political influence in appointing officials monitoring the process, and eliminate pressure on public servants.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha described the OSCE findings as accurate and objective.
In other news Monday, President Bamir Topi approved the proposed list of cabinet ministers in the new government led by the Democratic Party.
Parliament votes next on the appointees.

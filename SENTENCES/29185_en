BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said on Sunday (September 5th) that Serbia does not plan to withdraw the draft resolution on Kosovo it submitted to the UN General Assembly. 
The document, which denounces Kosovo's independence and calls for fresh talks with Pristina, is to be discussed on Thursday. 
Jeremic pointed out that intensive talks on the issue are under way with all international organisations, including the EU, adding the draft is not a goal, rather, the means to opening new talks on Kosovo. 
He also reiterated that Serbia's foreign policy priorities are EU membership and defence of the country's territorial integrity and sovereignty, using all legal, political and diplomatic means.

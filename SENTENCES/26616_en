ANKARA, Turkey -- A juvenile court in the western city of Aydin decided on Tuesday (September 8th) not to sue a 13-year-old boy who said that Allah would punish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although Erdogan himself had not filed a claim against the child, prosecutors insisted he be sent to jail for up to three years for insulting the prime minister.
The incident occurred in Aydin, ahead of the local elections in March.
The boy was angry because his father had gone bankrupt as a result of the global financial crisis.
In other news Tuesday, a court in Istanbul launched a trial against a man who allegedly killed his son for being a homosexual.
Yahya Yildiz, 49, is on the run and will be tried in absentia.
He is charged with murdering his son, Ahmet, 26, in June 2008, after Ahmet told him he had an affair with a German national.

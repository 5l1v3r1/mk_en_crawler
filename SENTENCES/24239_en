SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Sulejman Tihic, head of the Bosnian Party of Democratic Action (PDA), refused to attend a meeting Sunday (June 14th) with the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina's main political parties. 
He cited Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik's nationalist rhetoric as the reason.
The Sunday meeting was attended by Dodik, Dragan Covic of the Croatian Democratic Union of BiH, and High Representative Valentin Inzko. 
The talks were part of the so-called "Prud Process", which calls for regular meetings among key leaders. 
Inzko stressed that the international community strongly supports the process, and also said he expects the Peace Implementation Council to decide in October on the future of the Office of the High Representative and transforming it into the Office of the EU Special Representative.
In other news, UN war crimes tribunal President Patrick Robinson arrived in BiH on Sunday. 
He will have talks with members of the tripartite presidency, Inzko and Sarajevo Mayor Alija Behmen.

STRASBOURG, France -- The Council of Europe has warned Serbia-Montenegro that reinstating the death penalty would violate "fundamental European principles and standards". 
Walter Schwimmer, the general secretary of the European rights body, wrote to Justice Minister Vladan Batic on Friday (28 March), after Batic suggested informally earlier in the week that the death penalty should be reinstated to curb organised crime. 
Serbia-Montenegro is due to become the Council's 45th member at a ceremony Thursday in Strasbourg.

In an interview with Belgrade's <I>Vecernje Novosti</I> on Sunday, Kostunica said the current state of emergency should not be used for settling political scores, adding that statements suggesting the murder of Zoran Djindjic was politically motivated are inappropriate.

Saturday, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic said that the law would be amended to speed up the handover of indictees.

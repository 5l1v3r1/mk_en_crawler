BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Parliament (EP) members backed a draft resolution Wednesday (March 16th) calling for the opening of EU accession talks with Macedonia.
The resolution, drafted by EP Rapporteur Zoran Thaler, was adopted in a 49-7 vote with three abstentions during debates in the foreign affairs committee.
Thaler notes Macedonia has made substantial progress in the past 20 years, though there are still unresolved issues related to the lack of political dialogue, inter-ethnic relations, media and judicial independence.
The document is to be discussed further at a plenary session in April.

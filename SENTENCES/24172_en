NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou says Cyprus might block more chapters in Turkey's accession negotiations with the EU in light of an oil exploration dispute between the two countries.
"As long as there are threats regarding the exercise of our sovereign right to exploit the natural resources within our exclusive economic zone [in the Mediterranean Sea], it is very difficult for us to start discussions on the relevant chapter of the negotiations," he told the daily Hurriyet on Monday (December 15th).
Kyprianou said the Greek Cypriots would likely veto the opening of the chapter on energy, which was expected this month.
Turkey, for its part, accuses the Greek Cypriots of violating its territorial rights, insisting exploration vessels had entered its territorial waters.
In other news, Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat are meeting Tuesday in Nicosia in the latest round of reunification talks.
They are expected to discuss foreign relations, within the chapter on administration and power sharing.

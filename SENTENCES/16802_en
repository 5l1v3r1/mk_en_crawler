BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn on Monday (November 6th) welcomed a signal from Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan that his government is prepared to amend controversial Article 301 of the Penal Code, which has led to several journalists and writers being put on trial on charges of insulting Turkishness.
Rehn issued a statement saying he believes good intentions would translate into concrete action.
The deadlock over opening Turkey's naval and airspace to Greek Cypriot traffic continues to present problems, however.
In an interview published in Monday's Sueddeutsche Zeitung, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Turkey risks a crisis in its accession talks if it does not comply with an extended customs protocol that includes Cyprus.
On Wednesday, the European Commission is due to issue a new report evaluating Turkey's progress.

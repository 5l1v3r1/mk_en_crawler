BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Council of Europe (CoE) Secretary General Walter Schwimmer addressed the Serbian Parliament on Thursday (1 April), saying the progress of the Serbia-Montenegro union has not been sufficient.
While acknowledging that gains have been made in terms of democracy and the rule of law in the year since Serbia-Montenegro joined the CoE, he insisted more must be achieved.
In other news, Assistant Interior Minister Miroslav Milosevic said Thursday that Serbian police are prepared to apprehend all Serb war crime indictees if ordered to do so.
His remark follows the US decision to freeze most aid to Belgrade, citing a lack of war crimes co-operation.

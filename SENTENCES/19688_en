ANKARA, Turkey -- A draft amendment to controversial Article 301 of the penal code will be submitted to the parliament speaker this week, senior government officials said on Monday (January 21st).
The speaker will then submit it to lawmakers within days, Bekir Bozdag, deputy chairman of the ruling Justice and Development Party, told the Cihan news agency.
Article 301 currently forbids any insults to the Turkish identity or "Turkishness" and has been used to try a number of leading writers and intellectuals, including Nobel Prize-winning author Orhan Pamuk and murdered Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink.
The EU has urged Ankara to amend the article, arguing that it harms freedom of expression.

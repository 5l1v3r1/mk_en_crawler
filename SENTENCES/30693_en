BAKU, Azerbaijan -- A senior Azeri energy official said on Wednesday (April 6th) that Greece will be the first European country to which Azerbaijani gas will be supplied directly. 
Rovnag Abdullayev, president of state oil company SOCAR, was speaking after his company and Greece's national gas company DEPA signed a memorandum of understanding on the side lines of a Greek-Azeri business forum in Baku. 
Currently, Azeri gas is delivered to Greece via Turkey. 
Inaugurating the forum alongside Azeri President Ilham Aliyev, Greek President Karolos Papoulias emphasised efforts his country is making to emerge from its deep economic crisis. 
He urged Azeri businesses to take advantage of Greece's new investment framework.

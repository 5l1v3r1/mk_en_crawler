LONDON, Great Britain -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso told the BBC on Sunday (14 May) that he wants to see Bulgaria and Romania enter the EU as soon as possible.
He said membership would be good for both countries, as well as for Europe.
At the same time, he stressed that Sofia and Bucharest must meet all criteria, including fighting crime and corruption.
On Tuesday, the EC is to release its next monitoring reports on Bulgaria and Romania's progress, expected to play a key role in determining the date of EU entry.
Membership is scheduled for 1 January 2007, but either country could see accession put off if the EC determines the requirements have not been met.

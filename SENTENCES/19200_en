ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey and Iraq signed an agreement on Friday (September 28th) to fight terrorism together, although they failed to resolve differences over allowing Turkish troops to pursue guerrillas of the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) on Iraqi territory. 
Instead, they agreed to prevent financing, logistical support and propagandizing for the PKK. 
Both sides hailed the deal as a major step forward. 
A special commission will now meet every six months to examine how well the provisions are being implemented.
In other news, Kurdish rebels ambushed a van in southeastern Turkey on Saturday, killing 12 of its 14 passengers. 
According to Turkish officials, the vicitims included civilians as well as seven members of a village auxilliary force. 
The attack followed the death of a PKK leader.

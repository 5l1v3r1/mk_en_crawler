STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament (EP) approved the latest progress report on Turkey by a wide majority Wednesday (May 21st): there 467 votes in favour, 62 against and 61 abstained. 
The report also reiterated the EU's criticism of a case filed this year against the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), saying the effort to ban the party raises questions about the impartiality of the judiciary. 
The EP said it expects the Constitutional Court to act in accordance with Venice Commission guidelines and European standards in issuing its verdict.
The report also called on the Turkish government to respect pluralism, secularism and democracy while implementing reforms, and to strive for compromise with various political parties. 
The EP report praised the recent changes to Article 301 of the Penal Code, and called for removal of similar articles imposing limitations on free speech. 
Ria Oomen-Ruijten, the EP's rapporteur on Turkey, said at a press conference in Strasbourg that a new constitution is the only way the government can ensure separation of state and religion.

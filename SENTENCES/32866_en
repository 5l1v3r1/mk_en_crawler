ATHENS, Greece -- Greek police launched a massive operation Saturday (1 February) against the terrorist group Revolutionary Popular Struggle (ELA).
The operation was carried out in Athens and neighbouring municipalities.
Greek media, meanwhile, published the names of five major suspects.
ELA fell apart after archives of the former East German secret police were opened during the 1990s.

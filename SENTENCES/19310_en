SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The EU-led peacekeeping force in BiH (EUFOR) transferred full responsibility for mine clearing Thursday (September 27th) to the BiH Army. 
In a statement, EUFOR said the move underscores growing confidence in BiH institutions, adding that it would supply the army with all the equipment, vehicles, and mine-sniffing dogs it needs. 
An estimated 4% of BiH territory remains peppered with landmines dating from the 1992-1995 conflict.
Also Thursday, representatives of the judicial sector and the international community met in Sarajevo at a roundtable dedicated to judicial reform. 
The meeting, chaired by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak, set out as short-term priorities the finalising of a comprehensive strategy for the sector and preparation of a state strategy for handling war crimes cases.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The interior ministry announced on Saturday (May 15th) the arrests of four people in an operation against night clubs offering sex services. 
The action followed a big anti-organised crime operation in February code-named Octopus that netted 14 arrests. 
Investigators say the night clubs were functioning under the protection of the Octopus group, said to be involved for at least a decade in racketeering, prostitution, money laundering, and tax fraud.
Two other operations were carried out on Saturday, one targeting cigarette smugglers in Sofia and Blagoevgrad, the other against illegally-stored weapons.

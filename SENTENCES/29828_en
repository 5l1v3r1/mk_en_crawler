TIRANA, Albania -- The Central Elections Commission (CEC) announced late on Monday (May 23rd) that candidate Lulzim Basha of the ruling Democratic Party won Tirana's tight mayoral race. 
He beat incumbent Edi Rama, leader of the opposition Socialist Party (SP) by just 81 votes. 
The CEC's decision to include votes mistakenly cast in wrong boxes on Election Day, May 8th, remains controversial, with the opposition still insisting those votes should be considered invalid. 
Well over 250,000 votes were cast on Election Day. 
SP supporters have been protesting daily outside the CEC's offices demanding "respect for democracy". 
Socialist lawmakers have filed a complaint about the election result, with a decision expected soon.

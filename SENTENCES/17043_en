ANKARA, Turkey -- A French Roman Catholic priest, 74-year old Father Pierre Brunissen, was attacked and stabbed in the Turkish Black Sea town of Samsun on Sunday (2 July).
Police say the alleged assailant, a local man with a history of mental problems, turned himself in.
He claimed the priest was trying to convert local Muslims.
The incident took place on a crowded street near the church where Brunissen was assigned.
He is expected to recover.
Earlier this year, an Italian Catholic priest, Andrea Santoro, was shot dead by an underage Turk in the town of Trabzon.
The trial in that case is continuing.

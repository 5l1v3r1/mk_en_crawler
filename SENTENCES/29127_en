ANKARA, Turkey -- Relations between Turkey and Israel suffered further strain on Tuesday (April 6th) with Ankara's reaction to comments by Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman. 
The foreign minister said recently that Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan was becoming Muammar Gaddafi and Hugo Chavez. 
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu described the remarks as inappropriate and called on Jerusalem to end its "unacceptable approach". 
Lieberman's comments followed an impassioned speech on Sunday by Erdogan, who spoke of "black clouds" in Jerusalem while comparing the situation of Palestinians to the earthquakes in Haiti and Chile.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- About 100 war veterans blocked railway traffic between Belgrade and Bar at the Valjevo train station for an hour Monday (August 10th), demanding back pay for their participation in the 1999 Kosovo conflict.
The protesters insisted on meeting with Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac or Interior Minister Ivica Dacic but no government officials showed up.
After negotiations with police, the veterans ended the blockade.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu-Tariceanu is still undecided about nominees for the posts of justice and defence ministers.
He visited the Upper Council of Magistrates on Thursday (February 28th) and acknowledged that following a Constitutional Court ruling against him in a dispute with President Traian Basescu over the justice minister nominee, he needs more time.
Media reports suggest the biggest problem is that Teodor Melescanu, who in the interim is handling both justice and defence minister duties, will likely refuse to leave the defence ministry.
Tariceanu has no backup nominee if Melescanu refused to go to the justice ministry.
The clock is ticking, as delays in filling the justice ministry seat could affect an EU monitoring report on the judiciary this summer.

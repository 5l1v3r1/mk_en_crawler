ANKARA, Turkey -- The European Commission's stance on Turkey, expected to be made public in one month, will be firm and clear, EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen said Monday (6 September) as he kicked off a several-day visit to the country. 
He said "the moment of truth" is coming and nothing could postpone the EU's decision in December on whether to start accession talks with Turkey. 
Verheugen also visited southeast Turkey, seeking to assess the status of the Kurdish minority and their human rights situation.
In other news, a soldier and a guard were killed in a suspected Kurdish rebel attack in Diyarbakir early Tuesday. 
Unknown assailants opened fire on a checkpoint in an area with a large Kurdish population. 
The Kurdistan Workers' Party, now known as KONGRA-GEL, is suspected of involvement.

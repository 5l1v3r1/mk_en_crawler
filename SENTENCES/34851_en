SKOPJE, Macedonia -- NATO Ambassador to Macedonia Nicolaas Biegman told Radio Free Europe on Sunday (3 August) that Skopje is making progress in army reforms.
The question now is not whether Macedonia would accede to the Alliance, Biegman said, but when.
He refused, however, to discuss concrete deadlines.
Biegman stressed that Macedonians need employment and security, noting with satisfaction that efforts by some criminal gangs to destabilise the country had failed.

ANKARA, Turkey -- An illegal Maoist organisation called Communist Party - People's Liberation Army (MKP/HKO) claimed responsibility Wednesday (September 30th) for Monday's murder of a reserve colonel in northwest Turkey.
The group is particularly active in the eastern Kurd-dominated province of Tunceli.
In an e-mailed message, the far-left MKP/HKO said that Colonel Ajtekin Icmez, 64, was "punished" for "persecuting and killing" one of its activists in 1981, while he was in charge of a military unit in Tunceli, following the 1980 military coup.
Icmez, who retired in 1996, was found dead in his home.

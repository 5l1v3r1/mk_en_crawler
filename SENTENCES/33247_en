ANKARA, Turkey -- The government condemned Wednesday's (11 June) attack on the US consulate in the southern city of Adana and promised to step up security measures for all foreign missions in the country.
Around mid-day, a man entered the consulate premises and hurled an explosive device -- a hand-made bomb or a grenade, according to different reports.
Though a wall was damaged and several windows shattered, no injuries were reported.
A second device was disabled before going off.
A Turkish national arrested at the scene reportedly said he staged the attack in retaliation for Israel's attack Tuesday against the Palestinian militant group Hamas.
Officials said they were investigating the suspect's possible links to terrorist organisations.

TIRANA, Albania -- The government has drafted legislation banning the use of small boats and ships in an effort to curb illegal immigration and trafficking in drugs and arms, a spokesman said Wednesday (14 December).
Only specially licensed fishing and passenger vessels would be allowed in the country's waters for the next three years.
The new measure awaits approval by parliament.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha says the aim is to change Albania's image as ''a speedboat republic".

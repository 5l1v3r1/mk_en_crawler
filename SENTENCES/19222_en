WASHINGTON, United States -- Human rights watchdog Amnesty International asked international and Kosovo authorities Monday (January 28th) to punish the perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the late 1990s conflict in Kosovo. 
"Hundreds of cases of war crimes, crimes against humanity -- including rape and disappearances -- as well as other inter-ethnic crimes, remain unresolved seven years after the United Nations began its efforts to rebuild the Kosovo judicial system. 
Hundreds of cases have been dismissed for want of evidence that was neither promptly nor effectively gathered. 
Relatives of missing people report that they have been interviewed too many times by international police and prosecutors new to their case, yet no progress is ever made," the group said in a press release.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The opposition submitted a no-confidence motion against the cabinet Monday (October 18th), citing a second year of economic recession and protests. 
In addition to the alleged missteps by the government, the motion offers alternatives routinely suggested by the leading opposition parties -- the National Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party. 
A vote is expected on October 27th. 
In order to pass the motion, the opposition needs 236 votes. 
The cabinet narrowly survived another no-confidence vote in June.

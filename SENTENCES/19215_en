NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Demetris Christofias, leader of largest party in Cyprus, the communist AKEL, was sworn in as president Thursday (February 28th), following his victory in a run-off election earlier this month. 
In a speech to parliament, Christofias, 61, said his main goal would be the reunification of the island, divided now for decades. 
He vowed to resume negotiations with the Turkish Cypriot community and to meet with their leader, Mehmet Ali Talat. 
He also invited the EU to take a more active role in resolving the dispute.
Christofias then presented his new 13-member cabinet, made up of representatives of AKEL and two smaller centrist parties, the Democratic Party and the Movement of Social Democrats. 
EU Health Commissioner, Markos Kyprianou is moving to the key post of foreign minister.

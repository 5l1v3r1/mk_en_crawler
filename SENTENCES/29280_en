BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania's main goal, now that it is a member of the EU and NATO, is to join Schengen by March 2011, Prime Minister Emil Boc said on Saturday (April 3rd).
He added that Romanian authorities will exert the maximum effort toward achieving that goal.
Speaking at the opening of an immigration service office in the country's northwest, Boc said joining Schengen would guarantee border security to all 500 million EU citizens.

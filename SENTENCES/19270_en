TIRANA, Albania -- The primary opposition Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama said on Tuesday (February 26th) that the SP is willing to co-operate with other parties to implement electoral reforms directly tied to Euro-Atlantic integration.
Rama also expressed his readiness to co-operate with the leader of the Socialist Movement for Integration, Ilir Meta.
He withdrew his party from the coalition with the SP a few days ago, citing an inability to work with the SP.

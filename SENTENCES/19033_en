NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The government expressed dissatisfaction Saturday (December 2nd) with the European Commission's approach to Turkey and called for stricter measures to guarantee compliance with EU-related obligations. 
Late last month, the EC recommended that the EU Council partially freeze membership talks with Turkey, by suspending the opening of eight negotiation chapters. 
Following a lengthy meeting of the Cyprus National Committee, President Tassos Papadopoulos said these measures were insufficient and that Cyprus would propose changes to the EC's final instructions regarding Turkey before the summit of the EU Council later this month.
On Friday, Turkey's EU bid and Ankara's refusal to open its naval and air space to traffic from EU member state Cyprus were the focus of a visit to Nicosia by Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia and Slovenia have submitted an arbitration agreement to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on their long-standing sea border dispute, Hina news agency reported on Thursday (May 26th).
The agreement, which would refer the border dispute to international arbitration, was signed in November 2009 between Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor and Slovenian counterpart Borut Pahor.
The issue has been a stumbling block in bilateral relations since the independence of the two countries in 1991.

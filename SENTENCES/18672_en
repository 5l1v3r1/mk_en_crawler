TIRANA, Albania -- The vice chairman of the main opposition Socialist Party's (SP) parliamentary group, Petro Koci, announced on Wednesday (June 6th) that he is forming a faction within SP, opposing what Koci calls the "radical" ideas of leader Edi Rama.
An outspoken critic of Rama, Koci says last month's party congress demonstrated the total "privatisation and usurpation" of SP by Rama and his associates.

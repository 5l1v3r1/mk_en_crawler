ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament voted Tuesday (28 December) to approve the country's 2005 budget, a third of which will go towards paying interest on public debt.
Between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of spending in 2004 and 2003 went towards debt repayment.
The budget, based on projected revenues of 68.6 billion euros and a deficit of 15.8 billion euros, is calculated in the new Turkish lira, which becomes legal tender on 1 January.
In other news, Turkey has sent an official note to the EU objecting to possible permanent restrictions on the free movement of Turks in Europe, the foreign ministry said Tuesday.
Also Tuesday, the ministry announced that Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul would visit Israel and the Palestinian territories during the first week of January.
Last week, Turkey announced its desire to participate in the Middle East peace process.

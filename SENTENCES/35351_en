BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said Monday (16 February) that the Alliance will retain a presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) even after SFOR's mission is taken over by the EU. 
Scheffer also reiterated NATO's commitment to bringing key war crimes suspects to justice, saying he hopes Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic would be arrested and sent to The Hague before the EU force takes over.
Also Monday, SFOR personnel searched houses in the village of Gornja Bocinja, looking for illegal weapons. 
Troops emphasised that the search included the homes of Bosniaks as well as Serbs.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- President Abdullah Gul said on Wednesday (April 2nd) that Turkey has no intention of sending combat troops to Afghanistan. 
Shortly before leaving for Bucharest to attend the NATO summit, Gul said that while Turkey is expanding relations with Afghan authorities, it has no intention of enlarging its 1,200-strong military mission for the time being. 
Two weeks ago, Foreign Minister Ali Babacan said that Ankara planned to review its commitments in Afghanistan.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski is to submit a formal application for membership in the EU in Dublin Monday (22 March).
Ireland currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
Macedonia's submission was delayed nearly a month, after the 26 February death of President Boris Trajkovski in a plane crash.
On Saturday, Crvenkovski's office announced that he would continue performing his prime ministerial duties during the presidential campaign, in which he is expected to run as a candidate of the ruling Social Democratic Union.

TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu's refusal to fire Chief Prosecutor Theodhori Sollaku -- despite alleged links to organised crime -- has triggered a strong reaction in Tirana.
As expected, the opposition Socalist Party welcomed Moisiu's decision, saying the allegations against Sollaku were politically motivated.
But on Sunday (October 15th) a ruling Democratic Party spokesman suggested Moisiu might also have links to organised crime.
Spokesman Gazmend Oketa even hinted that the DP might seek impeachment.
Later in the day, Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli, a senior DP official, ruled that out.
In other news, the head of the European Commission directorate for the Western Balkans, Reinhard Priebe, urged the various political parties to reach some kind of consensus for the sake of the country's EU accession process.
Wrapping up a two-day visit to Tirana on Friday, Priebe said consensus would guarantee progress.

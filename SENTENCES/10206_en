BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) is expected to launch an infringement procedure against Greece on Wednesday (1 December), for presenting false statistical data on the Greek budget deficit from 1997 to 2003, according to media reports Monday. 
Athens would have two months to respond to the EC's findings. 
EC officials said the proceedings could end up in court, if the Greek government fails to respond adequately to EC concerns. 
Greece admitted last month that its 2001 entry into the Eurozone was based on incorrect budget performance data, and that the budget deficit since 1999 actually exceeded the Eurozone limit of 3 per cent of GDP.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Belgrade City Council verified on Monday (July 14th) the mandates of all 110 new members and adopted the agenda of its first session after two failed attempts. 
But the constituent session ended without electing a mayor, a secretary of the assembly or deputies. 
Members of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) and the Democratic Party of Serbia-New Serbia (DSS-NS) coalition stormed out of the session after arguments erupted over the voting procedure and the proposed agenda. 
Democratic Party (DS) member Branislav Belic, who presided over the session as the oldest member of the assembly, halted the session once there was no longer a majority present to elect Belgrade's next mayor. 
On Sunday, the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) announced it was leaving a coalition with the SRS and the DSS-NS in Belgrade, breaking an agreement signed after the May 11th elections. 
The DSS and the SRS are calling for new local elections in Belgrade.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Serbian authorities have handed over to the UN war crimes tribunal 18 diaries belonging to former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic, the court announced on Wednesday (May 19th). 
The 3,500 pages of notes by Mladic -- written between 1991 and 1996 -- turned up during a search of his wife's Belgrade apartment in late February. 
Tribunal spokeswoman Olga Kavran said they are being translated for analysis. 
Prosecutors want to use them as evidence in the trials of war crimes indictees Jovica Stanisic, Franko Simatovic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, Justice Minister Cemil Cicek and Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu issued a statement Thursday (28 October) pledging to push five new laws through parliament ahead of the 17 December EU summit.
The new legislation would facilitate the operation of civic associations and non-Muslim religious foundations.
It would also establish a judicial police force and amend criminal procedures and rules concerning the serving of sentences.
In a recently released report, the European Commission urged the adoption of these measures.

ANKARA, Turkey -- NATO Secretary General Lord George Robertson told reporters in Ankara on Thursday (23 October) that he has asked the Turkish government to provide troops and specialised reconstruction units for the Alliance's mission in Afghanistan.
He also noted that Ankara had considerable experience in intelligence gathering and gendarmeries that would also be welcome.
Turkey commanded the international force in Kabul for six months in 2002 and still maintains a unit there.
Robertson is making a farewell tour, as his term in office expires at the end of the year.
He is also seeking assurances that Turkey will send peacekeepers to Iraq.

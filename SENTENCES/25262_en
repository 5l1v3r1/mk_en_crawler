NEW YORK, United States -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton welcomed on Monday (September 28th) measures undertaken by Turkey and Armenia to normalise their diplomatic ties.
This happened at separate meetings with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and Armenian counterpart Edward Nalbandian in New York, on the sidelines of the 64th session of the UN General Assembly.
Officials in Ankara announced on Sunday that the two countries will sign an agreement on October 10th, establishing diplomatic ties.
"I want to reiterate our very strong support for the normalisation process that is going on between Armenia and Turkey," Clinton told journalists after her meeting with Armenia's Nalbandian.
During her meeting with Turkey's Davutoglu, Clinton said she values the Turkish government's strong commitment to the process.
While Turkey was among the first countries to recognise Armenia's independence in 1991, the two never established diplomatic ties.
Their common border has been sealed since 1993.

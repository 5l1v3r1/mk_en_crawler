ANKARA, Turkey -- The army carried out another series of air strikes against suspected Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) bases in northern Iraq on Saturday (December 22nd) -- the third Turkish offensive against the PKK militants in less than a week. 
Actions over recent weeks had left "hundreds of terrorists" dead, the General Staff said in a statement published on its website. 
It added that similar attacks will continue. 
Kurdish security officials said there were no victims in Saturday's attack.
On December 16th, Turkish planes bombed the Qandil Mountain in Iraqi Kurdistan at the border between Turkey and Iraq, which is believed to be one of the strongholds of the PKK militants. 
A ground operation followed two days later.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Energy Minister Hilmi Guler anounced that Turkey has started drilling for oil in the Gulf of Saros in the Aegean Sea.
He said on Saturday (February 2nd) that prospects are good since "a good spot was detected there".
In the light of an existing bilateral dispute over parts of the Aegean, Greece's Foreign Ministry said the government would not oppose the move since the exploration was being conducted entirely in Turkish territorial waters.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Officials marked the Day of Missing Persons Monday (April 27th) with a ceremony in the Gjakova village of Meje, where a 1999 massacre by Serb forces left about 400 civilians dead.
Kosovo leaders promised they will be more committed to learning the fate of the missing and vowed to boost efforts to improve the quality of life for all in Kosovo.
International Civilian Representative Pieter Feith issued a press release saying the families have the right to know the fate of the missing.
About 2,000 people, mostly Albanians, remain unaccounted for since the end of the 1998-99 conflict.
In other news Monday, the education ministry announced it is establishing a commission to review Serb school curricula, which so far Belgrade has managed.
As directed in former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's status plan, the ministry has established a seven-member independent commission -- which includes minorities -- to conduct the review.

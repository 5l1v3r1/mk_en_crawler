BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS) has offered to form a coalition with Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) for the Belgrade city assembly. 
SRS deputy leader Tomislav Nikolic said Monday (20 September) that he and Kostunica would meet to discuss the proposal Wednesday, although the DSS has said it is reluctant to co-operate with the Radicals. 
In Sunday's local elections, the SRS won 27 seats in the Belgrade assembly, DSS won 13, and their major opponent -- President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party -- won 34 seats.
Also on Monday, the Council of Europe's (CoE) Congress of Local and Regional Authorities praised the conduct of the elections. 
Alain Chenard, the head of the observing mission, said the vote was well-organised and largely conformed to Serbia's commitments to CoE standards.

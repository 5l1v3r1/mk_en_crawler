SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Former security chief Atanas Atanasov was arrested on Wednesday (17 November) for refusing to pay a 5,000-euro bail. 
Atanasov, who was charged with abuse of office in two separate cases -- one related to a 1999 security report on corruption and another related to the surveillance of Public Prosecutor Nikola Filchev in 2000 -- was detained prior to a Thursday hearing. 
He has repeatedly refused to pay bail in either case, insisting the accusations are groundless.

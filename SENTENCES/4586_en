Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) will send the Sarajevo pop-rock band Regina and its song "Bistra Voda" (Clear Water) to represent the country at Eurovision. 
The band performed the winning entry on national TV on March 1st.
Aleksandar Covic, the song's composer and a founding member of Regina, said the band has a good chance of winning in Moscow.
The band released its debut album in 1990. 
From 1990 to 1992, Regina's music enjoyed considerable popularity throughout Yugoslavia. 
The band split up in 1992, but new members kept its music alive and released four albums. 
The original members reunited in 2006 and released Regina's most recent album, "Sve Mogu Ja" (I Can Do It All), which won over a considerable number of fans in BiH and the region.
"Bistra Voda" is a rock ballad combined with marching drum overtones. 
It has drawn mixed reactions. 
While some consider it a good choice for Eurovision, others criticise it for lacking innovation and for having too much of a 1980s, former-Yugoslavia feel.
BiH no longer selects its Eurovision representative through a festival event and televoting. 
A seven-member jury made the call on January 12th, selecting "Bistra Voda" from among 79 entries submitted to BiH Radio and TV.
Many praise the new judging process, in place for three years now, as much more economical for BiH. 
However, critics argue the new system suffers from heavy political influence, stymieing true public participation and thwarting the promotion of musical talent.
Despite the criticism, expectations for Regina in Moscow are high. 
Many think "Bistra Voda" can match or surpass the country's best Eurovision performance, when Hari Mata Hari won third place for "Lejla" in 2006 in Athens.
Twenty-five years before that, Seid Memic "Vajta", a Bosnian representing Yugoslavia, performed a different song, coincidentally named "Lejla" as well, and finished seventh at Eurovision.

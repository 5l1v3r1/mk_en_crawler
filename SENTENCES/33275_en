BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO on Friday (9 May) signalled support for the Balkan nations in their fight against organised crime, which it said "poses one of the main threats to stability in the Western Balkans".
Secretary General George Robertson will join Balkan leaders for a two-day meeting in Ohrid on 22 and 23 May, which is being hosted by Macedonia and the Balkans Stability Pact and will be devoted to border security.
In a statement, NATO said that "inadequate border security of much of the region has created major problems of drug smuggling, gun-running, human trafficking and political violence." Robertson praised the Balkan nations for leaving behind the animosities of the past in their joint search for practical solutions to important issues.

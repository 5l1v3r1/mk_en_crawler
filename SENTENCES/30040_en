NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Parliament voted on Thursday (February 24th) to support the country in joining NATO's Partnership for Peace programme, in hopes of giving Cyprus a bigger role in EU-NATO co-operation, thus boosting efforts to reunify the island. 
But soon after the vote, government spokesperson Stefanos Stefanou said that President Demetris Christofias would veto the decision since it is not in line with his promise to reach a settlement of the long-standing Cypriot issue, which would demilitarise the divided island. 
In addition, he says the vote violated the constitution, as it breaches the president's executive authority to conduct foreign policy. 
Christofias meets with Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu on Friday as part of ongoing reunification talks.

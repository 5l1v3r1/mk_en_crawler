BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko and Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik met on Monday (June 8th) to discuss the political situation in BiH.
They agreed that all remaining issues regarding the state and military property should be resolved as soon as possible.
Both welcomed the BiH Council of Ministers' approval last week of laws necessary for achieving visa liberalisation with the EU.
They also discussed next week's meeting involving leaders of the three main political parties in BiH.
In other news Monday, the Office of the High Representative announced that Inzko has dismissed Himzo Djonko, police commissioner of Hercegovina-Neretva County.
This was the first time Inzko used his Bonn powers since taking office in March.
Djonko was sacked for several reasons, including allegedly submitting counterfeit documents concerning his work experience when he applied for the job.
Inzko said Djonko also threatened political rivals with criminal prosecution and urged other people to make physical threats against Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian.
Djonko denies all the accusations.
Inzko also removed Radislav Jovicic, a police officer in the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) from his post.
He allegedly used SIPA personnel and resources to conduct the surveillance of international community officials.

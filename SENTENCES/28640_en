THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Monday (May 10th) voiced concern over a recent assault on retired Bosnian Serb General Radislav Krstic, in a British prison. 
Krstic was attacked on Friday by three fellow inmates. 
He is serving a 35-year sentence at a high-security prison in connection with the 1995 Srebrenica genocide. 
UK authorities say they are investigating the incident and will take appropriate measures.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Pavle, died in Belgrade early Sunday (November 15th) at the age of 95.
The patriarch, who became leader of the Church in 1990, was admitted to the city's military hospital two years ago.
Though he reportedly suffered from heart and lung conditions, the Church did not specify the cause of death.
Last year, Pavle asked the Holy Synod to allow him to withdraw from active service because of his health, a request the Synod rejected.

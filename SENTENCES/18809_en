BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Turkey reportedly has agreed to open one of its harbours and one of its airports to Greek Cypriot traffic, in response to the threat of suspended EU accession talks.
Finland, which holds the rotating EU presidency, said on Thursday (December 7th) that the EU is studying the offer.
Late last week, the European Commission recommended partial freezing of the membership talks until Turkey fully meets its obligations under a 2005 extended customs union protocol.

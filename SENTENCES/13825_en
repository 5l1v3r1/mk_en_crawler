SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Armed Forces and EUFOR sealed an agreement Friday (16 December) on co-operation in de-mining activities in 2006. 
Under the deal, over 2 million square metres of land are to be cleared of mines next year -- 40 per cent more than in 2005.
In other news, the head of the BiH government's directorate for EU integration said a draft strategy for the process would be submitted to the BiH Council of Ministers immediately after the New Year holidays. 
Speaking to reporters after the completion of a public debate on the strategy, Osman Topcagic said all suggestions made during the discussions -- held in Mostar, Banja Luka, Brcko and Sarajevo -- would be incorporated.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian said on Monday (June 30th) that if BiH continues the current pace of reforms and fulfils the five conditions and two additional requirements set by the Peace Implementation Council (PIC), the Office of the High Representative (OHR) could close in a year.
He rejected media speculation that additional conditions, including constitutional reform, would join the list.
Gregorian noted that while experts have recommended constitutional reform to direct future reform efforts, it is not a condition for the OHR's closure.
He repeated that the time frame depends entirely on BiH politicians.
The OHR was to end its mission in July 2007, but PIC members decided that the lingering political turmoil surrounding police restructuring and constitutional reforms left BiH unable to govern itself.
In February, the PIC imposed the five conditions for shutting down the OHR.

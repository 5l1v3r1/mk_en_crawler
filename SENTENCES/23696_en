PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier has told UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that the mission is facing "continuously growing challenges" in fulfilling its mandate, local media reported Friday (May 22nd).
He reportedly said that the public's impatience with UNMIK is growing.
"There is a general perception among Kosovo Albanians that the mission's duties are fulfilled and its continuous presence is unnecessary," Zannier said.

ANKARA, Turkey -- There is no link between Turkey's pending decision on deploying peacekeepers to Iraq and disbursement of $8.5 billion in US financial aid, according to the new US ambassador to Ankara, Eric Edelman. 
During a meeting Wednesday (27 August) with Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, Edelman said the conditions attached by the US Congress with regard to the loan concerned co-operation between the two countries, but did not contain any reference to Iraq.
In other news Wednesday, Turkish security forces uncovered an illegal arms workshop in the Presembe district of Ordu province. 
Two people were detained.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Lawmakers elected Slavica Djukic-Dejanovic of the Serbian Socialist Party (SPS) as parliament speaker Wednesday (June 25th). 
She was the only candidate for the position. 
Apart from the SPS-led coalition, the Democratic Party (DS)-led coalition supported her, as did ethnic minority parties.
Meanwhile, Serbian President Boris Tadic, head of the DS, failed again on Wednesday to designate a prime minister. 
Observers had expected the announcement on Tuesday as well.

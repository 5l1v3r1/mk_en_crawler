SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg officially announced on Monday (3 May) that his government has approved plans for the construction of a new nuclear power plant in Belene, northern Bulgaria.
Work on the project started in 1987 but was suspended in 1991 due to environmentalists' protests and lack of funds.
Saxe-Coburg said the new facility would be commissioned in 2010.
Eight companies are bidding for the project.

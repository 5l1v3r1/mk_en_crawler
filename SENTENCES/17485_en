THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte announced on Tuesday (January 30th) that she plans to step down when her term ends in September.
Speaking to journalists, she voiced hope that Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic would be arrested by then.
She also urged the EU to keep pressing Belgrade for co-operation in the search for war crimes suspects, indicating she opposes any resumption of talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia until the country meets its obligations.
Del Ponte conceded that while Mladic was probably within reach of the Serbian authorities, nothing is known about Karadzic's whereabouts.
She also reiterated her disappointment that former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic died before his trial ended.

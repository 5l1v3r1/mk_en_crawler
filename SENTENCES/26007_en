BELGRADE, Serbia -- Thousands of police officers will protect participants in Sunday's (September 20th) Gay Pride event in Belgrade, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said on Wednesday.
He admitted the march is a high-risk event and warned that clashes with extremists are possible.
Several political parties and far-right groups have urged authorities to cancel the event.
The last one, held in 2001, was marred by extremists attacking several activists.

WASHINGTON, United States -- The Kurdish government in northern Iraq and its president, Massoud Barzani, are not only sheltering members of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) but are also providing them with weapons, Turkish Ambassador to Washington Nabi Sensoy told reporters Wednesday (July 11th).
He said US-made weapons apparently provided to security forces in northern Iraq were turning up in the hands of PKK guerrillas.
He also confirmed troop movements along the border with Iraq but said they were in response to higher than usual PKK activity in the area.
Any cross-border incursion would require approval by parliament, which is not expected to reconvene until after the July 22nd general elections.
In other news Wednesday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he hopes future presidential elections would be conducted by the new parliament without problems.
Erdogan added that if the opposition rejects the Justice and Development Party's recent call for a compromise candidate from among parliament members, then a popular vote for president would be the only alternative.
Such a move would require a national referendum.

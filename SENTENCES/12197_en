ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said Monday (13 December) he expects this week's EU summit to decide to launch accession talks with Croatia in March, without preconditions.
He added that his country has met all criteria for starting negotiations.
However, the Voice of America reports that EU leaders are likely to set co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal as a condition for starting talks.
Croatia has long been criticised for inadequate efforts to arrest fugitive General Ante Gotovina.

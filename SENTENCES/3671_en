Answering calls for assistance with the fires that have been called an "unprecedented disaster for Greece", Turkey sent a fire fighting plane to the country Monday (August 27th).
The assistance was not notable, compared with the significant help already offered by the European countries, but symbolically it was significant.
Fires have affected more than half of Greece's territory, officials say.
At least 64 people were killed and dozens of villages damaged or destroyed.
Although the blazes are now under control, metereologists say a new heatwave expected in the coming days could spell new trouble.
Ankara's decision to send a plane was heralded in the daily Hurriyet, which ran a story under the headline "A long-missed hand of friendship".
It quickly became one of the most popular articles on the newspaper's webpage, garnering a comparatively high number of comments.
Voicing solidarity with the Greek people, readers expressed deep sorrow for the losses and the huge amount of damage caused by the fires
Some even criticised the Turkish government for being too slow to offer help.
It is not the people of Turkey and Greece, but the political leaders who are to blame for the ongoing problems between the two countries, wrote one of the online readers, Ari Yurdusever.
"The world belongs to all humanity, and it will be a beautiful world when we all become citizens of the universe," wrote another, Cemil Hacibektasoglu.
"This is a world for all of us."
Turkey and Greece remain at odds on several issues, including airspace and territorial waters.
The decades-old division of Cyprus is the biggest obstacle to strengthened co-operation, and has also impacted Turkey's bid to join the EU.
Despite these deep-rooted problems, relations between the two neighbours have begun to thaw since 1999, when Greeks and Turks showed mutual solidarity during successive earthquakes that hit the two countries.

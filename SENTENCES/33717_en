ZAGREB, Croatia -- Special units of the Croatian Army have been preparing for a possible mission in Iraq, according to reports in the Zagreb press.
The media says that selected volunteers are undergoing special training at a military base near Delnice.
Instructors reportedly include Croatian soldiers who recently returned from six months with the International Security and Assistance Force in Afghanistan.
In other news, a report published Tuesday (2 September) by the US-based Human Rights Watch criticised Croatia for discriminating against Serbs who were displaced by the 1991-1995 conflict and who now want to return to their homes.
"Despite repeated promises, the Croatian government has been unwilling and unable to solve this problem," the paper says.

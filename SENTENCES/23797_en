BERLIN, Germany -- A court has rejected an attempt to cancel Kurdish Roj TV's licence to broadcast on German territory, media reported on Tuesday (May 19th).
Turkish authorities roundly criticise the Danish-based broadcaster for airing statements by the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and inciting terrorism.
Germany's interior ministry had declared Roj TV illegal, following complaints from Turkey.
However, a court in Leipzig ruled the ban will not take effect immediately, as it may face a legal challenge.
The Kurdish-language broadcasts by Roj TV have strained Turkey's relations with Denmark, prompting Ankara to initially oppose former Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen's bid to become NATO secretary-general.

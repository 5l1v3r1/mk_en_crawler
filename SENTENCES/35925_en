ATHENS, Greece -- George Papandreou, the new leader of PASOK, kicked off his election campaign on Saturday (17 January) with a call to Turkey for an agreement on mutual cuts in defence spending. 
Speaking in Alexandroupolis, he pledged to start work for implementation of the proposal immediately after the elections, saying that the money saved spared could be used for education and health sectors and for stimulating employment.
In other news, the Greek police seized 33kg of cocaine and arrested four men in a joint operation with Belgian law enforcement agencies. 
The suspects -- two Belgians, one Dutchman, and one Italian -- are thought to belong to an organization smuggling drugs from Greece to Western Europe.

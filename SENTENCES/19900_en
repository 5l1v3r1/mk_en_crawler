BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Reforms in Macedonia's defence sector are moving at a good pace, but more progress is necessary in the political arena, the German and Dutch ambassadors to NATO, Ulrich Brandenburg and Herman Schaper, said at a meeting Monday (November 19th) with Macedonian Defence Minister Lazar Elenovski in Brussels. 
Elenovski acknowledged that political tensions exist, but said his country is nevertheless a successful example of a multiethnic democracy.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Foreign Ministry confirmed on Wednesday (January 3rd) that Libyan authorities have tightened access to five nurses held in the Judeyda prison. 
As of Wednesday evening, Bulgarian Deputy Justice Minister Margarit Ganev had not received permission from Tripoli to visit the five, sentenced to death on allegations that they infected hundreds of children with HIV. 
The nurses' families and defence lawyers say they are also awaiting word on visits.
In light of the case, Bulgaria's National Association of General Practitioners called on the government Wednesday to withdraw all Bulgarian doctors and nurses currently working in Libya. 
It also made a similar proposal to other EU member states.

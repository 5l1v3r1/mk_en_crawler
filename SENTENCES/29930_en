PRISTINA, Kosovo -- International Civilian Office (ICO) head Pieter Feith is urging that the newly forming government observe high ethical standards. 
In an exclusive interview with Alsat TV on Sunday (January 23rd), Feith said that the government should exclude anyone who is indicted or under investigation. 
These comments follow suggestions from the US Embassy and the European Commission to establish a government of "clean hands". 
"What citizens want are people that are not accused, not under investigations, that have the skills and technical competence to deal with issues concerning Kosovo, and that have the faith of the citizens in and outside Kosovo," Feith said.

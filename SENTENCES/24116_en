BUCHAREST, Romania -- Thousands of public employees and other workers demonstrated in Bucharest on Thursday (May 14th), demanding higher salaries and job security. 
The left-centrist government has frozen salaries in the public sector and is expected to cut payrolls in the huge public administration and state-operated companies. 
The protestors chanted slogans outside both parliament and the economy ministry in the capital. 
Romania has been hard hit by the global financial crisis, which has turned it from an attractive investment option into a country with a growing external debt and declining market confidence. 
The industrial sector has shed thousands of jobs, and the government had to seek help from the IMF.

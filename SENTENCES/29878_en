PARIS, France -- Bulgaria will join the Schengen border-free zone once it settles all problems related to crime, corruption and border security, French European Affairs Minister Laurent Wauquiez told the Paris-based newspaper Le Figaro on Sunday (December 26th).
His statement came a couple of days after France and Germany said that Bulgaria and Romania's suggested admission to Schengen in March 2011 seems rushed, given the need for further progress in reforming their judiciaries, and in fighting corruption and organised crime..
Meanwhile, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov expressed confidence during a TV show Sunday that Bulgaria will join Schengen in September at the latest, after submitting reports to the European Commission in February and in August.

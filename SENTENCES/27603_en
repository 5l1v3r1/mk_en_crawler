PRISTINA, Kosovo -- US Ambassador to Kosovo Christopher Dell continues criticising the government, which, he says is controlling the country's economy. 
At a public forum Monday (June 28th) on privatising the Kosovo Energy Company (KEK), Dell said that low collection rates, political interference and insufficient resources KEK has at its disposal have created a vicious circle. 
"Kosovo's economy is heavily and needlessly dominated by the government. 
This was inherited from UNMIK and certainly from ex-Yugoslavia times," Dell said, adding that this thwarts entrepreneurship.

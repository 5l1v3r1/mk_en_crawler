PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker announced on Saturday (August 4th) that he will temporarily halt the property return process in Kosovo.
UNMIK spokeswoman Myriam Dessables said the decision is not aimed at any ethnic community in Kosovo, and especially not at Serbs.
Though UNMIK provided no other details, Tanjug reports the move may stem from a particular case in Klina where municipal authorities are suspected of involvement in the illegal seizure of Serb property.
Serbia's State Secretary with the Ministry for Kosovo, Dusan Prorokovic, protested Ruecker's decision, describing it as "one of the most scandalous in the eight-year history of UNMIK".

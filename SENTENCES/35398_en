BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The ruling Serb Democratic Party (SDS) will submit the required financial report to the Office of the High Representative by the Monday (19 April) deadline, said senior party official Momcilo Novakovic. 
He said it would prove that funds allocated to SDS were spent properly and not used to support indicted war criminals.
In other news, opposition parties led by the Union of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) held another rally at the weekend, calling for early parliamentary elections in Republika Srpska. 
SNSD says SDS is betraying the Bosnian Serb entity's interests by failing to fulfil tasks related to Euro-Atlantic integration.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government decided on Tuesday (June 5th) to send 70 soldiers to Afghanistan as of June 30th.
The new unit will replace a Bulgarian vehicular unit in Kabul.
They will guard the Warehouse Base, secure convoys and man a checkpoint.
The government said the gradual transfer of responsibilities from the International Security Assistance Force to Afghan security forces necessitates the change of form and mission.

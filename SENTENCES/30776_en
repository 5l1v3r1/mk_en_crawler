ANKARA, Turkey -- Police arrested 22 people on Friday (May 6th) on charges of belonging to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
The arrests were part of a larger ongoing operation aimed to stop potential terror attacks against political parties ahead of the June 12th general elections. 
On Thursday, authorities announced that PKK separatists were behind an attack against the convoy of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan Wednesday, which killed one police officer.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal appointed a London lawyer, Richard Harvey, to represent former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in court on Thursday (November 19th). 
The tribunal decided earlier this month that such representation is needed, should Karadzic refuse to appear in court. 
Accused of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, he boycotted the start of his trial, saying he needs more time to prepare his defence. 
The boycott prompted judges to suspend the proceedings until March 1st.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic met on Sunday (September 9th) with the Bosniak member of Bosnia and Herzegovinaâs (BiH) tripartite presidency, Haris Silajdzic, and assured him that Croatia will not influence the positions of Croat parties in BiH during crucial upcoming talks on police and constitutional reform.
He added that Croatia fully supports the integrity of BiH, stressing any entity division or separation would destabilise the entire region.
According to Vecernji List newspaper, the main reason for Silajdzic's surprise visit to Zagreb was a proposed declaration seeking the federalisation of BiH and creation of a Croat entity, which the Croat parties in BiH plan to seal on September 21st.

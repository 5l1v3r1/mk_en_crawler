ZAGREB, Croatia -- UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte is expected to submit her report about Croatia's war crimes co-operation to Luxembourg, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, on Tuesday (7 June). 
The document reportedly would be forwarded to the other EU member states by the end of the week. 
The Union will use it to help decide whether to schedule a new meeting on Croatia. 
Accession talks were delayed in March because of Zagreb's failure to arrest and extradite fugitive General Ante Gotovina to The Hague.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Thousands of people queued outside hospitals in Bucharest on Saturday (January 9th) to get vaccinated against swine flu after a popular local television actor died. 
Toni Tecuceanu, 37, died on Tuesday of lung complications caused by the flu. 
So far, 82 people have died of the virus in the country, which has 6,061 confirmed cases of it. 
Romania began mass vaccinations late last year but so far, less than 1% of the population has been immunised.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz said on Monday (September 20th) he is not satisfied with Serbia's efforts to find the two remaining high profile war crimes fugitives. 
He urged the EU to maintain its pressure on Belgrade to fulfil its obligations. 
Authorities there must arrest Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic, Brammertz stressed. 
"We have no time. 
This tribunal is closing down in three years time, we need the arrests now in order to have a trial which represents the magnitude of the crimes committed," he told a conference in The Hague. 
Brammertz's assessment is crucial to Serbia's EU bid.
In response, Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic said the arrest of Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb military commander, remains a priority. 
Rasim Ljajic, head of Serbia's council for co-operation with The Hague tribunal, said authorities are doing their best to track him down.
Separately, Belgrade authorities handed over to the tribunal a person charged with contempt of court for alleged witness intimidation during the trial of Bosnian Serb Milan Lukic. 
In July 2009, the tribunal sentenced Lukic to life in prison for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed against Bosnian Muslim civilians in the town of Visegrad, from 1992 to 1994.

With the quick sellout of the August 10th concert that the Irish rock band U2 will play in Zagreb as part of its 360ยบ tour, Croatian fans are gearing up to buy tickets on Friday (April 3rd) for a newly announced show on August 9th.
The tour will visit 14 cities across Europe during the summer before heading to North America.
Tickets for the August 10th show, which went on sale March 28th, were gone in 12 hours. 
Croatia has not witnessed such a scene since February 1996, when the first McDonald's opened in Zagreb.
Even though it was a cold night, fans mingled in the streets of Zagreb, bearing sleeping bags, beer and flasks of coffee. 
They started gathering immediately after midnight, waiting for more than 40 ticket outlets nationwide to open Saturday morning.
Since overwhelming computer traffic caused online sales to crash, the outlets became the last source of tickets. 
By noon, U2 followers had snapped up all 63,000 tickets.
U2's inclusion of Zagreb on its itinerary revived the status of Croatia's capital -- which the Rolling Stones visited in 1998 -- as an international star destination. 
Beyonce and Depeche Mode, coming in April and May, respectively, also represent that artistic revival.
Four months before U2 touches down in Zagreb, humanitarian and writer Bill Carter -- who originally connected the band to the Balkans -- will receive honorary BiH citizenship on April 6th in Sarajevo.
Carter remained in Sarajevo during the 1990s conflict and asked U2 to help the besieged BiH capital's citizens.
The band accordingly established a satellite link to Sarajevo during its concert tour in 1993 and 1994 so that western audiences could hear residents' stories of the conflict. 
Carter chronicled this exchange in his book Fools Rush In.
In 1997, U2 deepened its commitment to Sarajevo by performing there, giving the city its first major rock concert since Elton John's in 1992.

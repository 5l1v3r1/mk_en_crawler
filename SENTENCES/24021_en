TIRANA, Albania -- Interior Minister Bujar Nishani said on Wednesday (June 17th) that Albania has made progress in its fight against human trafficking.
He was responding to a new US State Department report that ranked Albania among countries with a high rate of human trafficking, and urged the government to do more.
"Albania's ranking is comparable to the overall level in the EU," Nishani said.
He also insisted that the government has stepped up efforts to offer protection to victims, including a 24-hour call centre to provide help and advice.

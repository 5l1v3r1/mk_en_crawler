BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Dragan Jocic said on Tuesday (25 July) that implementation of the government's action plan for co-operation with the UN tribunal has begun and that a panel would be formed by the end of this week. 
Jocic says the finance ministry has earmarked over 574,000 euros in additional funding for war crimes prosecution. 
He reiterated that Serbia is obligated to resolve the case of fugitive Ratko Mladic and close this chapter "for the sake of the state and the people".
Romanian President Traian Basescu echoed that sentiment during a meeting in Bucharest with Serbian counterpart Boris Tadic. 
Basescu stressed that Romania fully backs Serbian efforts to resolve the Mladic case, as this would bring Serbia closer to the EU. 
He and Tadic also discussed the Kosovo status issue and agreed that a solution must be reached through dialogue, rather than imposed.

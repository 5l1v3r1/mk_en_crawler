TIRANA, Albania -- The Electoral College, which was supposed to decide Friday (May 27th) on an appeal of the May 8th election results in Tirana, delayed its decision until June 3rd, leaving the winner of the mayoral race still unclear. 
The two main rivals -- the ruling Democratic Party's Lulzim Basha and the main opposition Socialist Party's (SP) Edi Rama -- are neck-and-neck. 
According to results published last week by the Central Election Commission, Basha finished 81 votes ahead of the incumbent, Rama. 
The SP appealed, arguing that the total ballots found in Tirana boxes were 870 more than the number of voters.

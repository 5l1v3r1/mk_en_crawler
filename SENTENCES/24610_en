LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Thursday (March 5th) that Union mediation was the only viable solution to the border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia.
Croatia's EU accession process remains stalled as long as the dispute continues.
At a meeting of European liberal and democratic parties in the Slovenian town of Bled, Rehn called on the two countries to accept the proposal to mediate talks on the border issue.
He also announced he would soon meet with Croatia and Slovenia's foreign ministers to discuss the matter.

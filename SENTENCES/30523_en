BELGRADE, Serbia -- The largest opposition Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) submitted a petition to parliament Thursday (January 13th) to amend the constitution.
The petition suggests reducing the number of lawmakers by half to 125, SNS leader Tomislav Nikolic said, and envisions cutting the number of ministries from the current 24 to no more than 15.
The SNS also wants to eliminate the state secretary posts.
The reforms would save an estimated 18.5m euros a year, Nikolic says.
More than 304,000 people signed a petition backing the amendment, he added.
Next, the SNS will target the public procurement system for reform, aim to reduce the number of government agencies, and reduce the number of political parties to two strong blocs.
Democratic Party (DS) Deputy-President Jelena Trivan rejects the proposed constitutional amendments, saying such a move requires serious analysis and widespread public debate first.
Trivan also denied co-operation between the DS and the SNS towards creating a two-bloc political system.
The Serbian Democratic Party and the Liberal Democratic Party also oppose the SNS initiative.

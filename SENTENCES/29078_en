LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- By a majority of just 3%, Slovenians on Sunday (June 6th) approved an arbitration agreement on their country's maritime border dispute with Croatia. 
The deal was approved by 51.5% of the voters, while 48.5% voted against. 
Turnout was about 41%. 
Authorities in both countries expressed satisfaction with the result, commenting that it represents an important step forward in bilateral relations. 
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso also welcomed the outcome, which clears the way for Croatia's further EU integration process. 
"This is an important step forward ... 
We now look forward to a final settlement of the dispute," Barroso said in a statement.

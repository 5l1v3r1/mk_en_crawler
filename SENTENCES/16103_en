ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on the public to put past controversies behind them and show their appreciation for novelist Orhan Pamuk, winner of this year's Nobel Prize for Literature. 
Nationalists unsuccessfully sued Pamuk earlier this year over an interview in which he said many Armenians and Kurds had been killed in Turkey over the years. 
"The prize is a first for a son of Turkey and it would be wrong for us to underestimate it," Erdogan said.
In other news, a Turkish F-16 fighter plane crashed near the southeastern town of Siverek during a training flight Monday (October 16th) killing the pilot. 
The cause of the crash is under investigation.
Also Monday, Turkish Airlines announced that it has begun to install surveillance cameras on some of its aircraft. 
The system allows pilots to monitor passengers.
The Vatican meanwhile confirmed on Monday that Pope Benedict XVI will visit Turkey in late November, visiting Ankara, Istanbul, Ephesus and Izmir. 
The trip was briefly in doubt following protests over papal remarks on Islam.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia's government survived a parliamentary vote of no-confidence submitted by opposition parties, following a day-long discussion Thursday (22 September) that ended after midnight. 
Sixty-one MPs from the ruling coalition parties rejected the measure, while 23 opposition parliamentarians backed it. 
Two opposition lawmakers abstained, while another 34 were absent from the parliamentary hall during the vote. 
At the end of the session, Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski vowed to intensify efforts for Macedonia's EU and NATO integration and rejected the opposition's charges of fatal delays in the reform process.

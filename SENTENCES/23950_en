ATHENS, Greece -- A series of firebomb attacks rocked Athens early Sunday (May 17th) and Monday, media reported.
The attacks targeted several car dealerships, security companies and shops, causing extensive property damage.
There were six bombings alone over the course of two hours Sunday, according to police, followed by six more early Monday.
No group has so far claimed responsibility, but police suspect anarchists.
Street violence and bombings have intensified since December, when a police officer shot dead a teenager in Athens.

ATHENS, Greece -- The government on Tuesday (January 11th) condemned anti-Islamic comments by a senior Orthodox official after protests from Greece's Muslim community.
Commenting on a bombing in Egypt on New Year's Day, Greek Bishop Seraphim of Piraeus described Islam as a "catastrophic worship" that is incompatible with Greece's Constitution.
He also urged the government to abandon plans to build a mosque in Athens to serve the growing Muslim community there.
Government spokesperson George Petalotis said the bishop's remarks "foment racial and religious hatred".

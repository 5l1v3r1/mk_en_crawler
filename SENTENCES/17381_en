SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament began debating a no-confidence motion Wednesday (February 28th) submitted by opposition parties against the coalition cabinet of Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev.
They demanded the government's dismissal last week, citing failed healthcare reform politics and problems in the healthcare sector.
A vote is expected on Friday.
Separately, Bulgarian expatriates in Turkey say they plan to approach the European Court of Human Rights, over the new law on European Parliament (EP) elections in Bulgaria.
The Federation of Balkan Turks in Edirne issued a statement Tuesday saying they want the law abolished in Strasbourg, if President Georgi Parvanov does not veto the measure himself.
They say it restricts their voting rights, since it allows only Bulgarian citizens who have resided in Bulgaria or another EU member state in the past three months, to participate in the EP elections.

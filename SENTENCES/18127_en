SKOPJE, Macedonia -- US special envoy for the Kosovo status talks Frank Wisner says his government views the issue of border demarcation between Macedonia and Kosovo as closed.
During a video conference organised by the US embassy in Skopje on Thursday (February 15th), he said that the US would not back a reopening of the border question and that Kosovo must be a multiethnic country that lives in peace with its neighbours.
Pristina has been seeking a renegotiation of a 2001 border demarcation accord sealed between Skopje and Belgrade, saying Kosovo Albanians had been excluded from the negotiations.
Skopje rejects any possibility of revision.

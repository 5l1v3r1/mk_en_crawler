ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader met on Tuesday (29 November) with visiting Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern and thanked Ireland for its support in opening accession talks with the EU.
Ahern, in turn, said his country is willing to help Croatia improve its business environment, to attract more foreign investment.
Also Tuesday, Sanader denied media reports that suggested a serious rift has developed between himself and President Stipe Mesic.
At issue is a draft agreement with Austria on the restitution of property belonging to members of the German ethnic community expelled from Croatia after WWII.
Mesic opposes it and says the cabinet failed to consult him on it.

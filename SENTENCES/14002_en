ANKARA, Turkey -- Authorities confirmed on Monday (16 January) that the death of a 12-year-old girl in the city of Van was due to the H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus.
Initial tests were negative for the disease.
The girl thus became Turkey's fourth bird flu victim.
Experts are also awaiting results of tests on three children hospitalised in Istanbul.
Also Monday, the WHO said that the risk of bird flu spreading among humans is diminishing in Turkey although more new cases should be expected.
It stressed that all victims had been in direct contact with infected poultry.

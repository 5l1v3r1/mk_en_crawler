ZAGREB, Croatia -- The opposition parties in parliament jointly called on Friday (5 November) for the resignation of Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul, insisting he was involved in a scandal related to privatisation.
According to the opposition, Zuzul took a bribe from a businessman to facilitate the purchase of the Imotski-based Imostroj Company.
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader says he is watching developments but is not considering Zuzul's dismissal, given the lack of evidence.

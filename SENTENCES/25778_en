SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The second round of talks between senior EU and US officials and leaders of the main Bosniak, Serb and Croat parties ended on Wednesday (October 21st) without agreement on a reform package aimed at ending the lengthy political stalemate and moving the country towards EU and NATO accession.
The talks, which started Tuesday at Camp Butmir near Sarajevo, failed to harmonise the views of the party leaders over much-needed constitutional changes.
Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, and US Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg said after the meeting that party officials remain committed to the negotiations process.
EU and US experts will return to BiH next week to continue talks.

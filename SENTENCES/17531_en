PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj -- who also led the now defunct Kosovo Liberation Army, reportedly met with UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker, incumbent Prime Minister Agim Ceku and President Fatmir Sejdiu on Friday (February 23rd), ahead of his return to The Hague for the start of his trial. 
Haradinaj has been on provisional release from Hague detention since June 2005 following guarantees provided by UNMIK and the Kosovo government. 
He is charged with crimes against Serbian civilians during the Kosovo conflict.
Later on Friday, Serbian President Boris Tadic criticised Ruecker for meeting with a war crimes indictee and vowed to make sure such practices cease.

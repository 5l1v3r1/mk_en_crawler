ANKARA, Turkey -- The main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) and the Nationalist Action Party have accused the government and the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) of wiretapping. 
CHP leader Deniz Baykal told a news conference Wednesday (May 28th) that bugging by state organisations undermines democracy and the rights of the citizens. 
He called the press event after a newspaper affiliated with the government published a conversation Monday between CHP deputy leader Onder Sav and a governor, verbatim. 
Interior Minister Besir Atalay and prosecutors say they will launch an investigation.
In other news Wednesday, Amnesty International issued its 2008 report on Turkey and voiced concern over judicial impartiality and a rise in violence. 
The human rights watchdog also expressed concern over Turkey's offensive against members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party. 
Officials say two more of them were killed late Tuesday in clashes with soldiers in the Van province of eastern Turkey.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Former Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski and Johan Tarculovski, a former senior police official, went before the UN tribunal at The Hague for the start of their war crimes trial Monday (April 16th).
They are charged with the murder of seven ethnic Albanians in the village of Ljuboten in August 2001.
Macedonian police raided the village, conducted house-to-house searches and set 14 houses on fire.
Fleeing residents were stopped at checkpoints and beaten, apparently in retaliation for the death of eight Macedonian soldiers whose truck had run over a landmine.
The two officials have pleaded not guilty, arguing that there was no war at the time and no one could therefore be tried for war crimes.
The defendants also argue that they were not in direct control of the forces that ransacked the village.
UN prosecutors say Boskovski and Tarculovski were part of a criminal conspiracy to carry out the retaliatory attack.
At the prosecution's request Monday, proceedings were delayed until May 7th to allow for the collection of additional evidence.

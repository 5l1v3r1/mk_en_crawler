SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The government and the IMF agreed on a three-year programme worth 1.2 billion euros, Costas Christou, head of an IMF delegation, said on Tuesday (May 5th), after completing talks with BiH authorities.
The first portion of the loan will be available within the next couple of months, once the IMF's executive board approves it.
The Federation of BiH will receive two-thirds of the funding, while Republika Srpska will get the remainder.
Christou explained the assistance is intended to preserve macroeconomic stability and support sustainable medium-term growth.

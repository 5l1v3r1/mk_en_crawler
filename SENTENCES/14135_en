BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy says BiH's integration in the EU is now a viable goal, ten years after the Dayton Peace Accords.
In an interview with the Banja Luka daily Nezavisne novine published on Wednesday (14 December), on the 10th anniversary of the peace deal's sealing in Paris, Douste-Blazy said France is closely following the ongoing initiatives aimed at strengthening BiH institutions.
He voiced strong support for the talks on constitutional reforms among the main political parties, and reiterated France's support for the landmark EU decision to launch negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with BiH.
Meanwhile, the political directors of the Peace Implementation Council for BiH are meeting in Paris Wednesday, with members of a BiH delegation attending.
Paddy Ashdown's successor as high representative may be announced.

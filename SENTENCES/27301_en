TIRANA, Albania -- A junior government partner, the Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI), wants to restart debate on electoral reform to prepare legislation ahead of the next general vote. 
"Free and fair elections and all-inclusive competition can be guaranteed only by a legal framework [Electoral Code] that meets international standards," deputy SMI head Edmond Haxhinasto said on Sunday (February 28th). 
He added that his party is preparing proposals based on OSCE recommendations and will soon send them to parliament for discussion. 
The last Electoral Code adopted by the ruling Democratic Party and the opposition Socialist Party -- enacted six months before the June 2009 elections -- aimed to eliminate smaller parties from parliament.

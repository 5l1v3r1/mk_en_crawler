ZAGREB, Croatia -- Dozens of journalists gathered in downtown Zagreb on Monday (September 29th) to protest the police's failure to deal with the growing crime rate in the capital. 
They rallied four months after assailants beat up Jutarnji List reporter Dusan Miljus on the street. 
Police have not yet found the culprit. 
Crime is Miljus's longtime beat. 
He has been identifying people linked to weapon trafficking between the EU and the former Yugoslavia.

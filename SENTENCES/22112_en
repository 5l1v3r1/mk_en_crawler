PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu described the new Kosovo Security Force (KSF) as Kosovo's elite army on Wednesday (August 13th) after meeting with the head of the disbanding Kosovo Protection Force (KPC), Sylejman Selimi. 
The KSF is expected to have 2,500 active members and 800 reservists. 
While the KPC was officially a civilian organisation, the new constitution describes the KSF as a "national security force".
Also Wednesday, the Albanian Army and KFOR representatives signed an agreement to continue joint border operations between Albania and Kosovo. 
They signed a similar agreement two years ago.

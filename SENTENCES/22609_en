BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbs went to the polls on Sunday (May 11th) to elect their next parliament, in a vote which may amount to a referendum on Serbia's future EU accession. 
The latest poll results show that the nationalist Serbian Radical Party has the support of about 35% of all Serbs entitled to vote, followed closely by the pro-European alliance gathered around President Boris Tadic, with about 34%.
Election stations opened at 7am local time and will close at 8pm. 
Local elections will be held in parallel with the parliamentary vote, including in the Serb-dominated municipalities of Kosovo.
Ahead of the election, the government approved two key documents at a session on Friday. 
The first was the Stabilisation and Association agreement signed with the EU. 
Outgoing Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and the cabinet members from his Serbian Democratic Party-New Serbia alliance walked out of the session, refusing to sign the agreement. 
They returned later to back the second document, an energy agreement with Russia. 
It was adopted unanimously.

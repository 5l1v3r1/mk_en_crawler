SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Official symbols adopted by the main ethnic groups in BiH are unconstitutional, the BiH Constitutional Court ruled on Friday (31 March). 
The decision means that the Republika Srpska and the Federation of BiH parliaments must change their coats of arms, anthems and flags within the next six months. 
It followed a complaint by Bosnian Muslim leader Sulejman Tihic that the symbols violated European conventions on human rights.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- British Ambassador to BiH Ian Cliff voiced support Thursday (27 January) for a call from Republika Srpska (RS) President Dragan Cavic, who is urging all political parties in RS and BiH to contribute to the proper functioning of state and entity-level institutions.
Cliff warned that the recent political turmoil could lead BiH away from its key goals of job creation, launching EU Stabilisation and Association negotiations, and joining NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.
Also Thursday, RS Prime Minister-Designate Pero Bukejlovic said he may invite the main Bosniak party SDA to join the new RS government.
SDA deputy chairman Adil Osmanovic said the party would support any cabinet that plans to focus on EU integration reforms and co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal.

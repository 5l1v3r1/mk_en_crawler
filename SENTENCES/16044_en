SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament elected on Friday (14 April) the seven members of the State Election Commission (SEC). 
There was some debate between the ruling coalition and the main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE on whether all candidates met the legal criteria for membership, prompting the replacement of one of the initial nominees. 
In the end, Jovan Josifovski was elected SEC chairman, and Suphi Jakupi was tapped for deputy chairman. 
The other members are Aleksander Novakovski, Tanja Altandjieva, Iljaz Ibishi, Snezana Kaleska and Aleksandar Dastevski.

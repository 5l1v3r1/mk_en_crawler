BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government said on Thursday (28 April) that three of its nationals being held hostage in Iraq are still alive, one day after their abductor's ultimatum passed. 
Prima TV reporter Marie Jeanne Ion, 32, cameraman Sorin Miscoci, 30, and Romania Libera journalist Ovidiu Ohanesian, 37, were abducted on 28 March. 
Authorities in Bucharest asked the kidnappers to extend their deadline and approached the Muslim Clerics' Association, a Sunni Muslim group in Iraq, to help free the three.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and Carla del Ponte, chief prosecutor of the UN war crimes tribunal, met on Thursday (October 11th) in The Hague to discuss Serbia's progress in fulfilling commitments to the tribunal. 
The EU foreign ministers meet in Luxemburg on Monday, to assess progress made by Serbia before it can sign a Stabilisation and Association Accord (SAA) with the EU. 
Rehn insists that an SAA is dependent on full war crimes co-operation. 
He told Zagreb's Jutarnji List on Thursday that he hopes the SAA will be signed this autumn.
The organisation Human Rights Watch said on Friday that it had sent a letter to the EU foreign ministers reiterating that they must press for full co-operation, including the arrest of fugitive Ratko Mladic.

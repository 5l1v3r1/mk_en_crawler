BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic issued a statement Tuesday (February 12th) appealing for restraint if Kosovo declares independence. 
Tadic once again pledged that he "will not abandon the fight for the interests of citizens and the struggle to preserve Kosovo", and repeated that "only in the EU can Serbia defend its Kosovo". 
He insisted that politicians avoid creating a situation that would jeopardise the safety of Kosovo Serbs.
Separately, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica reiterated that the main goal of all state institutions is to show national unity in defending Kosovo.
Also Tuesday, with Russia's backing, Serbian Ambassador to the UN Pavle Jevremovic demanded an urgent UN Security Council session to discuss the Kosovo situation. 
The Security Council is expected to decide on the request on Wednesday.

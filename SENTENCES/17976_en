TRIPOLI, Libya -- The Supreme Court on Wednesday (June 20th) heard the final appeal of death sentences handed down against five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor for allegedly infecting children at a Benghazi hospital with HIV. 
The court said it would issue its ruling on July 11th. 
While many expect the guilty verdict to be upheld, the ruling could pave the way for commuting the sentences against the medics, in exchange for compensating the families of the children.
On Tuesday, the 18 newly elected Bulgarian members of the European Parliament held a news conference in Strasbourg, France. 
They called for solidarity with the medics and for the continued support of Libyan children.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- General Prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi announced on Friday (May 4th) that the Organized Crime and Terror Investigation Directorate has opened a probe against Communications Minister Zsolt Nagy. 
He is suspected of supporting a transnational ring involved in organised crime and economic espionage. 
According to Kovesi, Nagy is expected to be questioned at the prosecution on Monday. 
Later on Friday, Nagy rejected the accusations, and said that he did not intend to resign from his post. 
A government spokeswoman, Camelia Spataru, briefly said that the minister would not be dismissed unless serious evidence against him appears.

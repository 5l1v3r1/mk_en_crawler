TIRANA, Albania -- The country's Central Election Commission has announced that it will not be able to organise local elections by January 20th as originally planned because the ruling coalition and the opposition have failed to resolve differences over a new electoral law.
President Alfred Moisiu said he would schedule a new date if the political parties reach an agreement.
He has resumed attempts to mediate a compromise on the main issues, holding separate meetings with top representatives of the largest parties in parliament.
The constitution requires the election be held by February 18th.
The EU warned last week that failure to hold a democratic election would derail membership efforts.

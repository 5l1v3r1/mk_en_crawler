ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul hinted on Wednesday (July 25th) that he still intends to run for president, despite strong opposition in the country's secular circles. 
"It is out of the question that I should rule myself out as a candidate," Gul told reporters at a press conference. 
"I cannot ignore the signals from the streets", he added, a reference to the sweeping victory his Justice and Development Party (AKP) enjoyed in early parliamentary elections Sunday. 
At the same time, he said the AKP needs more time to evaluate the situation before any announcement is made.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokeswoman, Krisztina Nagy, called on Turkey Friday (April 13th) to resolve peacefully any problems with neighbouring Iraq.
She stressed that Brussels was closely following developments and hopes that Turkey plays a constructive role in the region.
The statement followed a remark by Turkey's army chief, General Yasar Buyukanit, who said earlier in the week that Turkey should go after members of the terrorist organisation Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in Iraq.
On Friday, the Turkish media reported that five PKK terrorists were killed in army operations in the country's southeast provinces of Hakkari and Sirnak.
The rebels allegedly entered Turkey from Iraq.

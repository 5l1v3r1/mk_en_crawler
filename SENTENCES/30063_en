LONDON, United Kingdom -- Amnesty International urged Romanian authorities on Wednesday (December 22nd) to provide urgent housing assistance to 56 Roma families who were forcibly evicted from their homes in the northwest city of Cluj last week. 
The families, living in improvised barracks and shacks, were given two days' notice their homes would be destroyed. 
There was no consultation with the affected community and no feasible alternative to eviction was explored. 
Some of the families have been moved to inadequate housing facilities, while others remain homeless, the human rights watchdog noted, warning that other families face risk of eviction.

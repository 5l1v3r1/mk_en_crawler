BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic said on Saturday (November 29th) the time has come to review the Kumanovo Agreement, a military accord between Belgrade and NATO on the withdrawal of former Yugoslav troops and police from Kosovo. 
"Serbia has proved that it is a factor of stability in the region," Tadic told the Politika daily. 
He also reiterated that Serbia believes giving Pristina the right to form its own security forces was a mistake. 
Observers have said that Belgrade will seek the right to redeploy its army and police forces in the northern part of Kosovo, which is dominated by Serbs. 
The Kumanovo treaty, signed on June 9th 1999, ended NATO's military intervention in Serbia. 
After it, KFOR contingents were deployed in Kosovo and the UN assumed administrative control over Kosovo.
In other news, a spokeswoman for The Hague tribunal confirmed that chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz has submitted his regular six-month report on Serbia's co-operation to the UN Security Council. 
It is scheduled for discussion on December 12th in New York.

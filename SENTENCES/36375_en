KUMANOVO, Macedonia -- Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski said on Wednesday (19 May) that he would seek the chairmanship of the ruling Social Democratic Alliance for Macedonia in November.
Incumbent Branko Crvenkovski will probably not seek re-election, since he became the country's new president earlier this month.
In other news Wednesday, the joint Bulgarian-Macedonian Commission for Environmental Co-operation held its second meeting.
Bulgarian Environment and Waters Minister Dolores Arsenova says the two governments should further boost co-operation in the area of environmental protection to meet EU standards.
Her Macedonian counterpart, Ljubomir Janev, said Bulgaria's experience in the field is invaluable.

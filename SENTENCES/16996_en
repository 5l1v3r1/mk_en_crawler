TIRANA, Albania -- The ad-hoc parliamentary commission that has been investigating alleged violations by Chief Prosecutor Theodhori Sollaku has completed its two-month work and compiled its findings, panel chairman Astrit Patozi -- of the ruling Democratic Party (DP) -- said on Monday (3 July).
The panel's final session Monday was held despite the absence of representatives from the main opposition Socialist Party (SP).
The SP has disapproved of the investigation since the beginning and has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the panel's work.
The DP accuses Sollaku of links to organised crime.

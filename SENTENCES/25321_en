TIRANA, Albania -- The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) on Monday (January 25th) suspended the voting rights of the Albanian delegation because its members were selected without parliamentarian procedure. 
Tirana insists the official regulations were respected in selecting members. 
They include Kastriot Islami, a lawmaker from the opposition Socialist Party, which has been boycotting Albanian parliamentary sessions since September.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) have asked Turkey to mediate tensions that followed the cancelation of Presidency Chairman Haris Silajdzic's first visit since the end of the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict, initially scheduled for Tuesday (May 25th).
He was expected to meet with President Boris Tadic, but cancelled the visit when Serbia refused to let him meet with war criminal Ilija Jurisic, who is serving a prison term for the May 1992 Tuzla massacre.
Serbia wants Turkey to persuade Silajdic to drop the prison visit altogether, and BiH has asked Turkey "to help make the visit possible".
Earlier this week, engine problems aboard Silajdzic's airplane were blamed for the cancellation.

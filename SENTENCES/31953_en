BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- On Monday (25 November), Prime Minister Dragisa Pesic flatly denied reports by the Western press that Yugoslav authorities were aware of illegal arms trades to Iraq and other countries under UN embargo.
In its Monday edition, The Guardian cited a report by the International Crisis Group that Yugoslavia served as the European hub through which Bosnia, Ukraine, Russia, and "possibly Macedonia and Belarus" provided illegal weapons to Iraq.
The paper also claimed that ranking government officials knew about the illegal trade but did nothing to stop it.
The Yugoslav cabinet denies all knowledge and says that a commission has been established to investigate.

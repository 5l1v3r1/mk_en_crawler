ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told members of his Justice and Development Party (AKP) that he is fully committed to democracy and a secular society. 
His comments followed a weekend demonstration in which at least 300,000 people took to the streets of Ankara to voice their support for the secular character of the republic. 
Erdogan also told reporters that the AKP had not yet picked a candidate for president, though he is considered a frontrunner.
Also Tuesday, Erdogan met with the leaders of the centre-right opposition parties, True Path Party (DYP) and Motherland Party (ANAVATAN), to discuss the upcoming election. 
At a joint press conference afterwards, DYP leader Mehmet Agar said that his party would decide its strategy after the AKP announces its candidate. 
ANAVATAN plans the same strategy.

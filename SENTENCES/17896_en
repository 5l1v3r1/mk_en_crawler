BUCHAREST, Romania -- Olympic athlete Maria Cioncan died in a car crash in neighbouring Bulgaria on Sunday (January 21st). 
One of Romania's leading female athletes, the middle distance runner won a bronze medal in the 2004 Athens Olympics. 
Her coach, travelling in a separate car, says Cioncan's vehicle skidded and crashed into a tree during the trip home from a training camp in Greece via Bulgaria. 
She died instantly, while the other person in the car suffered head injuries. 
Voicing shock Sunday, the head of the Romanian National Agency for Sport said he would insist that Romanian athletes stop using their personal cars when on training tours and that federations provide transportation instead.

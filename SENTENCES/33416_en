SKOPJE, Macedonia -- On Wednesday (30 April) the IMF Board of Directors approved a $28m stand-by arrangement to support the government's economic programme through 15 June 2004. 
The stand-by arrangement follows a staff-monitored plan, requested after arrangements under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility and the Extended Fund Facility were cancelled in November 2001, and implemented during the first half of 2002. 
The new government programme aims to secure a stable fiscal environment and exchange rate, and targets 3 per cent growth in both inflation and GDP.

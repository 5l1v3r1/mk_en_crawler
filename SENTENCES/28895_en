SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Boyko Borisov announced on Friday (June 11th) that the cabinet has decided to halt construction of the Burgas-Alexandroupolis pipeline. 
After a meeting with EU ambassadors in Sofia, he said the decision was based on environmental risks, as well as the fact the pipeline would pass through protected territories, included in the EU's Natura 2000 network. 
He also mentioned the questionable economic benefits of the project. 
The pipeline was to be completed in co-operation with Russia and Greece. 
Borisov also announced that the cabinet is putting the construction of a second nuclear power plant at Belene on hold, citing financial issues.
Despite Borisov's announcement, Energy Minister Traycho Traykov says the cabinet has not discussed either issue.

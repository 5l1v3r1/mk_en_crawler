NICOSIA, Cyprus -- In a move widely described as an effort to regain the initiative in efforts to reunite Cyprus, the Greek Cypriot government on Friday (16 July) offered to remove its forces from part of the ceasefire line that has divided the island for three decades, provided Turkey does the same.
"It is our conviction that these initiatives will form the basis of fostering trust and security among Greek and Turkish Cypriots," said government spokesman Kypros Chrysostomides.
The government also proposed setting up eight new checkpoints and opening the closed port of Famagusta for joint operation by the two communities.
Initial reaction from Turkey was cautious.
"Let's look at what they say.
We'll evaluate (the proposal) with our (Turkish Cypriot) friends and then we will make a decision," Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said.
Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat appeared to dismiss the proposals, describing them as a "distraction" and calling for a comprehensive solution.

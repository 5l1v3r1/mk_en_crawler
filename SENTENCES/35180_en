SOFIA, Bulgaria -- By an overwhelming margin, Nadezhda Mihaylova was re-elected leader of the main opposition party, the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), at the party's national conference late Saturday (21 February).
New members of the party's executive council were also elected.
Former Prime Minister Ivan Kostov, who once chaired the UDF, boycotted the extraordinary conference along with the faction around him.
Kostov has said he will leave the party, sparking rumours he will establish a new one.

ANKARA, Turkey -- One person died and three were injured Thursday (July 16th) in an explosion at a weapons manufacturing factory in the northwestern town of Duzce. 
Investigators say a gas leak sparked a fire at the plant.
Meanwhile, authorities announced Thursday that flooding along Turkey's Black Sea coast has claimed six lives and injured 11 people. 
Torrential rains earlier this week triggered flooding in the provinces of Artvin, Ordu and Bartin.

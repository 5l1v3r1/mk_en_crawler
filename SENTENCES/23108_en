ZAGREB, Croatia -- Austria on Thursday (October 2nd) extradited former Croatian General Vladimir Zagorec, wanted in Croatia on charges of embezzling $5m worth of diamonds bought with government funds. 
The BBC says he allegedly took the gems from an arms dealer while he was deputy defence minister during Croatia's 1990s war. 
The diamonds were a guarantee against the delivery of anti-aircraft missiles -- which violated a UN embargo. 
Zagorec, who has lived in Austria for the past eight years, denies the allegations. 
Austrian police arrested him in Vienna on September 26th. 
He was out on bail at the time, following his initial arrest in March 2007.

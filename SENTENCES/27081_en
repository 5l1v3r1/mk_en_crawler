BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Social Democratic Party (PSD) supports a 20% cut in the salaries of civil servants, while its ruling partner, the Liberal Democratic Party (PDL), continues to back the idea of layoffs in the public sector, Minister of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Constantin Nita said on Sunday (August 2nd). 
He added that the PSD would continue supporting the elimination of a lump-sum corporate tax introduced in May, saying that revenue could be achieved instead by raising taxes on mineral water and other natural resources. 
President Traian Basescu wants to see one fifth of civil servants laid off.
Prime Minister Emil Boc, meanwhile, says he will talk to each cabinet minister about staff reductions within government agencies. 
So far, only the education and the agriculture ministries have announced cuts.

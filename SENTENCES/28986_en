PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX head Xavier Bout de Marnhac said on Monday (November 8th) that corruption investigations are ongoing and that new developments can be expected soon. 
"This is a very serious issue ... 
There will be developments in the coming weeks or days," de Marnhac was quoted as saying after meeting with outgoing Prime Minister Hashim Thaci. 
EULEX conducted a number of raids this year in relation to alleged corruption cases, misuse of power, organised crime and tax evasion, but no case has been completed so far. 
EULEX has led no new actions since de Marnhac took office on October 15th.

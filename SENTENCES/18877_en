SOFIA, Bulgaria -- US Ambassador to Sofia John R. Beyrle again urged the Bulgarian government Wednesday (April 4th) to fight any attempt to embezzle in the utilisation of EU funds.
Speaking at a conference on public procurement procedures in the country, Beyrle said the current public procurement law is up-to-date with EU and international standards.
This legislation, together with a new register created with the assistance of USAID, marks progress in combating corruption, he noted.
A new report found that out of 100 public procurement procedures in the past six months, one in three were marred by violations.

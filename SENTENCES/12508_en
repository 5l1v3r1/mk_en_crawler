TIRANA, Albania -- The country's two main parties -- the ruling Socialist Party (SP) and the opposition Democratic Party (DP) -- are still unable to reach an agreement on the country's electoral map ahead of the 2005 parliamentary vote.
In separate statements Monday (7 February), SP representatives confirmed that the Socialists would not back down from their initial positions about revising election zones.
Separately, DP leader Sali Berisha accused SP chairman, Prime Minister Fatos Nano, of trying to put off this year's elections.

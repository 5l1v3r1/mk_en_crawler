BELGRADE, Serbia -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev assured Serbian leaders on Monday (February 25th) that there will be no shift in Moscow's support for Serbian sovereignty over Kosovo.
Medvedev is considered President Vladimir Putin's likely successor.
He and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov are the first officials from abroad to visit Belgrade and meet with President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica since Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence on February 17th.
Moscow says Kosovo's decision will jeopardise regional security and have serious implications for global politics.
Kostunica told Russian officials that Belgrade plans to continue to rule parts of Kosovo where Serbs and non-Albanians live.
"Serbia will do everything to implement its jurisdiction and state prerogatives for all loyal citizens in Kosovo," he said.
He also ruled out Serbia normalising relations with countries that recognised Kosovo's independence.
While in Belgrade, the Russian officials also met with Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik.
They reviewed the latest political developments and discussed what they view as a need for an elaboration of the Dayton Peace Agreement and the decision-making process in BiH.
They also talked about boosting economic co-operation.

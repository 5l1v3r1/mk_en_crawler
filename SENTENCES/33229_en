ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said on Monday (12 May) that the Turkish military could withdraw from Cyprus if the dispute over the island is resolved.
Gul's comment appeared to support an earlier one by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, who said that if Greek Cypriots recognise the guarantor status of Turkey, the Turkish military could gradually withdraw.

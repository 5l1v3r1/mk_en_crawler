PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Serbian memorial monument of Gazimestan, just outside Pristina, will soon be protected by the Kosovo Police which will replace KFOR troops.
Kosovo Police spokesman Baki Kelani said on Tuesday (March 16th) that the competencies still lie with KFOR but the police have started preparations to take over the protection of the monument.
In reaction, Serbia's Ministry for Kosovo said that the decision to withdraw KFOR from Gazimestan is not the right one.
Taking over the duty to guard the Gazimestan monument will be the first case of Kosovo Police protecting a Serb cultural monument in Kosovo.
The monument commemorates the medieval Battle of Kosovo in 1389.

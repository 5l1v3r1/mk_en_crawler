THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Dutch police said on Tuesday (6 June) that they have arrested a Croat convicted of war crimes in Croatia. 
Munib Suljic was tried together with two co-defendants for the murder of ethnic Serbs in the town of Pakrac during the 1991-1995 conflict. 
He received a ten year sentence last September, but Croatia's Supreme Court recently upped the term to 12 years on appeal by the prosecution. 
Dutch police denied an initial report that Suljic had been injured during the arrest.

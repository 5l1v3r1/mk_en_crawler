ATHENS, Greece -- An estimated 2,000 people marched in Athens on Thursday (July 9th) to protest racism and government plans to deport illegal immigrants. 
They rallied outside parliament chanting "No to expulsion!" The demonstration was organised by trade unions, the Committee for Protection of Immigrants and leftist groups. 
Several far-left groups, including anarchists ended up clashing with far-right groups and police officers in a district predominantly inhabited by immigrants.

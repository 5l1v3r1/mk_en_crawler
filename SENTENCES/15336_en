ZAGREB, Croatia -- The role of ombudsman should be strengthened to better protect the rights of citizens, according to a parliamentary conference on the subject Monday (25 September).
The participants agreed that the ombudsman should have its own funds and that the law on ombudsman' activities should be amended so that he/she is able to supervise the work of courts and state institutions.
Also Monday, Croatia's Council for National Minority and the British NGO WYG International kicked off a joint 700,000-euro project to support the rights of minorities.
The 18-month project aims to acquaint minorities with their constitutional rights and lay the groundwork for establishing minorities' councils as part of local administrations.

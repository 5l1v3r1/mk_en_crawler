PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Representatives of civic organisations in Kosovo have sent a letter to US Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg asking him to use his influence "to ensure that EULEX has enough capacities and political support to fulfil its mandate and yield the expected results for Kosovo citizens." No significant progress in rule of law has been seen since EULEX was deployed, the authors claimed, adding that the mission lacks support, political will and internal capacities.
A strong US commitment, they said, is a precondition for success.

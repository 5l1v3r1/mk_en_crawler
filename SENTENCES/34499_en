BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The federal Supreme Defence Council convened Wednesday (8 October) and authorised the participation of Serbia-Montenegro troops in international peacekeeping missions. 
The council had instructed the defence ministry to come up with draft laws needed to regulate the process. 
About 500 troops are expected to go to Afghanistan after the cabinet and parliament approve the necessary legislation.

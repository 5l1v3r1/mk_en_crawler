PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Deputy Prime Minister Edita Tahiri, who will head Kosovo's delegation in talks with Serbia, said on Tuesday (March 1st) that Kosovo will have a constructive and creative spirit in the dialogue, which is expected to start in two weeks. 
"Dialogue will have an exclusively technical character for the resolution of practical issues which contribute to the improvement of lives of citizens and accelerate Kosovo's integration in the EU, NATO and other international institutions," Tahiri said after a meeting with International Civilian Office head Pieter Feith.
Meanwhile, the opposition Vetevendosje Movement criticised the government for rushing into dialogue with Belgrade. 
The priorities of the government are not the troubles of the people and their social and economic misery but Serbia's political agenda, Vetevendosje argued.

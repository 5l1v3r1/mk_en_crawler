ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police said Saturday (16 April) they are investigating media allegations that fugitive war crimes indictee retired General Ante Gotovina might have fled the country in 2001 with forged documents. 
According to media reports in Zagreb earlier this week, Gotovina escaped using a false identity issued by the Zagreb police department. 
The news has stirred controversy in Croatia, which is trying to convince the EU that authorities are doing everything possible to locate and arrest the retired general.

TIRANA, Albania -- Tens of thousands of people hit the streets of Tirana on Friday (April 30th) in a protest organised by the opposition, insisting authorities open the ballot boxes from the June 2009 general elections, which they say were marred by violations. 
The government, however, says the demands are illegal. 
According to organisers, about 200,000 people joined the action, although no official figures were announced. 
Still, it was the biggest street protest against the election results so far. 
Twenty-two lawmakers from the opposition Socialist Party and 180 party supporters launched a hunger strike in an effort to get the government to agree to a partial vote recount. 
On Saturday, one group tried to break into Prime Minister Sali Berisha's office, injuring at least one police officer.

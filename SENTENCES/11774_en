TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu met on Friday (17 June) with representatives of local civil associations and organisations that will deploy observers for the 3 July parliamentary vote.
According to a statement from his office, Moisiu noted the importance of the participation of Albanian observers -- along with international monitors from the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights and the Council of Europe -- saying it would develop a positive tradition in the country.
Moisiu, who has been meeting in recent weeks with all groups involved in the elections process, again called for full implementation of the new election Code of Conduct.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The EU and the OSCE issued a joint statement Wednesday (29 October) in support of the six-week weapons collection programme due to start Saturday.
Authorities in Skopje have announced a "no questions asked" amnesty for those who turn in their weapons.
The government and the UNDP, sponsors of the campaign, hope to collect 25,000 arms.
According to some estimates, there may be as many as 150,000 guns in the hands of the population.
The EU says municipalities that fail to joint the voluntary disarmament campaign would be disqualified from further assistance projects.
Also Wednesday, parliament passed the law on military service, which is part of the NATO Membership Action Plan.
Under the bill, army staff would be reduced from 16,007 to 12,858 by 2007.

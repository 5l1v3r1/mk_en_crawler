THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Naser Oric, 37, the former commander of Muslim forces in Srebrenica, appeared before the UN tribunal on Wednesday (6 October) to hear the charges against him. 
In his opening statement, prosecutor Jan Wubben said Oric knew and approved of his men beating prisoners. 
Seven Serb prisoners allegedly died as a result of torture between 1992 and 1993.
In other news, the government of Republika Srpska (RS) said Wednesday that it has turned over 600 pages of military wartime documents to the UN tribunal. 
Conspicuously absent, however, were Radovan Karadzic's personal archives, which disappeared in 1998. 
RS Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic said the search for the documents would continue.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said Thursday (15 April) that he hopes a new federal government would be approved by the federal parliament Friday.
The legislature is expected to vote on the cabinet after the republican governments of Serbia and Montenegro reach a general agreement on distributing the cabinet seats.
Boris Tadic, the leader of the Democratic Party, has stepped down as federal defence minister, and Goran Svilanovic has resigned as federal foreign minister.
Serbian Renewal Movement leader Vuk Draskovic has been nominated for the latter post.
Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic, meanwhile, has proposed Prvoslav Davinic as the new defence minister.

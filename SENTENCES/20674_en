PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The ethnic Albanian leaders of Kosovo have renewed their pledge to consult the EU and the United States before declaring the province's independence.
In a letter to major international news agencies released on Sunday (December 9th), they promised to refrain from violence and keep the province calm, now that the deadline is passing for the international mediating troika on Kosovo to complete its mission.
The leaders, members of the Kosovo negotiation team in the just-completed talks with Belgrade, asked the international community to provide "urgent clarity" about the future of Kosovo.
Separately, Hashim Thaci, the former Kosovo Liberation Army commander who won Kosovo's recent general election, said in an interview Monday that the province's politicians could delay a declaration of independence until they have secured enough international support.
"We are for a co-ordinated declaration of independence.
For us recognition is as important as the declaration," he said, urging the EU to play a key role.
The declaration could be delayed until March, he said.
Meanwhile, Serbian Army Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Zdravko Ponos told the FoNet news agency on Sunday that the Serbian army is prepared to handle different scenarios regarding Kosovo.
He did not elaborate, noting that Serbia's political leaders do not foresee the need for a serious military engagement.
During a visit on Friday to Banja Luka in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbian President Boris Tadic warned that a crisis in Kosovo would affect the whole region.

BERLIN, Germany -- Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg says Germany will soon have 1,000 troops deployed in Kosovo, in contrast to the current 3,500 serving under KFOR. 
He told the German daily Welt am Sonntag on Sunday (May 2nd) that stability and security indicate troops can begin leaving, adding that the mission in Kosovo proves that longer engagements are required for success.

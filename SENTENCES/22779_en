TIRANA, Albania -- Prosecutors decided on Wednesday (October 8th) to open criminal proceedings against Bosnian businessman Damir Fazlic over alleged illegal financial activity in Albania. 
According to media reports, Fazlic established business relations with Prime Minister Sali Berisha and other government officials and registered a number of companies in 2005. 
Fazlic's alleged improper activities included selling a business worth 1.750m euros that was never active without paying any taxes for the transaction. 
Media also reported that Fazlic is behind a Serbia-based company that has sold power to the Albanian Energy Corporation (KESH) under favourable conditions, in deals worth about 35m euros.

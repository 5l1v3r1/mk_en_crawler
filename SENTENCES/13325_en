SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Macedonian Parliament on Friday (25 November) adopted a constitutional amendment reducing the president's powers in top judicial appointments.
The provision is part of a legislative package aimed at restructuring the national judiciary and bringing Macedonia closer to Euro-Atlantic integration.
Under the amendment, the head of state would be authorised to submit nominations to the legislature, but would not have the right to make direct appointments to the Republican Judicial Council.
Under another amendment adopted Friday, the public prosecutor of the country would be nominated by the government, but approved by parliament.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Officials announced on Tuesday (August 12th) that they found an abandoned bag they believe belongs to former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. 
The team for co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal said the bag contained a laptop, around 55 CDs, newspaper articles and two books. 
In a statement, the authorities added they are performing a DNA analysis to determine whether the items belong to the war crimes indictee. 
Karadzic's lawyer tells Beta that the location of the bag coincides with the spot where police arrested Karadzic in July.

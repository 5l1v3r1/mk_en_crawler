ATHENS, Greece -- The High Administrative Court imposed a temporary hunting ban on Friday (November 9th) after an environmental NGO demanded the preservation of wildlife in the region severely damaged by the devastating fires last summer. 
The hunting ban will be effective until November 21st, when a final decision on the issue is expected.
Meanwhile, Greece was hit with strong winds and snow on Friday, felling trees and causing transportation problems. 
Storms also hit Bulgaria, Romania and Albania where many roads were closed and some areas were left without electricity.
In other news in the region, the Greek coast guard launched an operation on Sunday to save a large group of illegal immigrants aboard a Turkish ship. 
The ship was apparently in danger of sinking in rough weather and choppy seas. 
According to the captain, 15 crew and 250 immigrants were aboard the vessel, which was reportedly heading for Italy.

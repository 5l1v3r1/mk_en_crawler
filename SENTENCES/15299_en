LISBON, Portugal -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso confirmed on Monday (October 30th) that he has appointed Leonard Orban as Romania's EU Commissioner.
He will be in charge of multilingualism and culture.
Following a meeting with Orban in Lisbon, Barroso expressed confidence that the candidate is right for the job.
Orban, currently deputy EU integration minister in Bucharest, also has served as Romania's negotiator-in-chief with the EU.
He was nominated to the EC post after Brussels rejected Senator Varujan Vosganian's nomination.

LISBON, Portugal -- In the biggest opening-game upset in European Championships history, Greece beat host Portugal 2-1 on Saturday (12 June).
"With its historic victory tonight, our national team won the respect of European fans and filled every Greek with emotion," Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said, congratulating the team.
Thousands of people took to the streets of major Greek towns Saturday night, blowing car horns in celebration.
Meanwhile, Croatia suffered a setback just 24 hours before its game with Switzerland when its first-choice goalie, Stipe Pletikosa, had to pull out of the tournament with a thigh injury.
Bulgaria, which is due to play its first game against Sweden on Monday, is concerned that it might lose midfielder Martin Petrov, who suffered an injury Saturday.

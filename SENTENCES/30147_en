NEW YORK, United States -- Human Rights Watch (HRW) is urging EULEX to appoint a high-profile independent prosecutor to investigate crimes allegedly committed by some former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) leaders.
In a press release Wednesday (January 19th), the human rights watchdog warned that EULEX will face major obstacles while trying to conduct trustworthy investigations of such serious accusations, a reference to Council of Europe Rapporteur Dick Marty's allegations on organ trafficking.
HRW added that an independent prosecutor may be necessary, along with an effective witness protection programme.
In addition, HRW asked the US government and the EU to pressure the governments of Albania, Kosovo, Serbia and other countries to fully co-operate with the investigations.

ANKARA, Turkey -- IMF First Deputy Managing Director Anne Krueger asserted Friday (17 January) that good relations between the Fund and Turkey hinge on progress the government makes in advancing structural reforms.
After meeting with senior government and central bank officials, Krueger expressed concern over the country's recent economic slowdown.
In Macedonia meanwhile, Finance Minister Petar Gosev announced that negotiations with the IMF on a Stand-By Agreement will begin Wednesday and will continue until 7 February.
One other note, the Fund is urging Romania to control wage increases and called on the government to speed up privatisation.
In October, the IMF withheld the release of a $396m loan, citing steep wage increases.

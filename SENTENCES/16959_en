BELGRADE, Serbia -- UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte left Belgrade on Tuesday (October 3rd) without approving Serbia's much publicised plan for the arrest of Ratko Mladic. 
"I must tell you I am not satisfied about the implementation of the action plan," she said. 
Del Ponte went on to add that she would not present a positive report on Serbia to the EU later this month. 
The EU will use her report as a basis for deciding whether to resume negotiations with Belgrade on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
Among those meeting with del Ponte was Rasim Ljajic, chairman of the national council for co-operation with The Hague tribunal. 
He later told the local TV Pink that "some operative data" about Mladic's location was presented to del Ponte, but did not elaborate.

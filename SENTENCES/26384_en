SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko warned on Thursday (November 12th) that he will have to "take the initiative in Mostar" after the City Council failed -- for a 17th time -- to elect a mayor. 
"I am now considering several options and will discuss this matter with the Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council next week," Inzko said in a statement. 
The Mostar City Council has been unable to agree on a consensus candidate, leaving the mayoral post vacant for a year and the city without a budget.

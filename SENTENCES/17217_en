SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Defence Minister Lazar Elenovski announced on Wednesday (December 27th) that he has sacked leaders of the country's military intelligence sector over the recent scandal involving army weapons, seized on their way to Bulgaria. 
Elenovski said three top officials were fired after an internal investigation suggested irregularities in the contract with the Bulgarian company receiving the exports. 
It also found that military intelligence failed to conduct the requisite preliminary assessment of the terms. 
Elenovski did not rule out a further shakeup of the army's general staff.

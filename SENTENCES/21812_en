NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Ahead of his talks Friday (July 25th) with Cypriot President Demetris Christofias, Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat predicted comprehensive reunification talks will begin in September. 
In an interview Wednesday with CNN Turk, he stressed the importance of political equality with Greek Cypriots in all institutions. 
Talat said some issues are nonnegotiable for the Turkish Cypriot side -- Turkey's guarantorship, political equality and a bi-zonal state with two founder states -- but added, "we are ready to negotiate everything else."

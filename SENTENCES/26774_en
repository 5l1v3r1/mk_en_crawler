SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko met on Monday (February 8th) with Bozo Ljubic, leader of the Bosnian Croat HDZ 1990 party, marking the start of a new round of talks with key politicians. 
The focus is on the current political stalemate and issues related to state and military property. 
Resolving the matter is crucial to transitioning the Office of the High Representative into an EU Special Representative office, currently a year behind schedule.

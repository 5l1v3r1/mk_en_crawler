ZAGREB, Croatia -- The UN war crimes tribunal's verdict in the case of two former Croatian generals has drawn angry protests in their home country. 
Tens of thousands of Croats gathered in Zagreb, Split, Rijeka, Osijek and Pozega on Saturday (April 16th) to voice outrage over the conviction and sentencing of Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markac, who received prison terms of 24 and 18 years, respectively. 
President Ivo Josipovic also expressed his shock, while Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor noted that the decision is subject to appeal.
In its ruling Friday, the tribunal found the two men had participated in a joint criminal enterprise aimed at forcibly and permanently removing the ethnic Serb population from the Krajina region of Croatia. 
A third general, Ivan Cermak, was acquitted of all charges and arrived in Zagreb late Friday.

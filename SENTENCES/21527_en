THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former war crimes tribunal spokeswoman Florence Hartmann refused on Monday (October 27th) to enter a plea on contempt-of-court charges.
On August 27th, the tribunal indicted her for disclosing confidential information from the trial of former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic.
According to the indictment, in her 2007 book, "Peace and Punishment", as well as in the work "Vital Genocide Documents Concealed", published in Bosnia and Herzegovina in January, Hartmann revealed two confidential decisions the Court of Appeals made in Milosevic's case:
on September 20th 2005 and on April 6th 2006.
Prosecutors maintain Hartmann knew she was violating the law when disclosing decisions marked confidential.

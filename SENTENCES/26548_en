ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou warned on Wednesday (December 9th) that Greece's financial woes pose a risk to national sovereignty for the first time since the reinstatement of democracy in 1974. 
"We are decided to do everything that is within our powers to get the budget deficit properly under control, to restore stability of public finances and to continue development. 
This is the only way for Greece not to lose its right of sovereignty," Papandreou said. 
Greece, a member of the eurozone, has been heavily criticised for its rapidly expanding deficit, now estimated at 12.7% of GDP. 
On Monday, the rating agency Standard & Poors announced it has put Greece on a negative credit watch.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The Hague tribunal prosecutor's office is mulling whether to combine the trial of former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic with that of former Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic, Frederick Swinnen, political adviser to the prosecutor, said on Monday (May 30th). 
He pointed out that all options are under consideration at the moment, but no decision has been made. 
Karadzic's war crimes trial started in 2009 while Mladic's extradition to The Hague is pending. 
A court in Serbia on Tuesday rejected an appeal filed by Mladic's lawyer, Milos Saljic, who said his client is too ill to stand trial.

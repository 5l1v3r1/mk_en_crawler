WASHINGTON, United States -- Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini believes that Albania will see its EU visa barriers fall by summer. 
In a speech on Tuesday (January 26th), Frattini expressed hope that political parties in Tirana will understand the country's broader interest and help it join the EU as soon as possible. 
The opposition Socialist Party has been boycotting parliament for months, demanding an investigation into June 2009 general elections.
A reported 89% of Albanian citizens support EU integration, according to a survey by the Institute for International Studies in Tirana.

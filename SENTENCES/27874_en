PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The FOL (Speak-Up) Movement on Monday (November 22nd) urged acting President Jakup Krasniqi not to campaign ahead of the December 12th snap elections, as it might potentially violate the constitution.
The NGO pointed to a recent appearance by Krasniqi in Prizren, where he participated in a Democratic Party of Kosovo rally.
"At the time when there is an acting president and an outgoing government in Kosovo, we consider that Krasniqi's involvement in a political party undermines political stability and establishes a bad precedent for the democratic functioning of public institutions," the movement said in a press release.
FOL called on Krasniqi to demonstrate maturity in representing the presidential institution, which it says should serve as a unifying symbol.
Krasniqi was serving as parliament speaker when he had to take over the duties of acting president after Fatmir Sejdiu resigned from the post in September amid constitutional violations.

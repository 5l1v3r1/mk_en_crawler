BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis and her Macedonian counterpart, Antonio Milososki, held talks in Brussels on Friday (March 21st). 
The meeting was organised by the United States and attended by US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried and the US Ambassador to NATO, Victoria Nuland.
In a statement afterwards, the two ministers pledged their commitment to resolving the longstanding name dispute between their countries. 
"We had an exchange of ideas that underlined the will of the two governments to reach a solution," Bakoyannis told reporters. 
Milososki, for his part, said that "things are moving slowly," but added that hope should not be lost. 
UN-mediated talks on resolving the dispute will continue on Tuesday, after the two diplomats brief their governments on the meeting's results.
Also in the news, White House Press Secretary for US President George Bush, Dana Perino, said that Bush is optimistic there will be a positive outcome to the negotiations before the NATO summit in April.

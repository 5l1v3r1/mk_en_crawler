TIRANA, Albania -- Police announced on Monday (21 August) that they found and destroyed illegal marijuana plantations in the village of Lazarat, in the southern Gjirokaster region. 
Over 1,700 plants were destroyed. 
No one was arrested, however, as the houses and yards involved were abandoned years ago.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Teams of experts representing the Turkish and Greek communities on Cyprus are working constructively, Jose Diaz, spokesman for the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, said on Wednesday (April 23rd).
The six working groups and the seven technical committees began work on Tuesday and will lay the groundwork for the eventual resumption of negotiations to reunite the island, divided now for decades.
"Members of each technical committee and working group discussed and expressed their positions in a very positive way," Diaz said.
Officials established the committees according to an agreement reached last month between new Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat.

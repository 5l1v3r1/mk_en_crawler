SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A former high-ranking official used a fake German diploma to get her job, an investigation into the authenticity of the document revealed on Tuesday (November 30th). 
Kalina Ilieva apparently forged her diploma from the Berlin University for Engineering and Economics, because she never completed her studies there, the agriculture ministry announced after checking her credentials with the university. 
Ilieva now faces charges both in Bulgaria and Germany. 
She became head of the State Agriculture Fund in 2009, when she was 28. 
This is the second investigation against her, after she provided fake medical documents.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The international community's High Representative to BiH Paddy Ashdown and BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic called for new talks aimed at unblocking the country's crucial police reform, Ashdown's office said Friday (22 July).
The two urged all parties that took part in the previous negotiations in Vlasic to attend the new meeting, scheduled for Tuesday in Sarajevo.
The talks will focus on reaching an agreement on steps that need to be taken to ensure the realisation of the key police reform.
Restructuring the BiH police system was set as one of the main conditions by the EU for starting talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with BiH.
The Vlasic initiative failed after Bosnian Serb authorities refused to accept the reform concept -- mainly due to the redrawing of police regions.

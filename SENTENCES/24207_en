BUCHAREST, Romania -- By a wide margin Wednesday (May 13th), parliament rejected the first no-confidence vote filed against Prime Minister Emil Boc's cabinet, which its foes accused of implementing policies that only aggravate the economic crisis. 
The opposition National Liberal Party and the Democratic Union of Hungarians submitted the motion. 
Both parties were in power until last November. 
After the vote Wednesday, Boc said the outcome demonstrates how stable the two-party coalition between the Liberal Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party is.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said on Monday (August 18th) that the decision by a Serbian student to flee back to his homeland after allegedly beating another student into a coma is his "personal choice". 
Miladin Kovacevic, 20, refuses to return to the United States to be tried for the May 4th assault, which left Bryan Steinhauer, 22, with multiple skull fractures.
According to Jeremic, Serbia's laws do not allow the extradition of its citizens. 
The Serbian newspaper Blic reported on Monday that witnesses have seen Kovacevic training with the local basketball club KK Vrbas. 
Kovacevic played for Binghamton University in New York state before the alleged altercation with Steinhauer.

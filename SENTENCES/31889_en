ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey is to remain in command of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan for two more months, according to government sources quoted Thursday (28 November). 
The allied peacekeeping troops are currently under the command of Maj Gen Hilmi Akin Zorlu, whose mandate is set to expire on 20 December. 
However, in view of the latest developments with Iraq, the transfer of command will be most probably delayed, according to Turkish media. 
Turkey will eventually hand over command to Germany.
Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Colin Powell says Ankara should receive additional financial assistance if a military intervention in Iraq is required. 
Turkey has a number of military bases near its border with Iraq, which could provide the necessary proximity for US or other troops. 
But Ankara has indicated it will not be able to bear the full cost.

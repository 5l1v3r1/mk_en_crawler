ATHENS, Greece -- EU Internal Market and Services Commissioner Michel Barnier said on Friday (January 14th) that the prospect of Greece leaving the eurozone is out of the question. 
"Greece is still in a state of emergency, but has reasons to hope for a better future, since there are prospects for development. 
Amidst difficult times, Greece made the right decision and has undertaken painful efforts, defending its role in eurozone," Barnier told journalists after meeting with local officials in Athens.

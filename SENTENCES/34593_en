BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic said Thursday (28 August) that there would be no government reshuffle, though he did not rule out the possibility of some changes.
Commenting on the government's programme, he noted that the cabinet has another year in office and said that its priorities are established.
He said it makes political sense for parties in the ruling coalition, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia, to support cabinet decisions.
This was in response to reports that Serbian Justice Minister Vladan Batic's Christian Democratic Party of Serbia might not support the action plan on economic harmonisation between Serbia and Montenegro, scheduled for a vote in the federal parliament Friday.

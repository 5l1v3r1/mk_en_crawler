ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Speaking at the Alliance of Civilisations summit in Istanbul on Monday (November 13th), UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan rejected the idea of a clash of civilisations. 
He described youth as a key factor for ending inter-religious mistrust and called for better opportunities. 
The Alliance is an initiative launched jointly by Spain and Turkey in 2005 and backed by the UN. 
It aims to promote dialogue between the West and the East, specifically the Islamic world.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Michael Steiner is proceeding with plans to transfer some powers from UN administration to Kosovo institutions, despite opposition by Belgrade. 
According to Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic, the government did not get a "positive response" to its request to put off the process, though Steiner insisted that authority over matters pertaining to defence, security, judiciary, foreign affairs and international economic relations would not be transferred for now.
Meanwhile, Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi sent a letter to the Council of Europe (CoE), expressing concern that the accession of Serbia-Montenegro would enhance "Belgrade's destructive policy towards Kosovo". 
Rexhepi insisted that Kosovo is not obliged to follow any CoE rules.

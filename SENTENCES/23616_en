TIRANA, Albania -- Three small parties in parliament have created a new right-wing coalition called The Pole of Freedom, local media reported on Tuesday (January 25th). 
The new group includes the Christian Democratic Party, the National Development Movement and the New Legal and Justice Party. 
The new coalition says it will try to attract lawmakers, other political parties and social groups that consider themselves traditionally rightist, including the National Front Party.
In other news Tuesday, the Court of Appeals has failed to process the case of Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha, who faces charges of corruption and abuse of power. 
According to media reports, two members of the panel resigned prior to the session, citing conflicts of interest with another case involving one of the defendants. 
They also argued the Supreme Court should take the case. 
It went to the Court of Appeals after a lower court cleared Basha of charges on procedural grounds. 
Basha faces charges over an allegedly corrupt tender procedure for the construction of a section of the Durres-Kukes highway in 2006, when he was transport and communications minister.

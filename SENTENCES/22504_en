TIRANA, Albania -- Albania is ready and open to investments in the energy sector, including in nuclear energy, Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on Sunday (June 8th) at the opening of the two-day Vienna Economic Forum in Tirana. 
"My feeling is that we should not exclude Albanians but include them to benefit from this excellent source, which is the nuclear source of electrical energy," said Berisha in his opening speech to company representatives from Austria, the Black Sea countries and Albania. 
Berisha also invited European companies to build about 400 hydro plants on rivers around the country. 
He noted that Albania favours the full liberalisation of its energy sector.

ATHENS, Greece -- Farmers blocked highway checkpoints Monday (January 18th) at Greece's northern border with Macedonia and Bulgaria, demanding secure subsidies, guaranteed prices for their produce, lower production costs and secure bank credits.
Using tractors, the farmers blocked key highways in Greece, along with the Promahon-Kulata and Exohi-Ilinden border checkpoints with Bulgaria.
The move prompted authorities to ask the European Commission to take "immediate" action to lift the blockades.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said that unless the situation is resolved by Wednesday, his country will seek compensation for each day the blockades continue.
In other news, a moderate earthquake measuring 5.2 on the Richter scale rattled the central part of the country on Monday.
The epicentre was in western Evpalio, about 160km west of Athens.
No injuries or damage was reported, though the quake cut power in the village of Trikorfo.

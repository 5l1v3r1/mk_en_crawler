BUCHAREST, Romania â A total of 77 custom officials and border policemen were arrested on Thursday (February 3rd) for suspected corruption and cigarettes smuggling, following a six-month investigation.
All of those detained worked on the border with Ukraine.
The operation comes amid Romania's efforts to meet criteria for the Schengen Zone.
Romania and Bulgaria had hoped to join the border-free zone next month, but face a delay amid opposition from Germany and France.

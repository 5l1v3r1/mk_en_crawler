BELGRADE, Serbia -- Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte wrapped up a visit to Belgrade on Wednesday (June 6th) saying Serbia has finally shown true commitment to arresting Bosnian wartime commander Ratko Mladic and other war crimes suspects.
She received assurances from Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica that at least three of the remaining five fugitives could be arrested and extradited to The Hague very soon.
Del Ponte said that Mladic is likely hiding in Belgrade and would be found fairly easily.
She also urged the EU to restart negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Belgrade as soon as possible.
Last year, the European Commission suspended negotiations over Serbia's failure to co-operate fully with the war crimes tribunal.

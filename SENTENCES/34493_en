BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission President Romano Prodi on Thursday (9 October) criticised Croatia's decision to set up a protected environmental and fishing zone along its Adriatic coast. 
"Unilateral decisions always lead to difficulties, so I urge [Croatia] to start an open dialogue with its neighbours," he said after a meeting with Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan. 
Slovenia is vehemently opposed to the zone and has threatened to block Croatia's bid for EU membership.
In Brussels, Racan submitted Croatia's responses to a lengthy European Commission questionnaire, as required before any decision to open accession talks. 
Prodi said Zagreb would have to convince the EU that it is fully co-operating with the UN war crimes tribunal, a message echoed during Racan's meetings with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen.

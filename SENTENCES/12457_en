BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Vladimir Popovic, who headed the communications bureau in late Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's government, says the Serbia-Montenegro Army is protecting top war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic. 
In the latest edition of the Insider TV programme on B92 Tuesday (8 February), Popovic said while he was in the government information circulated about the military's role in guarding Mladic. 
The former adviser also called for a deeper investigation into last year's incident at the Topcider army barracks and the death of two soldiers there. 
Earlier this month, Popovic said the military had been involved in Djindjic's March 2003 murder.

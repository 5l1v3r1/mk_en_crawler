ANKARA, Turkey -- Four bombs went off in front of British and US interests in Turkey late Tuesday (28 September), causing damage but no casualties. 
Three of the targets were branches of the British-based bank HSBC in Istanbul, Izmir, and Adana. 
The same institution was hit by a major attack in Istanbul last November. 
The fourth target was the Turkish-US Association in Ankara.
In other news, Dow Jones announced it is launching a new index in Istanbul geared to the needs of Muslim investors. 
It will track 17 companies with a total value of $4 billion. 
Stocks in Turkish companies that sell items such as alcohol, pork products, and tobacco are excluded from the index.

ATHENS, Greece -- A group calling itself Popular Action claimed responsibility late Tuesday (December 23rd) for shooting at a police van earlier in the day. 
In an anonymous phone call to the news website Zougla.gr, the group said it fired at the van in the Goudi district of Athens, bursting a tyre but causing no injuries.
Meanwhile, student protests against the December 6th killing of 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos by a police officer continued in Athens on Tuesday. 
Around 2,000 university and high school students marched outside parliament, shouting slogans against the police and the government. 
Scattered incidents marred the largely peaceful rally. 
About a dozen youths overturned a police vehicle, with the officers inside escaping unharmed.
Separately, a group of high school students staged a rally outside the education ministry. 
The students are expected to decide in early January whether to continue their protests over Grigoropoulos' death.

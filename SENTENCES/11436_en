BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska Prime Minister-designate Pero Bukejlovic has invited the major Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA) to talks on forming a new entity cabinet.
SDA official Tarik Sadovic said on Tuesday (25 January) that the meeting would take place Thursday.
Sadovic downplayed the outcome, however, as Bukejlovic and other Serb officials have excluded SDA's participation in the new RS government.
European Commission Ambassador to BiH Michael Humphreys hinted he would try to mediate an agreement between Bukejlovic's Serb Democratic Party and the SDA.

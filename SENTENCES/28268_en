SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Jovan Vraniskovski, a controversial former bishop of the Macedonian Orthodox Church, has been detained by Bulgarian border police based on an international arrest warrant, media reported on Wednesday (November 17th).
The warrant was issued earlier this month on orders of a court in Bitola, Macedonia.
Vraniskovski has been sentenced in Macedonia to two and a half years in prison for misusing donations at the diocese he previously headed.

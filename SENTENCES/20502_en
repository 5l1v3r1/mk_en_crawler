NICOSIA, Cyprus -- In a report released on Thursday (January 10th), the International Crisis Group (ICG) called for new joint efforts this year by the UN and the EU aimed at a comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus problem. 
According to the think-tank, all sides, including neighbouring Turkey and Greece, have much to gain from a settlement. 
The ICG warned that further delays in resolving the decades-old problem is no longer a comfortable status quo. 
Visiting UN headquarters in New York late Wednesday, Turkish President Abdullah Gul suggested peace talks resume after the presidential election in the Greek part of the island next month.

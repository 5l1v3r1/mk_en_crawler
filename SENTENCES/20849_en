BUCHAREST, Romania -- An estimated 20,000 swine from a farm in Timis county, western Romania, owned by the US-based company Smithfield, will be slaughtered after swine fever was diagnosed there, authorities announced on Sunday (August 5th).
A quarantine has been imposed there due to the outbreak.
A couple of weeks ago, about 3,500 pigs died at the same farm.
Authorities blamed a bacterial illness exacerbated by the excessive heat.

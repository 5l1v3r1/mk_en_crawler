PRAGUE, Czech Republic -- Western Balkan countries will not be left out of future EU expansion, incoming European Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said on Saturday (November 28th), a day after he was nominated for the post. 
Fuele, who is the Czech Republic's minister for European affairs, indicated the Western Balkans and Turkey will be top spots for official visits while he is enlargement commissioner.
Announcing his team Friday, European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso named several new commissioners from Southeast Europe. 
Greece's Maria Damanaki was tapped for fisheries commissioner, while the agriculture portfolio went to Dacian Ciolos of Romania. 
Bulgaria's foreign minister, Rumyana Zheleva, will take up the newly created position of International Co-operation Commissioner.
Pending approval by the European Parliament, the new EC is expected to start work in late January.

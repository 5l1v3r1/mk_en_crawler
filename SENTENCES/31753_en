SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The international community's High Representative in BiH, Paddy Ashdown, will visit Belgrade on Tuesday (8 April) to participate in the 6th South East Europe Co-operation Process (SEECP) meeting.
According to an Office of the High Representative (OHR) spokesman, Ashdown will use the occasion to discuss the fight against organised crime with Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic and Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic, particularly after the crackdown by the Serbian government after the murder of Zoran Djindjic.
His spokesman says Ashdown will likely offer both BiH and OHR assistance.

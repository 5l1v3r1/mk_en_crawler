NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Prosecutors plan to file criminal charges against five people for a 2005 airplane crash that killed 121 passengers and crew members, Chief Prosecutor Petros Clerides said on Tuesday (November 4th). 
The Cypriot Helios Airways airliner crashed into a mountain near Athens on August 14th 2005 during a flight from Larnaca to Prague, killing everyone on board. 
A parallel inquiry by Greek investigators pointed to possible human error. 
Investigators say the plane flew on autopilot for nearly two hours before it ran out of fuel. 
A loss of cabin pressure earlier in the flight had likely rendered everyone aboard unconscious.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said on Sunday (May 16th) that an agreement has been reached with Spain, the current head of the EU, that Pristina institutions will be represented at next month's EU-Western Balkans summit in Sarajevo in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244.
He told the Tanjug news agency that Serbia has insisted Kosovo cannot represent itself as an independent country and that Belgrade will do what it can to guarantee the success of the Sarajevo conference.
In March, Serbian President Boris Tadic skipped a regional summit in Brdo, Slovenia because Kosovo sent an official.

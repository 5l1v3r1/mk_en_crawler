BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliament on Wednesday (July 8th) approved a new law on regional development that will divide Serbia into seven statistical regions:
Vojvodina, Belgrade, Western, Eastern, Central, Southern, and Kosovo and Metohija.
The regions will then be divided into developed or underdeveloped, in a bid to reduce economic and social disparities.
Also Wednesday, parliament elected new members of the Republic Election Commission (RIK).
Lawmakers appointed Predrag Grgic, a lawyer from Zrenjanina, as chairman.
Previous RIK head Sonja Brkic and 13 other members from the Democratic Party and the Serb Progressive Party stepped down in February, amid press reports about enormous bonuses allocated to RIK members last year.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Franco Frattini, the former EU justice commissioner who is now Italy's foreign minister, doesn't expect the most serious possible sanctions against Bulgaria for corruption.
From Brussels, where he participated in the EU foreign ministers' summit, he said that under Article 7 of the Nice Treaty, Bulgaria could suffer the denial of some EU member rights if there is evidence it breached basic principles.
However, the decision requires a unanimous vote, which is unlikely, according to Frattini.
Last week, Reuters reported the EC will suspend Bulgaria's access to 500m euros in EU funds over corruption issues.

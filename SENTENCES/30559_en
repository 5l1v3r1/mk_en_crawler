GENEVA, Switzerland -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon believes that a new meeting on the name dispute between Skopje and Athens should be initiated after the June 5th parliamentary elections in Macedonia. 
This round of talks would evaluate progress achieved so far. 
Ban voiced this stance during a meeting in Geneva on Tuesday (May 10th) with Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who told Ban that Skopje is willing to find a mutually acceptable solution to the name dispute.

ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Simitis is expected to announce a new model of organisation in his reshuffled cabinet, after the ministers are sworn in on Monday (7 July).
Simitis will reportedly establish a concrete and binding timetable of the tasks and responsibilities for every ministry and will personally monitor the timetable on a daily basis.
The same model would be applied to the ruling PASOK party's preparations for the May parliamentary elections.

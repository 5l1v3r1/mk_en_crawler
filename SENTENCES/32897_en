ANKARA, Turkey -- In a speech to parliament Thursday (29 May), Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan requested full support for six proposed amendments to Turkish law, aimed at harmonising it with that of the EU.
He said failure to integrate would push the country into isolation, in terms of regional security and foreign policy.
The prime minister added that although the accession process would not be easy, it is the right path.
Also Thursday, Turkish Deputy Chief of General Staff Gen Yasar Buyukanit said that the military supports government efforts towards EU integration, despite media reports to the contrary.

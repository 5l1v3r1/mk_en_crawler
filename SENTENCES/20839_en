SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski met on Thursday (March 6th) with visiting EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who said he is sure Macedonia is capable of completing crucial reforms needed to meet the criteria for launching membership negotiations with the Union.
Rehn briefed Gruevski on eight priorities the country must fulfill to get a start date for negotiations.
In Brussels Wednesday, Rehn said that Macedonia must resolve its name dispute with Greece, or Athens will certainly veto Skopje's EU and NATO membership bids.
Earlier, Rehn visited Zagreb, where he again warned that Croatia's controversial environmental protection and fishing zone in the Adriatic could slow its EU membership bid.
Neighbours Slovenia and Italy oppose the zone.
Despite the warning, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader predicted that Croatia would complete accession negotiations sometime next year.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Acting President Jakup Krasniqi said on Monday (October 4th) that there will be no early general elections this year. 
Just last week, the ruling coalition partners -- the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) and the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) -- agreed in principle that early elections must be the response to President Fatmir Sejdiu's unexpected resignation. 
Most party leaders are reluctant to hold snap elections, Krasniqi said on Monday; he says they would prefer to wait until February or March. 
Sejdiu resigned from the presidency in mid-September after the Constitutional Court ruled he violated the constitution by being president of the country and leader of the LDK at the same time.
Meanwhile, parliament's working group on elections gathered to discuss proposed changes to the law on elections. 
Political party members differed over whether to lower the electoral threshold of 5%, as proposed by civil society organisations. 
The group will make final decisions next week.

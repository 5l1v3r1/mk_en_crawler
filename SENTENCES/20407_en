BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica has no secret proposal concerning the partition of Kosovo, Milivoje Mihajlovic, director of the government's office for media relations, said on Tuesday (September 11th) in response to a report by the Kosovo Albanian newspaper Koha Ditore . 
It claims Kostunica has offered the partitioning of Kosovo as a compromise and is briefing European officials informally. 
According to the newspaper, Vojin Lazarevic, a businessman and supporter of Kostunica's election campaign, is quietly visiting EU states to gauge reactions. 
Mihajlovic, however, insists that the Serbian government is neither considering nor would accept the idea of partitioning.
In other news Tuesday, Serbian Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic said Belgrade will urge Serbs in Kosovo to boycott the November 17th elections in the province. 
He said conditions have not been met to warrant participation.

ATHENS, Greece -- The Greek school year started on Friday (15 September) with a first: priests did not hear confessions in classrooms. 
The government has adopted a new rule barring confessions in schools, in recognition of the fact that Greece is becoming a multicultural society. 
The Orthodox Church has strongly protested the ban.

The second contingent of Macedonian soldiers who have been participating in Operation Iraqi Freedom returned to Macedonia earlier this month. 
Families, friends and Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski welcomed the group, which was honoured during a special ceremony on 16 June.
The soldiers described the engagement in Iraq as "a difficult but great and important experience".
"It is the wish of every commander to have such people by their side. 
Their professionalism, sacrifice, serenity and love for homeland were an example for the whole world in the past six months," the unit commander said.
The troops were engaged in complex operations in the Iraqi town of Taji. 
The first contingent left for Iraq last June.
Buckovski said the Army Special Unit showed in practice that it is prepared to perform the most difficult duties side by side with other armies and NATO members. 
"We will not spare money and time to invest in you," the minister told the soldiers at the ceremony. 
"You are the representatives of our country and the new image of the Macedonian Army."
He said the mission has developed a base that will foster the partnership Macedonia is developing with the United States and the democratic world as it moves towards its goal of NATO membership.
"Through this mission and the mission in Afghanistan, Macedonian soldiers for special operations are giving a share in the development of world peace and global combat against terror," Buckovski said.
A third contingent of soldiers arrived in Taji on 9 June.

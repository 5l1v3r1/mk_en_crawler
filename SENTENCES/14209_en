ATHENS, Greece -- Public sector trade unions announced on Monday (12 December) that they plan a two-day nationwide strike beginning Wednesday. 
The unions oppose the new government bill on restructuring public enterprises, particularly texts on collective labour contracts.
In other news, Greek police say they believe a group called the Revolutionary Struggle was responsible for Monday's blast in central Athens. 
It injured four people and damaged buildings and cars near the economy ministry.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia is expected to assume control of the Prevlaka peninsula by 15 December, Prime Minister Ivica Racan said Friday (22 November) on HRT. 
The peninsula, situated on the Croatian-Montenegrin border, was occupied by the Yugoslav Army in 1992. 
Since the end of the Yugoslav-Croatian war in 1993, the region has been under the mandate of the UN Security Council. 
Montenegrin official Branko Lukovac, a former foreign minister of Yugoslavia, says the region will be demilitarised and turned into a major tourist area with the aid of the Croatian and Montenegrin governments.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Ivica Racan, leader of the main opposition Social Democratic Party, said Wednesday (27 April) that his party would seek early elections if EU accession negotiations do not begin this year.
Last month, the EU delayed the launch of negotiations because of Zagreb's failure to arrest war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina.
Racan expressed doubt that Prime Minister Ivo Sanader would convince the newly formed EU assessment task force that Croatia is fully co-operating with The Hague tribunal.
He also criticised Sanader for refusing to discuss recent claims that Transport Minister Bozhidar Kalmeta and ruling party parliamentarian Sime Prtenjac helped Gotovina elude justice.

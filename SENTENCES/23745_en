PRAGUE, Czech Republic -- The EU and Ankara agreed on Tuesday (April 21st) to open two new chapters -- on social policy and employment, and taxation -- within Turkey's accession negotiation process by the end of June.
Sweden assumes the EU presidency post on July 1st.
The decision on the chapters emerged after a meeting in Prague between Turkey and the foreign ministers of the EU Troika, consisting of the past, current and future EU presidency holders.
During the meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan urged the Union not to block Ankara's membership talks with political issues that are irrelevant to the negotiation process.
"All chapters that are technically ready should be opened," he said, adding Turkey has "every reason to move forward".
According to media reports, Cyprus was another topic at the meeting.
Accession talks slowed, in part, because Turkey refuses to open its ports and airports to Cypriot carriers until the economic isolation of Turkish Cypriots is addressed.

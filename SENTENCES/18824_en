PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Parliament voted almost unanimously Thursday (April 5th) in support of the UN-sponsored plan that would grant supervised independence to the province. 
Some 100 lawmakers backed the blueprint drafted by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, one voted against it, and 19 were absent. 
Serbs have been boycotting the legislature since ethnic riots in March 2004. 
The deputies adopted a statement that praised the plan as "a balanced and right solution ... 
in accordance with the will of the people". 
Parliament also welcomed the international community's plan to maintain a civilian and military presence until Kosovo is able to meet all provisions of the Ahtisaari plan.
In Belgrade, Vuk Jeremic, foreign policy adviser to President Boris Tadic, denounced the resolution as "a unilateral act" that was not helpful to the search for a solution.

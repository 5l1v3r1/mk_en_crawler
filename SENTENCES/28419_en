ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Ivo Josipovic on Wednesday (May 12th) welcomed the arrest in Australia of war crimes suspect Dragan Vasiljkovic and insisted that Croatia will give him a fair trial.
According to Josipovic, justice "could be slow" but is achievable.
Vasiljkovic, a former Serb militia commander known as "Captain Dragan", is wanted for the 1991 torture and killing of Croatian civilians and prisoners of war in the rebel Serb stronghold of Knin, and in the southern village of Bruska in 1993.
Vasiljkovic has fought extradition to Croatia insisting he cannot receive a fair trial there.
He had been on the run for more than a month before police arrested him Wednesday.

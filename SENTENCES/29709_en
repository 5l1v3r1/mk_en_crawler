SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Prosecutor's Office filed new charges Wednesday (May 25th) against Veselin Vlahovic, known as the "Monster of Grbavica", for war crimes against Bosniak and Croat civilians committed during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
According to the 14-count indictment, Vlahovic participated in the killing of 14 people, as well as rapes, torture and inhumane treatment of civilians in the Sarajevo neighbourhoods of Grbavica, Kovacici and Vraca.

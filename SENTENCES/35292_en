THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal cancelled two days of hearings on Wednesday (18 February) because Slobodan Milosevic was too ill to go to the courtroom.
This would delay the end of the prosecution phase of the trial at least until next week.
Prosecutors had planned to wrap up the case against the former Yugoslav strongman on 19 February.
Milosevic would then get three months to prepare his defence.

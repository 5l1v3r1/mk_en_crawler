BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Francis O'Donnell, head of the UN office in Belgrade, said Friday (6 February) that political instability is damaging Serbia's international credibility and affecting relations with the UN and the international community in general. 
He observed that one UN agency has already suspended operations in the republic because the government was unable to sign an agreement worth $15m. 
"If this stagnation continues, the whole UN system's plan to provide development assistance for the next five years will be affected," O'Donnell said in a statement. 
He went on to warn the reformist camp not to form an alliance with Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist Party.

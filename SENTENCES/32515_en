ANKARA, Turkey -- On Tuesday (11 March), President Ahmet Necdet Sezer asked Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the leader of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), to form a new cabinet. 
The request followed Erdogan's victory in Sunday's by-elections and the resignation of Prime Minister Abdullah Gul. 
In his first official statement, Erdogan indicated that he would make minor changes to the cabinet; still unclear is whether he will replace the ministers who oppose the deployment of 60,000 US troops on Turkish territory. 
It is also not clear if and when his new government would resubmit a resolution on the deployment.
Turkish Ambassador to Washington Faruk Logoglu announced, meanwhile, that informal talks are underway on the possible use of Turkish airspace in an operation against Saddam Hussein's regime.

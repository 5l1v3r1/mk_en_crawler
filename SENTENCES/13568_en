VIENNA, Austria -- UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte says the end of February is the deadline for the arrest and extradition of top war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic. 
In an interview with the Austrian publication Der Standart on Friday (17 February), she said that if Mladic is not in The Hague by the end of this month, the EU should halt Stabilisation and Association Agreement negotiations with Serbia-Montenegro. 
EU foreign ministers are scheduled to meet later this month.
On Saturday, the defence ministry announced that Serbia-Montenegro military intelligence services have been conducting surprise checks at military facilities recently, searching for indictees including Mladic. 
The Hague tribunal reportedly recently gave the Serbian government information about five locations where Mladic could be hiding. 
Defence Minister Zoran Stankovic -- a former associate of Mladic's -- issued another public appeal Friday urging him to surrender for the good of the country.

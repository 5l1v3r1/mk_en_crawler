SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A former US ambassador, Clifford Bond, has been appointed to represent the international community in Srebrenica, the site of Europe's worst post-war atrocity.
Christian Schwarz-Schilling, the international high representative to BiH, announced on Thursday [3 May] that Bond would oversee efforts to facilitate the return of Muslim refugees and monitor the situation in the ethnically divided area.
Tensions there have been running high in recent weeks, following an International Court of Justice ruling that confirmed genocide was committed there in 1995.
Muslims who had returned to their homes in the last few years say they will leave unless Srebrenica receives special status, outside the jurisdiction of Republika Srpska.

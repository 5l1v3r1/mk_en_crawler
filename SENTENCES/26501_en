THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen told the Dutch parliament on Wednesday (November 11th) that Serbia has made serious progress in co-operating with The Hague war crimes tribunal, though it is not entirely complete. 
Nevertheless, Verhagen told lawmakers he no longer rules out Serbia's closer integration to the EU, implying his country might agree to unblock Serbia's free-trade agreement, as part of its pre-membership agreement with the EU at the bloc's December summit. 
The final decision, he said, will be based on war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz's report to the UN Security Council on December 3rd. 
Serbia's full co-operation with the court is a precondition for its EU integration process.

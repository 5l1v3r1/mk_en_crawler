BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini warned Bulgaria and Romania that safeguards could be introduced if progress in judicial reforms is not reported.
Frattini told Romania's state TV channel on Wednesday (May 30th) that reforms must accelerate and progress be shown in the fight against corruption.
He also rejected criticism by some EU members, who say he has been too lenient towards the two newest members.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn sounded a similar note in an interview Wednesday with Le Figaro, saying triggering the safeguard clauses would demonstrate credibility regarding the EU enlargement process.

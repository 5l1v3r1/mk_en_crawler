SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prime Minister Nikola Spiric announced on Tuesday (May 15th) that he has sent a letter to all cabinet ministers, urging them to speed up work on laws related to the EU reform agenda. 
He also insisted laws enacted by the Office of High Representative on a provisional basis be passed via regular legislative procedures and that he be kept apprised on a monthly basis of progress made regarding EU-related reforms. 
Last week, BiH authorities received a letter from EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, expressing disappointment with stalled reforms. 
He warned that the country would miss its chance to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU this year.
In other news Tuesday, the members of BiH's tripartite presidency left for Iraq. 
They are inspecting Bosnian troops deployed with the international mission there.

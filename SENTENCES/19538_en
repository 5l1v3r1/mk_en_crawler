SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The EU on Monday (October 29th) welcomed a declaration pledging to unblock stalled police reform, signed by leaders of the six main parties in BiH's parliament on Sunday.
In a statement, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokeswoman Krisztina Nagy praised what she described as "the spirit of consensus and compromise".
She stressed that maintaining this constructive approach would be key to other reforms related to EU integration.
In a separate statement Monday, the Office of the High Representative praised the fact that party leaders initiated and prepared the declaration, after months of deadlock.
The entire process has dragged on for more than two years.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Swiss Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Ray visited Belgrade on Friday (17 June) and said the time has come to begin discussions about Kosovo's status. 
She met with Serbia-Montenegrin counterpart Vuk Draskovic, Serbian President Boris Tadic and Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica. 
Calmy-Ray said the time has come for negotiations on the province's status, while "honouring standards and minority rights". 
She also emphasised that Switzerland did not back an unconditional independence scenario for Kosovo.
In other news, a minor traffic accident Sunday on the bridge linking the ethnic Albanian and Serb quarters of Mitrovica triggered a fight between members of the two communities. 
A car carrying four ethnic Albanians hit accidentally a van driven by a Serb. 
Members of the two communities nearby started throwing stones at each other and at vehicles on the bridge. 
Police quickly separated the two groups but not before several vehicles were damaged. 
There were two arrests.

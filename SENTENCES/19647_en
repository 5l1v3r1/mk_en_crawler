SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government failed to strike a deal with teachers' unions last week, which means a teacher walk-out is expected to take place Monday (September 24th). 
The educators are demanding their salaries be doubled by October and raised again next year. 
They also want more spending on education. 
The government has offered a 21% increase in teachers' wages.

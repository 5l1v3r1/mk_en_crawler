PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Parliament passed a law Thursday (June 21st) on travel documents, which aims to provide the public with highly secure passports, similar to those in Western European countries. 
Interior Minister Blerim Kuci says the law includes stiff fines for forgery or misuse.
Also Thursday, the leader of the Confederation of Free Syndicates in Kosovo, Bahri Shabani, announced the planned sealing of a Social Pact among trade unions, employers and the Ministry of Work. 
Shabani said the accord would be aimed at regulating the rights and duties of workers through a collective labour contract and would serve as the basis for future legislative initiatives.

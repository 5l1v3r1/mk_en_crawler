SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Dimitris Kourkulas, head of the European Commission delegation to BiH, warned on Tuesday (September 25th) that by delaying the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, BiH is, in effect, imposing sanctions on itself.
Kourkulas met with Republika Srpska (RS) President Milan Jelic to discuss the progress of police reform talks, urging the adoption of an agreement before the end of the month.
Jelic said he hoped there would be agreement within the next week.
Later in the day, however, representatives of Serb parties reportedly reaffirmed RS's position on all key issues.
Talks have dragged on for two years now.
In other news, a delegation representing the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) visited Sarajevo on Tuesday and said BiH has made only minimal progress in implementing post-accession obligations towards the Council of Europe.
PACE's monitoring team met with High Representative Miroslav Lajcak and agreed that BiH must focus on finalising the police-reform process to advance its EU integration bid.
Also Tuesday, Lajcak met with Almir Dzuvo, director general of the BiH Intelligence-Security Agency.
Lajcak demanded more effective crime fighting strategies, saying "Corruption, organised crime and war criminals continue to undermine the fabric of society." (Dnevni Avaz, Nezavisne Novine - 26/09/07;

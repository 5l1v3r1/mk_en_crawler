ATHENS, Greece -- The left-wing guerrilla group Conspiracy Nuclei of Fire has claimed responsibility for a series of parcel bombs earlier this month that injured one person and caused widespread concern, police announced on Tuesday (November 23rd).
Two members of the group said in a letter to the news network Indymedia that they sent parcel bombs to French President Nicolas Sarkozy, the Hague-based International Court of Justice, and the embassies of Belgium and Mexico in Athens.
More than ten parcels containing bombs hidden in books or folders were sent from Greece to European leaders and various embassies in Athens on November 4th and 5th.

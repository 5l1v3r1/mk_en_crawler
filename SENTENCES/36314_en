SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Yunal Lyutfi, deputy leader of the junior government partner, the Movement for Rights and Freedom (MRF), said Wednesday (26 May) that co-operation with the ruling National Movement Simeon II has been fruitful and could potentially last through 2010. 
Nonetheless, MRF has made clear its intentions of running alone in the next elections; coalition scenarios would be considered only afterwards.
Also Wednesday, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy met with his Turkish counterpart, Abdullah Gul, in Ankara. 
Among the topics slated for discussion were relaxing visa regimes, especially for business use, and beefing up co-operation in the cultural and educational spheres.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Leaders of the six ruling political parties met on Saturday (August 23rd) to discuss a series of key issues, including constitutional reforms, EU integration, state property and the status of the Brcko district.
Also attending was High Representative Miroslav Lajcak, who later commented at a joint press conference "Today's meeting was rather a discussion than an agreement." The only topic on which participants achieved a significant level of agreement was implementing BiH's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
They agreed to do everything necessary within the set time limits to fulfil commitments envisioned in the document.

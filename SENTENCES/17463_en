SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Kosovo authorities and UNMIK are cautious about the possible participation of Macedonian citizens in any future protests planned by the pro-independence ethnic Albanian movement Vetevendosje in Pristina.
Kosovo police chief Sheremet Ahmeti told Skopje's A1 TV on Sunday (February 25th) that police plan to tighten border checks for all buses from Macedonia around March 3rd, when another rally in support of Kosovo's independence is planned.
Ahmeti stressed that authorities are determined to prevent a repetition of the violence that marred Vetevendosje's February 10th demonstration in Pristina, which ended in two deaths.

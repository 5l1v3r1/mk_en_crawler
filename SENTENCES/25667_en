BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police searched the Belgrade home of war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic on Tuesday (February 23rd). 
War Crimes Prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic and Interior Minister Ivica Dacic described it as part of the regular activities of the Action Team in charge of arresting the remaining war crimes fugitives. 
Unofficial reports suggest police found a large amount of money in the house. 
Mladic's son, Darko, refused to comment on the operation. 
The last time the former Bosnian Serb military leader's house was raided was in December 2008.

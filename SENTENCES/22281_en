BELGRADE, Serbia -- Between June 2002 and December 2005, war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic hid in three military facilities and many apartments in Belgrade, says the head of Serbia's national council for ties with the UN war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic. 
In an interview Monday (August 11th) with the Germany weekly Der Spiegel, he said, "Unfortunately, we found this out much later." Acknowledging he does not believe that the former Bosnian Serb military commander will ever surrender, he called on Mladic to give up for the good of his country.

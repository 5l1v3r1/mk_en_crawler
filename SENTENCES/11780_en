SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament passed key amendments Saturday (18 December) to the law on political parties, aimed at overhauling the domestic party system ahead of parliamentary elections next year.
Among other things, the amended law introduces stricter registration requirements for political formations which are not represented in the current legislature.
Membership in more than one party is banned under the amendments, which also impose severe limits on economic activity.
The major opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party has objected to several provisions and intends to make its case to the Constitutional Court.
In other news, Bulgaria's right-wing opposition launched a parliamentary initiative to sack Chief Prosecutor Nikola Filchev, saying he used insulting language in conversations with opposition lawmakers.
Filchev has been linked to a series of recent scandals.

TIRANA, Albania -- EU personnel met with Prime Minister Sali Berisha and Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama on Wednesday (May 26th) in Tirana, in a bid to mediate a solution to the months-long political stalemate.
At issue are differences over the transparency of the June 2009 general elections, which the SP insists were manipulated.
Leading the lengthy closed-door talks Wednesday was EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele's chief of cabinet, Jana Sindelkova.
No details were released.
The two-day visit follows a meeting last week in Strasbourg, attended by both Berisha and Rama.
The EU is concerned about the stalemate's effect on reforms crucial to Albania's integration process.

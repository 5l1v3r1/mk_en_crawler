NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu agreed on Tuesday (August 31st) to hold fresh intensive talks aimed at reuniting the divided island. 
The two leaders will have a regular meeting on Friday, followed by two rounds of intensive talks on September 7th and 10th. 
The focus again is on the property issue, said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's special adviser on Cyprus, Alexander Downer, who added that Christofias and Eroglu must "take time and get it right". 
The remarks came after Eroglu noted recently that the negotiations' deadline -- at the end of this year -- is approaching. 
Friday marks the second anniversary of the start of these UN-mediated talks.

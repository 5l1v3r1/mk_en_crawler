ANKARA, Turkey -- The EU risks being "overtaken by a racist mentality" against Turks, Turkey's chief EU negotiator Egemen Bagis said on Wednesday (February 2nd) in an e-mailed statement of remarks in Poland. 
He was there on Tuesday to attend a commemoration for Holocaust victims at the former Nazi concentration camp in Auschwitz.
Bagis reiterated his country's commitment to EU integration, and said Ankara's accession to the bloc would be "a historic milestone for world peace".

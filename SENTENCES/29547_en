TIRANA, Albania -- The European Commission (EC) on Wednesday (March 31st) criticised Albania for insufficient aviation control.
The EC urged Tirana to meet criteria that would boost safety, warning that unless it does so, it risks placement on the EC's so-called "black list".
The European Aviation Safety Agency has told the EC in the past that Albania does not meet international security criteria.
The EC says it is intervening now amid the increasing number of flights from Albania to EU countries.

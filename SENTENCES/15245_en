ANKARA, Turkey -- Police arrested an armed man who tried to enter Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's office on Monday (29 May) in Ankara.
The man, who carried an unlicensed handgun, told police he had come to seek help with problems involving terrorists from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party.
Police tightened security measures after a senior judge was killed and four others were wounded in a 17 May shooting spree at Turkey's highest administrative court.

NEW YORK, United States -- Houston-based Bulgarian oil trader Ludmil Dionissiev pleaded guilty on Friday (August 17th) in New York to smuggling Iraqi oil to US companies in violation of the UN oil-for-food programme. 
Dionissiev was charged with bringing Iraqi oil into the United States in January 2001 on behalf of two companies owned by the other defendant, David Chalmers of Texas.
Later Friday, Chalmers also pleaded guilty to paying a secret surcharge, in violation of UN sanctions and US law, to front companies and bank accounts of the Iraqi government at the time. 
The guilty pleas are expected to result in more lenient sentences than if the defendants had stood trial and been convicted.

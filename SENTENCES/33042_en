ANKARA, Turkey -- Once Turkey meets EU political membership criteria, the Union should set an earlier date for launching accession negotiations, according to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 
He made the comment after meeting in Ankara on Wednesday (21 May) with European Parliament Liberal and Democratic Group Secretary General Alexander Beels, as well as with the group's chairman, Graham Weston.
In related developments, the cabinet meets Thursday to discuss a reform package aimed at harmonising Turkish legislation with that of the EU. 
The legislative measures would then be discussed by parliament on Friday.

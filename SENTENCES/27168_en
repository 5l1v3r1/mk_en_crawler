ATHENS, Greece -- The honorary chairman of the main opposition New Democracy party, former Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, said Friday (January 1st) that an emergency government of national unity should be set up in Greece, as the country is experiencing a serious economic and financial crisis. 
According to him, the current PASOK-led government should take bolder measures to deal with the grave situation.
"[European Central Bank Vice President] Lucas Papademos should be asked to take over the central management of the economy, and [former PASOK parliamentary member and health and welfare minister] Alekos Papadopoulos should take over public finances," Mitsotakis said. 
"These two along with Finance Minister Giorgos Papaconstantinou should form a mini-cabinet which [former Prime Minister] Costas Simitis should be asked to chair as a minister without portfolio," he added.

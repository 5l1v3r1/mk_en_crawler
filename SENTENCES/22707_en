SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The three main political parties, the Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA), Republika Srpska's Union of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) and the Croat Democratic Union of BiH (HDZ BiH), signed a landmark deal Saturday (November 8th) stating the country's determination to pursue EU-related reforms. 
The surprise agreement emerged just days after the EU voiced concern that rising nationalist rhetoric among local political leaders was affecting EU-related progress. 
Signing it were the leaders of the three parties, the SDA's Sulejman Tihic, the HDZ BiH's Dragan Covic and the SNSD's Milorad Dodik, in the northern town of Odzak. 
The document spells out their commitment to reforming the constitution, settling the state property issue and holding a census in 2011, all key preconditions set by the EU.
Dodik described the agreement as a good basis for further discussions. 
"On some issues that we agreed on today there is consensus... 
while there are others that remain open and discussions have been launched to settle them." (Dnevni Avaz, RTRS, SRNA, Nezavisne Novine - 08/11/08)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Danish diplomat Peter Sorensen has been appointed as the head of the EU delegation to Sarajevo, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton announced on Monday (May 30th).
The decision comes in the wake of an EU foreign ministers' decision in March to strengthen the EU's presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
The move also follows Ashton's recent visit to Banja Luka where she talked leaders out of holding a referendum on the Bosnian judiciary.
Sorensen's appointment comes at a crucial time for the Western Balkans region and BiH in particular, Ashton said in her statement.
Sorensen currently heads the EU delegation in Skopje.

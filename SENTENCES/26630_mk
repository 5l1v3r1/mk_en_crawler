MADRID, Spain -- Foreign Minister Miguel Moratinos said on Friday (January 8th) that Spain will continue talks on the EU accession of Balkan countries. 
Moratinos, who will preside over the European Foreign Policy Council over the next six months, told journalists that talks with Croatia will continue. 
Four more chapters in Turkey's EU accession talks will open, while discussions with Montenegro, Albania, Serbia and Macedonia should continue as well. 
He urged Skopje to resolve its long-standing name dispute with Athens and for Cyprus to be reunified. 
Regarding Kosovo, whose independence Spain does not recognise, Moratinos said he hopes for "constructive developments".

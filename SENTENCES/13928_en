SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski announced on Wednesday (17 August) that he has rejected the resignation of Justice Minister Meri Mladenovska-Gjorgievska, who offered to step down following an escape at the Idrizovo prison. 
Last week, an inmate armed with a gun killed a fellow prisoner and managed to get away. 
Buckovski says Mladenovska-Gjorgievska had no personal responsibility in the case, despite claims to the contrary from the opposition.
Also Wednesday, police detained two men suspected in connection with a blast in front of the Bit Pazar police station in Skopje last month. 
The main suspect in the case, a 22-year-old Kosovo Albanian named Ramadan Siti, remains at large after escaping from a Macedonian prison three months ago.

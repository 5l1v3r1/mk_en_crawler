ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government has decided to initiate arbitration in an attempt to resolve its maritime border dispute with Slovenia, according to Olga Kresovic-Rogulja, who chairs the Croatian Commission for Border Issues. 
Zagreb and Ljubljana have been at odds for several weeks, following Croatia's unilateral decision to establish a fishery and environmental protection zone in the Adriatic. 
Following Thursday's (13 November) announcement from Zagreb, the Slovenian Foreign Ministry indicated it would not object, but said arbitration is a long-term process. 
More immediately, Slovenia wants Croatia to ratify and enforce a bilateral agreement on borders signed by the respective prime ministers in 2001.

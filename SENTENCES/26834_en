PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Two journalists from the Podgorica-based Vijesti daily claimed on Thursday (August 6th) that they were attacked by Mayor Miomir Mugosa and his son Miljan while working on a story about the mayor's alleged abuse of power. 
The incident happened shortly before midnight Wednesday outside a bar owned by Mugosa's son. 
In the quarrel, Miljan Mugosa allegedly attacked Vijesti deputy editor-in-chief Mihailo Jovovic who suffered an ear injury that required surgery. 
Jovovic and photographer Boris Pejovic have pressed charges against the mayor's son. 
The mayor says he and his son acted in self-defence after being attacked. 
He also says that he had been under surveillance for several days.

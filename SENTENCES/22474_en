BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Serbian daily Danas reported on Wednesday (September 10th) that security services in Serbia and Republika Srpska are working to identify members of a group allegedly threatening to kill Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic. 
His office recently received about 40 letters containing threats, according to security sources.
Authorities are also investigating certain texts published in the press, which may contain encrypted messages to Hague fugitives, especially Ratko Mladic. 
The messages allegedly give information about the progress of investigations, how close the security services are to Mladic and when to change locations. 
Danas's sources say classified ads and stories published in some newspapers are the main means of communication between Mladic and his network.

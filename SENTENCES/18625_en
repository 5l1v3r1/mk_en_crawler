ZAGREB, Croatia -- Despite opposition abroad, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said on Thursday (December 7th) that the cabinet plans to go ahead with implementing an amended Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone (ZERP). 
He said Croatia has no bilateral agreements with Italy or Slovenia that would prevent it from doing so. 
The European Commission (EC) reacted strongly, saying Croatia should refrain from activating the zone without consulting the two other countries, both of which are EU members.

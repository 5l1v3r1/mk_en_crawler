BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic said Friday (11 July) that Kosovo leader Hashim Thaci would not be arrested if he travels to Belgrade as part of an official delegation invited by the government. 
A Serbian court sentenced Thaci to ten years in prison for involvement in a 1993 attack against a police patrol in central Kosovo that left three officers dead. 
Mihajlovic made his comments after Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic said talks between Belgrade and Pristina are expected in September.
In other news, Bulgarian police arrested a suspected member of the Zemun Clan at a seaside resort near the city of Varna on Friday. 
The state news agency BTA identified him as Nenad Milenkovic, one of the most wanted criminals in Belgrade. 
He is suspected of being responsible for about 20 murders, including the March assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.

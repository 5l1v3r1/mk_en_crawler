BELGRADE, Serbia -- The bag and laptop found in Belgrade at the beginning of the week belong to former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, police sources told the Serbian newspaper Press on Wednesday (August 13th), citing results of DNA analysis. 
Police will hand over all items found in the bag to Karadzic's lawyers on Thursday, the source added, noting that the contents suggest Karadzic knew agents were closing in on him. 
"Today we can say for sure that he was aware of preparations for his apprehension. 
It seems that he knew that special agents were following him and had tried to run away quickly," the source said. 
On Wednesday, Karadzic's lawyer, Svetozar Vujacic, said that the discovery of Karadzic's belongings was staged.

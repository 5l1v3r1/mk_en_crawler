SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed Monday (2 June) that the US administration sent a list of persons seen as responsible for obstructing the stabilisation process in the country.
The ministry will forward the list to line authorities responsible for launching investigations.
"The list is only a warning and the relevant institutions must assume a clear stance and check the reasons for banning the work of these individuals," said Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen announced on Friday (22 April) that he changed the regulations of the Kosovo Trust Agency -- which handles privatisation in the province -- in order to avoid bureaucratic obstacles and speed up sales. 
The adjustment would mean that the agency will be no longer be obliged to determine the ownership status of so-called socially owned enterprises before a privatisation deal, but could clarify the issue after assets are sold.

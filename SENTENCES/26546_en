BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Central Electoral Bureau on Wednesday (December 9th) announced the final results of Sunday's presidential run-off.
Incumbent Traian Basescu of the Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) won re-election with 50.33% of the vote, just ahead of rival Mircea Geoana who garnered 49.66%.
Turnout was 58%.
Geoana, leader of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), has contested the returns and is awaiting a ruling by the Constitutional Court.
Basescu on Wednesday urged reconciliation and the quick formation of a new government, given pressing economic issues.
His PDL has formally invited the National Liberal Party (PNL) to start consultations on forming a new government, though the PNL recently helped take down the PDL's previous government in a no-confidence vote.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The United Regions of Serbia (URS) will submit a petition Monday (May 30th) for the decentralisation of Serbia, as well as a proposal for amendments to five laws related to the initiative.
The petition was backed by 515,792 people.
URS leader Mladjan Dinkic says centralisation is among the main problems affecting Serbia's development.
The URS proposes that 80% of payroll taxes be given to local authorities, who collect them;
that citizens be allowed to directly elect the municipality president and mayor;
and that confiscated property should be returned to local self-governments.

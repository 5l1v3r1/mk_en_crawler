SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The commission working to declassify the archives of the communist security services announced on Tuesday (September 4th) that 19 current members of parliament collaborated with the former secret police.
Seven of them were affiliated with the nationalist Attack party.
The ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party follows with six, the Movement for Rights and Freedom (MRF) has four, and the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (VMRO) has two.
The commission said 139 lawmakers -- past and present -- collaborated with the former State Security Service.
Many of these, including President Georgi Parvanov, MRF leader Ahmed Dogan, and VMRO leader Krasimir Karakachanov, were already known to have done so.
However, a few of the names on the list -- such as former Prime Minister Zhan Videnov, popular actor Todor Kolev and renowned violinist Dimo Dimov â were surprises.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Meeting on Monday (13 December), the EU foreign ministers' council agreed that Bulgaria and Romania should be ready to seal their accession treaties in late April or May.
The European Council's summit later this week is expected to result in a final position on the two countries' goal of joining the EU in 2007, as well as a decision on setting a date for the start of accession talks with Turkey.
Meanwhile, during a meeting with his EU counterparts Monday, Greek Foreign Minister Petros Molyviatis again linked Turkey's accession bid to progress on the Cyprus dispute.
A handful of other EU countries reportedly agree.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- State prosecutors charged seven former army and police officers Wednesday (April 21st) with crimes against humanity, committed against Muslim civilians during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.
The suspects allegedly acted in an inhuman way against Muslims in the northwestern region of Bukovica -- near the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina -- in 1992 and 1993.
The area includes 37 villages populated mainly by Muslims.

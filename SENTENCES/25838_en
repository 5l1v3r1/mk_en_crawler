BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic opened on Wednesday (February 17th) an international conference on emergency situations, saying there is a need to establish joint regional teams to react to natural disasters.
He also called for increased regional co-operation aimed at preventing crises and emergency situations.
Russian Minister of Emergency Situations Sergey Shoigu told the conference that opening a regional centre for emergency situations in the Serbian town of Nis will co-ordinate efforts against fires, floods and other emergencies.
Shoigu dismissed speculation that Russia wants to set up a military base there.
Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic reiterated that the Nis centre is intended for humanitarian, not military activities.

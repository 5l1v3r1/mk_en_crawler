NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council is expected to hold a crucial session Monday (24 October) on the situation in Kosovo, following UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's recommendation that talks should be launched on Kosovo's final status.
Annan acted on the basis of a report by his special envoy, Kai Eide, who assessed the implementation of democratic standards in the province.
Leaders in Serbia and Kosovo, meanwhile, continue to take divergent stances on the province's future.
Before leaving for New York on Sunday, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said Kosovo should be granted a high level of autonomy within Serbia.
But his Kosovo counterpart, Bajram Kosumi, told Reuters that the province should be granted full independence.(Independent - 24/10/05;

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Opposition parties asked President Fatmir Sejdiu on Wednesday (April 1st) to schedule local elections in October. 
The leader of the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo, Ramush Haradinaj, and Reformist Party leader Teuta Sahatcia say the elections should be held before cold weather sets in. 
"It would be good if we are not late with the elections. 
It would be better if they are held as soon as possible," said Haradinaj after meeting with OSCE Head of Mission Werner Almhofer. 
The autumn of 2009 has been mentioned as a possible election period. 
Opposition parties also want the OSCE to help organise and monitor voting, despite its status neutral position on Kosovo, media reported on Thursday.

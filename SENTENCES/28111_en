PARIS, France -- The first chartered flight organised as part of France's campaign to expel around 700 illegal Roma immigrants with criminal pasts is arriving in Bucharest on Thursday (August 19th) with 79 Roma aboard.
European Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said on Wednesday that officials are following the situation "with great attention", noting that each member state has the right to take security measures regarding foreigners.
In an interview with the Romanian section of radio RFI, Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Baconchi expressed concerns about mounting xenophobia in France over the expulsions.
"I am concerned about the risks of populist provocation and of creating xenophobic reactions at a time of economic crisis," he said.

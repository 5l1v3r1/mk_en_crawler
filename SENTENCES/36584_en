SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament on Tuesday (3 August) backed the government's proposal to postpone local elections by one month.
They will now be held on 21 November.
The government proposed the delay to allow lawmakers time to complete their debate on the power decentralisation package, which includes redrawing some municipal boundaries in a bid to reduce the number of municipalities.
With the delay, the elections would reflect those changes.
In other news, Swedish diplomat Michael Sahlin assumed the post of EU representative in Skopje on Tuesday.
He replaces Soren Jessen-Petersen, who is the new head of UNMIK.

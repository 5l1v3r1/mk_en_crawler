BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Bosnian Serb government issued a formal apology Wednesday (10 November) for the deaths of nearly 8,000 Muslims in the Srebrenica enclave in the summer of 1995. 
"The government of Republika Srpska (RS) sympathises with the pain of relatives of the Srebrenica victims and expresses sincere regrets and apologies over the tragedy which has happened to them," the ministers said in a statement. 
The government also pledged to take "decisive steps to bring to justice all those who committed war crimes". 
The statement came after the RS authorities accepted the findings of a government report on the atrocity.
In other news, SFOR personnel searched the home of Bosnian Serb Radenko Bucevac in Mokro on Wednesday. 
Officials said the search was part of an operation aimed at smashing the network of support for war crimes indictees.

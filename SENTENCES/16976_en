ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic urged the two major political powers -- the ruling Croatian Democratic Union and the opposition Social Democratic Party -- to reach consensus for the sake of EU accession.
He said EU membership is the ultimate goal and requires unity among all parties.
Media reports suggest escalating remarks between the two parties could signal early elections.
In other news, Croatia's national co-ordinator for NATO, Pjer Simunovic, announced in Brussels on Monday (3 April) that a new long-term strategy for development of the country's armed forces would be submitted to parliament in June.
This would represent what he describes as an essential element of Croatia's integration in the Alliance.
Also Monday, a new bill on data protection currently under discussion by parliament is being criticised by domestic NGOs and journalists, who claim the measure would jeopardise democracy.
Some provisions stipulate that any information which might represent a threat to public authorities can be labeled classified information.

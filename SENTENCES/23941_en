TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha on Monday (January 19th) urged the opposition to contribute to achieving a free and transparent election process.
He asked it "to help build a highly credible election commission and control the preparation for the election process" during a meeting with lawmakers from his ruling Democratic Party.
President Bamir Topi also weighed in on Monday, asking all parties to guarantee peaceful elections in June.
"They can put an end to the country's transition, which has been marred by election controversy," he said.

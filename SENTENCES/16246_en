SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament on Friday (October 13th) removed Aleksandar Prcevski from the public prosecutor's post, following a request from the government. 
The ruling VMRO-DPMNE had demanded his replacement, citing inefficiency and unprofessional behaviour. 
Deputies representing the ruling parties passed the motion unanimously, while those from opposition parties boycotted the vote. 
They say Prcevski had no opportunity to defend himself.

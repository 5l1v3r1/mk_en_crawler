ZAGREB, Croatia -- The United Kingdom will likely ratify the EU Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Croatia by the end of July, HINA reported Wednesday (14 July), quoting a source at the British Embassy.
London has repeatedly delayed ratification, citing concerns over Croatia's level of co-operation with the war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
In other news, Croatia's Centre for Peace, Legal Advice and Psychosocial Help and the UK's Minority Rights Group International presented a report Wednesday.
It is described as a comprehensive historical review of the status of minorities in Croatia.

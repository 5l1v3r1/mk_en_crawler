BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU will re-introduce visas for Western Balkan countries if the number of rejected asylum applications increases by 50% in the next six months, the European Commission (EC) said in a press release Thursday (May 26th).
The statement came after EC officials met on Tuesday.
If visas are reinstated, the measure will last for six months at first.
If there is no improvement during this period, visas will be required for an additional nine months.
The proposal, developed by the EC, is expected to be adopted at the EU Council of Ministers meeting in June.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu announced on Friday (27 June) that his government has drafted legislation that would encourage Kurdish rebels to lay down their arms and rejoin society.
Under the terms of the draft, those who have not participated in armed attacks would not be punished.
Those who were involved in armed clashes would serve reduced sentences if they co-operate with authorities.
But the amnesty would not be extended to top Kurdish leaders.
The Kurdish Democratic People's Party said it was dissatisfied with the new draft, insisting it merely elaborated on earlier legislation.
The party urged authorities to turn a new page in dealing with the Kurdish issue and offered to mediate between Ankara and the rebels.
Parliament is to discuss the draft this week.

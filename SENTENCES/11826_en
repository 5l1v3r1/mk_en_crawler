SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Finance Minister Milen Velchev said Wednesday (16 February) that Bulgaria may further reduce corporate taxes and the VAT to attract foreign investment.
He said the corporate tax on profits, slashed to 15 per cent from 19.5 per cent on 1 January, could drop to between 10 per cent and 15 per cent.
He added that the VAT could be reduced to 18 per cent from the current 20 per cent.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Voters went to the polls Sunday (November 30th) to elect a new parliament. 
Polls suggest that the left-wing Social Democratic Party and the right-wing Liberal Democratic Party are the front-runners. 
Each is expected to grab between 32% and 35% of the vote. 
The ruling right-wing National Liberal Party, headed by Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, was trailing in polls with about 20% of the vote. 
This marks the first time people are voting directly for specific candidates rather than for a political party, and it is also the first time they are electing parliament members only. 
Previous elections were held simultaneously with the presidential vote.

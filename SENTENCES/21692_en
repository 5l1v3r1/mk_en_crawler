BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Croatia took another step in its EU accession talks Monday (April 21st) by opening two more of the 35 chapters -- taking the total to 18 open chapters. 
A few more chapters are expected to open in June, shortly before Slovenia's term as holder of the rotating EU presidency ends. 
France assumes that role on July 1st and has committed to supporting Zagreb's EU entry.
Also on Monday, new invitee Croatia completed the first round of its NATO accession talks. 
"We discussed political and military issues. 
We expressed our readiness to take part in collective defence and to contribute to peace, stability and security in the Euro-Atlantic community," the head of the Croatian negotiating team, Bianca Matkovic, said after the meeting in Brussels. 
On May 7th, the country is expected to launch the second stage of talks, focusing on financial and judicial issues.

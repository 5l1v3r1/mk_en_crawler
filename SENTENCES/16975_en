BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu called on Monday (3 April) for more transparency in the activities of the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI), during a presentation of the SRI's annual report for 2005.
Basescu said the lack of transparency was creating a risky parallel between SRI and the communist-era Securitate.

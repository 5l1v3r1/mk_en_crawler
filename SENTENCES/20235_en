BUCHAREST, Romania -- The commission working to declassify Securitate files announced on Thursday (September 13th) that Orthodox bishop Andrei Andrecut was an informant for the feared secret police during Nicolae Causescu's regime. 
Andrecut, bishop for Alba in northwest Romania, was recruited in the 1980s with orders to penetrate the community of Eastern Rite Catholics. 
He denies harming anyone with his work for the secret service.
In other news Thursday, the National Anti-corruption Division asked President Traian Basescu for permission to press criminal charges against former Transport Minister Miron Mitrea, a member of Adrian Nastase's 2000-2004 cabinet. 
Allegations against Mitrea include bribe-taking and falsification of official documents. 
The probe against Mitrea is directly connected to an ongoing case against Nastase over ownership of an expensive building in downtown Bucharest.

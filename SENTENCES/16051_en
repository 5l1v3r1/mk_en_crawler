SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Presidency Chairman Sulejman Tihic said in a newspaper interview over the weekend that UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte suspects BiH authorities know the whereabouts of fugitive Radovan Karadzic. 
Tihic spoke to the Sarajevo daily Dnevni avaz after returning from a three-day visit to the Netherlands, where he met with del Ponte. 
He said she does not believe assurances that Karadzic is not on BiH territory and that BiH and Republika Srpska officials are unaware of his approximate location.
In the same interview, Tihic said that Dutch officials had vowed to support the returns process in Srebrenica with 5m euros worth of new aid. 
He added that he would insist the money is allocated for sustainable return projects and new jobs.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Nikolay Dzhonev, the Bulgarian detained in the United States last month, returned to Bulgaria on Sunday (13 October). 
The 21-year-old law student was arrested on 29 September at Atlantic City International Airport after authorities found a pair of scissors and two boxcutters hidden in his backpack. 
Such items were banned after last year's 11 September attacks. 
Dzhonev pleaded guilty to knowingly and willfully violating airport rules. 
Late last week, he was sentenced to two days in jail and five years probation. 
Deputy Foreign Minister Petko Draganov said the thousands of letters and petitions sent to US authorities on Dzhonev's behalf had helped him.

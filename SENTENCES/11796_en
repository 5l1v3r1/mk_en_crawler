SKOPJE, Macedonia -- New Mayor Trifun Kostovski pledged on Sunday (17 April) to make infrastructure and security improvements his top priorities, as well as stepping up efforts against corruption and street crime. 
In an interview with RFE, Kostovski, who won the recent mayoral race as an independent candidate backed by the opposition, said that his team would include those with experience and education, while party and ethnic background would be less important.

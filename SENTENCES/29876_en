SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Stefano Sannino, deputy director-general of the EU's Directorate General for Enlargement, has called on BiH to implement necessary reforms stemming from the EU agenda and to prove it doesn't need an international presence any longer.
The presence of the Office of the High Representative, 15 years after the Dayton Peace Agreements, suggests political shortcomings, Sannino told the Sarajevo-based daily Nezavisne Novine on Monday (January 24th).
He reiterated that the constitution needs amending in line with recommendations by the European Court of Human Rights.
In December 2009, the Strasbourg-based court ruled that BiH's Constitution, created as an annex to the Dayton Peace Agreements, discriminates against minorities.

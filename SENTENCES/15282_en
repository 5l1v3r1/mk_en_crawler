PODGORICA, Montenegro -- An expert delegation from the US Defence Department will be visiting Montenegro from November 6th to 8th to discuss defence reforms. 
The head of the Montenegrin Army, General Jovan Lakcevic, announced the visit on Monday (October 30th) during a conference on Euro-Atlantic integration in Podgorica. 
He stressed that the military's main goal is full-fledged NATO membership, adding that establishing the army's future model would be accomplished in consultation with NATO experts -- primarily from the United States, seen as a strategic partner in the process.

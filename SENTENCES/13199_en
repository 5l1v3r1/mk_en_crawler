BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian Parliament voted on Monday (28 November) to approve the country's 2006 budget, which officials say meets the requirements of the IMF.
The adoption of an IMF-approved budget is tied to a deal between Belgrade and the Paris Club of creditor nations.
The group of the 19 richest countries has agreed to write off $730m of Serbia's foreign debt if Belgrade follows IMF's guidelines for economic reform and prudent fiscal policy.
Analysts describe approval by parliament as a crucial test of Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's minority government.

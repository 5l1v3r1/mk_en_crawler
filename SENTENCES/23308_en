TIRANA, Albania -- Running democratic elections that comply with international standards will be the best way for Albania to divide its historic and political past from the future, President Bamir Topi said on Monday (March 30th).
The June 28th general elections will be Albania's first major test after becoming a NATO member later this week, Topi told a forum in Tirana.
In other news Monday, media reported police seized about 100kg of marijuana in two separate operations in the town of Gjirokastra, near the Greek border.
They arrested three suspects.

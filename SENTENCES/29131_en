BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prosecutors filed corruption and embezzlement charges Wednesday (May 5th) against former Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase. 
They say that while in office from 2002 to 2004, he received gifts and services worth 630,000 euros, in return for helping officials keep their jobs. 
He is also suspected of forging official documents in connection with acquiring his home, worth an estimated 1.5m euros. 
Nastase has repeatedly denied all accusations. 
Investigations into the case began in 2006, but in 2008 the Constitutional Court ruled that former prime ministers have the same immunity as incumbents and could only be indicted with parliamentary approval. 
Lawmakers gave that green light last year.

PRISTINA, Kosovo/TIRANA, Albania -- Officials in Kosovo and Albania angrily deny allegations of weapons, drugs and human organ trafficking that Council of Europe (CoE) Special Rapporteur Dick Marty has made against Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci.
Acting President Jakup Krasniqi said on Wednesday (December 15th) that the report is not based on facts and is intended to discredit the liberation war of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).
The report alleges that Thaci heads a "mafia-style" Albanian group responsible for trafficking.
Thaci's political opponents also condemn the report, describing it as a blow to independence.
Social Democratic Party leader Agim Ceku said Belgrade is behind many of Marty's accusations.
The Human rights group Amnesty International called on EULEX to immediately start investigating Thaci's alleged involvement in activities described in Marty's report.
EULEX Deputy Head of Mission Andy Sparks said the rule of law mission will examine the report.
In Brussels, Maja Kocijancic, spokesperson for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, called on Marty to provide evidence.
Officials in Tirana rejected the report Wednesday.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha said it is not supported by facts, evidence or reality -- which, he says, confirms political bias and amounts to a flagrant abuse of authority by the CoE.
His comment followed a meeting in Tirana with CoE Director General of Democracy and Political Affairs Jean Louis Laurens.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Justice Ministry official Slobodan Homen said on Sunday (August 22nd) that an investigation against alleged drug trafficker Darko Saric will expand to include some businessmen and politicians, he but refused to name names.
In an interview with the Podgorica-based daily Dan, he declined to say whether Montenegrin citizens would be investigated too.
In April, the special prosecution filed charges against Saric and 19 others suspected of smuggling 2.5 tonnes of cocaine from South America.
Serbian police have said Saric may be hiding in the region, specifically in Montenegro.
Police there however say new information suggests that he has left the Balkans and gone to South Africa.

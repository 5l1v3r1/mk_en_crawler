ATHENS, Greece -- Greece is voicing dissatisfaction with Washington's refusal to abolish visa requirements for Greeks travelling to the United States.
On Sunday (October 12th), Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said the US administration's decision is "wrong".
"Greece follows a foreign policy of defending its national interests always in the framework of its international obligations," she said in an interview with the daily Vima.
Last week, the US administration decided to exclude Greece from its Visa Waiver Programme, citing "political reasons".
Greek government sources perceive an allusion to Athens' move earlier this year to block Macedonia's NATO bid.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The G17 Plus party, a junior member of Serbia's ruling coalition, said it could pull out of the government and force early elections if Ratko Mladic is not arrested by September. 
Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic, a top figure in the party, said on Monday (8 May) that he had received assurances from Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica that the fugitive would be caught by then. 
The leader of G17 Plus, Miroljub Labus, resigned as deputy prime minister last week to protest the government's failure to arrest Mladic by 30 April. 
Dinkic said his party's main board would decide Saturday whether other G17 Plus members of the cabinet would resign as well. 
The EU decided to freeze talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Belgrade because of the Mladic issue.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A court convicted former Kosovo Liberation Army member Gjelosh Krasniqi of hostage-taking Wednesday (April 29th) and sentenced him to seven years in prison in the second war crimes trial conducted by EULEX in Kosovo.
The judges cleared him of murder allegations.
Police arrested Krasniqi last May on charges of kidnapping, robbery and the murder of police officer Pashke Luli.
Prosecutors alleged that Krasniqi and three unidentified suspects entered Luli's home and ordered him to accompany them.
Luli has not been seen since.

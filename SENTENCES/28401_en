BUCHAREST, Romania -- Sweden's SAAB on Thursday (April 15th) urged Romania to drop plans to buy used US-made F-16s and buy new Gripen aircraft instead.
Jerry Lindbergh, a Swedish government official in charge of defence exports, said SAAB is ready to offer 24 new JAS 39 multi-purpose fighters for $1.3 billion, the same price Lockheed Martin wants to charge for the used F-16s.
Last month, the Romanian government decided to pick the US offer, mostly due to political factors.
Romania's air force is in urgent need of modernisation.

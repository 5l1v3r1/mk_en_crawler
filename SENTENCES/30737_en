BELGRADE, Serbia -- Bosiljka Mladic, wife of war crimes fugitive and former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic, said on Tuesday (April 5th) that she doubts her husband is alive. 
Speaking at the opening of her trial for illegal possession of weapons, she told the court that if Mladic were alive, he would have found a way to contact his family. 
Last year, Bosiljka Mladic requested the court officially declare her husband dead so his family could dispose of his assets and receive his pension. 
The arrests of Mladic and Croatian Serb wartime leader Goran Hadzic remain a key condition for Serbia's EU integration bid.

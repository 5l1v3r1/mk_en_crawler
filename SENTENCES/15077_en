LONDON, Britain -- The EU is set to provide Turkey with a checklist of around 150 tasks it must fulfil in the next two years if it wants to join the EU by 2015. 
Among other things, Ankara will be asked to eradicate torture, establish freedom of religion and assert civilian control over the military. 
The measures are designed also to address concerns among some in Europe regarding Turkey's readiness to join the Union. 
The EU officially launched membership talks with Turkey in early October.
In other news, officials say the Turkish government expects to raise $6.75 billion from privatisation of state-owned assets in 2006. 
Turkey has so far this year conducted sell-offs worth $16.8 billion, including the privatisation of 55 per cent of Turk Telekom for $6.55 billion.

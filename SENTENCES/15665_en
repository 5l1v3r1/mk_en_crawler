SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A EU expert mission arrived in Sofia on Monday (21 August) to assess the fight against organised crime, corruption and money laundering, EU Affairs Minister Meglena Kuneva confirmed on national radio. 
This will be the last such partnership inspection conducted by the European Commission (EC) under the Justice and Home Affairs chapter before the EC releases its September monitoring report on Bulgaria's progress towards EU accession. 
The report will play a decisive role in determining whether Bulgaria enters the EU in January 2007, as planned, or sees its entry postponed by a year.
According to a report introduced by Interior Minister Rumen Petkov on Sunday, the crime rate fell in the first half of 2006. 
The number of serious criminal acts in Bulgaria dropped by 36 per cent in the first half of the year, compared to the same period in 2005. 
Petkov said there were three contract murders, one of which was solved.

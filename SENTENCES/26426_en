PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Shterpce/Strpce Mayor Bratislav Nikolic said on Sunday (March 14th) that he will not change his politics despite shots fired at his house by gunmen.
"This act was committed by people who do not support good ideas, but want to frighten people who do a good job," Nikolic said, a day after the incident.
No injuries or damage was reported.
Police have arrested two suspects.
Nikolic was elected in the November 2009 municipal elections as a candidate of the Serbian Liberal Party.
So far, he has ignored Serb parallel structures that have been active in the small town for the past ten years.

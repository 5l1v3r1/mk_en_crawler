TIRANA, Albania -- Interior Minister Lulzim Basha resigned on Thursday (March 24th) in order to be able to run for mayor of Tirana in the May 8th local elections. 
A similar notice was sent to parliament where Basha represents the ruling Democratic Party. 
The Albanian Constitution bars a mayoral candidate to hold posts in the parliament or government at the same time. 
Basha's main rival is incumbent mayor Edi Rama, the head of the opposition Socialist Party.

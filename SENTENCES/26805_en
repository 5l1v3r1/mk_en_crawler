BELGRADE, Serbia -- Five people suspected of involvement in last week's deadly blasts at the Prvi Partizan ammunition factory in the town of Uzice will spend 30 days in custody, a judge decided on Sunday (September 6th). 
Four men and one woman working at the plant have been detained for possible negligence regarding security measures, which may have led to the blasts. 
On Saturday, the country observed a day of national mourning in memory of the seven workers killed in Thursday's explosions.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn briefed the European Parliament Monday (May 26th) on the pace of EU integration efforts among countries in the Western Balkans, describing it as '"steady but uneven".
Rehn said finalising Kosovo's status and forming the new government in Serbia remain the most sensitive issues.
He also described 2008 as an important year for Croatia, adding that if accession talks proceed as scheduled, the EU could provide an accession timetable by the end of the year.
He urged Macedonia to commit to reforms, starting with free and fair parliamentary elections next month.
Rehn urged both Albania and Montenegro to effectively implement their Stabilisation and Association Agreements (SAAs).
He reiterated that Bosnia and Herzegovina can expect to sign its SAA on June 16th.

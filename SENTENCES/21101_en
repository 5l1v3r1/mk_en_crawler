SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs Rosemary Di Carlo visited Sarajevo on Thursday (November 1st) and praised the police reform declaration signed by the six main BiH parties last week. 
She also urged that it be implemented as soon as possible. 
The so-called Mostar document confirmed the readiness of BiH politicians to complete the police reform process in line with three EU principles -- state-level organisation, financing from a single budget and suspension of political interference in police work. 
The document is fuzzy on specifics however, linking actual police reform to talks on constitutional reform. 
In this regard, Di Carlo urged local leaders not to lose momentum.

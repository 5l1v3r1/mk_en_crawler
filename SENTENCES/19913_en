THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The trial against Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj, charged with war crimes against Croats and Bosnian Muslims in the 1990s, will begin on November 7th, the UN war crimes tribunal announced on Tuesday (September 18th). 
The trial will start with opening statements by prosecutors, followed by Seselj's introductory statements the next day. 
He surrendered to The Hague tribunal in February 2003, but blocked trial proceedings late last year by staging a hunger strike until the tribunal agreed to let him act as his own counsel in court.

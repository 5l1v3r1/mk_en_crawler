BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Greek Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis vowed that the country's economic credibility will be restored shortly. 
At a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels on Thursday (21 October), Alogoskoufis said Greece is committed to fiscal transparency and will do everything necessary to publish reliable budget figures. 
The minister referred to a recent scandal in which the previous Greek cabinet was accused of falsifying EU criteria so that Greece could adopt the euro. 
He said the EU will make recommendations in November on Greece's fiscal problems and the country's budget for 2005.

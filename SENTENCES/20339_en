SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The opposition Democratic Union for Integration and the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia filed a no-confidence motion Monday (February 11th) against Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska.
At issue is how police made some arrests in the village of Brodec last November.
Albanian television channels and Macedonia's Kanal 5 aired video Sunday of Macedonian policemen questioning a witness with head injuries.
Six people were killed in the Brodec operation and 13 were arrested, including suspected terrorist Lirim Jakupi.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- British Ambassador to Zagreb John Ramsden said Tuesday (28 June) that internal problems related to adopting the new EU Constitution should not affect Croatia's EU membership bid.
During a roundtable on the upcoming UK presidency of the EU, Ramsden reaffirmed the EU commitments made towards Croatia thus far, but reiterated that the chief condition for launching membership talks is Zagreb's full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.

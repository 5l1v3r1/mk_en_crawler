ATHENS, Greece -- A home-made bomb exploded Wednesday (September 23rd) outside the apartment building of opposition PASOK lawmaker Louka Katseli, causing minor damage.
She was not in the building at the time.
The attack came just weeks ahead of the October 4th general elections in which Katseli is a candidate.
The newest polls suggest PASOK has a 7% lead over the ruling New Democracy party.
Katseli's apartment is on the fourth floor of a building in Athens' central district of Halandri, where several embassies and ministerial buildings are situated.
It is considered one of the safest areas in the capital.
An anonymous tip was sent to a local newspaper and a TV channel 20 minutes before the explosion.
Police raided a house in the district late Wednesday, which resulted in four arrests.

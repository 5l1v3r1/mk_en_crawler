ROME, Italy -- As official candidates for EU membership, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Turkey signed the new EU Constitution at a formal ceremony in Rome on Friday (29 October), along with representatives of the EU member states. 
To take effect, the constitution must be ratified individually by each member state -- either by referendum or parliamentary approval.

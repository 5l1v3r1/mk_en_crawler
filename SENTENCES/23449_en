BELGRADE, Serbia -- Former Yugoslav army officer Damir Sireta pleaded not guilty Tuesday (December 23rd) to charges of participating in the execution of 200 Croatian prisoners of war in 1991. 
"I do not admit committing that crime, and I do not feel any guilt," Sireta, 45, told the war crimes section of Belgrade District Court. 
He allegedly belonged to an execution squad that killed prisoners of war in Ovcara, eastern Croatia. 
In 1991, Sireta was a member of the Vukovar territorial defence, which was part of the former Yugoslav People's Army.
In other news Tuesday, President Boris Tadic reportedly said that technical problems are affecting the hunt for two remaining war crimes fugitives, Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic. 
He described the issues as security-related and said they are not uncommon in other countries. 
The Netherlands refuses to allow Serbia to proceed in its EU integration process until Mladic is in custody.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu expressed optimism Friday (August 27th) about the future of relations with Greece.
"We have differing positions ...
on certain subjects but the way to overcome them is with dialogue.
If the dialogue is not enough, then more dialogue.
There is no other alternative," Davutoglu said during a visit to Konya for a rally ahead of the September 12th referendum on constitutional amendments.
His comments came after the 46th round of exploratory talks between Turkish and Greek diplomats in Athens.
Davutoglu said he plans to visit Greece this autumn, following Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas' recent trip to Turkey.
As for Israel, Davutoglu said the country has met five of Turkey's seven conditions to resume bilateral relations.
Ties became strained after Israel's May 31st raid on a Turkish-led aid flotilla to Gaza that left nine people dead.
He pointed out that Ankara is still waiting for Israel to apologise for the raid and to compensate the victims, two conditions the international community has set as well.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The hunt for war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic is being ramped up, Rasim Ljajic, head of Serbia's national council for ties with the UN war crimes tribunal, said on Thursday (December 4th). 
"Operations will be taking place over the coming days and will continue until Mladic's arrest," he vowed. 
Earlier in the day, police searched five locations, including the Belgrade home of his son, Darko, seizing items believed to belong to Mladic. 
On Wednesday, NATO peacekeepers in Bosnia and Herzegovina raided the home of war crimes indictee Radovan Karadzic's wife, seeking proof of suspected links to Mladic.
In other news Thursday, Hague tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz said his office will present strong evidence to prove Karadzic's guilt during his trial. 
Still unclear is when it will start. 
Brammertz says prosecutors will focus on four charges in the indictment -- ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the 1992-1995 conflict, the shelling of civilians during the siege of Sarajevo, the Srebrenica genocide and the use of UN peacekeepers as hostages.

ANKARA, Turkey -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder refuted recent media speculation that Germany would demand the EU give only conditional approval to Turkey's bid to open accession negotiations.
In an interview with the Financial Times Deutschland on Wednesday (21 July), Schroeder stressed that Germany fully supports Turkey's EU integration efforts.
Suggesting he had been misquoted earlier, he said Germany never insisted on additional conditions for Turkey.

NEW YORK, United States -- The European Commission will wait until Turkey adopts a key package of reforms before it releases its next report on the country's progress towards EU accession, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Friday (22 September) during a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul.
The so-called "9th reform package" is currently being debated by parliament.
Rehn also reportedly plans to visit Ankara in early November to discuss freedom of speech issues.

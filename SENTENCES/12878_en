SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Setbacks in efforts to privatisate Bulgaria's tobacco industry have led to calls for cabinet-level changes, with Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Lidia Shouleva coming under particular criticism.
On Tuesday (1 February), British American Tobacco formally withdrew its bid for the three largest tobacco factories, citing the political environment.
It was the sole candidate in the tender.
The withdrawal sparked a disagreeement between government partners NMS-II and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), as well as between the cabinet and the opposition.
On Wednesday, however, MRF deputy Yunal Lyutfi promised his party would back the government in any no-confidence motion, though he also called for "certain reshuffles".

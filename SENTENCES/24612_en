ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed the demands of the Alevi community with the chairman of the Alevi Cem Foundation, Izzettin Dogan, at a meeting Saturday (December 6th), local media reported. 
Followers of the Alevi branch of Islam have long complained of discrimination and forced assimilation by the majority Sunni Muslims. 
In a major demonstration in Ankara last month, the Alevis called on the government to abolish the Religious Affairs Directorate, cancel compulsory religious courses at schools and legalise their community's prayer houses. 
After the meeting Saturday, Dogan said Erdogan pledged to address the Alevi issue after next year's local elections. 
Analysts suggest the government is preparing new measures to meet the Alevis' main demands, given their influence in previous elections.
In other news, four illegal immigrants drowned after their rubber boat capsized off Turkey's northwest coast Saturday. 
The boat, carrying 27 immigrants, most of them Palestinians, sank off the town of Ayvalik while trying to reach the Greek island of Lesbos. 
Rescuers managed to save 23 of the immigrants.
Separately, Turkish police arrested 19 illegal immigrants and three human traffickers Sunday in an operation in the Aegean province of Izmir. 
The immigrants were hiding in a bus that police officers stopped in the town of Selcuk.

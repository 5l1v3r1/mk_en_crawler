SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Several BiH politicians rejected the possibility Monday (May 28th) of removing Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik from office for blocking key constitutional and police reforms. 
The Stratfor intelligence agency says Dodik alienated US officials, including Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney, during talks inWashington last week. 
The discussions had been aimed at overcoming the deadlock over reforms.
BiH Presidency Chairman Nebojsa Radmanovic rejected the idea of sacking Dodik, as did Deputy Parliament Speaker Mladen Ivanic. 
Croatian and Bosniak politicians say the international community should respect the fact that Dodik is the legally elected RS leader.

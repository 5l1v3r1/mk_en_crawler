TIRANA, Albania -- Former Socialist Party (SP) leader Fatos Nano has launched an official campaign under the slogan "The movement for SP's revival", calling all Socialists to rebuild the divided party together. 
At a meeting with supporters in Tirana Wednesday (September 19th), Nano criticised current SP leader Edi Rama for usurping the party and ending the democratic system within it.

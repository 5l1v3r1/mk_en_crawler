ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in Diyarbakir on Tuesday (July 28th) sentenced prominent Kurdish activist Leyla Zana to 15 months in prison for propaganda in favour of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
She missed the sentencing because she was in England for a speech, which the court also deemed as PKK propaganda. 
At the University of London, she told an audience "what is the heart and the brain for a person, this is what the PKK and [imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah] Ocalan are for the Kurdish people." Zana has already served a ten-year prison sentence, handed down in December 1994, for supporting the PKK.

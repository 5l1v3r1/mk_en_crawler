TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament on Thursday (7 April) adopted a draft law on curbing conflicts of interest.
The ruling Socialist Party (SP) had enough votes to pass the measure, but it triggered fierce debate.
The opposition accused SP and the government of adopting a law favouring their interests.
Critics, led by the Democratic Party, said the draft would allow for the transfer of property to relatives of ruling party and government officials.
Starting in 2006, it would preclude members of the government or parliament and their relatives from owning private companies or signing contracts involving public funds.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Constitutional Court of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) is expected to rule Wednesday (March 30th) on the formation of authorities in the entity. 
Outgoing FBiH President Borjana Kristo filed a motion before the court against the formation of the upper house of parliament and the election of FBiH president and vice-presidents. 
The House of Peoples was constituted on March 17th despite a boycott by the two main Croat parties -- the HDZ BiH and HDZ 1990. 
On Monday, High Representative Valentin Inzko suspended the decisions of the BiH State Election Commission (CIK) which deemed the newly established FBiH parliament and the FBiH president and vice-presidents illegitimate. 
He says the CIK lacks the authority to rule on such legal issues and that all must await the Constitutional Court's ruling.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The ruling Justice and Development Party plans to call for an emergency session of parliament on Tuesday (5 September) to discuss the government's proposal to dispatch troops to Lebanon. 
The mandate would be for one year, but subject to an extension.
In other news, the Kurdistan Liberation Hawks (TAK), a group believed to be linked to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), has claimed responsibility for a bombing Monday in Antalya that claimed three lives and injured dozens, as well as for four blasts in Marmaris and Istanbul late Sunday. 
TAK also reiterated calls for foreigners to avoid Turkey, but hotel owners and Western travel agencies report very few cancellations.

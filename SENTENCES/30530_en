SKOPJE, Macedonia -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso and EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele wrapped up a regional tour promoting EU integration after stops in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Montenegro and Macedonia.
It began Friday (April 8th) in Sarajevo where Barroso reiterated "BiH should have a European future," after a meeting with members of the country's presidency.
He pledged the EU's political and financial assistance, but at the same time pointed out BiH should "do its part".
Presidency Chairman Nebojsa Radmanovic reiterated the country stands firmly on its path to EU membership.
In Montenegro, Barroso and Fuele met President with Filip Vujanovic and Prime Minister Igor Luksic among others on Friday.
Barroso said that Podgorica has made progress in fulfilling the EU-set conditions for getting a date to start membership talks, but at the same time urged specific results, particularly in the rule of law area.
On Saturday, Barroso was in Ohrid where he addressed a forum on EU integration, saying now is the time to settle the long-standing name dispute between Macedonia and Greece, as resolving it would boost Macedonia's European integration process.

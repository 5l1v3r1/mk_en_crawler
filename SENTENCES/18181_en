SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Skopje District Court acquitted former ethnic Albanian paramilitary leader Agim Krasniqi and ten others of terrorism charges on Friday (February 16th).
The charges stem from the siege of Kondovo and threats to shell Skopje in 2003 and 2004.
According to the judges, prosecutors failed to provide compelling evidence of their claims.
The acquittal also marked Krasniqi's first public appearance in two years.
With him on the run, his trial was conducted in absentia.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- New government statistics suggest more than five million Romanians visited foreign countries in 2002 following the waiving of visas for travel to most EU member states. 
About one-fifth of them visited Western Europe. 
The EU has called on Romania to tighten border controls to stem the tide of people seeking illegal employment in the West.

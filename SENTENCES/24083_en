SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov on Thursday (July 16th) officially gave the mandate to form a cabinet to Boyko Borisov, the informal leader of the election-winning Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB). 
Borisov, the next prime minister, now has seven days to assemble a programme and his cabinet members, which will then be voted on by parliament. 
GERB won 116 out of the 240 seats in parliament in recent elections, and needs backing from just five more lawmakers to get parliamentary approval.

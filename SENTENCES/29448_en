TIRANA, Albania -- Property and bank accounts of suspected terrorists and mafia bosses operating in Albania have been blocked by the police, following court orders supported by the finance ministry.
The total value of property seized since 2008 is about 22m euros, local media report on Monday (November 1st).
Some of the owners are on the black lists of the UN and the United States.
The rest are accused of participating in criminal gangs or have been convicted of trafficking and other crimes.
In other news Monday, the Tirana Appeals Court backed the extradition of former Albanian government official Almir Rrapo to the United States to stand trial for murder, kidnapping and racketeering.
The court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Rrapo's defence arguments that he could be sentenced to death if convicted in the US.
Rrapo, 28, was arrested in July based on a request from authorities in Washington.

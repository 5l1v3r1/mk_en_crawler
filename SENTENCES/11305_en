TIRANA, Albania -- In a press interview published Thursday (24 February), British Ambassador to Albania Richard Jones urged authorities to step up implementation of crucial reforms.
Jones stressed that finalising the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Albania and the EU requires more work by Tirana, especially electoral reform and an improved business climate.
In other news, the public prosecutor's office announced that a probe has cleared Prime Minister Fatos Nano of alleged involvement in arms trafficking between Albania and Kosovo in 1998.
The investigation was launched last year amid claims by an opposition member of parliament.

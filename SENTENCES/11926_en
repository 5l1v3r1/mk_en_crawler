ANKARA, Turkey -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has been quoted as saying that his country's support for Turkey's EU membership bid before and after the expected start of EU accession talks on 3 October depends primarily on the implementation of reforms.
Media reports Monday (17 January) also quote Schroeder as saying that a major problem is the level of Turkey's economic dependence on EU countries.

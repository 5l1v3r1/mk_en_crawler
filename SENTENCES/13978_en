BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prosecutors have decided to resume an investigation into alleged corruption involving two members of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), former Justice Minister Rodica Stanoiu and former PSD vice president Florin Georgescu.
According to an interior ministry press release Tuesday (16 August), the prosecution office of the High Court of Appeals and Justice will again scrutinise purported transcripts from PSD meetings in November 2004, when the two officials reportedly made statements proving corruption.
The PSD has denied the authenticity of the transcripts.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- An invitation to NATO membership might be possible in 2006, says Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski.
In an interview with the MIA news agency Tuesday (31 December), he noted that army professionalism, modernisation of military equipment and reduction of personnel would be the three pillars of defence sector reform.
The result, Buckovski said, should be a modern, compact and skilled army - one that is ready to join NATO.

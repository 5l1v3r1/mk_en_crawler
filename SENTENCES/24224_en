SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Campaigning for the July 5th parliamentary elections in Bulgaria officially kicked off on Sunday (June 14th). 
Political parties and coalitions had until Saturday evening to register their candidate lists. 
Twenty of them did so, according to media reports. 
The election will be Bulgaria's first to employ a partial majority voting system, with 31 out of the 240 parliamentary members elected via majority vote.
Just before the registration deadline, a significant rearrangement of smaller parties took place. 
The NAPRED coalition, which won just over 2% in the European Parliament elections on June 7th, split. 
The major party in the coalition, VMRO, joined the conservative Order, Law and Justice formation, which won around 4.7% of the EP vote.

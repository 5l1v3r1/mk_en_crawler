BELGRADE, Serbia -- KFOR has seized uniforms bearing emblems of the Serbian Army (VS), which were allegedly to be used by a paramilitary group to stage fake incidents in Kosovo and on the border with Macedonia, Serbian Army General Mladjen Cirkovic said on Saturday (November 3rd).
He said that he had warned KFOR about the threat of paramilitary group attacks and that KFOR is pursuing the matter.
"We give KFOR information, they check it.
That's how recently, following one of our tip-offs, a number of Serbian army uniforms were confiscated," Cirkovic said, adding that the VS will not tolerate any provocations in the region.
The VS also said they expect international forces led by NATO to protect Serbs and other non-Albanian civilians in Kosovo if violence breaks out during the ongoing status talks.
KFOR representatives insist they will respond to any threat that might arise.

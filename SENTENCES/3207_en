Although bird flu has not been found in Kosovo so far, the government is nevertheless preparing to handle any possible outbreak of the disease.
Prime Minister Agim Ceku has followed in the footsteps of other regional political figures by demonstrating that there should be no fear in consuming chicken products.
At the weekend, he ate meat for the cameras, urging the public to do the same.
During a visit to the Veterinary Laboratory in Fushë-Kosovo, the prime minister sought to reassure members of the public that, should the virus be detected, the government would be able to deal with it.
Ceku praised the readiness of the Veterinary Laboratory staff, noting that nine experts from the United States are working with them.
"The government is prepared and has enough capacity to prevent bird flu and combat it in case of appearance," he said.
Kosovo has earmarked 400,000 euros for dealing with bird flu outbreaks, and currently awaits additional funding from the World Bank.
The extra financing is to be determined at a donor's conference in the near future.
"There are many requests for help, but the options are limited.
Otherwise, health and food always will be our priority," Ceku said.
To date, Kosovo is the only place in Southeast Europe where the virus has not been detected.
More than 450 samples have been taken from the province, and all have tested negative.
Alush Berisha, owner of a small chicken farm in Podujeva, is confident that his birds are healthy.
"Since 2003, I have had 200 chickens on my farm.
They never had been ill.
I am not afraid of the bird flu virus," he said.
Berisha uses the chickens mainly to produce eggs.
UNMIK deputy chief Patricia Woring said she is confident in the Kosovo government.
"I think that all Kosovars must be proud and believe in the work that has been done.
Otherwise, we must be vigilant and open our eyes," she said.

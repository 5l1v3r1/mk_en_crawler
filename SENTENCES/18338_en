BELGRADE, Serbia -- At the weekend, Serbian authorities detained a controversial businesswoman, Stanislava Cocorovska-Poletan, who is wanted by Macedonia in connection with a huge cocaine bust. 
Her Serbian lawyer, Svetozar Pavlovic confirmed on Sunday (January 14th) that Cocorovska-Poletan, who has dual Macedonian-Serbian citizenship, was arrested late last week and is in custody in Belgrade, awaiting extradition to Macedonia. 
Skopje accuses the woman, once linked to murdered Serbia mafia boss and paramilitary leader Zeljko Raznatovic-Arkan, of organising the smuggling of 486 kilos of cocaine recently seized at the Blace border crossing.
In other news, Macedonian police announced the arrest Friday of former Deputy Economy Minister Sasa Andonovski, as he returned from Vienna. 
He has been charged with abuse of office.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia will hold a referendum on its new local decentralisation law on 7 November, parliamentary speaker Ljupco Jordanovski said Friday (3 September).
Parliament's decision came after opponents of the law collected more than 150,000 signatures for a petition calling for the referendum.
The law is the final piece of legislation under the Ohrid Peace Accord.
It grants greater powers to local governments and redraws the borders of several municipalities.
Also on Friday, parliament decided to again postpone local elections, initially scheduled for 21 November, to avoid a conflict with the referendum.
The local vote will now take place by 31 March of next year.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi said on Sunday (January 2nd) that the Serb-dominated northern part of Kosovo won't be part of any future dialogue with Serbia. 
"The north is an internal issue of Kosovo and can be treated only with the international community, but not with Serbia," Rexhepi stressed. 
As for integrating the north, "It is one of the main problems, in fact the main problem," he added. 
Institutions in Pristina admit insufficient control in that part of Kosovo and that Belgrade supports the functioning of parallel structures. 
While opposition parties criticise the government for failing to control the area, Rexhepi criticised the international presence in Kosovo for not doing enough to improve the situation or delegating more competencies to the government.

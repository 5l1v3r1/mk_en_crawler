ZAGREB, Croatia -- The new cabinet held its first session Thursday (January 17th) after receiving a vote of confidence from parliament at the weekend. 
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said one of the most pressing issues is inflation. 
He stressed that a significant factor in rising prices stems from external factors, particularly oil prices. 
As for EU accession negotiations, Sanader acknowledged there are problems, but he insisted that Croatia does not intend to give up its protected fishing zone in the Adriatic. 
The zone has raised tensions with Italy and Slovenia and threatens to delay accession talks.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov announced on Monday (May 3rd) that the ruling GERB party will propose establishing a special anti-mafia court by this summer.
Judges working in the court would be required to pass lie detector tests, as are members of the National Security Agency, the interior ministry and the prosecution.
The court will handle cases related to organised crime and corruption expeditiously.
Similar cases have been protracted until now, due to the heavy workloads of courts around the country.

DUBLIN, Ireland -- The EU welcomed ten new states and 75 million new members on Saturday (1 May), with celebrations across Europe. 
The ten new members are Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia. 
Ireland, current holder of the rotating EU presidency, held a ceremony in Dublin to mark the historic event. 
In his speech, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said that the enlargement brings three major challenges: to agree on a constitution enabling the bloc to work effectively, to fight terrorism, and to spread prosperity to all members. 
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Romanian President Ion Iliescu and Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader also attended the celebration as representatives of aspiring states.

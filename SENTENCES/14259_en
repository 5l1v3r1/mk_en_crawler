ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A bomb exploded in a supermarket in Istanbul on Monday (13 February), injuring 15 people.
The incident happened just four days after another device went off in an Internet cafe, killing one person and injuring 15.
A group calling itself the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons Organisation has claimed responsibility for both blasts and is threatening more.
In other news, prosecutors have indicted two Islamists for throwing stones and shoes at a female journalist during recent protests against cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad.
The two men were angry that the woman was not wearing a headscarf while covering the demonstration for the Sabah daily.
She was not injured.

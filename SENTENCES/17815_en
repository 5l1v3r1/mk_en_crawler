ATHENS, Greece -- Public Order Minister Vyron Polydoras and Police Chief Anastassios Dimoschakis vowed on Thursday (June 21st) to investigate any alleged cases of police misconduct.
Reports of police brutality have been rising, following the release of video taken by a mobile phone video showing officers abusing two detainees at a police station in central Athens last June.
On Thursday, a new video recording, also captured by a mobile phone, aired on local television, showing policemen from another station mistreating two prostitutes.

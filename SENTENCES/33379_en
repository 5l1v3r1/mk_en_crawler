ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian government will decide on easing the visa regime for Serbia-Montenegro at its session Wednesday (4 June), Prime Minister Ivica Racan said Tuesday.
Racan said the suspension of visas would be provisional, and would be applied from 10 June until the end of this year.
Deputy Foreign Minister Ivan Simonovic praised Belgrade's readiness -- expressed by Serbian Justice Minister Vladan Batic during his visit to Zagreb earlier this week -- to return stolen Croatian registers of births, marriages, deaths and land.

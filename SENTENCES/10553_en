TIRANA, Albania -- The latest EU report on Albania praises the progress made in regional governance reforms, local media said Monday (15 November). 
The EU reportedly gave a positive assessment of the decentralisation process, saying that greater autonomy for local governance units has helped clarify their functions. 
However, the report also cited a number of issues that still need to be addressed, including the transfer of authority over water and energy supply, education and social protections from the central to local governments.

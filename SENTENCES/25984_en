SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Peace Implementation Council (PIC) Steering Board kicks off a two-day meeting in Sarajevo on Wednesday (November 18th) focusing largely on the political stalemate that has thwarted reforms.
Ahead of the meeting, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said he sees no security risk for BiH but noted there is deterioration in the political situation.
According to him, the PIC will probably not set a date to close the Office of the High Representative and transition it an EU Special Representative office.

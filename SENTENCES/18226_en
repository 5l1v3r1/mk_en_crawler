BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu highlighted the fight against corruption, efficient utilisation of EU funds and effective teamwork as key priorities of his new government, during its first session in Bucharest on Wednesday (April 11th). 
Tariceanu added that the cabinet would continue following the EU integration and reform programme endorsed by Parliament in 2004. 
The new cabinet is composed of members of PNL and the ethnic Hungarian UDMR.
President Traian Basescu, meanwhile, is vowing to watch the cabinet carefully for signs of corruption. 
In an interview in Thursday's Cotidianul daily, he added that there is no way to reconcile his differences with Tariceanu.
In other news, former Economy Minister Codrut Seres is in trouble again, this time over the national hydropower producer Hidroelectrica. 
Prosecutors are investigating him and eight others, though details are sketchy. 
He is already being investigated for alleged irregularities in energy sector privatisation deals, but denies any wrongdoing.

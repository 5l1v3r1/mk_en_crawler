ANKARA, Turkey -- Military aircraft conducted bombing raids on terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) camps near the border with Iraq on Wednesday (October 10th).
The military has also dispatched tanks and troops to prevent PKK guerrillas from moving in and out of Iraq.
There are unconfirmed reports that the army might have shelled targets in Iraq as well.
The move came after a spate of PKK attacks that killed at least 15 soldiers since Sunday.
The Turkish government asked parliament this week to authorise a military operation on Iraqi territory, but no decision is expected until next week.
In other news Wednesday, one police officer was killed and four people were injured in a bomb attack on a police car in the southeast Turkish province of Diyarbakir, a frequent target of attacks by Kurdish separatists.
Witnesses say it was a hand grenade that exploded.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A Turkish court on Saturday (April 5th) pressed charges against 24 suspected al-Qaeda members of planning bomb attacks and belonging to a terrorist organisation. 
The alleged terrorists were indicted for having planned attacks in Istanbul, which would have taken place if Turkey decided to send more troops to the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan. 
Turkey currently has 1,200 troops deployed in Afghanistan and is considering a possible increase of its contingent.

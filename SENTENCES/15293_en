ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul suggested on Monday (October 30th) that the government supports an initiative by EU presidency holder Finland for talks on the Cyprus issue, describing it as a "constructive effort". 
A spokesman for the Finnish EU Presidency says the talks could be held November 5th and 6th, ahead of the release of the European Commission's (EC) next evaluation report on Turkey. 
Media reports in Ankara suggest the weekend meeting would be held in Helsinki.
The Financial Times, meanwhile, reported that the EC's report will be strongly critical of Turkey. 
Quoting the text of the draft document, the paper said the EC will express disappointment with Turkey's refusal to open its airports and seaports to Cypriot ships and planes, as called for under an extended customs protocol. 
It will also voice concern about freedom of speech issues, the political influence of the Turkish armed forces, lack of judicial independence, and inadequate minority rights.
On Monday, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan reiterated that Ankara will not open its air and naval space to Greek Cypriot traffic before the isolation of the northern, Turkish-occupied part of Cyprus is lifted.

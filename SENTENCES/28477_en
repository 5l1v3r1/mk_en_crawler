PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Assembly of the Community of Kosovo Municipalities is calling on Serbian President Boris Tadic and Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic to resign, public broadcaster RTK reported on Wednesday (September 15th).
The assembly also urged Serbia's parliament to initiate a no-confidence vote against the government.
According to the report, the calls followed an urgent meeting in north Mitrovica reviewing the security and political situation, after last week's adoption of an EU-Serbia harmonised resolution on Kosovo at the UN General Assembly.
Kosovo Serbs believe that Belgrade's decision to withdraw the initial resolution is a failure and say they have lost trust in the Serbian government.

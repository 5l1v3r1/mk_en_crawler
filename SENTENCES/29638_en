PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Romanian Colonel Marian Petre has been appointed head of the Special Police Department within the EULEX, media reported on Monday (April 25th).
This is the highest position in EULEX, in terms of the planning dimension of police operations, the Romanian Ministry of Administration and Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.
Romanian police have a questionable reputation in Kosovo because of an incident in February 2007.
Two Romanian police officers deployed with UNMIK were held responsible for firing rubber bullets into a crowd of Pristina protestors, killing two and injuring 80.
Neither UNMIK nor Romanian authorities have held any of the officers accountable.

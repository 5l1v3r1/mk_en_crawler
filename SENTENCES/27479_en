PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Two blasts rocked the northern town of Zvecan early Monday (September 27th) causing damage but no injuries. 
Police say the explosions occurred on the same street. 
One source is quoted as saying devices were thrown into the yard of the editor in chief of Radio Mitrovica, Caslav Milisavljevic, and in front of a private shop nearby. 
Allegedly, the explosives intended to threaten Milisavljevic's son into resigning from the Working Group for the north, which is in charge of establishing the Municipality of Mitrovica. 
Both Milisavljevic and Dragana Stojkovic, owner of the shop, say the attack was politically motivated. 
Milisavljevic's house was also targeted in July.

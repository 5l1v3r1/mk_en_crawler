ANKARA, Turkey -- The country's co-ordinator for the fight against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), retired General Edip Baser, explicitly dismissed on Saturday (16 September) the possibility of negotiations with the terrorist organisation. 
Speaking at a news conference, Baser welcomed the determination voiced by his US counterpart, retired General Joseph Ralston, who visited Ankara earlier in the week. 
Details are expected shortly.
In other news, Turkish authorities say they suspect a radical PKK faction is behind the bomb blast in Diyarbakir that killed ten people and injured 17 last week. 
Investigators say the material used was similar to that used recently against Turkish military targets.
Near the resort town of Marmaris meanwhile, police arrested four men and seized more than 10kgs of plastic explosives. 
A total of 27 people, including tourists, were injured in bombings there last month.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Partizan Belgrade fan club leader Milos Radisavljevic was sentenced on Wednesday (August 4th) to 16 months in prison for threatening journalist Brankica Stankovic.
He was detained in May over a December 2009 incident when thousands chanted threats and insults against the B92 reporter during a football match.
Stankovic has received numerous threats after reporting on fans suspected of hooligan attacks.

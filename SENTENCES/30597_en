BUCHAREST, Romania -- The governing style needs changing to boost public confidence in the cabinet, President Traian Basescu said after meeting with parliament members from the senior ruling Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) on Tuesday (February 15th).
Basescu says he has been talking with officials from the ruling coalition groups for the past three days about measures to restore confidence in the government and ruling parties.
He deflected speculation about a potential replacement for Prime Minister Emil Boc.
TV station Antena 3 reports that Basescu wanted to replace Boc, but backtracked when the ruling coalition objected.

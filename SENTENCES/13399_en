BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The national council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal is expected to decide on Thursday (26 January) whether to grant UN prosecutors at The Hague access to information and documents they seek. 
Serbia-Montenegro Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic, who also chairs the national council, said Wednesday that granting the request would ensure the fulfillment of prosecutors' demands and remove any suspicion that Belgrade is hiding documents.
In other news Wednesday, Serbian Assistant Prosecutor for War Crimes Jasna Jankovic announced that some 40 investigations of alleged war crimes are under way. 
Ten of the probes relate to mass graves found in the Belgrade suburb of Batajnica, which contained the bodies of some 500 Kosovo Albanians killed in 1999.

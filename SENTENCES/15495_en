SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Authorities have deported a naturalised BiH citizen of Tunisian origin -- Bedrudin Fershishi, also known as Abu Malik -- to his country after rejecting his request for asylum, his lawyer Dzhevad Kadribasic said on Wednesday (23 August).
Abu Malik was arrested in the Zenica and Zavidovici region on 25 June.
Kadribasic says the deportation procedure violates the law since it occurred before the BiH Constitutional Court ruled on a request by Abu Malik for recognition of his BiH citizenship, acquired during the 1990's conflict.
Thursday's BiH edition of the Zagreb-based Vecernji list daily quoted Abu Malik's brother as saying the so-called Mujahedin community in BiH would contest the deportation, fearing Abu Malik would be mistreated in Tunis.

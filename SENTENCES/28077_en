LONDON, United Kingdom -- A court in London decided on Tuesday (April 20th) that it will discuss Serbia's request for the extradition of former BiH presidency member Ejup Ganic on July 5th. 
The proceedings started on April 13th after the Home Office certified Belgrade's extradition request as valid. 
On Tuesday, the court appointed Judge Timothy Workman to handle the case, giving the defence team a month to submit all documents and arguments, after which Serbia will submit its arguments. 
Ganic was arrested on March 1st at London's Heathrow Airport, based on a warrant issued by Belgrade. 
Serbia wants him in connection with a May 1992 attack in Sarajevo against a Yugoslav National Army convoy, which left more than 40 soldiers dead. 
Ganic has denied the charges.

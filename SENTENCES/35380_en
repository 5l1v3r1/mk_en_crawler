LONDON, United Kingdom -- Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), told the BBC that the nations of the Western Balkans are moving away from nationalism, but at different rates.
"You have a balance between the pull of Europe and the pull of the nationalist legend .When the scales shift and the pull of Europe becomes more powerful than the pull of the past nationalism, countries move forward," he observed.
Ashdown added that Croatia had turned its back on nationalism faster than other countries in the area.
He characterised the situation in BiH as "50-50", while in Serbia "the pull of the myth of nationalism remains stronger than the pull of Europe".

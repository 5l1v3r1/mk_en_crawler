PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu on Wednesday (October 22nd) ruled out any further discussion with Serbia on issues related to Kosovo's status, saying Pristina will discuss only regional matters. 
He was responding to the UN's fresh initiative to initiate talks between Pristina and Belgrade on six points regarding UNMIK's reconfiguration process. 
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon outlined the points in a letter to Serbian President Boris Tadic in June. 
They relate to the judiciary, police, customs, transport and infrastructure, as well as to the protection of Serbian cultural heritage in Kosovo. 
UN envoy Andrew Ladley has already concluded his first round of meetings in Pristina and Belgrade.

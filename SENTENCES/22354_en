ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic will present a medal to a Croatian Serb who saved the lives of Croat prisoners of war from Vukovar early in the 1991-1995 war.
Croatian media reported on Sunday (November 16th) that Aleksandar Jevtic will receive the medal for the courage he demonstrated.
The daily Jutarnji List quoted a number of former Croatian military officers from Vukovar who say Jevtic saved more than 150 people at a war camp in Serbia.

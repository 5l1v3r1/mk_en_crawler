TIRANA, Albania -- The government will ask for double the number of observers during the 2009 parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on Saturday (August 2nd).
He was responding to accusations by the opposition Socialist Party, which claims the government has asked the OSCE not to monitor the elections.
Berisha denied that and said he would invite other observers as well, such as the European Commission, the European Parliament and various NGOs.

ATHENS, Greece -- Three people died in falls linked to a general strike by workers at the state-owned electricity company, police announced on Sunday (March 9th).
In the Leonidion municipality of the Peloponnese peninsula, a 64-year-old woman fell a distance of four metres in the dark and died.
Police are investigating two similar fatal incidents.
Employees with the monopoly Public Power Corporation continued their nationwide strike Sunday, cutting electricity for two hours.
However, the electricity situation has been somewhat alleviated due to lower demand in warm weather.
The workers have protested planned pension reforms for a week and prosecutors are investigating to determine if workers have overstepped their rights by hampering the normal operation of the public utility.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The Hague war crimes tribunal Deputy Chairman O-Gon Kwon on Tuesday (April 21st) rejected a request by former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to give a telephone interview to Dutch journalist Zvezdana Vukojevic.
The judge noted Karadzic has permission to communicate with journalists only through letters because telephone conversations may result in the revealing of protected witnesses and other confidential information.
In February, Kwon okayed the interview with Vukojevic, who works for the Revu magazine, as long as it involved no conversation.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The City Council rejected an initiative Monday (September 14th) launched by the opposition to remove Mayor Miomir Mugosa from office. 
The no-confidence motion was filed after two journalists with the Podgorica-based daily Vijesti claimed they were assaulted by the mayor, his son and their guard in August. 
On Monday, Mugosa reiterated he was the one being attacked, and said he would react the same way should it happen again.

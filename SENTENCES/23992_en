PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Minorities will account for 10% of the staff of the new Kosovo Security Force (KSF), Defence Minister Fehmi Mujota said on Saturday (January 17th).
Mujota explained that the government plans to appoint a Serb as deputy KSF minister, though most Serbs are against establishing the force, arguing that accepting it would mean accepting Kosovo's independence.
Mujota added that around 1,000 KSF members will come from the outgoing Kosovo Protection Corps.
In other news Sunday, French Brigadier General Michel Jakovleff, commander of KFOR's northern task force, said violence in the north is criminal in nature, rather than political or ethnic.
In an interview with Koha Ditore, he added that co-operation between KFOR and the EULEX mission in the north is "very close".
He said one of the main problems in the north is smuggling, especially of fuel.

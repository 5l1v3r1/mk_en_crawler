SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Court has confirmed that several senior officials of the Party of Democratic Progress (PDP), including Foreign Minister and former Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Mladen Ivanic, are under investigation in connection with a 2002 embezzlement affair. 
Thursday's (21 September) edition of Nezavisne novine says prosecutors launched a probe earlier this month. 
Ivanic, former RS Interior Minister Zoran Djeric and eight other officials are suspected of abuse of office and financing PDP using funds from the RS budget.
In a statement to Nezavisne novine, Ivanic dismissed the accusations as politically motivated.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The bodies of more than 150 people killed in the Srebrenica massacre have been discovered in eastern BiH, forensic experts announced on Wednesday (October 11th).
Some 96 complete and 64 partial remains were excavated from the mass grave at Krcevine, on the border with Serbia.
It is the sixth grave discovered in the area.
All the victims had been blindfolded before they were shot, experts said.
Their bodies were initially buried in the Srebrenica area but were moved to this location at the end of the conflict to hide evidence of the atrocity.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU security chief Javier Solana said Thursday (9 December) that the European Commission's (EC) Feasibility Study on Serbia-Montenegro's EU integration prospects will be finished early in 2005.
Solana met with Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic and told him that Serbia-Montenegro should continue to intensify reforms, especially those related to strengthening national institutions and the judiciary, as well as fighting corruption and organised crime.
Solana said he hopes Serbia and Montenegro will co-operate to move further along the road to the EU.
At the same time, he acknowledged the possibility of a "two-track approach", in which the EC will make separate assessments and programmes for each entity.

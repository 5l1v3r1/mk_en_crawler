TIRANA, Albania -- European Education, Training, Culture and Youth Commissioner Jan Figel wrapped up a two-day visit to Tirana on Tuesday (October 2nd).
He said Albania has made progress on its road to the EU, but that much remains to be done.
"It is up to Albania to do its fundamental homework as it is your own country and we can only support you all the way," Figel said.
He added that Albania is closer to the EU than it was even a year or two ago, as evidenced by the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA).
Meanwhile, the leader of Albania's Socialist Party, Edi Rama, headed to Brussels on Tuesday in a bid to boost prospects for the ratification of the SAA, which was signed in June 2006 but has yet to be ratified by several EU members.
Rama will hold talks with European Parliament officials and international experts on public policies.

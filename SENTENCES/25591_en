ATHENS, Greece -- Finance Minister George Papaconstantionou said on Tuesday (March 23rd) that his country wants to settle its debt crisis within the EU. 
He added, however, that Athens will not "beg" ahead of Thursday's EU summit in Brussels, where possible aid for the debt-ridden nation will be discussed. 
Papaconstantionou reiterated that his country will continue to fulfill its obligations regardless of the EU's decision. 
Government spokesman George Petalotis said seeking help from the IMF has been "put to one side" for the time being. 
The rating agency Fitch expressed doubt that EU leaders will offer aid to Greece during their Brussels summit.

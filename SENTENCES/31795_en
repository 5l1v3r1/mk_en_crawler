ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Simitis said Monday (6 January) that resolving the Cyprus issue should not be delayed. 
Failure to reach a compromise soon could damage the overall stability of the Eastern Mediterranean, Simitis warned.Greece, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU for the next six months, has vowed to seek solutions that are beneficial to both the Greek and Turkish communities on the island.
Simitis also urged all other EU members to reach a common stance on the issue of Iraq. 
Some have reservations about a possible military operation, while others, including the UK, avidly support the ouster of Saddam Hussein.

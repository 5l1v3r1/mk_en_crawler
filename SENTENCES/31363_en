ZAGREB, Croatia -- Wartime army chief Gen Janko Bobetko, hailed at home as a hero of Croatia's 1991 struggle for independence but charged with war crimes by a UN court, died Tuesday (29 April), according to his doctor.
He was 84.
Bobetko, the most senior Croatian officer to be sought by the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, was never tried due to his frail condition.
The court, which revealed his indictment in September of last year, acknowledged in February that he was too ill to stand trial.
Bobetko spent his last days at his home in Zagreb, after demanding last week to be released from hospital.

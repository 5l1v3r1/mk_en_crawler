BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister-designate Lucian Croitoru announced on Thursday (October 15th) that he intends to set up a government backed by political parties, as opposed to a technocrat or caretaker cabinet.
President Traian Basescu used his constitutional power earlier in the day to nominate Croitoru to the post, rather than approve Klaus Johannis, the candidate nominated by a coalition of opposition parties.
Croitoru said that negotiations with parties in parliament will begin soon.
Two of them, the Social Democratic Party and the National Liberal Party (PNL), wasted no time in rejecting his nomination.
PNL Chairman Crin Antonescu said Basescu acted irresponsibly in choosing Croitoru, and effectively extended the ongoing political crisis triggered earlier this week by a successful no confidence vote against Prime Minister Emil Boc's cabinet.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The sealing of an official political agreement on BiH's new defence law is scheduled for Monday (18 July).
The agreement is the work of BiH Defence Reform Commission.
The US Embassy in Sarajevo issued a statement on Friday, praising the efforts and noting that a professional and efficient military that meets NATO standards is a key condition for eventual membership in Euro-Atlantic structures.

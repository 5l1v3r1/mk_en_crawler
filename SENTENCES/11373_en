ATHENS, Greece -- The foreign ministry said Thursday (21 April) that those responsible for vandalising a Turkish flag at a Greek military school would be punished severely. 
The ministry condemned the act and vowed to find the perpetrators. 
A group of Turkish officers visiting the school found a vandalised Turkish flag, inscribed with hostile slogans, in their room. 
The incident cast a shadow over Greek Foreign Minister Petros Molyviatis's visit to Ankara.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska's ruling Serb Democratic Party (SDS) said on Monday (28 November) that it expects representatives of the Party of Democratic Progress (PDP) to leave all posts in BiH and RS institutions and public enterprises. 
On Sunday, BiH Foreign Minister and PDP leader Mladen Ivanic said his party was leaving the ruling coalition and joining the opposition. 
He cited failures in reforms and privatisation as the main reason for the move. 
The SDS has rejected Ivanic's explanation, saying the PDP is trying to cover up its own shortcomings.
Milorad Dodik, leader of the main opposition Union of Independent Social Democrats, said on Monday that the break-up of the coalition means the SDS government no longer has support, suggesting a no-confidence motion may be in store.

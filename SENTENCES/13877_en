PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- KFOR acknowledged on Tuesday (18 October) the presence of an armed group in western Kosovo but denied it is a new ethnic Albanian rebel structure.
The statement followed recent media reports of armed individuals stopping and searching vehicles at illegal checkpoints.
Meanwhile, Kosovo was a focus of discussions Tuesday during a meeting between Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic and Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker.
Juncker stressed that any future decision on Kosovo's status must not favour one side over another.

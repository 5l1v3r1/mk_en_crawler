SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH was due Friday (25 November) to formally launch negotiations with the European Commission on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the first step towards membership in the EU. 
Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and Bosnian Prime Minister Adnan Terzic will attend a ceremony marking the beginning of the negotiations. 
In an open letter addressed to the citizens of BiH on Thursday, British Ambassador to BiH Matthew Rycroft pointed to four priorities that must be tackled in the upcoming period -- the development of state institutions, implementation of police reforms, implementation of public broadcasting system legislation and co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. 
The talks are expected to last about 12 months.
In other news, the European Council decided on Thursday to prolong the EU police mission in BiH until the end of 2007. 
The mandate and size of the mission will be adjusted, refocusing on "supporting the fight against organised crime in a more proactive way and implementation of police reform", the Council statement said.

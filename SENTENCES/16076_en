SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska said on Sunday (17 September) that new passports, originally expected this month, will not be issued until the first half of 2007. 
She blamed the delay on a personnel issue at the main contractor, Germany's Giesecke & Devrient. 
The initiative is aimed at providing Macedonia's citizens with secure papers, in line with EU standards.

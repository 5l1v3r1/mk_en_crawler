PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- NATO's South Wing Commander, US Admiral Harry Ulrich, said in Pristina on Friday (February 23rd) that the Pact is very concerned after a recent violent demonstration and an attack on UN vehicles in the capital.
He warned that NATO would respond firmly to any hint of violence.
After meeting with international and Kosovo officials, Ulrich said he agreed with the assessment of the local authorities that such isolated incidents are counter-productive and destructive for Kosovo's future.
The OSCE meanwhile announced that Chairman-in-Office, Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos, plans to pay visits to Belgrade and Pristina starting on Monday.

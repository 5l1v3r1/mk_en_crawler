BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Serbian Radical Party (SRS) formally expelled its former deputy leader, Tomislav Nikolic, Friday (September 12th) along with the 17 members of parliament who joined him in forming a new parliamentary caucus, Forward Serbia.
SRS general secretary Aleksandar Vucic also resigned and is expected to officially join Nikolic's new formation shortly.
Nikolic said on Sunday he will begin talks on forming his new party Monday.
"We will work out a programme and statutes of the party.
Everything related to the party's registrations should be ready by the end of this week," he said.

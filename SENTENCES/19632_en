BELGRADE, Serbia -- The European Parliament (EP) sees Serbia as an engine of European integration for the whole region if it would display its full potential, EP Rapporteur for Serbia Jelko Kacin told the daily Novosti on Saturday (October 27th).
Asked whether the EP could demonstrate more pragmatism and lenience about co-operation with the Hague tribunal, Kacin reiterated Serbia would not sign its Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU until Ratko Mladic has been detained and extradited to The Hague.
Commenting on the EPâs criticism of Serbia's failure to tackle corruption, Kacin said it would take a long time for the judicial system to meet EU standards and the judiciary needs "new people with European experience".

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Several hundred people led by activists from the Green Action and Right of City organisations, alongside members of a Facebook group initiated by Ivan Pernar, disrupted the opening of a shopping mall in downtown Zagreb on Thursday (April 7th). 
Although the protest was billed as a peaceful action, demonstrators clashed with police who tried to stop them from entering the Cvijetni mall. 
As a result, the mall was temporarily shut down with many shoppers inside. 
Four demonstrators were arrested, including Pernar. 
The protestors say the construction process was corrupt, with private interests superseding the public's.

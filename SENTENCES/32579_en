TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament voted late Monday (3 March) to allow foreign troops and aircraft to use the country's territory and military resources in a possible operation against Iraq.
Lawmakers said while they support efforts to find a diplomatic solution, force may be required.
Parliament also said it is committed to co-operating with the international coalition against possible terror threats associated with conflict in Iraq.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria has signed a contract to supply weapons to the new Iraqi Army, according to Tsonko Kirov, a member of parliament's defence and foreign policy commission.
He would not reveal the value of the contract Monday (28 March) but said it involves AK assault rifles and pistols manufactured by plants in Sopot and Kazanluk.
In other news, a Libyan court on Tuesday started to hear an appeal by five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor sentenced to death for allegedly infecting 426 children with HIV.
Defence lawyers say the children had the virus before the nurses began working at the hospital and that purported confessions were the result of torture.
During a meeting in New York Monday with Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan vowed to work on their behalf.

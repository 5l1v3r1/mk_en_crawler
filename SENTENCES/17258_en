SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Leaders of Macedonia's main opposition parties, the Social Democratic Alliance for Macedonia and the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) -- Radmila Sekerinska and Ali Ahmeti -- did not attend Monday's (December 25th) working breakfast with government leaders and the ruling parties.
Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski expressed disappointment with their absence and accused them of deliberately undermining political dialogue in Macedonia.
For her part, Sekerinska said there was no point attending, as decisions have been made and opposition opinions would be ignored.
She reportedly was referring to a draft law that would allow Macedonians living abroad to participate in elections.
The ruling coalition prepared it without consulting with the opposition parties.
DUI said it would participate in such meetings only if representatives of the international community were present.

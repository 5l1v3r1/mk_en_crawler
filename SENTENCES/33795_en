ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), winner of Sunday's (23 November) parliamentary elections, is working to form a coalition and to rid itself of its image as a party of radical nationalists.
It is also waiting for President Stipe Mesic to hand it the mandate to form a government.
The HDZ won 62 seats in parliament and needs support from smaller parties to gain a majority of 75 seats.It has started talks with the Peasants' Party, which has nine seats and is a member of the current Social Democrat-led ruling coalition.In recent weeks, the HDZ has promised to improve relations with Serbia and has called on Serb refugees to return.
It has also pledged to work for Croatia's integration into the EU and NATO.
On Monday, OSCE election observers said the vote was generally in line with international standards, but added that some improvements could be made.

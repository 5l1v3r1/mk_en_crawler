BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Macedonian Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski met on Thursday (8 May) with senior EU and NATO officials, who assured him that the international community would not allow political or criminal elements to undermine the country's peace process.
In Brussels, he met separately with European Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten and NATO Secretary General George Robertson.
In Skopje, meanwhile, parliament rejected proposed changes to the constitution that would have legalised wiretapping as a common surveillance measure in the fight against corruption.
Supporters failed to muster the necessary two-thirds majority.
The country has been rocked by a recent wiretapping scandal.

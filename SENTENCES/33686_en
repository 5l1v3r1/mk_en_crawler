ATHENS, Greece -- A previously unknown terrorist group, calling itself "Revolutionary Struggle'', assumed responsibility for two separate bombs that exploded at the downtown Athens court complex early Friday (5 September).
The second explosion occurred 30 minutes after the first, slightly injuring one of two policemen who had rushed to the scene to investigate.
The court opened as normal, but cases in a building damaged by the bombs were temporarily transferred elsewhere within the complex.

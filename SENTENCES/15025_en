COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Police have arrested another suspect in connection with an alleged terrorist plot to attack foreign interests in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), authorities announced on Tuesday (1 November). 
The individual, who has not been identified, was one of six suspects detained last week. 
Two other members of the cell were arrested in BiH a week ago as they allegedly planned suicide bombings. 
Danish police are sending a team to Sarajevo to co-ordinate investigations.
Also Tuesday, Brcko District Public Prosecutor Zekerija Mujkanovic confirmed the arrest of three Bosnian Serbs from Bjieljina -- Kosta Kostic, Milos Milosevic and Raco Simic -- who are charged with committing war crimes against Bosniak civilians in the Brcko region in 1992. 
Bosnian Serb police detained the three on Monday.

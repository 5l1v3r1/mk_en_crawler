NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned on Friday (December 3rd) that talks on Cyprus' reunification could "founder fatally" unless a substantive agreement is reached within the next few months.
"I fear a critical window of opportunity is rapidly closing," Ban said in his latest report to the UN Security Council on the progress of the talks.
As for problematic issues that have been hindering the talks, such as the complex property issue, Ban urged Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu to draft a practical plan to overcome their differences by January, when he is scheduled to meet again with them.
He also warned against any "inflammatory statements" that could further strengthen public scepticism about the ongoing negotiations.

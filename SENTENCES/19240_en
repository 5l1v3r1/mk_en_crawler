PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci says Kosovo's path to EU integration is wide open. 
"I can say that Kosovo de facto is a candidate for the EU and NATO. 
The road has been opened and we will become members of the World Bank and the IMF," Thaci told reporters Sunday (March 30th), as he returned from an EU foreign ministers summit in Slovenia.
Stressing that EU integration is his cabinet's "new goal and new mission", he explained that Kosovo is working to meet all the criteria of a strong democratic and multi-ethnic state. 
He added that he expects all EU members to recognise Kosovo in the near future.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said on Sunday (December 7th) that talks between Belgrade and Podgorica on dual citizenship are wrapping up and an agreement should emerge soon.
"I expect a compromise agreement ...
which would recognise dual citizenship for all those who gained the right by the date of the signed agreement, while the situation with new citizenship applications should be reviewed every following year," Dacic told Beta.

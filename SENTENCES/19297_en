ZAGREB, Croatia -- The country's protected environmental fishing zone (ZERP) in the Adriatic might be restructured to resolve ongoing disputes with Slovenia and Italy, local media reported on Friday (January 25th). 
The European Commission seeks a solution that could lift restrictions on fishing, but keep environmental protections. 
Thus, the ZERP would be transformed into a protected environmental zone (ZEP), which would limit fishing activities only in case of direct threat to local ecosystems. 
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn reportedly proposed the measure. 
Opposition to the ZERP threatens to slow Croatia's accession process.

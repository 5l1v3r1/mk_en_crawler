PARIS, France -- Despite repeated warning s from Ankara, the lower house of parliament adopted a bill Thursday (October 12th) making it a crime to deny that Armenians suffered "genocide" at the hands of the Turks.
The measure still needs approval from the upper house and the president.
Turkey called the decision a "serious blow" to bilateral relations and is threatening economic sanctions.
Armenia says Ottoman Turks killed 1.5 million people systematically in 1915 -- a claim Ankara denies.
Thursday's vote triggered a series of protests in Turkey.
The EU weighed in as well, saying the measure could damage efforts to reconcile the matter through dialogue.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A joint commission of the Republika Srpska (RS) Parliament and the RS Council of Peoples reached agreement Monday (21 August) on the new entity law on higher education.
The two houses passed different versions last month.
The need to harmonise the two texts arose after the Bosniak and Croat caucuses in the Council threatened to launch a procedure to protect their vital national interests, saying the law did not guarantee equality of all constituent peoples in the management of state-run faculties in RS.

STRASBOURG, France -- Serbia will use all political and diplomatic means to protect its territorial integrity, Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said on Wednesday (February 20th).
"The internationally recognised borders of Serbia were violated" by Kosovo's unilateral independence declaration, Jeremic told a press conference in Strasbourg, where he addressed an extraordinary session of the European Parliament's foreign policy committee.
He insisted that Serbia will not accept Kosovo's accession to the UN, the Council of Europe or the OSCE and said relations between Serbia and countries that have recognised Kosovo have been permanently damaged.
On Wednesday, Britain, which was among the first to recognise Kosovo, said diplomat David Blunt will serve as UK ambassador to Kosovo.
Norway and Latvia also recognised Kosovo on Wednesday.

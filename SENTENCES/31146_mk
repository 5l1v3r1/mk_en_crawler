ANKARA, Turkey -- Eighteen Turkish Hezbollah members were released from custody Tuesday (January 4th) and Monday after a new law restricting the amount of time suspects can spend in detention awaiting their final verdicts was enforced on January 1st. 
Under the law, enacted to harmonise Turkish legislation with EU standards, suspects can be held no longer than ten years. 
Dozens of supporters of Kurdish militants took to the streets to celebrate the release of the detainees who included Hac Inan, the alleged leader of an armed Hezbollah wing known as Turkish Hezbollah. 
Another senior member of the group, Edip Gumus, was welcomed by supporters when he was released along with nine other men Monday. 
They were convicted in 2009 for killing 188 people and attempting to establish an Islamic state in the Kurdish-dominated southeast Turkey. 
They are now awaiting a ruling by an appeals court. 
Until that happens, they must report to police every week and cannot leave the country.

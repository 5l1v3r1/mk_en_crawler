PRISTINA, Kosovo -- An agreement signed on Tuesday (November 23rd) between the ministry of health and the Family Medicine Centre in Mitrovica will enable lead-contaminated members of the Roma community to receive daily decontamination therapy.
Dozens of Roma families living in camps built on the remains of the Trepca mining complex have been affected by lead.
In October, a camp in Cesmin Lug, in northern Mitrovica, was closed and the families were moved to new houses with the financial assistance of the EU and the US.
Another camp in Osterode, where Roma community members have been living in miserable conditions for ten years, is expected to close in the spring.

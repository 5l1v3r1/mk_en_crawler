ATHENS, Greece - The new parliament was sworn in on Wednesday (September 26th), ten days after snap elections were held. 
The ruling New Democracy party now has 152 seats in parliament, followed by PASOK with 102 seats, the Communist party with 22 seats, SIRIZA with 14 seats, and the nationalist formation LAOS with ten seats.
The first session started later than planned due to a meeting of PASOK lawmakers, at which party head George Papandreou requested a confidence vote. 
His rival for the post, Evangelos Venizelos, criticised the move as an attack on party unity. 
Following heated debate, PASOK's session ended without the confidence vote.

TIRANA, Albania -- Those attending an OSCE meeting in Tirana agreed Tuesday (28 January) to boost support for projects in Southeast Europe that address regional issues such as organised crime and trafficking.
The meeting, hosted by the OSCE mission in Albania, presented an opportunity for five out of the six missions in the region to exchange ideas and methodology and compare results.
It attracted representatives from the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, and the OSCE missions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo and Yugoslavia.

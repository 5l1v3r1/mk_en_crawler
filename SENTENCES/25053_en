ANKARA, Turkey -- Unrest and protests in Turkey's Kurd-dominated southeast continued on Sunday (December 27th) when eight demonstrators were injured and about a dozen others were arrested in the towns of Hakkari and Yuksekova. 
Two police officers were also reported injured. 
The unrest broke out after last week's arrests of 31 Kurdish officials over their suspected ties to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party.

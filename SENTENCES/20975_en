BELGRADE, Serbia -- The leaders of the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party of Serbia and G17 Plus agreed on Friday (November 2nd) that presidential elections will be scheduled some time after December 10th. 
Although the three leaders -- Boris Tadic, Vojislav Kostunica and Mladan Dinkic -- did not discuss a specific date, the agreement they struck guarantees that elections will not be held before the completion of negotiations on Kosovo's status.

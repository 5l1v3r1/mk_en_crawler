BUCHAREST, Romania -- Magistrates announced nationwide protests Thursday (July 9th), demanding better working conditions, adequate funding and the resignation of Justice Minister Catalin Predoiu, who halted bonuses due them to compensate for being understaffed and over-worked.
Magistrates are also threatening to block the fall presidential elections by refusing to participate in electoral committees.
Protests in several Bucharest courts began two days ago, when magistrates refused to work mornings.
Predoiu has said he has no intention of resigning.

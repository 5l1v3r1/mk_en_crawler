According to the CURS Institute survey, published on Monday (22 November), Nastase leads in the race for the presidency, with 42 per cent.
His main rival, Bucharest Mayor Traian Basescu of the opposition Truth and Justice alliance, is second with 32 per cent.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor, head of the extreme right Romania Mare party, trails with 13 per cent.
However, 30 per cent of respondents say they are undecided.

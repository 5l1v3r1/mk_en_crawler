ZAGREB, Croatia -- European Parliament (EP) Rapporteur for Croatia Hannes Swoboda and members of the EP foreign affairs committee kick off a visit to the country Monday (March 14th) for talks with Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor and members of parliament.
Earlier this month, Swoboda said that the target date for completion of Croatia's EU accession talks remains June but Zagreb needs to work harder to implement remaining reforms.
The visit comes amid anti-government protests and calls for early elections.
Kosor reiterated on Friday that she would call elections only after the government completes the accession talks.
Meanwhile, a poll conducted by Ipsos Puls agency and released at the weekend by Nova TV showed that 57% of Croats support calling snap elections immediately.
About 33% polled would prefer the government first finalise accession talks, as Kosor has said.
Almost half of the respondents, 48%, think that holding early elections would delay Croatia's EU entry by another year, while 43% say the vote would have no impact on the talks.

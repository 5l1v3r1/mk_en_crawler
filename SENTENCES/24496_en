BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government has earmarked over 1 billion euros to support the economy next year and alleviate the impact of the financial crisis on local companies, Deputy Prime Minister Mladjan Dinkic said on Tuesday (December 9th).
He added that about 590m euros will serve as state guarantees for bank loans to local industry.
Another 240m euros will fund the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and will help provide business start-up loans.
Other measures aimed at reversing the economic slowdown include stabilising prices and exchange rates, reducing public spending and bureaucracy and boosting capital investment by nearly 30%.

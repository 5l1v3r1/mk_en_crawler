SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- At least 28 defendants in war crimes trials and convicts began a hunger strike on Tuesday (January 9th), demanding more lenient sentences. 
They want BiH's courts to impose the former Yugoslavia's 15-year maximum sentence for war crimes, rather than the 40 years stipulated under Bosnian law. 
Among the striking inmates are three men charged with taking part in the Srebrenica massacre.
In other news, a Bosnian court entered a not-guilty plea for a former Bosnian Croat military police officer who refused to enter a plea on Tuesday. 
Pasko Ljubicic is accused of taking part in raids on several Muslim villages during the 1992-1995 conflict and in crimes against civilians in the Lasva valley between January and July 1993.

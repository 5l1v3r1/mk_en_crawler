BELGRADE, Serbia -- Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic says Serbia hopes to join the EU between 2012 and 2014, now that round four of technical negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) were completed on Friday (July 13th).
After the talks, Djelic said sugar trade is the only open issue.
After a final round of technical talks in September, he says a SAA could be signed in October.
In other news, Deputy Foreign Minister Milica Delevic Dilas said on Saturday that the country plans to establish a common Schengen Visa application centre, to facilitate procedures.
Instead of the standard practice that involves embassies, the visa process would be simplified and implemented in this one centre, as of next year.
Also on Saturday, Serbia handed over the remains of 11 Bosniaks, killed during the 1992-1995 conflict.
The remains were found in the Sava River and buried in two cemeteries, before being exhumed.

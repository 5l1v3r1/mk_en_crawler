BUCHAREST, Romania -- A Romanian citizen is among the UN staff members killed on Friday (April 1st) in an attack of demonstrators against the UN compound in the northern Afghan town of Mazar-i-Sharif, Romania's foreign ministry confirmed on Saturday.
The riot was spurred by a recent burning of a Koran at a Florida church.
Among the victims were at least seven UN workers.
Romanian President Traian Basescu expressed his condolences to the families of the victims.

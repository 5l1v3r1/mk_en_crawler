ROME, Italy -- Police on Monday (December 27th) defused a parcel bomb found at the Greek Embassy in Rome. 
Suspicious packages turned up in several other embassies, including Albania's, but no bombs were found in them. 
The device at the Greek embassy was similar to the ones that injured two employees at the Swiss and Chilean embassies in Rome last week. 
An Italian anarchist group calling itself Informal Anarchist Federation has claimed responsibility for those.
According to media reports, two suspected members of a Greek extremist organisation travelled to Italy over the past several months and were in contact with Italian anarchists.

DIYARBAKIR, Turkey -- The pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) has denounced the blast that killed ten people and injured 17 in Diyarbakir last week. 
On Friday (15 September), local media quoted the leader of the Diyarbakir DTP branch, Salih Karaaslan, as condemning the incident. 
The DTP earlier this month called on the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) to halt its armed campaign and observe a unilateral ceasefire.
Meanwhile, Istanbul police say they smashed a small group that was blackmailing local businessmen on behalf of the PKK. 
Police believe the group demanded over 50,000 euros from each, making death threats against those who refused to pay.

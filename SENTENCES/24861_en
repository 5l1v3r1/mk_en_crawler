ZAGREB, Croatia -- The defence ministry announced on Thursday (July 2nd) that Croatia is joining NATO's forces in Kosovo, deploying a unit of 20 military officers and two helicopters.
This marks the first NATO operation in the Balkans for Croatia, which joined the Alliance in April.
Last month, NATO authorised the gradual reduction of its forces in Kosovo, which currently number 14,000 personnel.

ANKARA, Turkey -- In response to severe drought conditions, Mayor Melih Gokcek imposed tough restrictions on residents Thursday (August 2nd) -- two days with water, then two days without -- to conserve what little is left in reservoirs.
Gokcek also asked residents to take longer holidays outside the city, in order to stretch limited water supplies in the capital.
Meanwhile, a report published on Thursday by the European Commission concludes that wildfires that ravaged southern Europe last month -- triggered by extremely high temperatures -- were among the worst on record.
The amount of land burned through July is nearly as much as in all of 2006.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- High Representative to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Valentin Inzko on Tuesday (January 26th) urged the EU to take seriously ongoing challenges in the country.
The EU, including the European Parliament (EP), needs to be proactive to reverse recent political trends toward fragmentation, Inzko told the EP's Western Balkans Working Group.
He reiterated that BiH is at a stalemate with no major reforms implemented recently.
Inzko also criticised attempts to challenge state institutions and his powers, as is happening in Republika Srpska (RS).
The entity's parliament approved a draft law Tuesday on holding referendums and other initiatives.
The law spells out procedures and responsibilities of the various institutions.
RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik called for a referendum next month.
He wants to see if citizens support the 1995 Dayton Peace Accord, which gives the high representative sweeping powers.
Dodik has also threatened to eventually hold a referendum on seceding from BiH.

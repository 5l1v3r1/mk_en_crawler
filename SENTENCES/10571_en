ATHENS, Greece -- The government's council for foreign affairs and defence convenes Monday (13 September) to decide on the dismissal of Air Force General Staff Chief Panayotis Papanikolaou.
He was asked to submit his resignation Sunday over delays in launching a search and rescue operation following a helicopter crash in the Aegean Sea that killed the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria Petros VII and 16 others.
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis says Defence Minister Spilios Spiliotopoulos also tendered his resignation, but it was rejected.

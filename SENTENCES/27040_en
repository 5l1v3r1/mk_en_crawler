BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Wednesday (September 2nd) that Croatia could wrap up its accession talks with Brussels in the first six months of 2010 if it resolves its border dispute with Slovenia and implements the necessary reforms. 
Rehn told the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee that Zagreb must also fully co-operate with The Hague war crimes tribunal.

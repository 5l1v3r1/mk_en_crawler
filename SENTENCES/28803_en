PRISTINA, Kosovo -- International Civilian Office head Pieter Feith said on Saturday (October 9th) parliament could be dissolved by the end of the year, in the wake of President Fatmir Sejdiu's resignation last month.
"As soon as the assembly's autumn season is over, the assembly is dissolved, and then there are 45 days provided by the constitution until the elections are organised," Feith said.
This marked the first time he'd brought up the issue of dissolving parliament before early elections take place.
Analysts say Sunday February 13th could be Election Day.
An official announcement is expected from acting President Jakup Krasniqi this week.

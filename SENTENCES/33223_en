BUCHARST, Romania -- The ruling Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSD) won eight mayoral races in Sunday's (11 May) partial local elections, which took place only in small towns and villages. 
Total turnout was 56.5 per cent. 
Twelve other races will be held next Sunday. 
The Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania won in two settlements.
On Monday, PSD leaders said the party would draft proposals to amend the electoral law, aiming to introduce direct votes for members of the Senate. 
PSD says the changes would increase voter turnout.

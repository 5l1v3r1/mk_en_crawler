ISTANBUL, Turkey -- The trial against 19 people charged in the murder of Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink resumed on Monday (February 11th) in Istanbul.
The court hearing, which was closed to the media due to the age of the primary suspect, 18-year-old Ogun Samast, took place amid heavy security.
Dink, 53, was gunned down in front of his Agos newspaper offices in Istanbul in January 2007.
Samast was arrested shortly afterward in the town of Samsun, where he confessed to the murder, saying he was responding to politically contentious stories by Dink.
Hundreds of people, including intellectuals and politicians, protested around the court Monday demanding justice and transparency.
In other news, the additional one-month period given to the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) to prepare its defence in its closure trial ended on Monday.
The Chief Prosecutor's Office of the Supreme Court of Appeals filed charges against the DTP late last year for opposing "the indivisible integrity of the state and the nation" and called for the party's "permanent closure".

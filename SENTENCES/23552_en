SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), the senior ruling coalition partner, officially proposed on Tuesday (March 24th) that general elections take place on July 5th.
However, it would require cutting the campaign period from 30 days to three weeks.
That way, the two campaigns -- for European and national parliament -- will not coincide.
If parliament rejects shortening the campaign season, the general elections would likely be delayed a week, until July 12th.
Meanwhile, leaders of the BSP and its major rival in the elections, Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), squared off in a public debate that aired Tuesday night on state TV.
The focus was economic policy and measures to deal with the global economic crisis.

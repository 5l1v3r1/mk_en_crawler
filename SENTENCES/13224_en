TIRANA, Albania -- During a visit Wednesday (22 February), Dutch Foreign Minister Bernard Bot stressed that his country expects Tirana to meet the conditions set in the recently sealed Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
After meeting with Albanian President Alfred Moisiu, Bot praised the signing of the SAA, saying that the Union kept its promises and now it is Albania's turn to make good on pledged reforms.
These include strengthening the fight against corruption and organised crime, restructuring the judicial sector and boosting freedom of speech.
In other news Wednesday, the ruling Democratic Party managed to defeat a no-confidence motion the opposition Socialist Party had filed against Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli for alleged procedural violations.
Many of the opposition lawmakers ended up boycotting the vote themselves, because the secret ballot they had requested was not used.
Also Wednesday, chairman of the Central Election Commission Ilirian Celibashi warned again of the impact of delayed electoral reforms.
Despite pledges made to the international community, a parliamentary committee in charge of reforms has not yet started work.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis proposed on Monday (November 19th) that the EU offer candidate status to all countries in the Western Balkans.
She introduced a five-point plan at a meeting of the Union's External Relations Council meeting in Brussels.
The proposal, which covers Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia, recommends the initialling of Stabilisation and Association Agreements between each country and the EU.
Bakoyannis also suggested that all countries be given dates for the beginning of pre-accession talks, once they commit to observing the principles of neighbourly relations, and then receive candidate status by next fall.
She proposed the eventual lifting of visa restrictions on citizens of these countries, allowing travel within the EU.
Additionally, she suggested supplementary financing for these countries.

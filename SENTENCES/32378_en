BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The German government announced on Thursday (27 March) that it has decided to increase aid and assistance to Serbia to help bolster stability in the aftermath of Zoran Djindjic's assassination, offering 40m euros instead of 30m. 
Berlin has also decided to provide 25m euros in additional assistance and a further 30m in loans. 
German Development Aid Minister Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul announced the new assistance package after talks with Serbian officials in Belgrade, saying the aid demonstrates "support for Serbia's new government in its efforts to join Europe".

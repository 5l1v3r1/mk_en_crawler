SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling opposes holding an international conference on BiH's future, an idea proposed recently by Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader.
In an interview published on Tuesday (8 August) in the Sarajevo daily Dnevni avaz, Schwarz-Schilling said the country's problems must be solved by its own politicians, though with assistance from the international community.
He also said he and Sanader had never discussed the idea of a conference.
In other news Monday, the Office of the High Representative (OHR) announced that the head of the OHR in Banja Luka, Graham Day, resigned last week due to "irreconcilable differences" over management issues.
A replacement is being sought.

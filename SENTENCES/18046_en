BERLIN, Germany -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn urged Turkey to step up reforms after Sunday's (July 22nd) parliamentary vote, in an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt published on Tuesday.
Rehn said the country needs a fresh effort to revive its EU integration process, stalled since last year, when the EU froze negotiations on eight of the 35 chapters of the acquis, due to Turkey's trade and customs problems with Cyprus.
Early parliamentary elections were scheduled after the previous legislature failed to elect a new president for the country and had to be dissolved.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was quoted on Tuesday as saying he would pull out of politics if his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) fails to form a single-party government after the elections.
In other news, three people have been arrested in connection with the murder of an independent candidate for parliament.
A gunman fired at the car carrying businessman Tuncay Seyranlioglu, 42, after a TV appearance Monday evening.
Three other people in the vehicle were wounded.

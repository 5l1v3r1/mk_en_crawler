SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Officials say Bulgaria and the IMF are close to concluding a new stand-by agreement.
On Monday (5 July), Finance Minister Milen Velchev said the two sides have already agreed on a memorandum of understanding about Bulgaria's economic policy prior to its EU accession in 2007.
Hans Flickenschild, the chief of the Fund's mission to Bulgaria, said the IMF board of directors would examine the agreement on 6 August.
In other news, Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov has begun consulting with all parliamentary parties about the date of the next parliamentary elections.
He also noted that any changes to election law must be adopted at least six months before the vote.

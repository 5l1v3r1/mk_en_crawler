TIRANA, Albania -- By an overwhelming margin, parliament passed a series of constitutional amendments late Monday (April 21st). 
The vote was 115 to 17, with three abstentions. 
Prime Minister Sali Berisha told lawmakers the reforms will avert a crisis in the country's political system. 
With the changes, the electoral system becomes a regional proportional one; the president is elected by a majority of votes -- 70+1 -- in parliament, and the general prosecutor becomes subject to a five-year term limit. 
President Bamir Topi criticised the changes Monday, saying implementation will take time.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul says the NATO summit in Istanbul will go ahead as planned, and reiterated Turkey's commitment to ensuring security for the event.
His comments followed a pair of blasts Thursday (24 June).
One took place aboard a bus in Istanbul;
four people were killed, including the bomber.
The other blast was in Ankara, near the hotel at which some heads of state, including US President George W. Bush, plan to stay ahead of the summit, which begins Monday.
Meanwhile, in an interview with the local station NTV, Bush said the United States would work with the governments of Turkey and Iraq against the separatist Kurdish Workers Party.
Bush said he would discuss the matter with officials in Ankara at the weekend.

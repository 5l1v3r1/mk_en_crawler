SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The opposition Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) and the Movement for Rights and Freedom (MRF) are talking about broadening their partnership beyond the upcoming mayoral race in Kardzhali, a town with a predominantly Turkish ethnic population, Dnevnik quoted officials from both parties as saying on Thursday (August 16th). 
Even though the two parties are opponents at the national level, UDF chairman Plamen Yurokov said, this shouldn't be an issue at the local level.
For its part, MRF praised the idea, saying it is trying very hard to move beyond its image as an ethnic party.

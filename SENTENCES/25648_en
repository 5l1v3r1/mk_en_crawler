ZAGREB, Croatia -- It took years, but convicted war criminal Milan Spanovic is back behind bars in Croatia.
The Serb was taken late Wednesday (August 19th) to a prison in the town of Sisak, after being extradited by the UK.
He had fled there in 1998.
A Croatian court subsequently sentenced him -- in absentia -- to 20 years in prison for war crimes committed against civilians around Glina in August 1991.
Spanovic was found guilty of murder, torture, pillaging and arson.
He lived in the UK for eight years before an unrelated arrest in 2006 brought his identity to the attention of the courts.

PARIS, France -- Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux said on Thursday (August 12th) that authorities have dismantled more than 40 camps of Roma immigrants since announcing a crackdown two weeks ago.
Hortefeux says about 700 Roma have been sent to Romania and Bulgaria -- " back to their countries of origin" -- on special chartered flights.
The crackdown on a total of about 300 Roma camps was announced on July 28th, after President Nicolas Sarkozy said the minority poses security "problems".

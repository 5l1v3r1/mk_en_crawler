BELGRADE, Serbia -- Twelve NGOs from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia have urged UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to appoint David Tolbert, deputy chief prosecutor of the UN tribunal, to succeed chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte, when her term expires in September. 
The Belgrade-based Fund for Humanitarian Law, one of the signatories of a joint letter sent to Ban last week, announced the move Monday (June 25th). 
The NGOs say Tolbert, of the United States, enjoys a strong level of trust in the former Yugoslav republics and has the experience and skills to guarantee effective prosecutions.

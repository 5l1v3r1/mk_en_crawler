BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Adrian Nastase on Thursday (9 December) praised the technical conclusion of accession talks between Romania and the EU.
Nastase described the outcome as a success for politicians, the government and its negotiating team, as well as for all Romanians.
For his part, President Ion Iliescu said completing the talks marks an extremely important moment on Romania's path to European and Euro-Atlantic integration.
The opposition Justice and Truth alliance, however, says the EU moved prematurely to wrap up the talks with Romania, and that the country is currently unable to meet the conditions set forth in accession talks.

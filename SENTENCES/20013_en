ANKARA, Turkey -- Voters overwhelmingly supported several amendments to the constitution proposed by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in a referendum Sunday (October 21st).
Just over 69% backed the draft that would have voters elect the president, rather than parliament.
Just under 31% opposed it.
Turnout was 67.5%, far higher than expected.
The package of reforms includes provisions that would allow the president to serve two five-year terms instead of the current single seven-year term.
Parliaments and governments will sit for four years instead of five.
Some experts, including the head of Turkey's Electoral Council, Muammer Aydin, have said that the amendments could force recently elected President Abdullah Gul to seek re-election and might make it necessary to reduce the tenure of the current parliament by a year.

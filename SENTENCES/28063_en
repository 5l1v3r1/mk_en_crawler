NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Local authorities announced on Tuesday (June 22nd) they have intercepted a vessel transporting military equipment believed to have been destined for Sudan, where an EU and NATO arms embargo is active. 
The ship, sailing under the Antigua and Barbuda flag, has remained in Cypriot waters at the Limassol port since June 11th. 
Its documents suggested it had sailed from Norway, passing through Germany and Spain. 
Local press reports suggest the ship, loaded with tanks and explosives, was blocked after a tipoff from the United States. 
However, the US Embassy in Nicosia says its country was not involved.

ATHENS, Greece -- Greece and Macedonia agreed on Wednesday (December 5th) to hold a new round of talks on their dispute about the official name of Macedonia. 
UN special envoy Matthew Nimetz brokered the agreement. 
Rather than in New York, the talks would take place in Skopje next month, with a possible follow-up meeting later in Athens. 
After talks with Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis in Athens, Nimetz said his goal was to edge the positions of the two sides closer in the next few months. 
Greece objects to the official name of its neighbour as the Republic of Macedonia because it sees it as an implied claim regarding its own ancient province of Macedonia. 
Athens is now threatening to block Skopje's accession to NATO and the EU if the issue is not resolved. 
NATO decides in April 2008 whether to invite Macedonia to become a member.

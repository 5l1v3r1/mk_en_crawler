ZAGREB, Croatia -- Finance ministry representatives failed to talk trade unions into accepting planned wage cuts in the public sector on Saturday (March 14th). 
The meeting was focused on the 2009 budget revision, which assumes considerable spending cuts to keep the deficit under control and on securing more funds for development projects to offset the negative effects of the economic crisis. 
The unions rejected the proposed wage cuts, insisting that the 240,000 government employees should not bear the brunt of the economic slowdown. 
They also called for more comprehensive austerity measures.

Albania has not met the conditions agreed on a year ago, according to the European Commission's (EC) May report on the visa liberalisation process. 
Moreover, its findings suggest the country will not be able to secure visa-free travel this year.
"I think it is more realistic to think that the [visa] criteria will be fulfilled in 2010, not in 2009," said Helmut Lohan, head of the EC delegation in Tirana.
Document security is one of the main sticking points. 
Biometric passports are "indispensable for having a visa-free regime with the EU countries," EC Vice-President Jacques Barrot said during a visit to Tirana on May 2nd.
Albania began issuing such passports in April, but the process has been slow. 
Citizens are more preoccupied with getting the election ID cards required for them to vote in parliamentary elections scheduled for June 28th.
Lack of secure documents is not the only hurdle keeping the country off the Schengen white list, however. 
Inadequate control of borders and migration are also top concerns.
In all, Albania received low marks for reform implementation, which covers the documents issue, migration, public order and security, external relations and fundamental rights.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha has said visa liberalisation is his country's number two priority, after NATO membership. 
In comments aired June 5th by TV Klan, he pledged visa-free travel by the end of his Democratic Party's second mandate in office -- assuming the party triumphs in the upcoming vote.
Opposition politicians have blasted the government's failure to meet the EU benchmarks, but the Berisha administration insists significant progress has been made.
Albania and EU signed a deal in January 2008 that aims to facilitate travel for students, athletes and businessmen. 
For the prospect of travelling freely to Europe, however, it appears Albanians will have to wait.

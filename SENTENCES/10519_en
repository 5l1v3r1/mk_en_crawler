ZAGREB, Croatia -- The UN tribunal said Friday (15 October) its investigators want to question former Macedonian Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski in connection with the killing of six Pakistanis and an Indian by Macedonian police in 2002.
At the time, Boskovski's ministry claimed the men were Islamic terrorists, but authorities admitted in 2004 that they were actually illegal immigrants making their way to the West.
The former minister has Croatian citizenship and was arrested in Zagreb under a judicial co-operation agreement between Croatia and Macedonia.

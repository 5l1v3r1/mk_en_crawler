TIRANA, Albania -- Relations between the government and the IMF are "brilliant", according to Finance Minster Kastriot Islami. 
He said Saturday (25 January) that he believes the Fund's decision to postpone discussions on an agreement with Albania "does not hurt government and it also identifies political difficulties", especially in carrying out reforms to prevent fiscal evasion and trafficking. 
Islami also linked the month-long postponement to the date for approval by parliament of a law regulating the closure of duty free shops. 
Jan-Peter Olters, the IMF resident representative to Albania, confirmed that relations with Tirana have not been affected and that co-operation with the government continues.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic said in an interview on Sunday (February 4th) that his country should go to the UN demanding changes to special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for the future of Kosovo.
In particular, he said, Belgrade should demand an amendment that calls for Kosovo to remain part of Serbian territory.
President Boris Tadic, meanwhile, summoned Serbia's top leaders for a meeting Monday to plot the country's future strategy on Kosovo.
In the province, Serb leaders announced on Sunday that they plan to stage protests against the Ahtisaari plan.
There were also calls for a referendum on the blueprint.

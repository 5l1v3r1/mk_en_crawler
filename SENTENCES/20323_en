ANKARA, Turkey -- Deniz Baykal, leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party, said Wednesday (September 12th) that a coup is no solution to ongoing concerns.
Marking the 27th anniversary of the last full-blown army coup in Turkey, Baykal told the Radikal daily that nowadays "both democracy and the republic, which gave birth to it, are experiencing problems.
We are in a worrying process â¦ but a military coup is not the answer".
The solution lies in the hands of politicians "standing up for democracy and the republic", he added.
The 1980 coup ousted the government of Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel and resulted in the suspension of parliament.

WASHINGTON, United States -- Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Rosemary DiCarlo says the current process of determining Kosovo's final status is in no way aimed at punishing the incumbent Serbian government for totalitarian policies in the 1990s.
During a State Department-hosted web chat last week on US policy on Southeast Europe, DiCarlo noted that UN Security Council Resolution 1244 specifically urged a political process to resolve the Kosovo status problem.
In other news, UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen visits Belgrade Tuesday (14 March) for talks with Serbian President Boris Tadic.
The focus will be on the situation in Kosovo and further steps in status negotiations.
During a visit to Belgrade on Monday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Ferenc Somogyi reaffirmed his country's support for Serbia-Montenegro's EU aspirations.
Talking to Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, he added that Budapest believes resolving Kosovo's final status must contribute to the stability of the entire region.
From Belgrade, Somogyi travelled to Podgorica to discuss the May independence referendum.

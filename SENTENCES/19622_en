SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) decided on Sunday (March 23rd) to return to the government, ten days after announcing its departure.
The decision was made during a meeting between DPA leader Menduh Thaci and Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski.
All DPA ministers will resume their duties with the exception of Deputy Prime Minister Imer Aliu.
"DPA and VMRO-DPMNE agreed to form working groups that will work to find a solution to adopt a law on the use of languages according to the constitution and the existing legislation, as well as in accordance with the Ohrid Framework Agreement.
The parties will also hold discussions ...
related to the victims of the 2001 conflict in accordance with the legislation, as well as on a law on the use of flags, according to the constitution," the DPA announced.
The party had insisted its views on these issues were being ignored.
With Macedonia still hoping to receive an invitation at the NATO summit in April, officials in the country have been calling for unity.

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- The former head of the Yugoslav secret police was convicted for covering up the murder of four members of the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO). 
After 7 months of proceedings, a court in Belgrade on Thursday (30 January) sentenced Radomir Markovic to seven years in jail. 
Markovic was originally charged with staging the car accident in which Vuk Draskovic, then leader of SPO - adamant opponents of Slobodan Milosevic - was injured and four others killed. 
The court threw out these charges and convicted Markovic of trying to cover up the incident. 
The accident involved a car crash with a secret service truck in October 1999. 
Nenad Ilic and Nenad Bujosevic, the agents who were in the truck, were sentenced to 15 years in prison each for murder. 
Markovic's sentencing had to be adjourned because of protests by relatives of the victims who were outraged by the ruling. 
The judge later pronounced the sentence in closed chambers.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- More than 5,000 people gathered on Saturday (June 16th) in the northern BiH district of Brcko for the funeral of 80 people killed there in 1992, at the beginning of the conflict.
The victims, 77 Bosnian Muslims and three Bosnian Croats, were killed soon after Bosnian Serb troops captured the town and launched an ethnic cleansing campaign.
The victims were identified by DNA tests after being exhumed from a mass grave in Gorica last year.
In other news, Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble arrived on Sunday for a two-day visit to BiH.
The aim of the trip is to exchange experiences with the International Commission for Missing Persons, whose expertise was crucial, for example, when the tsunami of December 2004 struck Asia.

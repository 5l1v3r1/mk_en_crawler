ATHENS, Greece -- Defence Minister Yannos Papantoniou said Monday (20 October) that Greece plans to close all barracks on its northern border, since the threat there no longer exists. 
Troops would be transferred to the eastern border with Turkey, bringing troop strength up to 100 per cent. 
Only small military units, specialised in preventing illegal immigration, would remain at the northern border.

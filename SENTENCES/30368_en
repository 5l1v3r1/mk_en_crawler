SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The state prosecutor's office announced on Saturday (February 19th) it has filed charges against Veselin Vlahovic, known as the "Monster of Grbavica", for war crimes committed against Bosniaks and Croats in Sarajevo in 1992 and 1993.
As a member of a paramilitary group, Vlahovic allegedly took part in murders, rapes, illegal detention and torture of non-Serb civilians.
Prosecutors plan to call more than 100 people to testify.
Vlahovic was arrested in Spain last March and was handed over to Bosnian authorities in August.

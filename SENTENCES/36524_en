LONDON, United Kingdom -- Slovenia's European Commissioner, Janez Potocnik, has called on the EU to conclude Stabilisation and Association Agreements (SAA) with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia-Montenegro during the next two years.
In a statement to the London press, Potocnik said the Union should go forward with the integration of Western Balkan countries, despite the problems they have encountered with organised crime and corruption.
Successfully concluding the SAAs would help finalise the process of reforms and Europeanisation, he said.

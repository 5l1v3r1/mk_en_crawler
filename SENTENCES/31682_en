PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- In an interview with the Pristina daily <I>Koha Ditore</I> on Sunday (12 January), EU security chief Javier Solana made it clear that any unilateral moves to determine the status of Kosovo would fail.
Solana reiterated that the status of the province would be set only in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244.
The province must meet standards set by UNMIK before eyeing a more concrete resolution of status.

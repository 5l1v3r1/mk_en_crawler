SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Following more than six months of deadlock, talks between the Serb Orthodox Church (SOC) and the Macedonian Orthodox Church (MOC) are expected to resume in late March, according to MOC spokesman Bishop Timotei.
MOC is not recognised by synods in the region.
Negotiations were frozen last year after unrest caused by the arrests of SOC-installed church officials in Macedonia.
Speaking Tuesday (1 March), Timotei said the biggest problems relate to church autonomy.

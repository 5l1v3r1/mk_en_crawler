ATHENS, Greece -- Since nearly half of the estimated one million immigrants to Greece entered the country illegally, the government is considering whether to extend the deadline in the legalisation process beyond the end of this year.
Interior Minister Prokopis Pavlopoulos also told parliament on Thursday (17 November) that the cabinet is looking at the possibility of giving immigrants the right to vote.

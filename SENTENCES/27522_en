THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj has asked The Hague war crimes tribunal to be temporary released during the upcoming holidays break for family reasons, media reported on Friday (November 26th).
In the motion, his defence team says there is no risk of Haradinaj escaping or exerting influence on witnesses.
He is seeking release from December 17th - January 14th, as his wife will give birth in mid-January.
Haradinaj is in custody at The Hague's Detention Unit, awaiting retrial on charges of murder, torture and cruel treatment of Serbs, Roma and Albanians during the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict.

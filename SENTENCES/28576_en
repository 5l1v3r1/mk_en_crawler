SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini visited Sarajevo on Tuesday (April 13th), saying he believes the European Commission (EC) is close to scrapping EU visas for BiH citizens. 
He added visa liberalisation might be formally announced at the June 2nd EU-Balkan summit in Sarajevo. 
After meeting with members of the tripartite presidency, Frattini said BiH has met all conditions, making the issue largely technical at this point. 
In November 2009, the EU decided to lift visa requirements for citizens of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, but stopped short of doing the same for BiH and Albania, due to their failure to implement all necessary reforms.

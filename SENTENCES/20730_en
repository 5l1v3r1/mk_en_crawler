TREBINJE, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Meeting with local authorities in Trebinje on Tuesday (August 7th), High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said police reform is only a technical issue, unnecessarily being complicated by politics and speculation. 
He also denied rumours that police restructuring would dismantle the Republika Srprska (RS) police or the entity itself. 
Lajcak has set an end of September deadline for agreement on stalled reforms, in order to initial a Stabilisation and Association agreement with the EU this year.
Also Tuesday, Lajcak said he had noted improvement in the work of the BiH Security Ministry and urged Minister Tarik Sadovic to ensure this progress is maintained. 
A couple of weeks ago, Ljacak called Sadovic into his office, over some controversial remarks Sadovic had made to the media.
Separately Tuesday, the head of the BiH border police authority, Radisha Samardzija, said border control had improved in the past six months, largely due to improved co-operation with the Interior Ministry.

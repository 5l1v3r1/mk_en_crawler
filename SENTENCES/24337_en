ATHENS, Greece -- The extremist group Revolutionary Fight claimed responsibility Wednesday (March 11th) for twice targeting a Citibank branch near Athens recently.
A bomb exploded on Monday outside a Citibank office in the Athens suburb of Kifissia, causing damage but no injuries.
Bomb experts defused a device outside the same office on February 18th.
No one claimed immediate responsibility for that incident, though police suspected Revolutionary Fight.
In other news Wednesday, President Karolos Papoulias urged about 50 seasonal workers from the culture ministry, who have been on strike demanding permanent jobs and several months' worth of back pay, to stop their action.
The strike has caused the Acropolis museum to close for the fifth time in the past two weeks.
"I completely understand the demands of the protestors, but it is unimaginable for me that this sacred place, the Acropolis, could be closed," Papoulias said, adding there were other ways to protest.
In all, about 670 seasonal workers with the ministry, whose contracts the ministry refused to renew, have filed a complaint in court.

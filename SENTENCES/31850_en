PALE, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR troops Thursday (2 January) searched the premises of a Pale-based radio station owned by Radovan Karadzic's daughter, Sonja.
About 30 US, Italian, and French troops spent some three hours on the premises of Sveti Jovan Radio in what a SFOR spokesman described as a "routine unscheduled inspection".
The peacekeepers have a mandate to check local radio and TV stations to verify that they do not use frequencies carrying SFOR communications.
The spokesman said the inspection was unrelated to the search for Radovan Karadzic.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Acting President Jakup Krasniqi will propose February 2011 as the date for holding early general elections, Koha Ditore daily reported on Saturday (October 2nd).
The announcement is expected in the coming days, the daily said, adding the possible dates are the 6th or 13th.
The possibility of snap elections emerged after last week's resignation of President Fatmir Sejdiu.
He stepped down after the Constitutional Court ruled that he should not have been serving as LDK leader and president at the same time.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- An investigation began on Monday (March 16th) of three former Yugoslav National Army pilots suspected of war crimes. 
Zoran Slavuljica, Asim Pandzic and Midorag Atanackovic are undergoing investigation in connection with the fighting in Dubrovnik in 1991. 
Montenegrin prosecutors initiated the investigation based on a 2007 co-operation agreement with their Croatian counterparts.
On Tuesday meanwhile, The Hague war crimes tribunal is expected to rule on the appeal filed by former Republika Srpska President Momcilo Krajisnik. 
He received a 27-year prison sentence in 2006 for persecuting non-Serb civilians during the conflict in BiH. 
The court, though, acquitted him of genocide charges.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU's Justice and Home Affairs Council on Thursday (February 24th) discussed the so-called post-visa liberalisation mechanism for the Western Balkans countries and decided against making changes to the current situations. 
Still, they noted the European Commission-established mechanism, which could be enforced as an early warning system "in case of a massive influx of asylum applicants". 
A detailed report on the situation will be presented in June. 
Serbia, meanwhile, on Thursday established a commission to monitor the EU visa-free regime, dealing with issues related to fake asylum seekers.
During the same session, the EU ministers approved a readmission agreement with Turkey, which means that illegal migrants who have entered the bloc via Turkey will be returned to their country of entry. 
The deal will not be applied to political asylum seekers. 
Its approval is significant, signalling that the EU could start visa dialogue with Turkey. 
The agreement requires formal approval by Ankara.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- US Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Daniel Fried suggested on Wednesday (May 16th) that the United States would not make any unilateral move regarding the recognition of Kosovo's independence. 
Speaking to reporters at NATO Headquarters, Fried said that any steps towards independence without a new UN Security Council resolution would be risky. 
Although the latest talks between the United States and Russia failed to overcome the differences on the province's future, Fried said Washington would continue to work for a UN resolution.

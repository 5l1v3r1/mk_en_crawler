SOFIA, Bulgaria -- At an international energy forum Monday (March 12th), representatives of Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia and Serbia issued a joint declaration asking the EU to allow the re-opening of two older reactors at Bulgaria's Kozloduy nuclear plant.
They were decommissioned at the beginning of the year in line with the country's accession obligations, though Bulgaria supplies energy to much of the region.
In response, Michael Humphreys, the head of the EC Delegation to Sofia, said turning the units back on would be "out of the question".
He stressed that such changes to the EU accession contract are unacceptable.

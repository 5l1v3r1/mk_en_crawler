BUCHAREST, Romania -- The European Commission's (EC) next report on Romania -- due for release in October -- may finally recognise the country as a functioning market economy -- a key step in Romania's EU accession.
Media reports in Bucharest Thursday (16 September) cited representatives of the EC delegation to Bucharest as saying the Romanian economy might receive functioning market status because of its macroeconomic stability.

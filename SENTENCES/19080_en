SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Customs authorities prevented a heroin trafficking attempt at the Gyueshevo border crossing with Macedonia late last week, according to a weekend announcement from the regional customs office in Kyustendil.
The drugs were found with two passengers, Serb citizens of ethnic Albanian origin, in a bus travelling from Turkey to Macedonia.
The market value was estimated at over 500,000 euros.
The two men and the bus driver, a Turkish citizen, have been charged.
In neighbouring Serbia, border police in Dimitrovgrad seized nearly 5kg of heroin Sunday, hidden in a compartment in the international passenger train from Istanbul to Belgrade.
One Serbian citizen was arrested.
In Albania meanwhile, police confiscated 22 Turkish-made guns from a private car in Durres, after a tip involving suspected weapon trafficking.
Two Albanian nationals were apprehended.

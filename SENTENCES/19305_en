SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski praised the government of Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski on Tuesday (August 28th) saying it has boosted public optimism regarding the future.
However, he added, it has not followed through with needed reforms.
Assessing its first year in power, Crvenkovski said this government has demonstrated "higher discipline in the financial sphere and better order in some other areas", including the fight against crime and corruption.
But he criticised the authorities for slow progress in judicial reforms and accused them of "indulging in populism".

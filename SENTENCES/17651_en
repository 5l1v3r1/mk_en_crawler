TIRANA, Albania -- The leader of the Socialist Party, Edi Rama, sent a letter Monday (March 26th) to Prime Minister Sali Berisha, head of the ruling Democratic Party, proposing a roundtable discussion on key reforms.
Recalling the political deadlock that nearly derailed last month's municipal elections, Rama stressed that the main parties must launch a new phase of political dialogue and co-operation and join forces to implement reforms crucial to the country's Euro-Atlantic integration bid.
Rama also hinted that if Berisha rejects the invitation, the opposition would pursue early parliamentary elections.
In other news Monday, the Foreign Ministry announced that the Swedish Parliament has ratified Albania's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
Sweden is the fifth EU member state to do so.

TALLINN, Estonia -- The foreign and defence ministers of the three Baltic and three Adriatic Charter countries reiterated their commitment to continued co-operation in the NATO enlargement process, following a summit in Tallinn, Estonia, on Tuesday (February 6th).
Despite positive messages regarding future membership offered at the NATO summit in Riga last November, the Adriatic Charter countries -- Albania, Croatia and Macedonia -- must work hard and complete their reform agendas, the ministers agreed.
Judicial and police reform, as well as the fight against corruption and organised crime, were highlighted as crucial areas demanding attention.
The foreign and defence ministers of the three new Partnership for Peace member countries -- Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina -- also participated in the summit, as did US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Rosemary DiCarlo.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- A Bucharest court on Monday (June 15th) sentenced state secretary Emilian Cutean to 5 years in prison on charges of corruption and misappropriation of state funds.
Cutean headed the State Secretariat for Revolutionaries' Affairs -- a government body in charge of giving financial support to people who took part in the 1989 anti-communist revolution.
The court found him guilty of abusing his office by authorising a payment of about 85,000 euros in 2004 to an NGO that he chaired.

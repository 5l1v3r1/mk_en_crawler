BELGRADE, Serbia -- Justice Minister Dusan Petrovic sent an official request to Russia Thursday (February 28th) seeking the extradition of late Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic's wife and son.
The ministry said it decided to make the move since the whereabouts of Mira Markovic and Marko Milosevic are well known.
Earlier this year, Russia confirmed it had granted the pair asylum status, making extradition unlikely.
Marko Milosevic has lived in Russia since 2000.
His mother joined him three years later, after being investigated for embezzlement in Serbia.
Last year, authorities issued an international arrest warrant for both of them, in connection with an international cigarette smuggling ring.

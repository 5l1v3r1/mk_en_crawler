BUCHAREST, Romania -- The country's chief negotiator with the EU, Vasile Puscas, said Friday (18 July) that Romania's objective is to close EU entry negotiations next year.
He said this deadline would allow authorities to prepare a draft accession treaty in late 2004 and possibly initial the treaty in early 2005.
The 25 EU states would thus have a year and half to ratify the treaty and decide to accept the country as of 1 January, 2007.

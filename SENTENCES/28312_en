NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriots went to the polls Sunday (April 18th) to elect their president in a vote seen as crucial to the future of reunification talks.
Voters will choose between incumbent Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat and his opponent, hardliner Dervis Eroglu.
Polls suggest a lead for Eroglu, who is a firm supporter of the independence of the northern part of Cyprus.
Talat, on the other hand, favours closer ties with Europe and the reunification of the north and south.

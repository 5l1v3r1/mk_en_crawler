SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Interior Minister Hari Kostov said on Friday (11 July) that the six-week programme for the voluntary surrender of illegal weapons would probably begin on 1 October. 
The first session of the co-ordination body implementing the law on voluntary disarmament was held Friday. 
The panel includes representatives of parliament, the ministers of defence, interior and justice, representatives of NGOs and municipal authorities. 
Kostov added that after the 15 November deadline, stiff penalties and sanctions for possession of illegal weapons would be applied. 
A special task force will be asked to prepare a detailed disarmament plan and submit it to parliament by 24 July.

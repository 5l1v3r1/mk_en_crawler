ZAGREB, Croatia -- The deputy governor of Croatia's central bank said Tuesday (24 May) that he expects accession talks with the EU to start before the end of 2005. 
Croatia's economy has advanced sufficiently to ensure Zagreb's admission into the Union by 2007 or 2008, Boris Vujcic said. 
He also signaled the government's desire to join the Eurozone two years after accession.

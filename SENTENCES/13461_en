ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader says Croatia has made progress in all areas this year, achieving most of its goals.
During a Christmas reception in Zagreb on Thursday (22 December), he said the biggest success was the launch of accession talks with the EU in October.
In other news, President Stipe Mesic again criticised the government Thursday for what he described as slow economic reforms and inconsistent economic policy.
He urged the cabinet to approve an economic development strategy and acquaint the public with it.

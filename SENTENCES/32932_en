ANKARA, Turkey -- The National Security Council (MGK) will hold a regular monthly meeting on Wednesday (28 May), the first since Chief of General Staff Gen Hilmi Ozkok expressed the military's concern over recent appointments to public offices. 
The MGK is composed of both government and military officials. 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan says no personnel changes are expected.
Meanwhile, EU Commissioner for External Affairs Chris Patten said Tuesday that the Union has a clear view about civilian-military relations in pluralist democracies and those should be taken into account when evaluating Turkey's application to open accession negotiations.

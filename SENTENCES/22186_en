PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci told his ministers on Thursday (May 15th) that the cabinet is a month away from governing all of Kosovo, including the Serb-dominated north. 
"We are close to June 15th, when the constitution of the Republic of Kosovo will start applying, and naturally we will continue with the normal and efficient functioning of the institutions of the state of Kosovo across its territory," Thaci said. 
After June 15th, UNMIK plans to hand over its responsibilities to local institutions. 
Some competencies in the judicial and police sectors will be transferred to EULEX, the EU mission to Kosovo.
Meanwhile, NATO Joint Forces Commander Admiral Mark Fitzgerald visited the northern town of Mitrovica on Thursday. 
After June 15th "KFOR will start reducing its troops after the transfer of powers is completed and other security structures are in place," he said, adding that KFOR's mandate will not change as it stems from UN Security Council Resolution 1244.
Separately Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuqi described as "irrational" a request by Moscow urging all countries that have recognised Kosovo to reconsider their decision. 
"Recognition of Kosovo is on the right track, and Pristina is waiting for recognition from the Russian government too," Kuqi said.

NEW YORK, United States -- Participants discussing Kosovo at the UN Security Council on Friday (November 12th) urged Belgrade and Pristina to engage in a dialogue as soon as possible and voiced support for UNMIK efforts. 
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic told the Security Council that his government would not ask Kosovo Serbs to participate in next month's snap elections, as the vote is not being held in line with UN Security Council Resolution 1244. 
He reaffirmed Serbia's commitment to finding a compromise solution to Kosovo issue. 
He also reiterated that Serbia will not recognise Kosovo's independence either explicitly or implicitly.
Kosovo's acting Foreign Minister Vlora Citaku said that Pristina authorities are ready for a dialogue with Belgrade, but he stressed they will never discuss Kosovo's right to independence. 
In its quarterly report on Kosovo, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's Special Representative Lamberto Zannier assessed that the situation in northern Kosovo remains unstable after the International Court of Justice's July opinion on the legality of the country's independence. 
"Our key challenge in northern Kosovo remains to mediate between the communities, as well as to serve as a bridge between northern Kosovo and the Pristina authorities," he said.

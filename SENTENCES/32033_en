BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Tanjug reported Saturday (19 October) that Justice Minister Savo Markovic has said Yugoslavia will not recognise new indictments from the UN war crimes tribunal, as the country is observing its law on co-operation with the tribunal. 
Tribunal spokeswoman Florance Hartmann says chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte and Yugoslav officials will discuss new requests for investigations and witnesses Monday in Belgrade.
In other news, the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) appealed late Saturday to the Serbian Supreme Court over the decision of the Serbian Electoral Commission to annul the results of the presidential run-off. 
DSS insists it has proof that turnout exceeded the required 50 per cent minimum.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenther Verheugen said Monday (29 September) that he expects the EU progress report on Turkey to be positive and encouraging. 
After a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, Verheugen praised reforms aimed at bringing the country into line with EU criteria. 
He added, however, that Ankara must help resolve the Cyprus dispute, noting that the issue would affect the EU decision on starting accession negotiations with Turkey.

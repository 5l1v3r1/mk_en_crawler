STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Saturday (September 5th) that Croatia has achieved enough progress in judicial reforms and the shipyards issue to wrap up EU accession talks in the first half of 2010. 
However, he noted, the ongoing border dispute with Slovenia must be resolved as well. 
Speaking on the sidelines of an informal weekend meeting of EU foreign ministers in Stockholm, Rehn said he expects the two countries to strike an agreement "this autumn". 
Croatian Foreign Minister Gordan Jandrokovic, who also attended the meeting, said the border row will be resolved soon. 
His Slovenian counterpart, Samuel Zbogar, confirmed that the two sides are closer to reaching an agreement but more work must be done.

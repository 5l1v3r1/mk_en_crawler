SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria has made progress in the most criticised areas of its EU membership preparations, EU Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs Franco Frattini said during his visit to Sofia on Monday (31 July).
Frattini, who held talks with Interior Minister Rumen Petkov, Justice Minister Georgi Petkanov and Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev, said particular gains had been made in judicial reform and anti-corruption efforts.
He urged authorities to keep up the momentum.
Bulgaria is scheduled to join the EU on 1 January, along with Romania.
Frattini next visits Bucharest to assess judicial reforms.

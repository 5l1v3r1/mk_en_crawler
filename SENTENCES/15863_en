ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey and the EU are engaged in negotiations on a Finnish proposal to end the deadlock over allowing Cypriot vessels and planes into Turkish ports and airfields, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Namik Tan said Thursday (October 19th). 
Turkey has said it will open its ports to Cyprus only if the Union ends economic sanctions against the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.
The proposal reportedly calls for allowing partial access to Turkish ports in exchange for opening the Cypriot port of Famagusta, located in the Turkish-run part the island, under EU supervision. 
Tan said there were "unbalanced" elements in the draft, but the stalemate could be overcome soon.

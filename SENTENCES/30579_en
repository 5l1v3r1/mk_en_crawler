PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Irregularities reported during last month's snap parliamentary elections have significantly affected public trust in the democratic process in Kosovo, according to the European Network of Election Monitoring Organisations (ENEMO). 
"These serious breaches of procedures were seemingly accepted and there were no attempts by the polling station staff to stop irregular voting behaviours. 
Similar incidents and alleged fraudulent acts reported for the December 12th elections give a bleak picture of the election process in Kosovo," ENEMO said in a press release published on Wednesday (January 12th).
Just outside Pristina, in Cagllavica, two NGOs of the Serbian civil society claim that irregularities and manipulations occurred among the Serb electorate as well, including vote-buying at a price of 50 to 200 euros per vote. 
Voters were also offered incentives such as food and firewood, the NGOs argued.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- A main adviser to Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said on Wednesday (December 5th) that war is one of the "legal means" available to defend the sovereignty of Kosovo.
"When someone doesn't respect the Security Council, which is solely responsible to react when someone threatens aggression and war ...
then there is nothing else left for countries to do," adviser Aleksandar Simic told Serbian state television.
One member of the ruling coalition, the Democratic Party, criticised the statement as irresponsible and dangerous, while another member, the Democratic Party of Serbia, downplayed any controversy.
The Serbian government and the ruling coalition have repeatedly rejected force as an option.
On Thursday, the International Crisis Group think tank warned that delays in granting independence to Kosovo could lead to an "unsupervised, possibly violent, independence process" that could threaten stability in the Balkans.
The group urged France, Germany, Italy, the UK and the US to begin a peaceful transition, culminating in conditional independence for Kosovo in May 2008.

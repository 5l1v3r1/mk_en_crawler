SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Romanian Justice Minister Monica Macovei visited Sofia on Wednesday (31 May), and said Bulgaria and Romania are partners that must join the EU together. 
Separating them, she added, would benefit neither. 
Her statement followed a meeting with Bulgarian EU Affairs Minister Meglena Kuneva. 
Their focus was on activities the respective governments are taking to resolve issues highlighted in the latest monitoring reports by the European Commission. 
Another monitoring report this fall will determine the countries' exact accession dates.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO's defence ministers are expected to reduce SFOR levels from 12,000 servicemen to 7,000, according to reports Monday (24 November) by international news agencies.
The move would reflect the improved situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and could be completed by mid-2004.
At their meeting on 1 December, the ministers are not expected to make any sharp reductions to NATO forces in Kosovo.
The Alliance would retain its 17,500 troops there at least until mid-2004.

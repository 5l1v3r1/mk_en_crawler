TIRANA, Albania -- The families of those killed by explosions at an ammunitions depot in Gerdec two years ago asked the General Prosecution on Thursday (October 21st) to strip Environment Minister Fatmir Mediu of his immunity and start investigating his responsibility for the incident.
This marks the third time the families are making this request.
The first two failed to result in any legal procedures.
Mediu was defence minister in March 2008, when the explosions hit the ammunition dismantling depot in Gerdec, 12km outside of Tirana.
In all, 26 people were killed and 300 were injured.

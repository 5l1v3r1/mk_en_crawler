PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Radosav Martinovic, a retired Yugoslav Army general who advises Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, has called for the establishment of a separate army in Montenegro.
In a statement Monday (15 August) in the Podgorica daily Pobjeda, Martinovic said the reform of the federal armed forces of Serbia-Montenegro did not bring satisfactory results and the need for separate armies in each republic is obvious.
According to him, Montenegro needs its own, professional military with some 3,000 troops.

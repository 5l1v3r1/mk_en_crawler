ZAGREB, Croatia -- The main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) filed a no-confidence motion Monday (19 June) against the cabinet. 
At issue is Pozesko-Slavonsko County, whose budget has been blocked for two and a half months over an old debt of 47m euros. 
The SDP, which dominates the local county government, claims foot-dragging by the cabinet on repayment is aimed at hampering the work of local party officials. 
President Stipe Mesic promised to discuss the matter with Prime Minister Ivo Sanader.
In other news Monday, Croatia and the EU started the first phase of screening for the Statistics negotiation chapter. 
Croatian experts estimate that 50 per cent of domestic legislation in the field meets EU requirements.

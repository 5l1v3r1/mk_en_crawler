BELGRADE, Serbia -- A fire broke out late Saturday (October 24th) at the Dragisa Misovic hospital in Belgrade, forcing patients to evacuate to other facilities.
One fire-fighter suffered minor injuries.
The blaze, which started in the roof and spread to a lower floor, heavily damaged the hospital.
Some political parties are demanding Health Minister Tomica Milosavljevic resign, not only because of the fire but also over the poor state of the health care system and the recent arrests of several health officials linked to corruption scandals.
He refused to quit Sunday, saying his resignation would not resolve problems in the sector.
Meanwhile, a Belgrade judge has ordered 30 days detention for eight health officials -- including former hospital directors -- arrested for abuse of power and corruption.
The suspects allegedly caused losses totalling 665,000 euros to the city of Belgrade, stemming from tenders to procure medical equipment.

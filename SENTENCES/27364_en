ANKARA, Turkey -- Two Turkish soldiers and three members of a Kurdish militia helping the army were killed on Saturday (May 29th) in separate clashes with terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) members.
The violence reportedly surged after PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan decided to abandon peace efforts and leave commanders in charge of the conflict, international press reported.
Two soldiers and a "village guard" member died in clashes in Sirnak province, while two militia members were killed in Siirt province, after PKK members attacked a military patrol.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH's top Serb and Muslim politicians reached a last-minute agreement Friday (September 28) to carry out a reform of the country's divided police forces.
The EU had set the end of September as a deadline for completing the talks, and refused to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with BiH until the deal was finalised.
"This agreement does not provide answers to all questions, but we want the police reform and, of course, we want to reform BiH," Bosniak leader Haris Silajdzic said.
Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said EU integration is the shared goal of everyone in the country.
He added that Friday's agreement would not lead to abolishing the RS police, but would integrate it into BiH police structures.
The Dodik-Silajdzic deal is reportedly based on a proposal by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak.
His office confirmed that it has received the agreement, and said EU institutions will now review it to determine whether three key principles set forth by Brussels have been met.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- European Commissioner for Tax Policy and Customs Union Laszlo Kovacs said on Monday (12 September) that Bulgaria's planned entry in the EU in 2007 depends entirely on the pace at which it fulfils commitments to the Union.
At the same time, he predicted the country would do so in a timely fashion.
Kovacs arrived on a two-day visit to Sofia on Monday.
He met with Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev, Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin and EU Affairs Minister Meglena Kuneva.
In other news, former Parliament Speaker Ognyan Gerdzhikov, a senior member of the ruling coalition partner NMS-II, confirmed on Tuesday that he might run for mayor of Sofia in the 29 October race.
There have been rumours lately that NMS-II and the Bulgarian Socialist Party might nominate a joint candidate.

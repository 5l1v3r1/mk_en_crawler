SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Scattered violence marred voting in snap elections Sunday (June 1st), called after parliament dissolved in April, following Macedonia's failed NATO bid.
In one such incident, police say one person was killed and a few others were injured in an attack against a police patrol in the northern town of Aracinovo, which is mainly populated by Albanians.
The BBC reports that violence has forced a suspension of voting in five areas, which could affect Macedonia's EU prospects.
According to the latest polls, the coalition "For a Better Macedonia" headed by the ruling VMRO-DPMNE, is the frontrunner.
The "Sun -- Coalition for Europe", headed by the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia, is also expected to win some seats, as are the two ethnic Albanian parties:
the Democratic Union for Integration and the Democratic Party of Albanians.
Experts expect relatively low turnout -- around 50-55%.

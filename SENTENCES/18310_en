ANKARA, Turkey -- The Foreign Ministry warned Cyprus on Thursday (February 15th) to call off a tender granting exploration and drilling rights off the island's shore.
Such tenders "violate the joint rights of the island's two communities and amount to a fait-accompli," it said in a statement, charging that Cypriot government's initiative undermines peace and stability on the island and in the entire region.
Cyprus is offering companies the right to explore an area of 70,000 square kilometres for oil.
The tender is the first of several licensing rounds, following an agreement among Cyprus, Egypt and Lebanon to establish an exclusive zone for oil and gas exploration in the Eastern Mediterranean.

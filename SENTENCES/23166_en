PRISTINA, Kosovo - Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig Moller said in Pristina on Tuesday (July 1st) that there should be no parallel Serb institutions in Kosovo and that any separation of Kosovo would be unacceptable. 
Moller, who met with Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, said the supervised independence plan by former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari provides sufficient guarantees for the Serb minority in Kosovo in terms of preserving its culture, language and heritage.
For its part Tuesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement Tuesday describing the establishment of a Kosovo Serb parliament as a logical reaction to the "illegal" unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo. 
"The assembly ... 
reflects the prevalent feeling within that community that it must confront [its] forced integration into the illegal Kosovo Albanian creation," the statement said.
In other news, relations in Kosovo's ruling coalition grew more strained Tuesday, following Monday's sacking of Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Naser Osmani. 
He belongs to the junior coalition ally Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), which immediately protested the move and insisted Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, of the ruling Democratic Party of Kosovo, reinstate Osmani. 
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu of the LDK said he supported Thaci's decision to dismiss Osmani for exchanging offensive comments in parliament with Transport and Telecommunications Minister Fatmir Limaj.

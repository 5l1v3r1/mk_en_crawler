BUCHAREST, Romania -- A court upheld a travel ban Tuesday (June 9th) imposed on far-right politician Gigi Becali, which prevents him from assuming his duties as a newly-elected member of the European Parliament (EP). 
Becali was banned from leaving the country after his arrest in April for allegedly kidnapping three men who he says stole his car. 
In Sunday's elections, Becali won an EP seat as a Greater Romania Party candidate. 
However, he will not be able to take office in Brussels due to the travel ban. 
The court ruling said he must remain in Romania while the investigation continues.

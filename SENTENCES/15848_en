NEW YORK, United States -- The Contact Group for Kosovo -- which includes the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- has asked UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari to produce a draft proposal on the future of the province. 
The six nations reaffirmed their plans to wrap up the process by the end of this year. 
They said "all possible efforts should be made to achieve a negotiated settlement" but warned that neither ethnic Albanians nor Serbs could block the process of deciding Kosovo's status. 
Ahtisaari briefed the Contact Group on Wednesday (20 September).
In other news, deputy UNMIK chief Steven Schook warned the ethnic Albanian leaders of Kosovo that they must be "very careful with the phrases they use and the messages they direct to public opinion and the people". 
The rebuke followed a statement by Kosovo Parliament Speaker Kole Berisha, who said there would be a revolt in the province if it were not granted independence. 
Hours later, four Serbs were injured in a grenade attack.
Also on Wednesday, KFOR Commander Lieutenant-General Roland Kather said NATO would not tolerate violence and disorder. 
"Our duty is to ensure security in Kosovo and everybody can rest assured we shall do that in a friendly way, but resolutely." (Politika - 21/09/06; Reuters, AP, AFP, UPI, BBC, Tanjug, KosovaLive - 20/09/06)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- At a session Thursday (17 October), the government decided to consider strategic educational reform guidelines within the next four weeks. 
Declining numbers of high school and college students over the past ten years and a drop in the quality of education require urgent measures, say officials. 
Only seven per cent of the population have a college education, while just over one third of college students actually graduate. 
Education Minister Grozden Flego outlined the problems, noting the current education system lags behind US and European standards. 
Prime Minister Ivica Racan wants the government to speed up adoption of reform guidelines.

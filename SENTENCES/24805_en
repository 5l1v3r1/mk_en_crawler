SOFIA, Bulgaria/BUCHAREST, Romania -- Bulgaria and Romania reported cuts in Russian gas supplies of up to 30% on Friday (January 2nd) due to a dispute over payments between Russia and Ukraine. 
Russia's Gazprom cut gas supplies to Ukraine on January 1st, saying Kiev did not pay its natural gas bills. 
Russia also accused Ukraine of stealing gas bound for Europe. 
Bulgarian state-owned gas provider Bulgargaz said it was now receiving 15% less natural gas from Russia because of the dispute.
Romanian gas pipeline operator Transgaz said gas supplies on Friday amounted to only 7 million cubic metres, while normally the country imports about 10 million cubic metres a day. 
However, Economy Minister Adriean Videanu rejected reports that Romania is facing shortages of gas. 
Other Balkan countries, including Croatia, Serbia and Turkey, reported normal supply levels.

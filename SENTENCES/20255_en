SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Constitutional Court refused on Tuesday (August 14th) to review the Local Elections Act, as requested by opposition parties. 
The decision was a blow to critics who tried to block the amendments on two fronts: procedural grounds and constitutional concerns. 
In the rush to pass the measure before summer holiday, the predominantly ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms managed to introduce a clause which would allow its supporters living in Turkey to cast votes, even if they haven't resided for at least ten months in local municipalities. 
Though he has criticised the measure, President Georgi Parvanov has scheduled local elections for October 28th.
In other news Tuesday, Parvanov appointed Deputy Interior Minister Boyko Kotsev as the country's permanent representative to the EU. 
Kotsev served as a deputy foreign minister in Simeon Saxe-Coburg's cabinet.

TIRANA, Albania -- US Ambassador to Tirana John Withers and OSCE Deputy Head of Presence Renate Herrmans stressed on Monday (December 7th) the need for stronger efforts against judicial corruption, saying the justice system must remain above reproach.
Speaking at a ceremony to inaugurate a new information centre at the Appeals Court in Tirana, Withers said judges should protect their integrity, as the judiciary must be free from political influence.
Herrmans said corruption remains and is serious.

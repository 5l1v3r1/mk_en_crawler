BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Meeting in Belgrade Tuesday (17 January), Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and Austrian Vice Chancellor and Transport Minister Hubert Gorbach agreed on the launch of a joint task force to address issues surrounding the mobile phone operator Mobtel. 
The Serbian government and an Austrian consortium of private investors are involved in a legal dispute before an international arbitration court in Zurich over ownership of the majority stake in the company.
Mobtel is currently under state administration, following the government's December decision to revoke its operating license. 
Serbian authorities made the move after Mobtel sold rights to services in Kosovo to a local company in the province.

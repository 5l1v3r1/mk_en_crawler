ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in the eastern city of Adana issued a suspended jail sentence Tuesday (September 15th) to a Turkish journalist who published a joke hinting the leaders of the countries are corrupt.
The joke was published in the Ekspres newspaper by journalist Sevda Turaclar.
She received an 11-month suspended sentence after President Abdullah Gul, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and former Finance Minister Kemal Unakitan filed a lawsuit against the newspaper.
"We have published similar jokes about previous presidents in the past and this has never happened," Turaclar told Reuters.

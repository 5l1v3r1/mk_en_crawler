PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Under UNMIK orders, police are preventing Albanian residents in Serb-dominated northern Mitrovica from rebuilding their houses, local media reported on Thursday (August 27th).
Serb members of the Kosovo police and EULEX police have blocked the road leading to the houses, preventing workers and owners from reaching the construction sites.
UNMIK says the land "has no legitimate owners", adding that the area is within UNMIK administration and it has the sole responsibility and right to issue building permits.
Local municipal leaders have said construction will continue when conditions improve, a jab at Kosovo and EULEX police.

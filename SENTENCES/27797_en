ZAGREB, Croatia -- Zemun Clan member Sretko Kalinic was extradited early Wednesday (August 25th) from Croatia to Serbia, where he was sentenced in absentia to 30 years in prison for the March 2003 murder of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. 
Kalinic is the first Croatian citizen to be extradited to another state based on the extradition agreement recently signed between Zagreb and Belgrade. 
Prior to his extradition, a court in Zagreb sentenced him on Tuesday to 18 months in prison for possession of fake Croat passports he obtained based on false data and documents.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greek Cypriots turned out in record low numbers Saturday (June 6th) to elect six members of the next European Parliament (EP). 
Only 58.88% of 526,000 registered voters cast their vote. 
In Cyprus, voting is compulsory for national elections but not for European ones. 
First exit polls showed the opposition conservative Democratic Rally (DISY) has won 35.5% of the vote, edging out the ruling Progressive Party of Working People (AKEL) with 33.7%. 
Each of them will get two seats. 
The other two go to AKEL's coalition partners, the centre-right Democratic Party (DIKO) and the socialist EDEK party. 
The elections only applied to Greek Cypriots; the northern, Turkish part of the island is not an EU member.
Three other Balkan EU members -- Greece, Bulgaria and Romania -- are holding EP elections Sunday. 
Greece will hold 22 seats; Bulgaria gets 17; and Romania gets 33 seats. 
Preliminary results are expected late Sunday.

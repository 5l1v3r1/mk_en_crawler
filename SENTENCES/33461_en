PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- EU security chief Javier Solana will pay visits to Belgrade and Podgorica on Wednesday to help boost ties between Serbia and Montenegro and develop a better functioning state union, a spokeswoman for Solana said Saturday (31 May). 
Cristina Gallach told the Montenegrin daily <I>Dan</I> that strengthening the union and enhancing political co-operation is essential.
On Friday, the head of the European Commission mission to Serbia-Montenegro, Geoffrey Barrett, urged the two republics to present a joint action plan to harmonise their economic and tax systems. 
Launching talks on a feasibility study for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement would depend on the action plan, he said.

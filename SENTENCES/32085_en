ATHENS, Greece -- Some 100 army officers from Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Macedonia, Romania, Slovenia and Turkey started a series of computer-simulated exercises Tuesday (15 October) in an effort to improve their response to earthquakes in Southeast Europe. 
Italy is also attending as an observer. 
The first phase of the exercise will last until 24 October; the second phase begins in December. 
Turkey, Greece, and Macedonia have experienced devastating earthquakes in the past half a century. 
Turkey will host the next such exercise in 2004.

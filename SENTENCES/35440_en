BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- New elections will be called next week if the four Serbian reformist parties fail to reach an agreement on forming a cabinet, Parliament Speaker Dragan Marsicanin said Thursday (12 February).
He told reporters that lawmakers are expected to amend Serbia's election laws, to allow a president to be elected by a margin of less than 50 per cent.
Marsicanin is currently acting also as president of Serbia after two attempts to elect a head of state failed due to low turnout.
He went on to say that Serbia was just "a step away" from calling elections at all levels -- local, presidential, and parliamentary.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian police arrested four members of the paramilitary group Scorpions on Friday (October 19th) in Sremska Mitrovica for war crimes committed against civilians in Kosovo during the 1999 conflict.
They will be charged with murdering 14 ethnic Albanian civilians, mostly women and children, in Podujevo in March 1999.
The Scorpions were known as one of the most brutal groups during the Balkan wars.
A widely circulated video showed members carrying out summary executions after the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.

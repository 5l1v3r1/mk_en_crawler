ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Writer and Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk said at the weekend that supporters of the controversial legal Article 301 -- which criminalises "denigrating Turkishness" and has led to court proceedings against other Turkish intellectuals -- are to blame for the murder of journalist Hrant Dink, who was gunned down Friday (January 19th). 
Pamuk and the slain journalist both faced trial last year for comments regarding the mass killings of Armenians in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire.
The Turkish daily Sabah, meanwhile, reported on Monday that an order issued personally by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to provide security to all charged under Article 301 has not been implemented. 
The EU repeatedly has insisted that the legal provision be scrapped.

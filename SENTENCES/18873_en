PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- A new human rights report by the OSCE Mission in Kosovo, released on Wednesday (April 4th), warns that the continued existence of parallel structures -- UNMIK-administered ones and those under Serb jurisdiction, not mandated by UNMIK -- in certain public sector areas affects the rule of law in the province. 
The document particularly cites parallel court systems and institutions dealing with security, property rights, education and health care.
Acknowledging that in some cases the parallel structures provide certain communities with access to public services, the OSCE concludes that, overall, they create an atmosphere of uncertainty and block development of a stable democratic society.

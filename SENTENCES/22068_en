NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias expressed frustration Sunday (October 19th) with a UN Security Council decision to elect Turkey as a non-permanent member for 2009-2010. 
"Certainly it does not please us that a country which occupies part of the Republic of Cyprus and violates the Cypriot people's human rights is elected as a member of the Security Council," Christofias said. 
He said he believes that the council's permanent members will demand Turkey honour its obligations as a non-permanent member. 
Turkey won a non-permanent seat Friday, along with Austria, Japan, Uganda and Mexico.

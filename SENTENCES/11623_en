BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- During talks in Belgrade on Tuesday (22 March), Serbian President Boris Tadic and Federation of BiH (FBiH) Prime Minister Ahmet Hadzipasic vowed further efforts to resolve disputes arising from their governments' Free Trade Agreement.
Problems emerged after BiH decided last month to abolish zero duties for imports from both Serbia-Montenegro and Croatia, to protect BiH farmers' interests.
Belgrade has protested the move as a violation of the FTA.
Tadic said on Tuesday that the two sides want to settle the problem via dialogue, though no specific date for talks was announced.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The EU expects the smooth formation of a new government in Macedonia, the spokeswoman for EU security chief Javier Solana said on Tuesday (25 July). 
Cristina Gallach reiterated that the country's main priority should be the EU integration progress. 
She also urged an end to disparaging remarks VMRO-DPMNE and the Democratic Union of Integration are trading. 
"It is important in this sensitive period that everyone refrains from giving unconstructive or provocative statements that could create unnecessary tensions," Gallach said.
In other news Tuesday, outgoing Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski, leader of the SDSM, said his party would serve as a fierce but constructive opposition and would support EU related reforms.

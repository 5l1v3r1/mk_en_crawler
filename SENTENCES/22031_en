PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The six members of the Contact Group, including Russia, oppose the holding of Serbian municipal elections in Kosovo on May 11th and support the same line as UNMIK, UN mission spokesperson Alexander Ivanko said on Wednesday (April 16th). 
Noting that UNMIK's view is supported by diplomatic representatives from the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy and Russia, he said, "It would be interesting to see if Serbia decides to oppose the will of all international players, not only those from the EU, the UN and the Contact Group, because they have all clearly said that Serbian local elections should not take place in Kosovo." UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker plans to send a message to Belgrade reiterating that holding the elections would violate UN Security Council Resolution 1244.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative to BiH Christian Schwarz-Schilling is urging politicians to curb their rhetoric and work instead to reduce tensions heightened in recent weeks.
In an interview published in Thursday's (17 August) Nezavisne novine, he cited two particular cases -- video footage of alleged war crimes against Serbs during Croatia's Operation Storm in 1995 and a recent bombing at the tomb of wartime Bosniak leader Alija Izetbegovic in Sarajevo.
Schwarz-Schilling stressed that instead of political speculation on possible suspects, the relevant institutions -- the police and judiciary -- must investigate, find those responsible and punish them.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Representatives of a NATO Parliamentary Assembly delegation visiting Skopje reportedly have voiced support for the accession of the Adriatic Charter countries -- Macedonia, Albania and Croatia -- in 2006. 
According to a statement from Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski's office on Tuesday (19 April), members of the delegation indicated such a scenario would contribute to the region's stability and security.
Separately Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Radmila Sekerinska stressed that the success of Skopje's application for official EU candidate status depends on judicial reforms and the passage of new election legislation.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatian police reported late last week that the crime rate in Zagreb declined by 20 per cent between January and July, compared to the same period last year.
Officials credited personnel changes, equipment upgrades and collaboration with local authorities, the media and the public.
In other news, Transparency International Croatia President Zorislav Antun Petrovic will file a lawsuit against the Croatian state television HRT for failing to provide information sought by the NGO.
Petrovic told reporters Saturday (27 August) that HRT did not respond to Transparency International's request for information about the expenses of parties and independent candidates during the local elections in May.
Petrovic says HRT is on the list of public institutions that by law must answer such queries.

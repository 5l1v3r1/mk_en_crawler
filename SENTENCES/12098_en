THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect surrendered to authorities in Republika Srpska and was flown to The Hague on Saturday (15 January). 
Savo Todovic served as deputy chief of the infamous Foca prison camp from 1992 to 1993. 
UN prosecutors have charged him with the killings and torture of numerous prisoners, mostly Muslim civilians. 
He faces life imprisonment. 
Todovic was the first indictee to give himself up following the Bosnian Serb government offer of financial assistance to the families of those who surrender.

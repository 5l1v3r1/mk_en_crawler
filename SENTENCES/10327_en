SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The ruling Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM) is expected to elect a new leader at an extraordinary congress Thursday (25 November).
Nearly 700 delegates are choosing among three official candidates for the post -- incumbent deputy leaders Vlado Buckovski and Radmila Sekerinska, and Tito Petkovski.
A fourth nominee, SDSM parliamentary group leader Jani Makraduli, withdrew his name from the race Wednesday and urged supporters to back Sekerinska.
SDSM representatives previously hinted that the future winner of the race would be also offered the post of prime minister.

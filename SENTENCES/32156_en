THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The judges in the trial of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ordered him Wednesday (13 November) to undergo psychiatric and cardiology tests to assess the impact of the proceedings on his health. 
The trial has been halted on several recent occasions due to Milosevic's high blood pressure and exhaustion. 
On Tuesday, all hearings were cancelled until at least the end of this week. 
Belgrade's Radio B92 quotes UN war crimes tribunal spokeswoman Florence Hartmann as saying that the court is considering a possible release on bail, due to Milosevic's deteriorating health. 
As precedent, she cited the case of Bosnian Serb Army Gen Radislav Krstic, whose lawyer represented him while he underwent medical treatment. 
Milosevic, however, has resisted all calls for the court to appoint a lawyer to represent him. 
Wednesday, the upper house of the Yugoslav parliament adopted a declaration seeking his provisional release, so that he could undergo treatment in Yugoslavia.

TIRANA, Albania -- Some 3,000 supporters of the opposition Socialist Party (SP) rallied in front of the government building in Tirana on Friday (November 20th) demanding an investigation into alleged irregularities in the June general elections that were won by the Democratic Party (DP) of Prime Minister Sali Berisha. 
The Socialists have been boycotting the work of the parliament demanding a recount of the ballots in several regions. 
The government, on the other hand, has been insisting that a recount would be illegal. 
The DP and its allies have 75 seats in the 140-seated parliament. 
Friday's protest, which is part of a series of demonstrations that began in October, continued through the weekend. 
On Saturday, the protestors set up a camp in front of the building.

ATHENS, Greece -- A bomb exploded outside a closed night club in Athens early on Friday (December 31st), causing serious damage but no injuries.
Police believe the blast was an act of intimidation by a criminal gang.
On Thursday, a small bomb exploded outside the Greek Embassy in Argentina, causing panic but no damage.
Earlier in the day, a bomb hidden in a parked motorbike near a courthouse building in Athens damaged buildings and cars.
Police warned on Friday that extremist groups may stage more attacks in the run up to the trial later this month of suspected members of the anarchist group Conspiracy of Fire Nuclei.

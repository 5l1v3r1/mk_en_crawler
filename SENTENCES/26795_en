TIRANA, Albania -- A mass grave containing 19 bodies has been discovered near the village of Linza, just outside Tirana, local media reported on Monday (February 8th). 
The remains are believed to be victims of the communist regime that ruled that Albania from 1946 to 1991. 
The dead were executed and buried in the area's mountainous terrain. 
The grave was discovered by a local man who spent nearly two decades searching for the body of his father, executed by the regime of Enver Hoxha in 1976. 
The dead man's son said he had been digging in the area for months.

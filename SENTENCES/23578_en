SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko has discussed problems in the functioning of the town of Mostar, with the Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC), local media reported on Monday (July 27th).
Inzko is considering all available options, his spokesperson Frane Maroevic said.
Inzko has told political parties represented in the Mostar City Council that they are responsible for the situation.
The Council has been unable to agree on a mayor, leaving the post vacant for months.
It also failed to adopt the city budget by July 15th, which means it won't be able to pay back salaries owed workers by August 31st.
This has provoked strikes and public protests.

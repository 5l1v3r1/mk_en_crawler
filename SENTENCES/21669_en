ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prosecutors filed charges Friday (October 24th) against former General Vladimir Zagorec for allegedly embezzling around $5m worth of diamonds and abuse of office. 
Zagorec, 44, was extradited from Austria last month. 
According to prosecutors, when he stepped down from the post of deputy defence minister in 2000, he embezzled diamonds left by a German trader in 1993 as collateral in an illegal weapons deal.
According to local media reports, Zagorec is one of the richest people in Croatia. 
His defence attorney is prominent lawyer Zvonimir Hodak, whose 26-year-old daughter was murdered in downtown Zagreb shortly after Zagorec's extradition.

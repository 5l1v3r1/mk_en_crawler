SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla Del Ponte said Friday (24 October) that she is extremely dissatisfied with the lack of co-operation by Republika Srpska authorities.
She noted that they have failed to detain a single person suspected or accused of war crimes.
Nor have they provided access to documentation necessary for The Hague tribunal to conduct investigations.
All trials in The Hague are to conclude by 2008.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Police spokesperson Arber Beka announced on Saturday (August 29th) that four people, including one US citizen, have been arrested for suspected involvement in terrorist activities.
"Four people have been arrested for illegal possession of weapons and for threatening security," Beka said, adding that the charges could be "expanded" to include terrorism.
Police seized two Kalashnikov rifles and five hand grenades during Friday's arrests in the western town of Prizren.
Local media reports allege the four have ties to radical Islamists, and that the arrests were carried out in co-operation with the FBI.
Beka neither confirmed nor denied these reports.

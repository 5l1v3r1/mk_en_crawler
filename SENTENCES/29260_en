ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, visiting the southeastern city of Diyarbakir on Friday (September 3rd), sought to win Kurdish support for the September 12th referendum on constitutional amendments. 
Speaking at a rally, he promised more constitutional changes after next year's elections. 
"After the 2011 elections, a broader-based new constitution will be founded â¦ We are opening the door [to further change]," Erdogan stated. 
The pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party is asking Kurds to boycott the referendum on judicial system reforms. 
Recent polls show that almost half will ignore their party and vote "yes" on the reform package.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) merged with the Civil Alliance of Serbia (GSS), during a joint session on Saturday (April 7th). 
Members elected Cedomir Jovanovic to remain at the helm of LDP, while GSS chairwoman Natasa Micic and the GSS founder Vesna Pesic will become LDP deputy leaders. 
The move follows earlier announcements from the two parties about plans to merge, in a bid to strengthen their political position. 
Negotiations to form a new coalition government have dragged on since the January 21st parliamentary elections.
A new poll meanwhile finds that most Serbians -- two thirds -- want a coalition government formed, rather than face the prospect of new elections. 
The poll was conducted by the Strategic Marketing agency.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Former Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff Nebojsa Pavkovic plans to surrender to the UN tribunal, his lawyer said Friday (15 April).
Ljubisa Zivadinovic told a local radio station that he had received instructions from his client to start work on his defence.
He denied knowledge of Pavkovic's whereabouts or when he would give himself up.
The retired general has been indicted for his role in the Kosovo conflict.
He failed to appear before a court in Belgrade a month ago in connection with the attempted murder of Vuk Draskovic during the Milosevic regime.

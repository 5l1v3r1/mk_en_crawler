BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government announced on Thursday (28 July) that it has decided to house some 440 refugees from Uzbekistan. 
The group spent the last two months in a UN-sponsored camp in neighbouring Kyrgyzstan, having fled outbreaks of violence in their homeland last May. 
Both the UN and the British presidency of the EU issued statements praising Romania for the humane gesture, especially at a time when the country is reeling from extensive flooding. 
Foreign Minister Mihai Razvan Ungureanu explained that the Uzbeks would remain in Romania for up to six months, and then head on to other countries, including the United States, the Netherlands and Canada.
In other news Thursday, President Traian Basescu said Romania would keep its 850 soldiers in Iraq until Baghdad becomes capable of guaranteeing its own security. 
He told foreign journalists in Bucharest that any pullout will come after consultations with allies and will be carried out only at the request of Iraqi authorities.

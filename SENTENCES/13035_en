SUBOTICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Croatian minority in Serbia is now allowed to display its national symbols during national and state holidays, as well as at its own rallies and gatherings, Chairman of the Croatian National Council in Serbia-Montenegro Josip Pekanovic said on Thursday (29 December). 
Permission was granted at last week's session of Serbia's Council for National Minorities in Belgrade. 
Pekanovic says the decision is important, as it reconfirms the existence of the Croatian minority and strengthens its rights.

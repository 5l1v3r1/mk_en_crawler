MOSCOW, Russia -- Bulgaria, Greece and Russia will sign an agreement next week to build an oil pipeline linking Burgas and Alexandroupolis. 
President Vladimir Putin will travel to Athens on Wednesday (March 14th) to attend the ceremony, the Kremlin said, as will Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev. 
The Burgas-Alexandroupolis project had been delayed for more than ten years. 
When completed in 2010, the pipeline will carry 700,000 barrels of oil to the Mediterranean market per day, bypassing the busy Bosporus Straits.

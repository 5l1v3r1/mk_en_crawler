ATHENS, Greece -- European Commission President Romano Prodi expressed support for Greece's ruling party PASOK and its newly elected leader, George Papandreou, in an interview for <I>Ethnos</I> newspaper on Monday (16 February).
As for who might succeed him as EC President, Prodi mentioned Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis.
Prodi acknowledged, however, that the post traditionally goes to a European leader who has served at least two years as a prime minister and whose party would likely win a majority in Euro-elections.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Meeting on Monday (24 July), the EU Council of Ministers endorsed a modified mandate for Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) negotiations with Serbia, as well as a new mandate for separate SAA talks with Montenegro.
In Belgrade, Deputy Prime Minister Ivana Dulic-Markovic said this confirms the EU's open-door policy towards Serbia and its readiness to resume SAA talks, once Belgrade fulfils its obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal.
Also Monday, the first round of the Enhanced Permanent Dialogue between the Montenegrin government and the EC took place in Podgorica.
The head of the EC Directorate for Western Balkans, Reinhard Priebe, says the talks focused on issues related to the functioning of democratic institutions, human and minority rights and the economy.

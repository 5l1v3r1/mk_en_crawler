SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Leaders of the main Bosniak party, the Party of Democratic Action (SDA), and the main Croat party, the Croatian Democratic Union BiH (HDZ BiH), met on Monday (April 7th) in a bid to improve relations in the ruling coalition of Federation of BiH (FBiH). 
They focused on issues related to the law on social benefits for war veterans, the law on the distribution of public revenues and the appointment of new management and supervisory boards for FBiH state companies. 
Party leaders agreed to meet again in ten days. 
The ruling coalition, which also includes the Party for BiH and HDZ 1990, was close to splitting a couple of months ago when the SDA ignored a coalition agreement and appointed its own CEO to the main power company, Eletroprivreda BiH. 
Relations between the main Bosniak parties remain strained.

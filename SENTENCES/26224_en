BELGRADE, Serbia -- War crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic said on Sunday (December 13th) that authorities are searching intensively for the two remaining fugitives, Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic, stressing that there is a clear political will to complete the country's co-operation with The Hague tribunal. 
"This can no longer be an obstacle for us on the road towards Europe. 
We cannot be held hostage by anyone, not even Ratko Mladic or Goran Hadzic," Vukcevic told the Beta news agency.

PODGORICA, Montenegro, Yugoslavia -- Parliament will vote on the new cabinet Monday (30 December), according to Mladen Vukcevic, executive committee president of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS). 
He also announced that DPS and its junior partner, the Social Democratic Party, have finally agreed on the new interior minister - a major area of contention. 
Milan Filipovic, former judge of the Supreme Court of Montenegro, is said to be the likely choice.
Meanwhile, the Election Commission decided Friday to put off the decision on when to schedule the repeat presidential election. 
The commission will wait until it receives the funds to cover expenses from the failed 22 December vote before calling new elections.

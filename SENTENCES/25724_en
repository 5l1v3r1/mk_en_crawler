ANKARA, Turkey --The Istanbul branch of the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) announced on Wednesday (October 21st) that it plans to welcome a second "peace group" -- composed of members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) -- who will arrive in Turkey from Europe, to support the government's initiative offering more rights to the Kurdish minority.
The arrival date has not been set yet.
The first "peace group" arrived on Monday, from PKK strongholds in northern Iraq.
Meanwhile, the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) is criticising the government for releasing all 34 members of that first group.
"This is a political, de facto amnesty carried out through the judiciary," CHP lawmaker Isa Gok said.
An association representing families of people killed by PKK militants also slammed the government for organising "a state ceremony to welcome the terrorists".

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The UN Security Council on Wednesday (November 21st) approved the extension of EUFOR's mandate in BiH for another 12 months, effective immediately. 
Earlier this year, EUFOR's troop total was slashed from more than 6,000 to 2,500 troops due to an improved security situation. 
The peacekeeping force was to leave BiH entirely next month, until officials in both entities requested the extension to preserve stability in BiH.
In other news Wednesday, a senior Bosnian Serb official said Republika Srpska (RS) has no plans to secede from BiH if Kosovo declares independence. 
Gordan Milosevic, an adviser to RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, said such a move would destroy the entity's booming economy. 
The public, however, feels otherwise. 
A poll by the Partner Agency published on Wednesday suggests 77% of BiH's Serbs believe that they should leave the Bosnian federation if Kosovo secedes from Serbia.

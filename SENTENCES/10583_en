BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Adrian Nastase said on Sunday (14 November) that Romania could pull its troops out of Iraq in mid-2005 if the situation there improves. 
"We hope that the elections in January will lead to a gradual normalisation of the situation in Iraq, and if this is the case Romanian troops could be withdrawn in June," he said. 
Romania currently contributes 750 soldiers to the international coalition.
In other news, French President Jacques Chirac said in an interview late last week that Bulgaria and Romania would enter the EU simultaneously -- in 2007, as scheduled -- despite some delays in Bucharest's accession negotiation process. 
Chirac stressed that the delays should be overcome.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The UN war crimes tribunal said Monday (7 October) that it will assume jurisdiction over five cases related to last year's military conflict in Macedonia. 
Four of them relate to crimes allegedly committed by the members of the former National Liberation Army against the Macedonian population. 
The fifth deals with crimes allegedly committed by government security forces against ethnic Albanian civilians last summer.

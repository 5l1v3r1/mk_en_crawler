BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Sreten Lukic, a retired general and former top level police official, will surrender to the UN tribunal within a week, Belgrade media reported Friday (25 March).
He was indicted in 2003 in connection with the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict.
Separately, Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus repeated his expectation that another indicted general, Nebojsa Pavkovic, will also surrender within the week.
The EU has warned Belgrade that it must transfer Lukic and Pavkovic to The Hague by the end of March if it hopes to receive a positive Feasibility Study concerning prospects for EU accession.
In other news, Jovan Simic, Serbian President Boris Tadic's advisor for issues related to the UN tribunal, said Friday that former Bosnian Serb police commander Stojan Zupljanin could be the "next passenger" to The Hague.
Zupljanin, who commanded police stations in northern BiH between 1992 and 1995, has been indicted for genocide and war crimes.

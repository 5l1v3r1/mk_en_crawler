STRASBOURG, France -- The European Court of Human Rights fined Turkey on Tuesday (September 14th) for failing "to protect the life and freedom of expression" of slain Turkish Armenian journalist Hrant Dink, who was gunned down on January 19th 2007 outside his newspaper's offices. 
In July 2006, he had been given a six-month suspended sentence for "denigrating Turkishness" stemming from an article in which he described the killings of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians during World War I as "genocide". 
In a written statement Wednesday, the Strasbourg-based court said Turkey should pay 100,000 euros to Dink's widow and children and 5,000 euros to his brother. 
Turkey says it will not appeal. 
"Efforts will be made in following the requirements of the Dink decision and all measures will be taken to prevent repetition of similar breaches in the future," the foreign ministry said.

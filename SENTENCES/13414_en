ROME, Italy -- After meeting on Thursday (24 November) with Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski, former European Commission President Romano Prodi expressed his hopes that Macedonia will be awarded EU candidate status during the December summit. 
It would not be natural for the enlargement process to stop, he said.
Also on Thursday, the European Council decided to set up an EU police advisory team in Macedonia. 
Its mission will be to support the development of a professional and efficient police force, based on EU standards. 
The team will provide help in the field of fighting corruption and organized crime, developing a border police service, boosting police accountability and ensuring public peace and order.

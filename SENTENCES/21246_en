ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic denied on Wednesday (May 28th) recent statements by Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic accusing Croatia of ethnic cleansing in Serbia during a military operation in 1995. 
"You remember Vukovar and the tragic events that took place there. 
You remember the ethnic cleansing of over 250,000 Serbs during Operation Storm in 1995. 
That was a dark time, one that should never be repeated," Jeremic told a meeting of the Adriatic-Ionian Initiative Conference in Zagreb last week.
Responding to the statement during a service to mark Croatian Army Day on Wednesday, Mesic said that "there are still plenty of people in Serbia who do not remember what happened and that tanks from Belgrade, Novi Sad and the rest of Serbia entered Croatia not only to destroy Vukovar but other towns as well. 
Moreover, flowers were often thrown onto those tanks as they made their way to the border. 
We sustained huge losses during those attacks." (Javno.com, Balkan Insight - 29/05/08; HINA, Vecernji List - 28/05/08)

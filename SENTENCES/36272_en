ANKARA, Turkey -- The government sent three helicopters and flight and maintenance personnel to Afghanistan on Sunday (30 May) to serve in the International Security Assistance Force there. 
The Turkish General Staff issued a statement saying the primary goal is to establish an administration in Afghanistan that would ensure international stability and would be capable of fulfilling its international obligations.
In other news Sunday, Justice Minister Cemil Cicek said 1,905 people from Kurdish-populated southern Turkey have benefited from the Repentance Law so far. 
The law, introduced last year, allows people convicted under the emergency law regulations to receive amnesty if they pledge not to get involved with separatist political movements.

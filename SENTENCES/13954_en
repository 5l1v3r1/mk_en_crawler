SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- British Ambassador to BiH Matthew Rycroft expects talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between BiH and the EU to begin on 12 December, two days before the 10th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords.
In an interview in Tuesday's (18 October) Banja Luka daily Nezavisne novine, Rycroft said the European Commission would determine the exact date.
He also called on the BiH legislature to complete the adoption of a key police reform agreement and the law on public broadcasting, the remaining conditions for the launch of SAA talks.
Britain currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
Meanwhile, BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic is wrapping up a two-day trip to Brussels, where he has been discussing the pace of reforms with officials at EU and NATO headquarters.

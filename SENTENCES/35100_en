ANKARA, Turkey -- The government submitted the 9th EU legislative harmonisation package to parliament on Thursday (24 June).
The package proposes replacing the death penalty with life imprisonment and removing military staff from the Higher Education Board.
In addition, the chief of general staff would no longer appoint members to the Communications High Board and the Radio and Television High Board.
The package aims to bring Turkish legislation into line with Additional Protocol 13 of the European Convention for Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
If adopted by parliament, the legislative adjustments would be considered another positive step for inclusion in the upcoming European Commission report on Turkey.
The report is considered crucial to the EU's decision on whether to launch accession negotiations with the country.

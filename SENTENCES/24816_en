TIRANA, Albania -- A new survey concludes that a large number of citizens won't get new electronic ID cards before the June 28th general elections, local media reported on Wednesday (June 3rd). 
The poll, by the Albanian European Movement, found the timeframe may be unrealistic. 
Issuing the cards began in January and the goal was to have them in applicants' hands by late June. 
Albanians will have to provide a passport or an ID card to vote at polling stations.

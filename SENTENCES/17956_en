SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament unanimously adopted a declaration Tuesday (June 19th) in support of the country's accelerated admission to NATO. 
The document, submitted by independent member Gjorgji Orovcanec, stresses the broad political consensus for membership and urges the government to speed up reforms related to the NATO integration bid. 
Expanding the Alliance, it adds, would help create conditions for sustainable peace in the Balkans. 
The declaration is being forwarded to all NATO member states.

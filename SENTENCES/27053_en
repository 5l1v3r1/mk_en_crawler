PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The European Commission (EC) office in Kosovo suggests that parliament increase its role in controlling the government's work, in order to contribute to Kosovo's EU integration.
"The key role that the parliament is going to play in the European integration process is not only in adapting legislation, but also to play the role of a watchdog and monitor the government's activity," the head of the EC Liaison Office, Renzo Daviddi, said after meeting with Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi on Tuesday (November 3rd).

ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in Istanbul on Friday (June 18th) ordered the release of three retired generals who were in custody for alleged involvement in plots to topple the government. 
Retired generals Cetim Dogan, Engin Alan and Suha Tanyeri, who were charged in relation to a 2003 coup plot, were released after lawyers objected to their arrest. 
The suspects reportedly aimed to provoke political chaos by planting bombs in mosques. 
No indictment against the suspects has been drawn yet.
In a separate ruling, a court in Ankara ordered the release of Erzincan's chief public prosecutor, Ilhan Cihaner,who is on trial along with 13 other suspects for allegedly belonging to a terrorist organisation. 
Nine other suspects in the same case were also released.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Interior Minister Georgi Petkanov said Wednesday (26 November) there have been no substantiated terrorist threats against the country.
He added that the special services had received several signals but none of them proved real after investigation.
Petkanov reported on antiterrorist measures at a joint meeting of the National Assembly committees on internal security and public order, foreign policy, defence and security.
The directors of the special services also briefed lawmakers, and said Turkish services had denied that they are a source of information about a likely threat to neighbouring Bulgaria.
Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg will hold a meeting of the Security Council on Friday.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte put more pressure on authorities in Belgrade to co-operate with the war crimes tribunal by showing three photos of a suspect who disappeared just hours after the Serbian government received a warrant for his arrest.
The pictures show former Croatian Serb leader Goran Hadzic in the garden of his villa and leaving the premises carrying a bag on the day he disappeared.
The photos, shown to reporters on Thursday (22 July), were taken by a UN prosecution "tracking team" searching for indictees in Serbia.
This was the first time prosecutors released material collected by trackers.
Earlier in the week, del Ponte criticised Belgrade officials for tipping off Hadzic about his pending arrest.
On Thursday, Serbia issued a warrant for him, and police announced they were investigating whether there had been an internal leak.

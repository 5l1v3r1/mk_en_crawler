BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The chief of the BiH Army's joint staff, Lieutenant General Sifet Podzic, warned that failure to adopt the BiH state budget might jeopardise defence reforms, as well as efforts to join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.
In an interview published in Sunday's (15 January) Nezavisne novine, Podzic urged the BiH Parliament to pass the budget bill as soon as possible.
On Friday, Federation of BiH (FBiH) President Niko Lozancic urged the FBiH government and parliament to pass the draft budget by the end of January.
It has not been passed in Republika Srpska.

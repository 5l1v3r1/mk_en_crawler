CRAIOVA, Romania -- Combating corruption is the most important challenge that Romania faces on its way to EU integration, said Emma Nicholson, the special EU rapporteur for Romania. 
During a news conference Saturday (21 December) in Craiova, she noted that a recent World Bank survey found Romanians do not trust their own state institutions, perceiving them as corrupt.

BUERGENSTOCK, Switzerland -- UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on Monday (29 March) unveiled what was described as a complete revision of the 450-page UN blueprint on the reunification of Cyprus.
According to Alvaro de Soto, the chief UN negotiator, the new plan addresses Greek Cypriot demands on governance, property and transitional arrangements as well as Turkish Cypriot worries about autonomy, military and legal security.
The two Cypriot sides, Greece, and Turkey have so far failed to achieve a breakthrough in negotiations.
They agreed last month to let Annan resolve any issues that may remain open after Wednesday.

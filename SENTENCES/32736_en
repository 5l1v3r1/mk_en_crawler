PUSTEC, Albania -- Prime Minister Fatos Nano and his Macedonian counterpart Branko Crvenkovski met Saturday (14 December) in the Albanian border village of Pustec, saying afterwards that a new stage of co-operation has begun between the two countries.
Nano said the aim is to intensify implementation of the bilateral agreement signed four years ago, as well as help each other reach their common aspiration of Euro-Atlantic integration.
Crvenkovski stressed that border security and the fight against organised crime should be common priorities.
He also announced that NATO plans to organise a conference in Ohrid in May, focusing on border security.

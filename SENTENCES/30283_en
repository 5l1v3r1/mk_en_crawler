NICOSIA, Cyprus --President Demetris Christofias said on Sunday (March 20th) that his country is opposed to using British bases on its territory for military actions against Libya. 
"We gave Britain the message that we do not wish the bases to be used, because we are against it," the president said. 
At the same time, he stressed that "it is another matter if democracy should rule in Libya and other Arab countries. 
There is no question about that, of course we are in favour, but this again â¦ is a right of these peoples of these countries." (CAN, Xinhua, Cyprus Weekly -20/03/11)

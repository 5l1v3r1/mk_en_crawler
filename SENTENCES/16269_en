TIRANA, Albania -- The acting chairman of the Central Election Commission (CEC), Klement Zguri, again voiced strong concerns Monday (15 May) over the long stalemate involving electoral reform.
Zguri warned that while the main parties continue to argue, time is running out to prepare for municipal elections this winter.
He noted that three of the seven commission seats remain vacant, as the parties cannot agree on new appointments.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Hague tribunal chief war crimes prosecutor Serge Brammertz said on Monday (January 12th) that while work remains in capturing the remaining war crimes fugitives, their pursuers have achieved significant results in the past six months.
In an interview with the Banja Luka-based daily Glas Srpske, Brammertz said one could expect more progress in the search for Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic if operational plans come to fruition and if political support continues.
He added that he discussed these plans during his latest visit to countries in the region.

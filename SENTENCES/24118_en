ATHENS, Greece -- Amid continuing street protests by Greek youths, Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis pledged on Tuesday (December 16th) to fight high-level corruption and clean up political institutions. 
"Long unresolved problems such as corruption in everyday life and a sense of social injustice disappoint young people," Karamanlis told the ruling New Democracy (ND) party's parliamentary caucus. 
He acknowledged the government underestimated the magnitude of problems plaguing the country.
The same day, about 20 student protesters occupied Greece's state television channel NET, briefly interrupting a news broadcast to protest against the December 6th killing of teenager Alexandros Grigoropoulos. 
Another group of youths threw firebombs and stones at the Athens headquarters of Greece's riot police, damaging several cars. 
On Wednesday, about 50 young people staged a symbolic protest at the Acropolis in Athens, hanging two giant banners for about an hour.

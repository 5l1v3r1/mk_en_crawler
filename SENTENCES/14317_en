SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The head of the European Commission Delegation in BiH, Ambassador Michael Humphreys, voiced his belief Wednesday (10 August) that local leaders would be able to reach an agreement on crucial police reforms. 
Humphreys stressed that if there is political will at all levels in BiH, the issue would be resolved and a major condition would be met in efforts to advance along the path of EU integration.
On Wednesday, Republika Srpska confirmed that talks on restructuring the BiH police sector would resume later this month. 
The first meeting is expected to take place in Banja Luka.

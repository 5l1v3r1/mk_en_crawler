VIENNA, Austria -- The ethnic Albanian delegation for talks on the future status of Kosovo called Tuesday's (23 May) round of the negotiations "successful".
The meeting focused on the protection of cultural and religious sites in the province.
The ethnic Albanian and Serb delegations agreed that adequate protection against violent attacks should be accorded to Serbian Christian Orthodox monasteries and churches in Kosovo.
However, the size of the envisaged protection zones remains a point of contention.
In other news, a Kosovo youth group known as "Self-Determination" has called for a boycott of Serbian-made food and other products.
The organisation is urging the ethnic Albanian majority in the province to refrain from buying Serbian products until Kosovo achieves independence.
It is also demanding that Belgrade compensate Kosovo Albanians for pain inflicted during the 1998-1999 crisis.

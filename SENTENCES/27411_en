PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The commander of the police station in northern Mitrovica, Milija Milosevic, was discharged from his post Monday (August 30th) following a decision by Police Director General Behar Selimi. 
Milosevic was rumoured to have committed serious violations, including interfering arbitrarily in investigations and closely co-operating with Belgrade. 
Milosevic will be replaced by another Kosovo Serb -- Branislav Kragovic. 
Selimi also sacked the police commander in the southern part of divided Mitrovica, Jahe Avdiu. 
The changes in command within the Kosovo police aim to increase both the quality of service and accountability, according to Selimi.

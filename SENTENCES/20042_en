TIRANA, Albania -- The National Council of the Democratic Party (DP) elected Astrit Patozi Sunday (September 16th) as its new deputy chief and head of its parliamentary group, by a vote of 102 to 4. 
The two positions were left vacant after Bamir Topi was elected president of Albania in July. 
Patozi was the only candidate for the positions, although Prime Minister and DP leader Sali Berisha allowed a 30-minute recess during the meeting for other candidates to be nominated.

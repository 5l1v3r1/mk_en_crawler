TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha is defending the government's controversial new decision to import waste from EU countries for domestic processing and recycling. 
From a long list of 166 suggested products, the government has accepted only 55 for import, Berisha told a cabinet meeting Thursday (October 21st). 
Environmentalists and members of the opposition have called for the decision on waste to be annulled. 
But Berisha says Albania's European integration requires a law on waste, and he urged all parties involved to participate in the process.
Environment Minister Fatmir Mediu says that none of the waste categories is considered dangerous, after criticism from the opposition that the policy opens the door to imports of toxic waste too.

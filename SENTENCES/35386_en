BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament voted on Tuesday (15 June) to severely restrict adoptions by foreign nationals. 
The law gives priority to Romanian couples and allows international adoption only as a last resort. 
It was drafted with help from EU experts. 
Romania had been under strong pressure from the European Parliament and the EU to limit adoptions.
In other news, Marian Saniuta, the former chairman of the Romanian Agency for Foreign Investments, was officially appointed interior minister Tuesday. 
He replaces Ioan Rus, who resigned last weekend to focus on his mayoral aspirations.

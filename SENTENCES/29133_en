BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliament Speaker Slavica Djukic-Dejanovic announced on Wednesday (May 5th) that lawmakers will likely pass a declaration condemning war crimes committed against Serbs, by the end of June. 
She said the document will urge parliaments of other former Yugoslav republics to condemn crimes against Serbs as well. 
At the end of March, Serbian lawmakers adopted a landmark declaration condemning crimes committed against Bosniaks in Srebrenica in July 1995. 
Backing by the Socialist Party of Serbia reportedly hinged on a reciprocal declaration regarding Serbs.

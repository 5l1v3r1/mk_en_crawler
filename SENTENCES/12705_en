BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Parliament Speaker Predrag Markovic will seek consultations this week with parliamentary caucus heads on the possible adoption of a new resolution on Srebrenica. 
Markovic said Sunday (5 June) that such talks were necessary following the broadcast of a tape showing the 1995 execution of six young Bosniaks in Srebrenica. 
Serbia's Justice Minister Zoran Stojkic is also backing the initiative. 
He said members of the Serbian paramilitary unit Scorpions, who were identified and arrested after the broadcast, would be tried by local courts quickly.
Also Sunday, Serbian police arrested two dozen people for stoning buses carrying Croatian football fans. 
One passenger was injured in the attack, which occurred on a highway running through Belgrade. 
The Croats were returning from a match in Sofia, where their team beat Bulgaria 3-1 in a World Cup qualifier.

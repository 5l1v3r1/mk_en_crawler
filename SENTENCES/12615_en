ZAGREB, Croatia -- The OSCE Mission and the UNHCR office in Croatia praised on Friday (1 July) the government's decision to extend a housing deadline for former holders of occupancy/tenancy rights who lived in state-owned flats before the war.
According to the joint statement issued by the OSCE and UNHCR, extending the deadline by 90 days would allow those who lived outside war-affected areas to file their applications for housing by 30 September.
The statement noted that occupancy/tenancy rights holders are the most important remaining refugee category without housing options in Croatia.
There is no application deadline for refugees from war-torn areas.
In other news, Finance Minister Ivan Suker says he expects the IMF board to discuss the new stand-by arrangement with Croatia in September.
He added that after the talks with the IMF mission are completed, the cabinet would present a memorandum for economic and fiscal policy.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament is expected to start voting next week on key constitutional amendments related to future membership in the EU, according to the chairperson of the parliamentary panel for constitutional reforms, Kamelia Kasabova.
On Tuesday (18 January), she expressed confidence that all draft changes would be endorsed by mid-February.
Although generally backing the proposed adjustments to the main law, the main opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party says it will insist on continuing to restrict land purchases by foreigners.

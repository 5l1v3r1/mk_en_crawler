BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between Serbia-Montenegro and the EU could be signed this autumn, provided Belgrade meets its obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal, European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso said Thursday (16 February).
Speaking after talks with Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic, Barroso said the EU is pleased with the course of the SAA negotiations.
He cautioned, however, that lack of co-operation was jeopardising the process.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who is accompanying Barroso, gave a similar warning during an interview with B92 TV, saying co-operation with the tribunal needs to be stepped up as soon as possible.
The EC will present a report on the matter to EU foreign ministers later this month.

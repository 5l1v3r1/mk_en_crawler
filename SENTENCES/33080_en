THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal, in a ruling Tuesday (20 May), gave prosecutors in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic 100 more days to complete their case against the former president. 
Though that phase was to have ended last week, the judges agreed with the prosecution that "it would be in the interests of justice to allow some variation in the time limit to allow. 
more time to call further witnesses." They refused, however, to grant 200 more days, as had been requested. 
Milosevic's trial began in February 2002. 
The defendant has so far missed 54 days due to illness. 
The judges' ruling is likely to push the end of the prosecutions' phase into 2004.

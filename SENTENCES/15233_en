THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Prosecutors at the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague have appealed a sentence given to a former Bosnian Muslim commander in Srebrenica. 
Naser Oric, 39, was convicted by the tribunal of failing to prevent men under his command from killing or mistreating Bosnian Serb prisoners. 
The incidents took place in around 50 Serb villages between 1992 and 1993. 
Oric was sentenced to two years in June, but was immediately freed as he had already served three years, provoking angry responses from the governments of Serbia and Republika Srpska.
A spokesperson for UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte said on Sunday (30 July) that the sentence was too short. 
Prosecutors had argued that Oric should be jailed for 18 years. 
The defendant's lawyer, meanwhile, says she will file an appeal of her own, insisting her client committed no crime and should be acquitted.

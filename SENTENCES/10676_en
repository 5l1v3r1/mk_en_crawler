SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski warned on Friday (8 October) that failure to apply Macedonia's new decentralisation laws could plunge the country into uncertainty. 
"We don't need to go back. 
We don't need to negotiate Ohrid again," he said, signalling that a victory by the opposition in the 7 November plebiscite could jeopardise Skopje's European integration. 
Crvenkovski made these remarks as the VMRO-DPMNE-led opposition launched a campaign to persuade voters to reject the new legislation, which provides more powers to local governments and redraws the boundaries of some municipalities. 
Ethnic Albanians would constitute a majority in several of these and would be able to use Albanian as their official language, along with Macedonian.

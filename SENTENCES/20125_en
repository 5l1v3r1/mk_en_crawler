PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The commander of US troops serving with KFOR on Thursday (August 16th) denied charges by a senior Serbian official that NATO is building a "NATO state" out of Kosovo. 
"NATO has no intention of forming a state in Kosovo since it is here in a peacekeeping mission," Brigadier General Douglas Earhart told reporters at a press conference in Gniljane, noting that the EU and the UN are also involved in efforts to determine the province's final status.
Cabinet ministers from the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) â including, most recently, Interior Minister Dragan Jocic -- have accused Washington of engaging in a state-building experiment.

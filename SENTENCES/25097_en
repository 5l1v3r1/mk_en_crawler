TIRANA, Albania -- The position of women in Albania must improve in order to give them a more important role in society, a national conference held in Tirana on Wednesday (October 28th) concluded. 
"Domestic violence, high unemployment, and a lack of representation of women in politics and other decision-making positions are all serious issues that need to be addressed in Albania," USAID head for Albania Roberta Mahoney said at the event, dubbed Empowering Women in Albania --A Strategy for Inclusive Development.

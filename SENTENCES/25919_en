PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbian and Montenegrin citizens will be able to continue entering Kosovo by showing their ID cards, despite a law on foreigners that requires citizens of other countries to show valid passports.
Artan Duraku, adviser to Interior Minister Zenun Pajaziti, said on Wednesday (November 18th) that this policy will remain in force through the end of this year.
Last week, a Kosovo police official was quoted as saying that citizens of Serbia and Montenegro would need passports to enter Kosovo, but this was later denied by police spokesman Bekim Kelani.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said on Monday (September 7th) that Serbia will meet all remaining criteria set by the EU for lifting visa requirements by the end of this month.
He added the European Commission would be informed of progress by September 25th.
In July, the European Commission formally recommended granting visa-free travel to citizens of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia.
The proposal, if approved by all 27 EU members and the European Parliament, would take effect in January 2010.
Separately, Dacic and Hans Ola Urstad, head of the OSCE Mission to Belgrade, signed an agreement on strategic partnership and priorities for police reforms.
Dacic said his ministry is co-operating closely with the OSCE to draft an action plan against organised crime, which is expected to be adopted this month.

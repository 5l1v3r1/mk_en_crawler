THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- War crimes indictee Radivoje Miletic has once again asked for his plea to be delayed. 
A UN judge granted the request Thursday (31 March), postponing the plea hearing by 14 days. 
According to Miletic's court-appointed defence counsel, the defendant is trying to hire his own lawyer. 
Miletic first deferred his plea on 2 March. 
A former senior aide to Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic, he has been charged with four counts of crimes against humanity and one count of violations of the laws or customs of war in connection with the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.

WASHINGTON, United States -- The United States urged unity on Friday (January 26th) within the six-nation Contact Group for Kosovo, amid reports that Russia is at odds with the West over UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's status plan for the province.
Ahtisaari introduced his proposal at a closed-door meeting with representatives of the Contact Group states -- France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Russia and the United States -- in Vienna.
US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack urged all Contact Group members to back Ahtisaari's efforts.
Media reports suggest Moscow may try to postpone formal submission of the document to Belgrade and Pristina -- now scheduled for February 2nd -- until a new Serbian government is formed.
In other news Friday, the OSCE Mission in Kosovo issued a new report citing significant progress achieved in lawmaking in 2006.
According to the OSCE, the Ministries of Health, Education, Science and Technology were particularly good at meeting their obligations in implementing laws.
The prime minister's office, however, was criticised for delays in executing laws and for not ensuring sufficient publicity about new legislation.

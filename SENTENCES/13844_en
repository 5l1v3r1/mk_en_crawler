SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The former head of the Macedonian Health Fund, Vojo Mihajlovski, was sentenced on Friday (17 March) to four years in prison after a Skopje court found him guilty of abuse of office in 2000.
Mihajlovski, also the former general secretary of the main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE, was convicted of violating the public procurement law, causing losses to the Fund of around 4m euros.
Time already spent in custody -- between December 2002 and May 2003 -- was taken into account.
Six other former officials from private companies and regional medical centres were also sentenced Friday.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) deputy chief Dragan Lukac said on Sunday (24 September) that at least three BiH citizens -- Mahrez Ben Mahmoud Ben Sassi Al Amandani, Safik Ben Mohamed Al Ayadi and Khalil Ben Ahmed Ben Mohamed Jarraya -- are on the UN list of suspected al-Qaeda supporters. 
He says none of them are currently on BiH territory or are using valid BiH identity papers. 
All three, said Lukac, received BiH citizenship during the 1990s conflict, stayed for some time, and then moved on.

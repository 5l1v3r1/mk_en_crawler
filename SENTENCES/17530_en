SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Another round of political talks on crucial BiH police reforms was held on Saturday (February 24th), but ended without much progress. 
The meeting was attended by representatives of the BiH parliamentary parties, Principal Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian, EUPM Commissioner Vincenzo Coppola and the US and UK Ambassadors to Sarajevo, Douglas McElhaney and Matthew Rycroft. 
After the talks, Gregorian issued a statement, warning that the time for reaching an agreement on the police reforms had effectively run out, delaying at least until 2008 the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. 
One last meeting may be held in Banja Luka this week.

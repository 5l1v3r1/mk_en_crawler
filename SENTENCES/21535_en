PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The international community is far from meeting its commitments to support the new state of Kosovo, a report by the International Crisis Group (ICG) said on Thursday (September 25th). 
The report concludes that supporters of former UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan on Kosovo have failed to implement it because of Serbian and Russian opposition, insufficient political will and poor co-ordination. 
The ICG also urged the Kosovo government to establish state and public institutions that are accountable and professional and above political influence.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and President Stipe Mesic finally agreed Friday (10 December) on the dismissal of Counter-intelligence chief Josko Podbevsek.
Weeks ago, Mesic signed the decree on Podbevsek's dismissal over a scandal involving the interrogation of a female reporter, but Sanader refused to co-sign.
However, after a closed-door meeting the two agreed that Podbevsek should go.
Mesic said Saturday both he and Sanader had proposed that former National Security Office head Tomislav Karamarko succeed Podbevsek.

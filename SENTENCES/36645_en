SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown said Sunday (2 May) that BiH has its place in the EU -- just like the new ten states that joined the Union on Saturday.
Ashdown stressed, however, that progress is especially dependant on co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal and Republika Srpska's will to detain war crimes indictees.
In other news, on Friday, Ashdown decided to postpone the establishment of the BiH Intelligence and Security Agency until 1 June to prevent a security vacuum.
Ambassador Kalman Kocsis pointed out that no appointments for the positions of director, deputy director or inspector-general have been made.

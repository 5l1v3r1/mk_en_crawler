ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to submit the list of ministers in his new cabinet Thursday (August 16th).
Normally, he would need to fill 22 slots, but following a meeting of his party's Central Executive Board, he said he wants to add two more ministries.
He said Abdullah Gul would retain the position of foreign minister for now, although his ruling Justice and Development Party has nominated Gul for president of the country.
Meanwhile, Gul said on Wednesday that the attempts by some politicians and military officials to thwart his nomination could backfire.
Asked whether, if he were elected, his wife would continue to wear a headscarf and traditional clothing, Gul said the Turkish Constitution protects human rights and free choice.

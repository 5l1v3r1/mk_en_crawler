ATHENS, Greece -- A teenager was killed and his young sister was seriously injured by a blast outside a public employee training centre in Athens late on Sunday (March 28th). 
The mother of the two children was also injured. 
According to reports, the family -- Afghan migrants -- were picking through a garbage bin for food in front of the building when the boy found and opened a bag containing the explosive device, detonating it. 
Citizen Protection Minister Mihalis Chrysohoidis described it as a "disgusting terrorist act" and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. 
Two other bombs were discovered in Thessaloniki and neutralized before they could cause harm.

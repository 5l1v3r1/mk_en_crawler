BELGRADE, Serbia -- A US Office of Defence Co-operation opened in Belgrade on Wednesday (June 6th), with US Ambassador Michael Polt and Serbian Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovic on hand.
Polt stressed the historic importance of the event, saying it demonstrated that "Slobodan Milosevic and Ratko Mladic's heritage is left far behind".
The office, headed by US Army Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandar Milutinovic, will assist with reforms in the Serbian military and with activities related to entry into NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.

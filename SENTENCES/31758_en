BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic is negotiating the terms of his surrender to the UN war crimes tribunal and could travel to The Hague soon, according to Yugoslav Deputy Justice Minister Nebojsa Sarkic. 
He added Wednesday (8 January) that the matter could be resolved within one or two days, but refused to elaborate. 
Yugoslavia has pledged to assist Milutinovic in getting a provisional release pending trial if he surrenders. 
He was indicted by the tribunal for his alleged involvement in the events in Kosovo in 1998-1999.

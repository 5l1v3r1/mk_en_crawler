BUCHAREST, Romania -- The US administration views Bulgaria and Romania as suitable for new US bases, according to General Charles Wald, deputy commander of the US European Command.
He was quoted Thursday (2 September) by local Romanian news agencies as saying talks with Eastern European countries are under way.
The region's proximity to the Middle East is seen as an important factor.

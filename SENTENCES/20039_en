BELGRADE, Serbia -- Veterans from the conflict in Kosovo escalated their hunger strike Monday (September 17th), by blocking the town hall and court building in Kursumlija and refusing to let anyone in. 
The protesters have been joined by several hundred veterans from neighbouring municipalities, including Nis, Prokuplje, Blace, Brus and Aleksandrovac. 
The strikers are demanding wages now owed them for eight years.

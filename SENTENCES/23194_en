SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Following a meeting Monday (March 31st) with Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev, Interior Minister Rumen Petkov said he has no intention of resigning despite a major scandal within his ministry. 
Petkov is alleged to have met with businessmen of dubious reputations who were being investigated by law enforcement agencies. 
While he denies any wrongdoing, even members of the ruling coalition have started calling for his resignation. 
The scandal began last month with the arrest of senior law enforcement officer Ivan Ivanov, reportedly for tipping alcohol producers about ongoing investigations into excise tax fraud.

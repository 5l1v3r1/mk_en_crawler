BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The World Bank is satisfied that the groundwork for sustaining and encouraging economic growth has been laid, said Rory O'Sullivan, former Bank representative in Belgrade.
Wrapping up his year in the post, he said structural reforms are perhaps the most important area where authorities need to focus their efforts to boost economic expansion.
Adding that investments are pivotal, he called for extending the legal framework to attract more of them.
The Bank has played an instrumental role in encouraging growth, reducing poverty and assisting specific projects, O'Sullivan noted.

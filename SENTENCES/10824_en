ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia has registered the highest number of tourist visits since it gained independence in 1991, Tourism Minister Bozidar Kalmeta announced on Wednesday (3 November).
He said during the first nine months of the year, 8.3 million tourists had visited, a 5 per cent increase compared to the same period in 2003.
This translated into 45.7 million overnight stays.
According to experts, revenues from tourism are expected to reach $8.5 billion.
Kalmeta credited the boom in part to stability in the country.

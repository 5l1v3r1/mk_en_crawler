BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian government has decided to accept a UN proposal on talks to resolve a number of issues in Kosovo.
It was announced Thursday (6 March) that Social Affairs Minister Gordana Matkovic will head the Serbian delegation, which is expected to travel to Pristina next week.
UNMIK chief Michael Steiner says the talks would focus on practical issues such as energy, trade and transportation.
Serbia hopes that it will be able to add return of refugees and security issues to the agenda.
This will be the first official meeting between Serbian and ethnic Albanian officials since the end of the 1998 conflict.

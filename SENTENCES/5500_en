The presidents of Croatia and Serbia, Ivo Josipovic and Boris Tadic, agreed this summer that the search for missing persons from the 1990s conflict is of enormous importance to future bilateral relations. 
Since then, progress has been made.
"The mechanisms that will produce concrete results are already set up. 
There is mutual monitoring, which means that, in case we need to do something, or have the request for exhumation in Serbia, we will be able to do so, and vice versa," Croatian Commission for Detainees and Missing Persons President Ivan Grujic said.

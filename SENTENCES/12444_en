SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prosecutors at the UN war crimes tribunal are seeking to transfer 18 cases to courts in the former Yugoslavia.
Twelve of these cases are for crimes committed during the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH.
The remaining six suspects would be tried for war crimes committed in Croatia.
Three of the Bosnian indictees are still at large.
A tribunal spokesman said in Sarajevo on Thursday (7 April) that national courts would gradually take over the responsibility for trying middle and low-ranking indictees, while the UN court would focus on key cases involving senior leaders.
In other news, a former Bosnian Serb police chief appeared before the UN tribunal on Thursday.
Ljubomir Borovcanin, who arrived in The Hague last week, was allowed to delay his plea by one month because he had not yet hired a lawyer.

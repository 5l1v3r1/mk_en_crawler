BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO-led peacekeepers uncovered a large ammunition dump Tuesday (21 January) in a village near Prijedor after residents led them to a site. 
Some 300 mortar bombs, 433 rockets, grenade launchers, ammunition for howitzers, fuses and mines were found in a hangar, SFOR said in a statement. 
The peacekeepers have urged the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina to help authorities recover arms and ammunition left over from the 1992-1995 conflict.

ATHENS, Greece - Over 200 immigrants arrived in Athens from the island of Crete on Sunday (January 23rd) with plans to launch a hunger strike demanding residence papers. 
The immigrants, young men from Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, have set up camps in front of the Athens University's Law School, which under local laws is off limits to police. 
They plan to start their strike on Tuesday.

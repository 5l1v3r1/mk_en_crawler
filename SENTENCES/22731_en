BELGRADE, Serbia -- The foreign ministry sent a protest note to Lithuania on Wednesday (May 7th) for recognising Kosovo's independence. 
The note reiterates Serbia's opposition to the unilaterally declared independence of its former province and warns of possible security consequences.
Also Wednesday, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said that Kosovo's unilateral declaration has not resolved a single problem. 
Addressing the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, Jeremic said Kosovo's independence has resulted in separation not only within the region, but also in Europe. 
It has not improved co-operation or contributed to reconciliation or stability, he added.

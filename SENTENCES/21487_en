BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government decided on Tuesday (October 28th) to postpone application of a controversial new law granting a 50% pay raise to teachers until April 1st 2009. 
The law was supposed to take effect on October 1st. 
Parliament passed it in September, and President Traian Basescu approved it last week, despite concerns about its cost. 
The Democratic Liberal Party has threatened to call for a no-confidence vote against the cabinet if the government does not enact the measure.
Also Tuesday, the IMF recommended that Romania take another look at the issue, saying the pay raise, coupled with the ongoing global financial crisis, may severely affect the country's economic competitiveness and its macroeconomic stability.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- In what is being hailed as an unprecedented act of political maturity, Kosovo Serb and ethnic Albanian politicians have sealed an agreement on the province's priorities.
Members of the Kosovo Serbian Return Coalition met with top Albanian political leaders and local authority representatives Wednesday (14 July) and signed an agreement to work together on the most important issues.
These include raising the standard of living, ending violence and securing better conditions for all.
Under the agreement, all property damaged or destroyed in the mid-March riots would be rebuilt, while both Serbians and Albanians would co-operate with international organisations to ensure Euro-Atlantic integration.

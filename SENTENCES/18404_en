TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister Besnik Mustafaj has again explicitly dismissed the potential for a so-called "Greater Albania" scenario or a future Albania-Kosovo union. 
In an interview with the Austrian press, Mustafaj reiterated that his government would seek no change to the current borders, if Kosovo becomes independent from Serbia. 
He added, however, that the government in Tirana is committed to forging close relations with Pristina.

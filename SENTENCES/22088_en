ATHENS, Greece -- Hundreds of tobacco producers blocked the main road connecting Athens and Thessaloniki on Wednesday (November 19th), causing serious traffic problems.
The farmers are demanding that the government raise low buy-out prices and grant 100% subsidies for tobacco they were unable to sell.
The action took place in the Fthiotida region, about 210km from Athens.
On Thursday, EU agriculture ministers meet to discuss subsidies for EU tobacco producers as part of the Common Agriculture Policy.
Thousands of tobacco producers from all over Europe gathered in front of EU headquarters in Brussels.
They oppose a decision by EU Agriculture and Rural Development Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel to trim their subsidies.
The rally drew farmers from Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Greece, Poland, Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria.
In other news Thursday, employees of the Athens subway system launched a 24-hour strike to demand a collective labour agreement that guarantees the jobs of full-time staff.
Observers expect serious transportation problems to result.

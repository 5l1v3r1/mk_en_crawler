SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Boyko Borisov, leader of election-winning Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), said on Monday (July 6th) the party has decided on the composition of the future cabinet. 
However, he plans to keep mum until final results of Sunday's parliamentary elections are announced. 
Borisov noted that his government will streamline some ministries and revise the state budget.
Separately Monday, former King Simeon Saxe-Coburg resigned as leader of the National Movement for Stability and Progress (NDSV), citing the party's poor performance in Sunday's elections. 
The NDSV, one of three coalition partners in the outgoing government, failed this time to pass the 4% threshold for entry in parliament.
In other news, police arrested several people Monday, including Deputy Minister of Emergency Situations Alexander Filipov, for suspected vote-buying. 
Sofia Deputy Head Prosecutor Galina Toneva said Filipov is also under investigation for embezzlement, corruption and misappropriation of state and EU funds. 
Filipov, the only deputy minister of Roma origin in the outgoing cabinet, had been under surveillance for some time.

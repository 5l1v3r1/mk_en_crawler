SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The international agencies involved in the property law implementation in BiH -- the Office of the High Representative, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the OSCE -- said Tuesday (13 April) that the process was nearing completion.
The implementation rate in the country reached 93 per cent as of 31 January.
Local housing authorities finalised work on 90 per cent of the total property claims and issued first-instance decisions in 99 per cent of the cases.
In other news, the Federation of BiH's House of Representatives on Tuesday endorsed two draft amendments to the entity's constitution.
The changes provide for direct election of mayors in municipal votes.
They also envision relevant representation of constitutional peoples in local self-government, stipulating that a mayor and deputy mayor of a municipality could not be from the same constitutional nation.
The BiH House of Peoples discusses the draft Wednesday.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The opposition officially submitted on Friday (April 4th) a no-confidence motion against the government due to recent scandals in the interior ministry. 
The motion, signed by all opposition parties, accuses the government of being involved with organised crime. 
The scandal began when a former and a current high-ranking official with the Interior Ministry were revealed last month to have passed sensitive information to businessmen involved in the grey market.
The debate on the vote should take three to seven days and the vote should take place 24 hours after the debate ends. 
Chances to pass the vote are slim, since the ruling coalition commands a majority of around 60% of all seats in parliament, while the opposition needs 50% + one vote to pass the motion. 
This is the fifth no-confidence motion against Stanishev's government, which came to power in August 2005.

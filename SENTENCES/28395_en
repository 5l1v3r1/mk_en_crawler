ANKARA, Turkey -- The terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) denied involvement in the explosion that killed nine villagers in the Kurdish-dominated southeast Turkey on Thursday (September 16th).
They died when their minibus struck a landmine near the city of Hakkari.
In a statement to the pro-Kurdish Firat News Agency, the PKK said the unilateral ceasefire it declared in August remains in effect.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the "terrorists" behind the attack and to respond.
"Terrorism has a cost but it will not remain unanswered," he said.

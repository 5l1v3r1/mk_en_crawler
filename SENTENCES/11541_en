MITROVICA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- KFOR personnel removed the barricades on the main bridge across the Ibar River in the ethnically divided town of Mitrovica late last week, according to local media reports Sunday (23 January) quoting an official announcement from KFOR.
The barricades went up last March following the ethnic riots in Mitrovica.
KFOR says bridge security is now in the hands of local and international police in the area.
In other news, Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj says he expects issues concerning demarcation of the Kosovo-Macedonian border to be resolved soon.
In an interview with Skopje's Telma TV on Friday (21 January), Haradinaj said the Kosovo interim government is open to friendly dialogue with Macedonia on any issue of common interest.

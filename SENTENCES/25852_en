ATHENS, Greece -- In his first address to parliament Friday (October 16th), Prime Minister George Papandreou said the country's economy is in grave condition. 
"The situation of the economy is explosive. 
The system of public finances is off the rails," Papandreou said as he presented his government's programme. 
He promised to restore the EU's and other partner markets' trust in Greek economy. 
Papandreou's socialist PASOK party won a convincing victory in the October 4th snap general elections, beating the ruling conservative New Democracy (ND) party.
On Saturday, the ND announced that its leader, former Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, will step down from the party's helm on December 6th. 
Karamanlis, 53, announced his resignation shortly after the October 4th elections. 
Four candidates say they will vie for his seat.

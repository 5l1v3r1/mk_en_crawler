SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Voters can expect preliminary results late Sunday (6 October) following Saturday's election, the first the country has organised on its own. 
A low voter turnout - less than 55 per cent - did not give any of the 57 parties and their coalitions a clear edge. 
The nationalist parties claimed victory, but Social Democrats leader Zlatko Lagumdzija said they would not have enough votes to form a government. 
He said he hopes that the reformist camp will be able to assemble a ruling coalition. 
His party was seen as losing some ground compared to elections two years ago. 
Former Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, also a member of the reformist Alliance for Change and chief of the centrist Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina, said his party was winning at all levels. 
Observers think a reformist coalition will retain control of the Muslim-Croat entity, but predict that the nationalist Serb Democratic Party will continue to govern Republika Srpska. 
The OSCE says the elections were largely incident-free.

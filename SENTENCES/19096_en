SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Sulejman Tihic, leader of the main Bosniak party, the Party of Democratic Action (SDA), has ruled out any compromise by his party on the issue of preserving Republika Srpska's (RS) police.
He told the party's main board on Saturday (March 31st) that Federation of BiH's political leaders would never agree to such a police structure and would continue to demand the establishment of a single state-level police force.
Tihic described the co-operation with the other Bosniak parties -- the Party for BiH and the Social Democratic Party of BiH -- as very good.
The SDA leadership also adopted a resolution in support of the Srebrenica City Council's demand that the town be given district status, outside of RS's jurisdiction.
It said it is unthinkable that Srebrenica, the site of genocide against Bosniaks in 1995, should remain under RS governance.

ATHENS, Greece -- Four illegal migrants died when they entered a minefield in northeastern Greece after crossing the border from Turkey, Greek defence ministry officials said on Monday (September 29th). 
Soldiers found the four bodies after residents of the nearby village of Kastanea heard explosions early Friday. 
The bodies of the four men were too badly damaged for authorities to identify them, but papers carried by two of them suggested they were Georgian, officials said. 
The minefield had fencing and clearly marked signposts. 
Officials say the four probably failed to see the warnings in the dark.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) will insist that identity cards and passports be issued in Albanian as well as in Macedonian, in accordance with the terms of the Ohrid peace accord, Deputy Prime Minister Musa Xhaferi said Wednesday (25 December), on behalf of his party. 
The announcement comes a day before a meeting of the Ohrid signatories, initiated by President Boris Trajkovski. 
Although DUI was not among the signatories, the party will participate in the meeting because it won the most popular support among ethnic Albanian voters in September's parliamentary elections. 
VMRO-DPMNE, one of the original signatories, is refusing to attend Thursday's session.

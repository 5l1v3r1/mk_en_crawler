SOFIA, Bulgaria -- About 1,500 workers of Kremikovtzi, Bulgaria's largest steel mill, staged a protest in downtown Sofia on Monday (March 9th) against planned staff cuts in the troubled company. 
They also urged the government to find a buyer for the insolvent plant. 
The protesters reached the buildings of the economy ministry and the government while chanting "Resignation". 
Kremikovtzi's workload has dropped sharply since August when it declared insolvency amid huge debts. 
Another factor aggravating the situation is the global drop in demand for metals. 
Workers say they have not received pay for the past three months and warned of management's plan to cut about 2,000 jobs.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic says talks between Belgrade and ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo would begin in September. 
The Belgrade daily <I>Vecernje novosti</I> quoted him Friday (11 July) as saying Serbian authorities were currently in "an even better position" than right after 5 October 2000, "as the world sees that Belgrade is not to blame for everything . 
that there are bad guys on the other side too". 
He added that Belgrade has been ready for negotiations with the ethnic Albanian bloc but said the appointment of a new UNMIK chief and the August recess of EU institutions makes starting talks in July unrealistic.

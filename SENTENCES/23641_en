ZAGREB, Croatia -- Vesna Pusic will be the presidential candidate of the opposition Croatian People's Party (HNS), party officials told a press conference Friday (July 24th).
The move came as a surprise, as Radimir Cacic, chairman of the HNS, was expected to get the nod for the race later this year.
Pusic is a sociology professor at the University of Zagreb and is well known for her liberal views.

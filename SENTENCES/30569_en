ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A court in Istanbul released a Turkish surgeon suspected of involvement in a human trafficking ring in Kosovo on bail Wednesday (January 12th). 
Doctor Yusuf Sonmez was freed a day after he was arrested based on a warrant issued by Kosovo. 
He was charged -- along with eight others -- by EULEX prosecutors over the Kosovo case late last year. 
Turkey does not extradite its citizens abroad, but relays testimony to other countries when deemed necessary. 
If convicted, they serve their term in Turkey. 
Prosecutors say Sonmez was a "key surgical participant" in operations performed at the private clinic Medicus, just outside Pristina.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- The High Criminal Court on Monday (October 20th) adjourned the trial against 86 suspected members of the shadowy separatist group Ergenekon until Thursday, to examine defence lawyers' requests.
The defendants, including retired army officers, leftist politicians, members of secularist associations, journalists, and academics, allegedly formed an illegal organisation that planned to incite chaos and disorder to trigger a military coup against the pro-Islamic government.
The court also ordered the continued detention of 46 other Ergenekon suspects.
The courtroom was packed with spectators and supporters of the defendants, prompting defence lawyers to complain about the conditions.
Hundreds of demonstrators protested the proceedings amid tight security outside the court building at Istanbul's Silivri prison.

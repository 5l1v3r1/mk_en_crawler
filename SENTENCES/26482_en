BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Outgoing Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, the EU’s new commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, on Monday (January 11th) ruled out excluding Greece from the eurozone, despite the country's financial crisis.
During hearings underway at the European Parliament for all commissioner-designates, Rehn said the Greek government’s economic problems are being closely monitored by the European Commission. 
He stressed the importance of the Greek government's set of measures to overcome the crisis, which he said should be received within the next few days or early next week.

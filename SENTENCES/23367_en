TIRANA, Albania -- Albania is "on the right track" towards visa liberalisation, but has so far failed to fully meet EU standards in this field, local media reported on Monday (May 25th), citing the latest European Commission (EC) report on the Western Balkans' visa liberalisation process. 
Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) are at the bottom of the EU list of compliant countries. 
The report was published a month before general elections in Albania, triggering heated political debate. 
The ruling Democratic Party had promised a visa-free travel regime with the EU by the end of its mandate. 
The main opposition Socialist Party accused the government of slowing the process by failing to take real action against crime and corruption.

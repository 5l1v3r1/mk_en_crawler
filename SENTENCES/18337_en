ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Zagreb County Court rejected on Friday (January 12th) a prosecutor's request for the detention of former army General Rahim Ademi.
He and General Mirko Norac have been charged with war crimes against Serb civilians and prisoners of war in the so-called Medak Pocket in 1993.
The prosecutor argued for custody, in light of the gravity of the charges.
But the court ruled instead that Ademi must not change his place of residence and must report to police every day.
Norac is serving a 12-year prison term in the local Glina prison for other crimes committed against Serbs in Gospic in 1991.

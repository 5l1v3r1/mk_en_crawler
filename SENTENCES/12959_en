SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria assumed command of the Multinational Peace Force South Eastern Europe (MPFSEE) on Friday (1 July) during a ceremony in the Romanian seaport of Constanza. 
Political and military leaders from Albania, Greece, Italy, Macedonia, Romania and Turkey attended the event along with their Bulgarian counterparts.
In other news Friday, Bulgarian EU Affairs Minister Meglena Kuneva warned that political wrangling should not delay the formation of a new cabinet, with so much left to do before the country's EU accession. 
In an interview with bTV, Kuneva said Bulgaria cannot afford to lose more time. 
She urged the winners of last weekend's parliamentary elections to agree soon on a new cabinet.

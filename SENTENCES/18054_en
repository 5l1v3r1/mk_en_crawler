NEW YORK, United States -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte presented her regular progress report to the UN Security Council on Monday (June 18th), noting general progress in Serbia's co-operation but repeating that all remaining fugitives must be brought to justice. 
The more positive tone of her report reflected the recent arrests of two indictees, Zdravko Tolimir and Vlastimir Djordjevic. 
Del Ponte says four others are in Serbia or within Belgrade's reach.
Addressing the Security Council, Hague tribunal President Fausto Pocar said the process of Serbian co-operation has reached a critical stage, as the tribunal is expected to close down in 2010.

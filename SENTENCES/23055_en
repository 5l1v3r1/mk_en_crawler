BELGRADE, Serbia -- Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, and French counterpart Bernard Kouchner issued a joint open letter Wednesday (April 2nd) urging Serbia to embrace innovative approaches in an effort to boost pro-European forces in the country. 
They urged Belgrade to co-operate with the EU mission in Kosovo (EULEX) instead of hindering its work, warning that unless Belgrade stops rejecting the mission, the country may lose its chance to eventually join the EU.

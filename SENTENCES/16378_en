She reaffirmed her country's support for Albania's EU integration bid, and said the fact that the ethnic Greek minority is represented in Albania's coalition government demonstrates Tirana's commitment to observing international standards for minority rights. 
On Wednesday, Berisha was scheduled to hold talks with his Greek counterpart, Costas Karamanlis, as well as with President Karolos Papoulias.

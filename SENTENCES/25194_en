BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska's (RS) parliament will debate the government's draft law on referendums and civic initiatives during an extraordinary session on February 9th, Parliament Speaker Igor Radojicic announced Thursday (January 28th).
The bill only stipulates the possibility of calling a referendum on a wide range of topics.
It does not specify which questions will be asked.
Prime Minister Milorad Dodik wants the measure while some opposition parties have imposed conditions on their support.
Dodik said he will ask voters if they support the 1995 Dayton Accord, which gave the high representative to BiH sweeping powers.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu made a televised address Thursday (March 1st), urging the public not to participate in Saturday's planned protest against UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's status proposal.
Sejdiu warned of the potential for violence, as happened in the February 10th demonstration.
Two protesters died after being shot in the head with rubber bullets fired by police.
The youth movement Self-Determination, which seeks Kosovo's immediate independence from Serbia, is organising the protests.
In other news Thursday, Russian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Vladimir Titov met with officials in Belgrade.
After the meeting, officials told reporters that both Serbia and Russia consider UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's blueprint for Kosovo not ready for presentation to the UN Security Council, as the plan is not acceptable to Serbia.
They insist that negotiations on the blueprint -- expected to wrap up Friday in Vienna -- instead continue, though no compromises have been struck between delegations representing Belgrade and Pristina.

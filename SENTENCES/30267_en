ATHENS, Greece -- The trial of 13 suspected members of the Conspiracy Nuclei of Fire anarchist group kicked off at a maximum security prison in Athens on Monday (January 17th). 
The defendants, all between the ages of 19 and 30, are accused of belonging to a terror group and of plotting several bomb attacks. 
Nine of them are attending the trial; the other four are bein absentia. 
The proceedings opened amid strong security measures, given fears of violence by supporters of the group. 
About 30 protestors chanted anti-government slogans near the court and tried to approach a van transporting the defendants. 
The hearing was interrupted several times.

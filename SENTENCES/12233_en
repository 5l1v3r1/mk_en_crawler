BUCHAREST, Romania -- The head of the state-run Romanian TV Broadcasting Corporation (TVR), Valentin Nicolau, announced his resignation Sunday (12 June), accusing the ruling coalition of exerting political pressure on management.
Parliament meets Tuesday to discuss a report on TVR's performance in 2004.
The ruling coalition says Nicolau resigned to divert attention from irregularities last year.
In other news, three Romanian journalists revealed Sunday that French reporter Florence Aubenas and her Iraqi guide had been held hostage with them for more than a month in Iraq.
The three Romanians were freed at the end of May, while Aubenas was released on Saturday.

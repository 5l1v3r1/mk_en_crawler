BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic said on Thursday (November 26th) that Serbia will submit its application for EU membership only after the bloc decides to unfreeze the interim trade accord that is part of its Stabilisation and Association Agreement. 
He explained that Belgrade will consider the most appropriate timing to present its application. 
Serbia's further EU integration process depends on its full co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Parliament's security committee on Monday (October 6th) presented Mitrovica Mayor Bajram Rexhepi with seven recommendations for establishing the rule of law across the divided town, whose north is predominantly populated by Serbs.
No contents were made public.
For his part, Rexhepi said the Serb community has begun to accept the new reality in Mitrovica and Kosovo despite pressure from parallel Serb structures.
In Pristina, Ramush Haradinaj, leader of the opposition Alliance for the Future of Kosovo, continued to criticise the government Monday for the situation in Mitrovica, saying it requires a strong commitment from local institutions to resolve it.
Also Monday, government officials announced that Kosovo will soon have a Constitutional Court, an independent institution with its own budget management and administration.
The court will consist of nine judges with nine-year terms.

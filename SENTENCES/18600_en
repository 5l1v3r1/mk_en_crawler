LAGOS, Nigeria -- A Bulgarian national and a British national have been kidnapped in Nigeria, diplomats from the two countries revealed on Monday (July 9th).
Petko Prandzhev, the Bulgarian acting chief of mission in Abuja, told reporters that his abducted compatriot was working for a British company.
The two workers were taken by armed men who attacked the barge they were on in the Calabar district of the Niger Delta on Sunday.
More than 200 foreign oil workers have been abducted in the area since January 2006 by local guerrilla groups.
No one has claimed responsibility for Sunday's attack.

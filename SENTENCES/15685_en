ZAGREB, Croatia -- Dutch Prime Minister Jan Pieter Balkenende said Wednesday (21 June) that the EU accession bids of Croatia and Turkey must be seen as two separate issues, and that it is up to the countries to meet the set criteria. 
There should be no connection between the Croatian EU bid and the debate on the new European Constitution either, said Balkenende, who was on a visit to Zagreb.
In other news, the first EU screening phase of Croatian legislation, under the Company Law chapter of the acquis, took place on Wednesday in Brussels. 
The second stage of the talks is expected to be held on 19 July.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Latin American crime groups dealing with cocaine see the Balkans as a new route for smuggling the drugs into Europe, according to Europol and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA).
"The route via the Balkans is more and more often used for cocaine smuggling from Latin America into the EU.
This trend should be among the priorities of local authorities in their fight against drug smuggling," Wolfgang Gotz, head of the EMCDDA, told BBC on Monday (January 3rd).
According to Europol, gangs from Colombia, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Peru and Venezuela are already active in the Balkans.

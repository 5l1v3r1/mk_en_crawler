SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko met with leaders of the main political parties Thursday (July 16th) and urged them to resolve all outstanding issues connected with the visa liberalisation roadmap. 
"If BiH authorities commit to resolving these issues, it will be possible for BiH to catch up with its neighbours as early as the middle of next year," Inzko said. 
He was referring to the European Commission's recent decision to exclude BiH from the visa-free regime, while opting to include Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro. 
He said discussions Thursday focused on efforts to resolve problems involving organised crime and corruption, difficulties related to issuing biometric passports, border management and migration, and issues related to state and defence property.
Republika Srpska Prime Minister and Serb Alliance of Independent Social Democrats leader Milorad Dodik said that leaders agreed that visa-liberalisation issues should be resolved as soon as possible. 
Bosniak Party of Democratic Action leader Sulejman Tihic told reporters that the so-called Prud process is in crisis and that big differences remain between him and Dodik.

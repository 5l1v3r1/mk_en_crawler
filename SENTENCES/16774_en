BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission will present its next monitoring report on Bulgaria by the end of September, says Michael Leigh, head of the European Commission's Enlargement Directorate General.
During a meeting Tuesday (6 June) with Bulgarian European Affairs Minister Meglena Kuneva, Leigh said the EC would shorten the summer holidays of its team assigned to Bulgaria, in order to complete the report on time.
Kuneva was in Brussels to present the government's action plan, aimed at addressing areas of concern cited in the EC's May monitoring report.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The ruling Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), New Serbia, the Serbian Democratic Renewal Movement and United Serbia (JS) will form a pre-election coalition, JS leader Dragan Markovic said on Wednesday (November 15th). 
Markovic says it will be called the People's Bloc. 
Latest opinion polls suggest DSS has slumped to third place in terms of popularity. 
Analysts say the coalition with smaller parties might help DSS remain in power.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic says he will sign an order Monday (20 October) setting the date for parliamentary elections.
The ruling coalition has decided on 23 November, and Mesic is expected to confirm that decision.
On Friday, parliament ended its mandate to officially launch the campaign.
Mesic and Prime Minister Racan issued separate statements Saturday urging voters to turn out for the election.
In other news, Croatian Deputy Prime Minister Goran Granic resigned as head of the council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
He was protesting a parliamentary decision that compels the government to provide war crimes suspects with legal assistance and access to government records.
Until now, authorities had refused to allow lawyers for fugitive General Ante Gotovina to obtain documents from the government archives.
Mesic reiterated that Croatia's intelligence services are unable to locate Gotovina.

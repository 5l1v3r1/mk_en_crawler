SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria supports all UN Security Council resolutions that condemn Turkey's invasion of Cyprus in 1974 and call for the withdrawal of Turkish troops from the island, President Georgi Parvanov said on Monday (October 6th) after meeting with Cypriot counterpart Demetris Christofias.
"Cyprus must remain a unitary, sovereign state, with sovereignty extended across the whole island," he told a joint news conference.
Parvanov also welcomed the start of direct reunification talks between the two Cypriot communities.
He noted that, while his country supports Turkey's EU accession, Ankara must respect the EU's values.

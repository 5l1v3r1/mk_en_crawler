SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Former US President Bill Clinton will preside over the opening of a memorial centre in memory of the Muslim civilians who were massacred in Srebrenica in 1995, BiH officials and Clinton's spokeswoman announced Monday (4 August).
"It is fitting that the man who did so much to end the war should open the memorial that will ensure that the victims of this massacre -- indeed all the victims of this terrible war -- are not forgotten," said Paddy Ashdown, the top international official in BiH.
Mustafa Ceric, the head of the Muslim community in the country, said Clinton was asked to preside over the event out of gratitude "for his role in stopping the aggression in Bosnia and Herzegovina".
The memorial will be opened on 20 September.

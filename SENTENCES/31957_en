SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Asked Monday (25 November) by a reporter about a reshuffle in the National Intelligence Service, President Georgi Parvanov said he does not rule it out, now that Bulgaria has received an invitation to join NATO. 
Parvanov acknowledged that he has already offered some proposals, aimed at making the special services more efficient. 
He refused to elaborate, but added that they would appear in the upcoming draft law on intelligence services.

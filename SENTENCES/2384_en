Kosovo is preparing to hold a population census in 2006.
In mid-November, local authorities announced the conclusion of the first testing phase, which took place in six municipalities.
Officials from the Ministry of Public Services said that this phase -- conducted in Pristina, Prizren, Gjilan, Kacanik, Skenderaj and Novo Brdo -- was "successful" and boded well for the project as a whole.
Lasting more than two weeks, the pilot project aimed to gather information on the number of inhabitants and their territorial distribution.
"The main objective was to test the data-gathering instruments and their functioning, and to detect the eventual deficiencies of procedure that need to be eliminated before the start of the general census," said Minister of Public Services Melihate Termkolli.
Population data will be among the factors influencing the process of determining Kosovo's future status, Termkolli added.
While legally part of Serbia-Montenegro, Kosovo has been a de facto UN protectorate since the end of the 1998-1999 conflict there.
The ethnic Albanian majority favours full independence from Serbia, while Belgrade is seeking to retain some form of sovereignty.
The last census in Kosovo took place in 1981, and was organised by the former Yugoslav authorities.
At the time, Kosovo's inhabitants were found to number nearly 2 million.
However, the overall figure, as well as the demographic breakdown, is thought to have changed significantly as a result of the conflict and related displacements.
Kosovo's Assembly first approved a population registration in 2003, but its adoption was delayed due to objections from Serbian representatives in parliament.

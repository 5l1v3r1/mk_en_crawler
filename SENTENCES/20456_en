BUCHAREST, Romania -- The ruling National Liberal Party (PNL) is expected to announce on Monday (February 11th) its choice for justice minister, following the rejection of its first choice, Norica Nicolai. 
The Constitutional Court ruled on Thursday that the president has the right to refuse a ministerial nomination, in this case Nicolai, who was nominated by Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu. 
Basescu cited issues with Nicolai's public image, given the EU's emphasis on the need for judicial reform. 
Deputy PNL leader Puiu Hasotti has raised the prospect of a government reshuffle as a result. 
The Hungarian Democratic Union in Romania and the Conservative Party say they are behind the idea, while the Social Democratic Party and the Greater Romania Party oppose it.

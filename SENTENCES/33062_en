ZAGREB, Croatia -- The head of the European Parliament's committee for Southeastern Europe Doris Pack has called on the fugitive Croatian Gen Ante Gotovina to surrender to the UN war crimes tribunal. 
The retired general has been hiding for two years since the tribunal unsealed an indictment for war crimes committed against Serb civilians in a 1995 Croatian Army operation. 
Earlier this month he indicated he might surrender under certain conditions. 
During a speech in Zagreb on Saturday (21 June), Pack also expressed satisfaction with the fact that all those indicted for the devastation of Vukovar are in custody at The Hague.

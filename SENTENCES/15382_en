SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government approved on Thursday (27 July) a draft law on the entry of EU citizens and their families to Bulgaria. 
For a short-term stay of up to three months, EU citizens would be required to only show their ID cards issued by their native country. 
For a longer stay, they would need a residence permit issued by the National Police Service.
Also Thursday, leaders of the eight largest right-wing opposition parties again failed to agree on a presidential candidate. 
The parties have set a deadline of 1 August. 
The election is on 22 October.

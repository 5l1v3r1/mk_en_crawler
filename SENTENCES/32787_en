SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Minister of European Affairs Meglena Kuneva said Sunday (8 December) in a radio interview that it is very difficult to predict how Bulgaria will fare at this week's EU summit in Copenhagen, in view of internal disagreements among member states on the Common Agricultural Policy.
Bulgaria hopes to receive a firm date of 2007 for joining the Union.
To that end, the Bulgarian and Romanian ambassadors to Denmark met Friday with Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller and handed him a joint statement declaring that the two governments are prepared to implement necessary reforms.

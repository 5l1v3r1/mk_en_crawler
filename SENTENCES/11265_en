ZAGREB, Croatia -- A new poll published in Friday's (24 June) Vecernji List finds the majority of the public wants the country to proceed with reforms, despite the recent delay in opening EU accession talks. 
The poll found 70 per cent of Croatians want their country to rely on its own potential and capacity in continuing with reforms. 
Another 17.3 per cent suggested the country should step up harmonisation of legislation and introduce an EU-related reform agenda. 
Some 4.2 per cent said it should change course and try to rely more on Washington.

THESSALONIKI, Greece -- Police said Saturday (17 July) they have arrested one of the main suspects in the 12 March 2003 assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
Dejan Milenkovic, 34, was nabbed late Friday night in Thessaloniki while carrying a travel bag containing "a lot of money", police said.
He had been under surveillance for over a month.
Serbian prosecutors say Milenkovic, nicknamed "Bugsy", was part of the Zemun Clan organised crime group, thought to be behind the Djindjic murder.
He also has been accused of driving a truck that nearly hit the prime minister's vehicle in a previous assassination attempt.
Greek authorities are now waiting for an extradition request from Belgrade.

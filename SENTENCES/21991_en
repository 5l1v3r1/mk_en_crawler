BELGRADE, Serbia -- A court on Monday (October 20th) charged former Yugoslav Army officer Damir Sireta with war crimes for his alleged role in the execution of Croatian prisoners of war in 1991.
Sireta, 45, allegedly belonged to a squad that executed more than 200 Croatian prisoners of war in Ovcara, eastern Croatia.
He was a member of the Vukovar territorial defence, which was part of the former Yugoslav People's Army.
Norway extradited Sireta to Serbia in May.
In other news Monday, Croatia submitted a report to The Hague war crimes tribunal and prosecutors that includes all documents related to Croatian artillery and special police actions during Operation Storm.
The Croatian army offensive began in August 1995 and ended with the elimination of the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina, which occupied around one-third of Croatia's territory.
The military operation killed hundreds of Serb civilians.

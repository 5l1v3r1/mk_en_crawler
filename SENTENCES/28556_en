PRISTINA, Kosovo -- International Civilian Representative Pieter Feith is urging the municipality of Prizren to change its logo by the weekend. 
During a visit to Prizren on Tuesday (September 14th), Feith encouraged the ruling coalition and the opposition to meet soon so as to make the deadline set by the Constitutional Court. 
In March, it ordered the municipality to make a change because the logo fails to represent all minority communities. 
Its main feature is the Albanian League of Prizren building. 
Government representatives accompanying Feith said they expect a meeting in the next few days.

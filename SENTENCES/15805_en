SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The government is working to assume more responsibility for its airspace, sealing an agreement Monday (19 June) with EUFOR that gives BiH authorities partial management of the upper air zone, above 3,000m.
EUFOR would continue to control airspace below 3,000m, while the medium zone and part of the upper zone still would be handled by BiH's neighbours, Croatia and Serbia, as BiH lacks the technology to go it alone.

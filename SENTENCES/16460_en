BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Federal Human and Minority Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic announced on Tuesday (11 April) his resignation from the post of government co-ordinator for southern Serbia, following a cabinet disagreement about municipal administration in the mainly Muslim city of Novi Pazar.
Tensions between two rival political parties in the town have been rising in recent months.
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Ljajic says he intends to remain chairman of the national council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan congratulated the Turkish Army Sunday (December 16th) on a military operation carried out in the early hours of the day against suspected camps of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in northern Iraq. 
Turkish military planes hit PKK bases in the Qandil Mountains, reportedly killing one woman and injuring two others.
"I am happy to announce that last night's operation was successful," Erdogan said, reiterating Ankara's resolve to use all military, economic and diplomatic means to fight PKK terrorists inside and outside its borders.
Regional government of Iraqi Kurdistan spokesman Jamal Abdullah urged Turkey to focus any future attacks on PKK targets. 
"We don't want the conflict between the Turkish troops and the PKK to turn into a conflict between the Turkish forces and the people of Kurdistan," he said.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The energy ministers of Croatia, Italy, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia signed a declaration on Tuesday (April 3rd), pledging to jointly build a new oil pipeline. 
The 1,300km project would link the Romanian Black Sea port of Constanta to the Italian Adriatic port of Trieste. 
It is expected to carry between 80 million and 100 million tonnes of crude oil annually, without damage to the environment. 
According to Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, the pipeline will cost between 2 billion euros and 3.5 billion euros to build. 
EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs cosigned the declaration, signalling that Brussels endorses the project.

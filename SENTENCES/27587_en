ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament convenes on Wednesday (October 27th) to discuss a no-confidence vote against Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor, filed by the opposition. 
The motion, supported by 58 lawmakers, was submitted a week ago. 
The opposition blames Kosor for a decline in living standards, economic contraction, as well as the rising unemployment rate, foreign debt and budget deficit. 
To pass, the motion needs backing from at least 77 of the 153 parliament members, and at this point, lacks that support.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told politicians in Sarajevo on Saturday (January 29th) that his country is ready to help the various communities overcome differences that prevent them from forming a government following general elections in October.
The region needs the three constituent peoples in BiH to co-exisit, he said, describing it as the "backbone of stability in the Balkans".
On Saturday, a planned meeting between Davutoglu and Presidency Chairman Nebojsa Radmanovic was cancelled over a protocol dispute.
Radmanovic called it off after Davutoglu's staff demanded that the Bosnian Serb flag be removed from the meeting venue.

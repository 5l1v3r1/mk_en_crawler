WASHINGTON, United States -- On Friday (18 April), the IMF board released $701m of an $18 billion assistance package it negotiated with Ankara in 2002.
Turkey has so far used $14 billion of the money.
The IMF expressed support for the government's strong commitment to stabilisation and reform.
It praised the central bank's prudent fiscal policies, but urged it to focus its efforts on fighting inflation.
The Fund also warned that the government needs to do more to reduce interest rates by maintaining fiscal restraint.
In other financial news, the Turkish government decided on Friday to provide more than $500m in aid to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus over the next three years.
The money will be used to upgrade tourist facilities, provide loans to farmers and entrepreneurs and build infrastructure.
Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Saturday that he was certain the reunification of Cyprus could be completed in 12 months so that both parts of the island could join the EU.

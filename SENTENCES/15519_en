SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Representatives of families of people who went missing during the 1990s conflicts in the former Yugoslavia are demanding answers from governments about the fate of their relatives. 
More than 60 representatives of associations for families of missing persons and government agencies from BiH, Croatia, Serbia and Kosovo gathered for a three-day conference in the Bosnian town of Brcko. 
The International Commission on Missing Persons issued a statement Saturday (November 25th) asking governments to speed up the identification process and the release of relevant information. 
"Resolving the issue of missing persons should be a pre-condition for European integration," the organisation said.

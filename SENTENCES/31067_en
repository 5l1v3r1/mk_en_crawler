WASHINGTON, United States -- The World Bank announced on Friday (December 3rd) it has debarred an Albanian company from its projects for three years after it was found to have been engaged in illegal practices in projects funded by the Bank. 
The company, called Elkri, applied to become a subcontractor in municipal water and wastewater projects in the cities of Durres, Fier, Lezhe and Saranda. 
According to the Bank, Elkri was involved in fraudulent practices during the bidding process. 
"The debarment may be reduced to two years upon implementation of an effective corporate compliance programme," the Bank said.

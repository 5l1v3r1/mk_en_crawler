THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj became the first defendant sentenced for contempt of court by The Hague war crimes tribunal. 
On Friday (July 24th), the tribunal sentenced him to 15 months in prison for revealing the identity of three protected witnesses in one of his books. 
Seselj mentioned their professions, names and family members, as well as other data and fragments of their written statements. 
He did this despite a court ban on disseminating statements. 
Seselj faces separate charges for war crimes committed against non-Serbs in Croatia, Vojvodina and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 1994.

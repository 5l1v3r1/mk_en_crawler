SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Former BiH President Alija Izetbegovic died Sunday (19 October) at the age of 78. 
Doctors said a heart condition and internal injuries suffered in a recent fall were the cause of death. 
Izetbegovic steered BiH towards independence from the former Yugoslavia and through the conflict of 1992-1995. 
Having served as his country's leader for a full decade, Izetbegovic resigned in 2000 citing poor health and advanced age. 
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Croatian President Stipe Mesic, Slovenian President Janez Drnovsek, and BiH's chief international officer, Paddy Ashdown, issued statements praising him for his role in shaping the Balkans of today. 
The funeral will be held Wednesday.

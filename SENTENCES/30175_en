BUCHAREST, Romania -- The cabinet on Monday (December 20th) survived a no-confidence motion over the 2011 wage bill, initiated by the opposition last week.
The motion needed 236 votes to succeed, but got 190 instead.
Similar to a previous no-confidence vote, ruling coalition lawmakers decided not to vote at all, thus challenging the opposition to demonstrate it has enough votes to bring down the government.
That also assumes no party defections.
Meanwhile, Victor Ponta, leader of the opposition Social Democratic Party, said he would appeal the bill before the Constitutional Court.

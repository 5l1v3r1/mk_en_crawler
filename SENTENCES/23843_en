TIRANA, Albania -- Searchers found two missing Albanian fishermen in Croatian waters near the island of Mljet, but only one survived. 
Authorities say Romeo Purizo was in shock when they found him on Thursday (January 22nd); he could not explain what happened. 
He and two others were aboard a rubber boat Sunday near the southern town of Vlora, but high winds apparently pushed them north to Montenegro, then to Croatia. 
There is no word yet on the third man.
In other news Thursday, the interior ministry announced that 114 people, all of them women, became victims of illegal human trafficking between August 2007 and August 2008. 
It disclosed the statistic during a presentation in Tirana on an anti-trafficking programme financed by the USAID. 
Albania has four social centres to help victims.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A new temporary crossing at Tanusevci-Debelde, on the border between Macedonia and Kosovo, opens Tuesday (8 July), a day after its scheduled opening was delayed for technical reasons. 
The crossing, meant to facilitate travel by villagers on both sides of the border, will be open from April to November and from sunrise to sunset. 
Another crossing at Strezemir-Restelica will open 15 August.
Also Tuesday, Macedonian Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski kicks off a two-day visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina, aimed at strengthening regional co-operation.

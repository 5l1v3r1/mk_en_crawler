STRASBOURG, France -- EP Rapporteur on visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans Tanja Fajon sparked debate at the European Parliament (EP) on Wednesday (September 30th), by asking to include Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) in the process. 
If Brussels includes all five Western Balkans countries in the visa liberalisation process, it would send a positive signal and force them to accept responsibilities, Fajon argued. 
But Daphne Gogou, from the office of Jacques Barrot, European Commission vice president responsible for Justice, Freedom and Security issues, told the EP members that changing the plan would delay the process that already includes Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro. 
Albania and BiH were excluded for failing to meet technical requirements.
In Tirana, meanwhile, Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on Wednesday that Albanians will travel visa-free to Europe within a year. 
He urged all citizens to apply for biometric passports, one of the conditions set by Brussels for Albania to be included in the visa-free regime.

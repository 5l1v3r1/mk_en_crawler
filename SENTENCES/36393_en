BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Democratic Party leader Boris Tadic is disappointed with the government's response to the weekend attack on Gordana Djindjic-Filipovic, the sister of murdered Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
He said Monday (17 May) that he had requested a meeting with Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica but had received no response.
"I find his sluggish reactions very dangerous.
He promised to protect the Djindjic family and is responsible for the behaviour of members of the cabinet," said Tadic, in an apparent reference to Police Minister Dragan Jocic, who faces pressure to resign over the incident.
But there are reports Djindjic-Filipovic had refused police protection.

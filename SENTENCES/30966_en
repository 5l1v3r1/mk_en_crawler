PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The European Commission (EC) sent a letter to the government expressing dissatisfaction with efforts by Kosovo institutions to fight corruption. 
Media reported on Wednesday (December 8th) that the new public procurement law, for example, lacks sufficient mechanisms to deal with problems cited in the EC progress report. 
The law, which took effect at the beginning of December, contains a considerable number of provisions deemed inconsistent with the European criteria for public procurement. 
In its letter, the EC criticises authorities in Pristina for failing to consider its recommendations when drafting the bill.

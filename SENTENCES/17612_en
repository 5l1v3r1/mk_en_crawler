BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu nominated Iuliu Winkler, a junior member of the governing coalition in Bucharest, as the new information technology and communications minister.
The appointment requires approval by President Traian Basescu.
Winkler is a member of the Democratic Union of the Magyars from Romania, a minor government ally.
Former Information Technology and Communications Minister Zsolt Nagy was suspended in June amid controversy over his possible involvement in an energy-related privatisation deal.
Basescu approved prosecutors' request to start probes into Nagy's activities in March.

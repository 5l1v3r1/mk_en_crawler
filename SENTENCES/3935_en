Croatia is due to hold parliamentary elections on November 25th, and a large number of Croatian citizens who now live in Serbia are likely to participate.
Many are ethnic Serbs who fled Croatia in 1995.
"We will do all the things in our power so that Croatian citizens who are living in Serbia can use their citizens' rights and vote in the next Croatian elections," says Serbian Commissar for Refugees Dragisa Dabetic.
Citizens of Croatia have the right to vote anywhere in the world, as long as they can present valid documents.
The process is handled by embassies, consulates or diplomatic missions.
The deadline for registration was Saturday (November 10th).
"Our representatives from the Commissariat for Refugees will visit all collective camps, neighbourhoods and places where we know that refugees from Croatia are living," Dabetic said.
"We will even provide them with free transport so they can come to the voting places.
For most of these people, travelling on the day of elections would be a financial luxury."
Expatriates can vote in Belgrade, Zumun, Subotica, Sombor, Indjija, Sremska Mitrovica and Pancevo, Dabetic says.
"If some of them want to travel to Croatia and vote in their local areas they will be provided with free transport," he adds.
According to the most recent data, around 76,546 exiles from Croatia have refugee status in Serbia, while around 100,000 have become Serbian citizens.
Most of the voters -- 49,893 -- are registered in the 9th election zone, which includes areas in Croatia where the majority of ethnic Serbs lived.
In addition to refugees, members of the Croatian minority in Serbia will also cast votes.
Around 16,000 ethnic Croats live in Vojvodina, a multiethnic province in the north of Serbia.
With dual Croatian and Serbian citizenship, they have the right to vote in both states.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police arrested Stojan Zupljanin, one of the remaining four fugitives indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, at an apartment near Belgrade on Wednesday (June 11th).
Bruno Vekaric, spokesman for Serbia's special war crimes prosecutor's office, said police and security agents participated in the operation that occurred around 12:30pm local time.
Zupljanin will appear before an investigative judge in Belgrade, with extradition to The Hague expected within the next 72 hours.
A former head of Republika Srspska police in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Zupljanin is charged with the ethnic cleansing of Muslim and Croats in the 1992-1995 conflict.
Observers consider his arrest an important step in Serbia's effort to assure the international community it is ready to meet its commitments to The Hague tribunal.

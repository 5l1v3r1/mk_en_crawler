BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn on Tuesday (September 16th) praised Albania's efforts to reform its economy and judicial system but said the country must step up the fight against organised crime and corruption and ensure free elections. 
Albania has to continue reforms that have already strengthened the judiciary and the election system, said Rehn after meeting with Albanian Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha in Brussels. 
Basha stressed his country is ready to fulfil its obligations to advance its EU integration process.
In other news Tuesday, Prime Minister Sali Berisha presented the government's latest achievements in the field of investment, which he attributes to reforms undertaken by his cabinet. 
"We guarantee investors security by implementing fresh reforms," Berisha told a press conference. 
However, the Socialist opposition accused Berisha of trying to divert public attention from the government's alleged responsibility for the death of businessman Kosta Trebicka, a key witness in an investigation of illegal ammunition trading.

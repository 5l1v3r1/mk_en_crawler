SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) on Wednesday (1 June) requested an extraordinary session of parliament to discuss campaign spending ahead of the 25 June parliamentary elections. 
Parliament is currently in recess to allow members to hit the campaign trail. 
BSP leader Sergey Stanishev said the Socialists want lawmakers to discuss government plans for a so-called "election lottery", intended to boost voter turnout.

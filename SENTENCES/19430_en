ATHENS, Greece -- As promised, journalists started a 24-hour strike Tuesday (November 27th) to protest planned pension system reforms. 
The journalists, as well as other unions, oppose the government's plan to merge the Athens Journalists' Primary Pension Fund -- one of the most robust in the country -- with the funds of physicians, engineers and lawyers into a joint Scientists' Fund. 
Newspapers will not be published on Wednesday and only emergency news of general social interest and developments regarding the strike will be broadcast.

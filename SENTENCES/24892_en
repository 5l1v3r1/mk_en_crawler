BERLIN, Germany -- Deputy government spokesman Thomas Steg denied on Monday (December 1st) reports that Germany may cut its financial aid to Kosovo. 
Berlin reportedly considered the move after Kosovo police arrested three agents of Germany's Federal Intelligence Agency in Kosovo last month and detained them for two weeks in connection with an attack on the International Civilian Office in Pristina. 
The three insisted they were innocent. 
Police released them eventually for lack of evidence. 
While Steg denied an aid reduction will be forthcoming, he acknowledged that Berlin intends to inspect how Kosovo is using the German funds it currently receives. 
Berlin will use its findings to determine later contributions, Steg said. 
Germany is Kosovo's second biggest donor.
In other news Monday, police arrested nine guards at Dubrava prison and authorities suspended 18 others in connection with an inmate's brazen escape. 
Bedri Krasniqi was serving a 27-year sentence for the 2002 murders of two police officers. 
Authorities say he left the prison through the main door Sunday after having lunch with relatives. 
His escape went unreported for ten hours.
Separately on Monday, a panel of judges in the Peja municipality convicted 21 people, including inmates, in connection with a group escape from the biggest prison in Kosovo. 
It happened in August 2007; seven inmates managed to flee. 
Two remain at large, but authorities killed two others in Macedonia.

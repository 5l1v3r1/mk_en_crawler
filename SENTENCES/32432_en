SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown has asked all relevant authorities to takes immediate measures in response to a new corruption scandal.
At a news conference Thursday (20 March), he said international auditors discovered losses of some 7.3m euros in the Federation of BiH (FBiH) Ministry of Refugees and Displaced Persons.
Former Deputy Minister Mijat Tuka -- currently a member of the FBiH Parliament -- and three of his close associates are accused of embezzling the money.
Ashdown says they violated tender regulations and procedures and mismanaged donor funding earmarked to rebuild returnees' houses.
As a result, Ashdown asked that Tuka be expelled from parliament within six days.

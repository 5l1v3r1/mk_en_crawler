BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen is urging Albania to stick to the democratic values of the Alliance. 
"I strongly condemn violence and I urge all parties to seek peaceful solutions to political dispute," Rasmussen told his monthly press conference in Brussels on Monday (February 7th). 
Asked to comment on the situation from his position as a former prime minister of Denmark, he said that it is crucial for small countries to reach consensus on major political issues.

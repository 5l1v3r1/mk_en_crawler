A new law approved by the federal parliament last month clears the way for Serbia-Montenegro to participate in peacekeeping missions abroad. 
The first such participation could be in Haiti, according to the head of the country's centre for peacekeeping operations, Colonel Petar Cornakov.
Authorities have already signed a decision to form a 400-soldier battalion for a possible role in the UN's Haiti peacekeeping operation, Cornakov said. 
It would be the first unit from Serbia-Montenegro to join such a mission, though the country has previously sent teams of three to five army officers to participate in missions strictly in a monitoring capacity.
Under the law, missions are to be proposed by the federal Council of Ministers and then sent to lawmakers for consideration. 
"Each mission must be approved by the Serbia-Montenegro Parliament", says Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic. 
Moreover, the law requires that both constituent republics give the go-ahead before Serbia-Montenegro can send peacekeepers abroad. 
It also requires that peacekeepers be withdrawn in cases of "extreme danger", as established by the UN's danger degree system.
Serbia-Montenegro's Army consists mainly of recruits. 
While the new law gives professional soldiers the opportunity to volunteer for international peacekeeping missions, it does not require soldiers who are completing mandatory military service to participate.
According to Cornakov, the proposed Haiti battalion will include an engineering and infantry band, with 150 officers and lieutenant officers each, along with a military police platoon and a medical team with 50 soldiers each. 
After candidates are selected, they will begin training for the mission on 1 February. 
The process will cost 30m euros, Cornakov said. 
The UN pays each peacekeeping soldier 786 euros per month.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal announced Wednesday (19 November) that former NATO Supreme Commander Wesley Clark would testify behind closed doors next month. 
The retired US four-star general is due to appear as a witness in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic on 15 December and 16 December. 
Portions of his testimony that do not affect US national interests would be released. 
Prosecutors want to question him about his contacts with Milosevic during the conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Kosovo. 
Clark led the 78-day NATO action in Belgrade in 1999 and is currently a candidate for US president.

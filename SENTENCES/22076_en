BELGRADE, Serbia -- Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen said on Sunday (October 19th) his country will be among the first to ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Serbia once Belgrade arrests war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic.
Verhagen told the daily Dnevnik that before the parliamentary elections last May, Serbian President Boris Tadic and Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic promised him that if they received a mandate from the people, the new government would arrest Mladic.
"If the EU wants to have the citizens' support for its political expansion, then politicians have to keep the promises they have made," Verhagen said.
He also dismissed claims that the Netherlands is imposing special conditions on Serbia or is the only obstacle to Belgrade's EU accession.
"We have always said that Serbia's place is in the EU, and we are ready to work with it to help it realise its European future," Verhagen said.

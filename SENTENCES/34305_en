SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in BiH, on Wednesday (29 October) issued what he described as a "serious warning" to the Muslim Party of Democratic Action to stop all attempts to influence the local police. 
"We have seen clear, powerful and irrefutable attempts to establish undue political control over the police," he said. 
BiH would not deserve to join the rest of Europe if it continues with these practices, he explained.
Also Wednesday, gunmen opened fire on a car containing the mayor of Tomislavgrad, Zdravko Prka. 
Police are not saying whether he was injured. 
He is the second town official targeted in a month.

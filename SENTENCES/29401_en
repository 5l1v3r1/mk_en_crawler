ANKARA, Turkey -- Over 400 people with suspected links to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) have been arrested in neighbouring Syria, Turkish media reported on Thursday (July 1st).
Officials say that operations that resulted in the arrests began two weeks ago.
Syria says the arrests that were made simultaneously in the cities of Halab, Damascus, Raqqa, Hassake and Kamishli just a day after clashes between Turkish troops and PKK militants in Turkey's southeast province of Siirt claimed 17 lives.
In a televised interview Wednesday, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government launched an initiative last year to improve the rights of the Kurdish minority, called for "more democracy, more justice, more fair distribution of income and more balanced development" to bring an end to terror.
The Turkish military announced on Friday that its jets bombed suspected PKK targets in northern Iraq late Thursday night, but provided no information about possible casualties.

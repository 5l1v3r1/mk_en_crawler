Slovakia offers partnership to Kosovo but continues to oppose its unilaterally declared independence.
This was the message that the top Slovak diplomat brought to Pristina on Tuesday (April 22nd), 64 days after Kosovo proclaimed its sovereignty.
"We discussed co-operation between two countries and affirmed Slovakia wants to be partners with Kosovo," said Slovak Foreign Minister Jan Kubis, following a meeting with Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu.
"The stance of our country remains unchanged," Kubis said.
"Kosovo's final status resolution didn't come from the UN Security Council, as Slovakia had called for.
But this doesn't affect us in reflecting new realities, and therefore I am here to confirm our partnership, and to let you know that we are aiming to assist Kosovo in the field of the economy, as well as other aspects."
He added that Slovakia is "currently monitoring the security that Kosovo has offered to its Serb community".
Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said that he requested Slovak recognition of Kosovo's statehood and said he and Kubis discussed co-operation between Kosovo and Slovakia.
"I believe that the partnership is bilateral and equivalent.
The current refusal of Slovakia to recognise Kosovo is not an obstacle to co-operation," Kuci said.
Slovakia is among several EU members -- also including Spain, Romania and Cyprus -- which have declined to recognise a sovereign Kosovo, in some cases due to worries about setting precedents for separatist movements.
However, senior Bratislava officials do not rule out extending recognition in the future, and Kubis has repeatedly stressed that Kosovo should not be isolated.
Asked at a Pristina press conference if he had arrived in Kosovo or Serbia, Kubis answered, "I am in Kosovo."
He added that his country is ready to contribute to Kosovo as part of both the EULEX mission and of KFOR.

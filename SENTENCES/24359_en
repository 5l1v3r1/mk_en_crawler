NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Human Rights Council said on Tuesday (March 10th) it would launch an investigation into alleged secret detention centres in Romania and Poland reportedly used by the CIA to fight terrorism.
Leading the investigation are UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Manfred Nowak and UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Counter-terrorism Martin Scheinin.
They will visit locations in the two countries, which allegedly hosted such secret centres, including US military bases.
They will also look into more than ten other US military bases around the world, including the base in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It allegedly served as a temporary centre for detainees before their transfer to Guantanamo.

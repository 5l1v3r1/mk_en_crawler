PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX police arrested five people suspected of economic crimes, the EU Rule of Law mission announced on Wednesday (September 15th). 
Two other suspects are abroad, the mission added. 
Unconfirmed media reports suggest the suspects are Kosovo Albanians. 
Four private companies and seven houses were raided across Kosovo as part of the EULEX action that targeted tax evasion, organised crime, fuel smuggling and misuse of economic authorisation.
Meanwhile, KFOR said in a press release Wednesday that some of its soldiers are being investigated for possible fuel smuggling and economic crimes. 
"KFOR welcomes the thorough investigation, and in the case of clear evidence, the criminals should be brought to justice," the press release stated. 
Pristina-based media reported that over the years, Ukrainian members of KFOR have sold around 150 petrol tanks in Kosovo.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Privatisation Agency announced on Thursday (August 21st) that it is suspending the privatisation of disputed assets belonging to the former Yugoslav states.
"The decision on further steps regarding these companies will be taken after consulting experts on the succession of former Yugoslavia," the agency explained.
The move follows an official protest by Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), which claims that 150 BiH firms still own property in Serbia worth up to 1 billion euros.
BiH has threatened to refer the issue to an international court.
Earlier this year, Belgrade angered ex-Yugoslav states by adopting an amendment to the privatisation law that permitted the sale of assets of companies based in Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro, Macedonia and BiH.
The agency proposed a tender for 15 BiH firms in June.

ATHENS, Greece -- Police on Friday (August 8th) found 22 illegal immigrants in an abandoned building in Mandra near Athens.
The immigrants, most of them coming from Pakistan, were reportedly held in horrible conditions and were being blackmailed by the group that smuggled them into Greece.
Reportedly, the families of each of the immigrants had to transfer sums between 4,000 and 6,000 euros to bank accounts of the smugglers.
Police found around 10,000 euros and documents belonging to the immigrants in two cars parked near the building where they were being held.
The vehicles belonged to two Pakistanis.
The police are still looking for two Greeks and two other Pakistanis suspected of belonging to the criminal group.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament adopted in the second reading Thursday (29 June) amendments to the Law on Defence and Armed Forces, abolishing compulsory military service as of 1 January 2008. 
Bulgaria will then have a fully professional army, in keeping with NATO membership requirements. 
Deputy Defence Minister Sonja Yankulova says the cost will be at least 15m euros.

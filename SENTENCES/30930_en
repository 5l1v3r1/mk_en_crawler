ANKARA, Turkey -- Gaps in the law and implementation failures by police, prosecutors, judges and other officials leave many Turkish women and girls unprotected against domestic violence, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a report Wednesday (May 4th).
The 58-page document was presented by the organisation's Europe and Central Asia Researcher Gauri Van Gulik in Istanbul.
It was drafted based on interviews with 40 female victims of domestic violence, as well as lawyers and other officials in the provinces of Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Diyarbakir, Trabzon and Van.
"This research shows that Turkey represents a paradox between practice and legislation in terms of its approach to domestic violence.
Although it is going to host and sign a brand-new convention [on domestic violence] proposed by the EU next week, 42% of women face domestic, physical or sexual violence because of the insincerity of both police and prosecutors in protecting women," Gulik said.

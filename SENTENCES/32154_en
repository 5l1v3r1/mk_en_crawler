LECCE, Italy -- Italian Interior Minister Guiseppe Pisanu and Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano signed an agreement Tuesday (12 November) on a joint effort to fight illegal immigration and human trafficking along Albania's coastline.
The measure is described as an effort to intensify the already existing co-operation against organised crime and human trafficking.
In other news, Italian police announced Tuesday that a joint operation with Dutch authorities has resulted in the dismantling of a major Albanian cocaine-smuggling ring.
Some 41 suspects, 20 of them Italian, have been arrested for buying drugs in the Netherlands, selling them in Italy, laundering the money in the Netherlands, and investing the proceeds in Albania.

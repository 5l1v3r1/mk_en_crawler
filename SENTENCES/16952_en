BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission's progress report on the Western Balkans is expected to tell Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania that they would not be able to join the EU in the near term. 
Citing a draft copy of the document, which is to be released on Wednesday (November 8th), the BBC says that the European Commission expects the next wave of accessions to take place "in the medium to long term". 
Macedonia would be told to speed up democratic political reforms, settle remaining problems with the ethnic Albanian minority and do more to fight crime and corruption. 
The draft reiterates that Serbia must arrest Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic if it wants negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU to resume. 
Belgrade also would be urged to adopt a more pragmatic approach regarding Kosovo.

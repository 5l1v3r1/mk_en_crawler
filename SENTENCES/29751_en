THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- In their closing arguments Tuesday (March 29th), prosecutors asked the UN war crimes tribunal to convict former Yugoslav Army Chief of General Staff Momcilo Perisic and sentence him to life in prison.

Perisic is charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes committed between 1993 and 1995 during the conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.

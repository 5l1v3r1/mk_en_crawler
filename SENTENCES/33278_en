BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Adil Osmanovic, the Muslim vice president of Republika Srpska, told a local newspaper on Saturday (10 May) that officials in the entity's defence and security departments are helping wartime leader Radovan Karadzic evade justice. 
He also said that a network of businessmen is funding the UN tribunal's most wanted suspect, and cited lack of political will as the reason Republika Srpska has so far not arrested a single war crime suspect. 
Dragan Cavic, the entity's president, denied later on Saturday that officials are helping Karadzic. 
He said he had raised the issue with the defence and interior ministers but was satisfied that they had no information about Karadzic's whereabouts.

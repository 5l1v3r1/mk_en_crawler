SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Sarajevo-based International Commission for Missing Persons (ICMP) says it wants to share its expertise worldwide and become a hub for the identification of missing people. 
"Effectively, we have the biggest human identification laboratory in the world," ICMP head Kathryne Bomberger told Reuters on Tuesday (June 3rd). 
She added that the ICMP's expertise and capabilities could help identification in other war-torn countries such as Lebanon, Colombia and Iraq, and assist in the aftermaths of natural disasters such as the Asian tsunami or Hurricane Katrina. 
In BiH, the ICMP has identified 11,000 of the 17,000 bodies exhumed from mass graves.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) police raided the homes of two close associates of fugitive Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic Tuesday (February 19th) in a bid to learn more about his whereabouts.
RS police spokesperson Tamara Maric said officers searched the home of Karadzic's former driver, Sava Regoje, in the central Bosnian town of Doboj, and that of his former bodyguard, Predrag Blagojevic, in the northeastern town of Bijeljina.
Both men are believed to be part of Karadzic's support network.
Police seized computers, phones, CDs and other items during the search.
Karadzic, wanted by the UN tribunal in The Hague, has been on the run for 12 years.

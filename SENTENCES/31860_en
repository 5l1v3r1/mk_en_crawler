BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- The parliaments of Serbia and Montenegro failed to adopt the new constitutional charter by the end of 2002. 
Democratic Opposition of Serbia parliamentary whip Cedomir Jovanovic blames Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia and Montenegro's opposition Socialist People's Party for obstructing the process. 
Although agreement on the final text was reached, the commission drafting the charter failed to agree Sunday (29 December) on the law for implementing it. 
Yugoslav Parliament Chairman Dragoljub Micunovic says the commission will meet either later this week or next week to complete the process.
Meanwhile, Serbian Parliament Speaker and acting President Natasa Micic said Monday that she would decide on 8 February when to schedule the next round of presidential elections. 
She assumed the presidency after Milan Milutinovic's mandate ended earlier this week.

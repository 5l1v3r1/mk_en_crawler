PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The European Commission (EC) believes that issuing biometric passports at the moment is dangerous for Kosovo. 
The EC liaison office in Pristina has sent a letter signed by EU Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom, advising the government not to issue biometric passports before regulating the civil registry and civil status issue properly, local media reported on Friday (June 4th). 
According to media reports, if Pristina authorities ignore the recommendation, the visa liberalisation process will be further delayed.

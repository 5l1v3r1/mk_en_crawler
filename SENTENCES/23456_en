BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic announced on Tuesday (April 28th) that Serbia will open a trio of new consulates in Montenegro, the first step to normalise relations between the two countries since Podgorica recognised Kosovo.
Jeremic told RTS that the new consulates will open in Niksic, Herzeg Novi and Bijelo Polje.
He also said Serbia plans to open another consular service in the Croatian town of Knin, the former "capital" of the self-proclaimed republic of Srpska Krajina.
It will close the consulate in the port of Rijeka.
In other news, a court on Monday sentenced defendant Damir Mandic to 30 years in prison for complicity in the murder of a popular opposition newspaper editor.
Dusko Jovanovic of the Dan newspaper was shot to death in May 2004.
Mandic, a karate professional, won acquittal in an earlier trial.
This verdict came during a retrial.

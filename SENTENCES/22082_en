TIRANA, Albania -- A court on Wednesday (November 19th) sentenced a British national to 20 years in prison for paedophilia. 
The court convicted David Brown, 57, of sexual violence against two children, ages 9 and 10, in an orphanage in the Albanian town of Elbasan. 
Brown worked for a humanitarian organisation. 
After he completes his sentence in a high-security facility, Albania will deport him.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, leader of the ruling VMRO-DPMNE, met with Ali Ahmeti, leader of the opposition ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) on Wednesday (March 7th), signalling the resumption of a political dialogue that had been blocked for months.
Senior EU and US diplomatic officials also attended the talks, which focused on thorny issues that led to a DUI boycott of Parliament.
After the meeting, Gruevski said his party was generally inclined to accept DUI's requests concerning party representation in Parliament's committee for interethnic relations, and in preparing a list of minority-related laws that should be adopted under the so-called Badinter principle.
Also Wednesday, DUI asked the Constitutional Court to review the legality of a pair of new laws -- on police and broadcasting -- that DUI says should have been come under the Badinter principle.

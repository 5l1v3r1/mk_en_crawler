BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU security chief Javier Solana's spokeswoman Cristina Gallach has denied speculation by the Serbian newspaper Vecernje Novosti that the EU wants to propose the creation of a Kosovo-Serbia federation.
The newspaper described it as a temporary stop for Kosovo on its way to independence.
On Tuesday, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica dismissed the idea as "nonsense" .
Also Tuesday, the Slovenian Foreign Ministry rejected a report in the Financial Times that it would try to convince Serbia to trade EU membership for Kosovo's independence.
Slovenia takes over the rotating EU presidency next year.

SARAJEVO,Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prosecutors confirmed on Friday (7 July) that they have filed war crimes charges against Momcilo Mandic, a businessman and former Republika Srpska justice minister, who already is standing trial before the BiH State Court for organised crime and embezzlement.
Mandic's lawyer says the war crimes charges stem from the period when Mandic served as Bosnian Serb justice minister in Radovan Karadzic's government, during the first year of the BiH conflict.

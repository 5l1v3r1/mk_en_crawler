SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- An audit of the Bijeljina-based Orao Aviation Institute will begin Thursday (7 November), Republika Srpska (RS) Supreme Auditor Bosko Ceko announced.
He said that for the time being, the government has submitted no other requests for such audits.
Meanwhile, RS authorities issued a statement, clarifying that a planned visit to Iraq by a government delegation in March 2001 had nothing to do with Orao.
According to the government, it was intended to discuss joining Iraq's Oil for Food Programme.
Orao stands accused of supplying military spare parts and expertise to Baghdad in violation of UN sanctions.
In other news, BiH is launching a two-year programme aimed at assessing the human rights situation in 48 municipalities.
The findings will be used to pinpoint abuses and obstacles to sustainable development.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former British Foreign Secretary David Owen is due to appear before the UN war crimes tribunal on Monday (3 November) to testify about links between Slobodan Milosevic and the Bosnian Serb government from 1992-1995. 
Owen was Europe's top peace broker during that period. 
In a written statement for the court, he said Milosevic was in full control of the Bosnian Serb leadership until sometime in 1993. 
Radovan Karadzic then started to distance himself from the Serbian president. 
In August of 1993 Owen wrote that it was "obvious that Milosevic's influence among Bosnian Serbs had waned ... 
and (Bosnian Serb military commander) Mladic was increasingly difficult to control." This statement could thus distance Milosevic from the 1995 Srebrenica massacre while blaming him for the start of the conflict.

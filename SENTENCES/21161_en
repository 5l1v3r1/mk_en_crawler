PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- "Violence is not an option, violence won't be tolerated and can't be tolerated," NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said during a brief visit to Kosovo on Friday (November 30th). 
He went on to add that the commanders of KFOR will call in reinforcements if the situation deteriorates. 
"KFOR is here and will stay here to protect every Kosovo citizen, majority and minority alike," de Hoop Scheffer said.
In other news Friday, Serbia blocked a declaration on Kosovo proposed at the OSCE ministerial session in Madrid. 
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic told journalists Belgrade objected to a stipulation that said that the OSCE mission should continue its activities regardless of the future status of Kosovo. 
"This is absolutely unacceptable," Jeremic said, adding that it is unnecessary "to separate a certain aspect of the international presence in Kosovo".

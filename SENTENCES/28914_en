ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey plans to deploy military units composed of professional soldiers on its border with Iraq in an effort to stop Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq from penetrating its territory, Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul said on Tuesday (November 9th).
In the first stage, the army will hire about 50,000 people for at least three years to participate in the fight against terrorism, the minister explained.
However, he stopped short of setting a timeframe for the possible deployment of the professional force.
In other news Tuesday, Turkish President Abdullah Gul received the annual Chatham House Prize from Queen Elizabeth II at a ceremony in London.
Gul was distinguished for deepening Ankara's ties with the Middle East, its mediation role between opposing groups in Iraq and efforts to bring together the Afghan and Pakistani leadership to resolve their disputes.

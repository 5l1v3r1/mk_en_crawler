ANKARA, Turkey -- Two Kurdish militants, members of the outlawed separatist Kurdistan People's Party (PKK), were killed in clashes with Turkish security forces in the eastern province of Tunceli, according to local authorities Sunday (21 August). 
The fighting happened near the village of Bozagakaraderbent. 
Last week, Belgian authorities banned -- at Turkey's request -- a scheduled news conference in Brussels by PKK leader Zubeyir Aydar, who was to announce a one-month ceasefire in Turkey.
In other news, a new poll conducted in Finland indicates scepticism towards Turkey's entry in the EU, according to the Brussels-based Web publication EU Observer. 
The survey, conducted for the Finnish MTV3, found that 47 per cent of Finns oppose Turkey's EU membership; 36 per cent support it and 18 per cent are undecided. 
Accession negotiations with Ankara are to begin on 3 October.

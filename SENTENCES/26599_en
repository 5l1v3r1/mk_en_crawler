BUCHAREST, Romania -- As promised, the Social Democratic Party (PSD) asked the Constitutional Court on Tuesday (December 8th) to nullify the results of Sunday's presidential run-off, arguing numerous violations affected the outcome. 
However, it is unclear what specific evidence the PSD has provided. 
Incumbent Traian Basescu edged out PSD leader Mircea Geoana in the run-off, despite polls before the vote that suggested Geoana would win by a comfortable margin. 
The Constitutional Court is expected to rule shortly.

SOFIA, Bulgaria - The country holds its first-ever elections for European Parliament (EP) on Sunday (May 20th). 
Voters will choose 18 candidates who will serve in the EP Parliament until June 2009. 
The mandate is usually five years, but both Bulgaria and its neighbour Romania joined half way through the 2004-2009 term. 
A new poll suggests there will be record low turnout in Bulgaria.
On Thursday meanwhile, Parliament failed to ratify the agreement with Russia and Greece on the Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline, due to the lack of a quorum. 
MPs from smaller ruling coalition parties let the opposition postpone the debate. 
Bulgaria has a 24.5% share in the project, which would provide Russian oil to Bulgaria and Greece, and potentially beyond.

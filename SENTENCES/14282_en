SOFIA, Bulgaria -- EU Commissioner for Enlargement Olli Rehn, in Sofia Friday (14 October), reiterated that reform of the judicial system remains the country's single largest challenge. 
Rehn paid a daylong visit to Bulgaria, and met with Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin and European Affairs Minister Meglena Kuneva. 
Acknowledging the impressive level of reforms so far, Rehn said there is no time to waste. 
Parliament adopted the last remaining amendments to the penal procedure code Friday morning.
On Thursday, Rehn was in Bucharest, again stressing that if reforms are delayed, the EU would not hesitate to activate the safeguard clause that would delay Romania's admission by one year. 
He urged more efforts to boost transparency in the business environment and in fighting corruption.

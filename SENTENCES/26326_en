NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cypriot President Demetris Christovias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat discussed EU issues on Tuesday (March 16th) at a meeting as part of ongoing intensified talks on the reunification of the divided island.
Talks are expected to make a break for elections in the Turkish Cypriot on April 18th.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who spoke to his special adviser for Cyprus Alexander Downer over the phone after the meeting, told journalists in New York that it is "very important" that the two leaders continue talks despite the electoral campaign in the north.
"We hope that if the two leaders can issue some joint statement on the agreement they will have made, that is my sincere hope.
I have asked Mr. Downer to do his best to facilitate to make progress," Ban said.
Downer announced that the next meeting between Talat and Christofias will be on March 30th.

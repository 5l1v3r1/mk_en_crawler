BRUSSELS, Belgium -- High Representative to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Valentin Inzko told NATO's North Atlantic Council that BiH must make progress in implementing its Individual Partnership Action Plan and the Planning and Review Process. 
"Tying BiH into NATO would prove invaluable to BiH's relations in the region and will give a boost to the EU integration process," Inzko pointed out Wednesday (November 11th). 
BiH submitted its official request to join the Membership Action Plan in early October. 
Inzko also voiced hope that BiH's 2010 budget will include funds needed to modernise its army. 
In Brussels, Inzko also met with NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen.

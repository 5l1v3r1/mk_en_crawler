TIRANA, Albania -- During a debate in parliament on Thursday (November 2nd), the various political parties again failed to reach a consensus on electoral reform.
This time, the sticking point was the mandate of the Ad Hoc Commission on Electoral Reform.
The majority wants it to wrap up work by November 10th, while the opposition insists its mandate should be extended until January.
The larger issue is exactly when local elections will be held.
The opposition wants them delayed from winter to spring, to prevent harsh weather from affecting turnout.
OSCE Ambassador to Tirana Pavel Vacek weighed in on Thursday, telling Panorama newspaper that the election should not depend on the weather.

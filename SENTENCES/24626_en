ANKARA, Turkey -- After receiving an unspecified ransom, Somali pirates released a Turkish ship Wednesday (January 7th) that they seized in late October.
The vessel, Yasa Neslihan, then headed to its original destination, China, with all 20 crewmen on board.
Pirates seized the ship, sailing under the flag of the Marshall Islands, on October 29th.
The pirates initially demanded a ransom of 7.3m euros but likely received much less.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- There will be no new Dayton-style accord aimed at determining Kosovo's final status, Russia's representative in the international troika of mediators in the Kosovo status dispute, Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko, told the Vecernje Novosti daily on Thursday (October 11th).
Kharchenko said that such a conference would result in a mechanism that would allow the West to impose its views.
All along, Moscow and Belgrade have insisted that Kosovo's status should be decided through negotiations within the UN Security Council.

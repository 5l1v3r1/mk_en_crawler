THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The Serbian lawyers representing Slobodan Milosevic say the trial must be suspended due to his poor health, The New York Times reported Sunday (13 November).
The barristers cited the opinion of a three-member medical team that examined the defendant on 4 November.
The doctors concluded that Milosevic needs a break of at least six weeks.
The judges could, however, order the hearings to continue with the defendant being represented by his two court-appointed British lawyers.
The tribunal noted that Milosevic has spent so much time on charges related to Kosovo that he has not begun addressing charges related to the conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.

OHRID, Macedonia â At a weekend forum in Ohrid, leading Albanian and Macedonian academicians discussed preparations under way to publish new editions on national history in both Albania and Macedonia.
They agreed that history must be objective but uniting, given the common goals of democratisation and Euro-Atlantic integration.
The academicians also voiced opposition to revising the history of the Balkans, saying that the past must be left behind, while increased co-operation must be cultivated for the sake of a better future.
A furor broke out in March after a prominent Macedonian historian called for territorial exchanges between Albania and Macedonia, saying there was a historical basis for redrawing the map."
In other news, representatives of Albanian and Montenegrin border municipalities met in Shkodra on Saturday (October 28th) to discuss trans-border co-operation projects.
Participants stressed the need to boost efforts in border checks and transportation.

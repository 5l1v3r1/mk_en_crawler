BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu promulgated the law on parliamentarians' pensions Thursday (20 April), providing lawmakers with up to 80 per cent of their last salary, based on the number of terms they have served.
The measure was returned to parliament twice for revision -- once by Basescu and then by the Constitutional Court.
Basescu had insisted the initial version was overly generous to the deputies.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police searched the homes of several former military and police officers Wednesday (December 9th) as part of the ongoing effort to find the so-called "artillery diaries", documents related to 1995's Operation Storm.
Prosecutors at the UN war crimes tribunal have requested the documents be turned over to them for use in upcoming trials involving a handful of retired generals.
One of the homes searched on Wednesday was that of former General Rahim Ademi.
Police also searched the homes of close associates of General Ante Gotovina and Marin Ivanovic, a member of Gotovina's defence team.

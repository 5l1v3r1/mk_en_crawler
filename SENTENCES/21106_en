SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Some actions by BiH Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj are harming the country, Prime Minister Nikola Spiric told the newspaper Nezavisne Novinje on Thursday (August 2nd).
He said Alkalaj seems to be following a policy that only produces new tensions.
"I have the feeling Alkalaj is moving against all others," he said.
The specific catalyst for criticism was Alkalaj's decision to order his ministry to buy 100 Arabic language books by Bosnian Muslim author Nijaz Durakovic, reportedly at the request of Haris Silajdzic, the Bosniak presidency member.
Spiric said he already has had one conversation with Alkalaj but it produced little result.

ATHENS, Greece -- The 28th Olympic Games open in Athens on Friday (13 August). 
Thousands of Athenians gathered in the streets Thursday evening to welcome the arrival of the Olympic Flame on the hill of the Acropolis, where a special ceremony was held. 
The Flame will be transferred to the Olympic Stadium for the official opening. 
An estimated four billion viewers around the world will watch it on TV. 
More than 4,000 performers will take part in the opening ceremony; 201 delegations will march in the parade of nations. 
Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, the head of the Athens Olympic Organising Committee, said Thursday that the Games would be a success. 
"What we promised we will deliver -- trust us," she said.
Earlier in the day Thursday, Mustafa Akinci became the first Turkish Cypriot politician to use the airport in Larnaca in the Greek part of the divided island, as he departed for Athens. 
He said this was a gesture showing his compatriots' desire for peace.
Thursday night, Greek fans were devastated to hear that the country's top athlete, Costas Kenteris, a 200m gold medallist from Sydney, and fellow sprinting medallist Katerina Thanou were involved in a motorcycle accident shortly after failing to appear for a doping test. 
The International Olympic Committee treats missed appointments as failed tests and suspends those involved.

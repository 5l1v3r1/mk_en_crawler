ROME, Italy -- The Italian presidency of the EU sent a note to Serbian authorities expressing the hope that the 16 November presidential elections will be successful in reaching the required turnout of 50 per cent.
The letter also urges consolidation of democracy and democratic institutions in Serbia.
A recent poll by the Institute for Social Sciences in Belgrade shows the turnout for the presidential elections might exceed 50 per cent, but firm conclusions are not possible.
The presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), Dragoljub Micunovic, is leading the poll with 29 per cent of the vote, followed by Tomislav Nikolic, candidate of the Serbian Radical Party, who is drawing around 11 per cent.
Meanwhile, the Civil Alliance of Serbia will insist on early parliamentary elections by the end of the year, party leader and Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic said Friday (7 November).
He pledged to ask DOS to support the initiative, but did not forecast possible reactions.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Great Britain sent some 200 British peacekeepers to Kosovo on Saturday (May 24th). 
They are part of the 600 additional troops Britain deployed to help NATO's peacekeeping effort. 
The troops will serve in the volatile northern part of Kosovo, where local Serbs have rejected Kosovo independence and clashed with UN personnel. 
NATO has approximately 16,000 troops in Kosovo.

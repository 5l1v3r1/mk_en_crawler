BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Liberal Democratic Party (PDL), a partner in the ruling coalition, has ruled out the possibility of holding early presidential elections in June together with the scheduled European Parliament elections, media reported on Sunday (March 29th).
The PDL's announcement refuted a previous one by Transport Minister Radu Berceanu, who suggested holding the two votes at the same time.
PDL deputy leader Cezar Preda said this idea had received neither discussion nor consideration.
Prime Minister Emil Boc also denied any discussions in the ruling coalition or with President Traian Basescu about such a proposal.

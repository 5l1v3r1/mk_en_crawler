SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Macedonian government has asked Kosovo authorities to start demarcating their common border as soon as possible, government spokesperson Ivica Bocevski announced on Wednesday (February 27th).
The issue should be resolved quickly to avoid regional instability, President Branko Crvenkovski said at a meeting with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana in Brussels.
The border demarcation process between Macedonia and Kosovo should be implemented within 120 days of Kosovo's declaration of independence, which took place on February 17th.
Meanwhile, US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried said in an interview Wednesday with Macedonian radio station Kanal 77 that Washington will not pressure Skopje into recognising Kosovo.
"This is a big decision," Fried said.

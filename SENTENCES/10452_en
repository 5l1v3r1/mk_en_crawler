TIRANA, Albania -- Minister of State Marko Bello reconfirmed Thursday (16 September) the country's commitment to EU integration and related reforms. 
The statement was made in response to criticism from the EU presidency over the slow pace of reforms in Albania. 
Bello said the government appreciated the recommendations, adding that problems identified in the EU statement were the focus of the country's recently presented European Partnership Action Plan.
In other news Thursday, an armed MiG-19 exploded shortly after taking off from Tirana Airport, killing the pilot and forcing a suspension of international flights. 
Rescuers were unable to reach the scene of the accident, just outside the airfield's perimeter, because of exploding ordnance. 
Officials attributed the accident to engine failure.

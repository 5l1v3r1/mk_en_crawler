SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The two main ethnic Albanian parties, the Democratic Union of Integration (DUI), and the Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDP), have agreed to remain in a coalition. 
Party leaders Ali Ahmeti and Abdulhadi Vejseli met on Monday (March 19th) to discuss the issue, dismissing rumours of serious rifts in the coalition as speculation. 
They said the parties are now discussing topics they would like to sort out with the ruling VMRO-DPMNE in a bid to revive long-stalled political dialogue.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Officials dismissed a report by a US-based rights organisation that claimed those in the country's mental institutions are subjected to deplorable conditions. 
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica described the report as part of a systematic campaign to discredit his country. 
He also accused Mental Disability Rights International (MDRI) of releasing its findings at a crucial time in the Kosovo status process. 
He did, however, promise an investigation into conditions at long-term mental institutions. 
The report, prepared over a period of four years, described "filthy conditions, contagious diseases and lack of medical care and rehabilitation".

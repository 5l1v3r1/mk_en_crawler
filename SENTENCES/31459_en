PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- Serb lawmakers decided to return to the provincial assembly in Pristina, a leading member of the Povratak faction announced on Friday (January 24).
The decision was made at a conference in Mitrovica following meetings with officials in Belgrade, Serbian Patriarch Pavle, foreign ambassadors and members of the UN mission.Chief UN envoy Michael Steiner welcomed the decision, saying "the best way for the Serbian community to address their problems in Kosovo is by participating fully in the institutions." The Serb deputies, who are the third largest political force in the assembly, will attend the next session on 6 February.
In Belgrade, meanwhile, the presidency of the ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia decided Saturday to ask UNMIK for return of at least one Yugoslav security unit to the province.
Leaders of smaller opposition parties in Serbia reacted positively to the ruling coalition's decision but called for consultations on a joint political stand.

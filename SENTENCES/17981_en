VIENNA, Austria -- The last round of UN-mediated talks on Kosovo, focused on the UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's status plan, began between the Belgrade and Pristina delegations in Vienna on Wednesday (February 21st). 
These negotiations, which will last until March 2nd, provide each side the opportunity to scrutinise the document and critique every chapter and annex. 
A final review would take place on March 10th, after which Ahtisaari plans to submit the document to the UN Security Council for approval. 
Prior to the start of the Vienna meeting, Ahtisaari acknowledged that compromise is unlikely.
In other news, Ahtisaari told the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna on Tuesday that the OSCE should continue playing a strong role in Kosovo in the future. 
The organisation has been actively engaged in the province since 1998.

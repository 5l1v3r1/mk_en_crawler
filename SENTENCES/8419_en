Russia's Eight Tenors and British violin virtuoso Nigel Kennedy are among the distinguished lineup of artists thrilling crowds this year in the ancient city of Ohrid, home to one of Southeast Europe's best-known cultural events.
The festival, now in its 51st year, began in mid-July and will continue until late August.
French piano duo Frederic Chauvel and Mark Sole-Leris are among the other international performers at this summer's event. 
Audiences also had the chance to appreciate the talents of American clarinetist Charles Neidich, Japanese pianist Katsura Mizumoto and Germany's Alliage Quintet.
The regional presence has been strong also. 
Vlatko Stefanovski and Stefan Milenkovic, acclaimed as one of the leading guitar and violin duos in the Balkans, were among the musical luminaries. 
Drama performances included a staging of Euripides' "Electra" by the Pula Theatre of Croatia, as well as the Bulgarian Sfumato Theatre's rendition of Shakespeare's "A Winter's Tale".
Meanwhile, art exhibits – among them, one featuring works from the Warsaw-based Museum of Cariacture and Cartoon Art – provided enjoyment for connoisseurs.

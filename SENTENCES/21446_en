SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Foreign experts will advise key institutions on the distribution of EU funds, Deputy Prime Minister Meglena Plugchieva announced on Sunday (August 24th). 
This includes the newly restructured road fund, the payment agency at the finance and agriculture ministries and the justice ministry. 
Another measure being prepared is a blacklist to bar people and companies from applying for EU funds if they committed past violations. 
Last week, Bulgarian authorities met with the visiting chief of the EU's Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), Franz-Hermann Bruner, who reiterated that concrete results are essential in the fight against corruption and organised crime, as well as stronger controls over the distribution of EU funds.

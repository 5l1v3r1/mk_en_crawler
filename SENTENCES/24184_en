CHISINAU, Moldova -- Agents of Romania's security services and nine Serb nationals incited the violent protests in Chisinau a week ago, Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin told the Spanish newspaper El Pais.
In an interview published on Monday (April 13th), he claimed those who "directed" the protests had no interest in the outcome of the April 5th parliamentary elections but sought instead to take advantage of the moment to organise a "revolution" two days later.
"We have everything on video, and we can identify the faces of all the people who attacked the police," he added.
Thousands of people protested the outcome of the elections, which the Communist Party won.
Demonstrators stormed government buildings, including parliament.
Two people died in the clashes, and police detained 166 protesters.

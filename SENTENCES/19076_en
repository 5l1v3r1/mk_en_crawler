THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic failed to appear on Tuesday (May 1st) as a witness in the trial against former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic.
He and five others are charged in connection with alleged war crimes in Kosovo.
The tribunal issued a statement, saying Lilic had notified the court that he had been taken to hospital in Belgrade at the weekend.
Prosecutors say they want to know by the week's end whether Lilic would be able to attend the trial after all, or would give testimony via videoconference from Belgrade.
During the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict, he served as a security adviser to then Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Netherlands will complete ratification of the EU Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Croatia within weeks, the Dutch Foreign Ministry said Wednesday (28 April). 
The Dutch Parliament has endorsed the SAA, but the ratification process was halted due to government dissatisfaction with the level of co-operation Croatia was providing to the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
In other news, Croatia and Slovenia opened a new border checkpoint on Wednesday, one of three crossings being operated in line with the Schengen security system requirements. 
The checkpoint includes customs, police, veterinary, sanitary and health control offices.

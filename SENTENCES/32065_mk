BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Serbia's Parliament will review possible changes to the election law Friday (18 October), following the failed presidential run-off. 
Parliament Speaker Natasa Micic says the session was called at the request of the ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia. 
At issue is whether to eliminate altogether the minimum voter turnout requirement.Because turnout fell below 50 per cent, neither Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica nor Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Moroljub Labus won Sunday's run-off.
Meanwhile, UNMIK chief Michael Steiner is urging Kosovo Serbs to take part in local elections in the province, scheduled for 26 October. 
He maintains that failing to participate would hinder efforts towards decentralisation and the mass return of refugees.

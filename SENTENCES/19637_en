BELGRADE, Serbia -- Chief UN Prosecutor Carla del Ponte said Friday (October 26) in Belgrade that Serbia now has the political will to arrest former Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic, although some officials are stalling the effort.
She insisted that Mladic is within reach of the authorities in Serbia.
Del Ponte also urged the EU to continue to press Serbia to improve its co-operation with the international prosecutors.
She said the Union should not sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Belgrade until Mladic is arrested and extradited to The Hague.
The EU, awaiting del Ponte's report, has delayed initialing the SAA.
Rasim Ljajic, the Serbian minister in charge of co-operation with the tribunal, denied government officials had any idea of the fugitive's whereabouts.
Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica issued separate statements reiterating the authorities' determination to track down Mladic and the two other Serbian war crimes suspects still at large.

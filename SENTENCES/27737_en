PARIS, France -- Romanian Interior Minister Vasile Blaga said on Wednesday (August 25th) that the repatriation of Romas who had settled illegally in France will not hamper his country's admission to the Schengen zone.
He added that the European border security agency, Frontex, believes there is not the slightest risk to Bucharest's bid to join the visa-free area.
He and other Romanian officials are in Paris to discuss the controversial repatriations, which France began this month to boost security.
Separately Wednesday, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nikolai Mladenov expressed support for the decision to repatriate Bulgarian and Romanian Roma who are illegally on French territory.
He said Sofia also has the right to expel foreigners who do not abide by Bulgarian laws.
Meanwhile, EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding expressed concern on Wednesday over Paris' repatriation move.
"It is clear that those who break the law need to face consequences," Reding said, adding "it is equally clear that nobody should face expulsion just for being Roma." (Deutsche Welle, DPA, Standart, Gandul, Dnevnik, France24 - 25/08/10)

HELSINKI, Finland -- Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen says his country hopes discussions on the EU entry of Bulgaria and Romania are completed during Finland's term as EU president, which ends in December. 
In an interview Saturday (9 September) on the Euronews TV channel, Vanhanen recalled that the decision to invite the two countries to join the EU was made during Finland's previous EU presidency and said it would be nice to complete the process this way. 
The EU has not yet determined if Bulgaria and Romania will join on 1 January 2007 or see their accession delayed under a safeguard clause.
In other news, Bulgarian Deputy Chief Prosecutor Valeri Parvanov announced on Friday that, in addition to the charges filed against seven regional prosecutors, ten magistrates in Sofia are being investigated for procedural violations and delays. 
The EU has cited inefficiency within the judicial system as an area of concern in the accession process.

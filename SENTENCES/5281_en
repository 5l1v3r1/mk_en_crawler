Kosovo Border Police (KBP) Director Shaban Guda says the force is dedicated to fulfilling its mandate to monitor and control its borders with its neighbours.
SETimes correspondent Linda Karadaku interviewed Guda about the most problematic parts of the border with Serbia, a country does not recognise Kosovo and considers its borders as administrative boundaries.
SETimes:
Which part of the border does the KBP control?
Shaban Guda:
The KBP is responsible for all border crossings except at Jarinje and Bernjak (Serbia), where EULEX police still have the mandate.
Since April 28th, KBP has had the mandate to monitor Kosovo's border with Albania, which is 113.55km in length, while KFOR maintains the rest of the border.
The total length of Kosovo's border is 743.55km.
The situation in the part of the border that KBP controls and monitors is calm, but there is some cross-border crime.
SETimes:
What cross-border agreements have you reached so far?
Guda:
We have an agreement for cross-border police co-operation with Albania, and we are putting the final touches on an agreement for police co-operation with Macedonia.
SETimes:
What about co-operation with neighbouring countries to fight smuggling and organised crime?
Guda:
There is a good co-operation in fighting cross-border crime with all the neighbouring countries.
The most problematic part of the border is with Serbia because we have no co-operation.
Cross-border crime can't be fought without such co-operation.
SETimes:
What is the situation at the border between Kosovo and Serbia, at the two main border crossings in Merdare and in the northern part of Kosovo?
Guda:
Aside from the two border crossings in Jarinje and Bernjak -- all standards of border control are applied at the crossing at Merdare, which is under KBP control.
There are a lot of problems in the northern part of the border such as illegal crossings, smuggling goods and uncontrolled entering of the border.
SETimes:
Kosovo citizens who live close to the border with Montenegro have protested the border demarcation.
How much do they influence in the work of the KBP?
Guda:
One of the main elements to exercise control and monitoring of the border is the demarcation of the borderline with neighbouring countries.
This problem did not exist with Albania, it does not exist with Macedonia, but we still have a problem with the part of the border with Montenegro and Serbia.
SETimes:
What do you see as a solution to the problem of controlling the border with Serbia in Kosovo's north?

ANKARA, Turkey -- Lawmakers of the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) who earlier intended to give up their mandates after their party was banned by the Constitutional Court, decided on Friday (December 18th) to remain in parliament as members of another political organisation.
DTP leader Ahmet Turk said that the group will join the Peace and Democracy (BDP), a small Kurdish group that was founded recently.
He added that DTP supporters and jailed leader of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) Abdullah Ocalan have urged lawmakers not to give up their mandates.
On December 11th, the Constitutional Court decided to ban the DTP based on its alleged links with the PKK.
The decision spurred mass Kurd protests in the country.

TIRANA, Albania -- The major opposition Democratic Party (DP) demanded Friday (24 October) that the cabinet either resign or face a no confidence vote.
The demand follows Prime Minister Fatos Nano's controversial decision to have deputy ministers run the interior and foreign affairs ministries due to parliament's rejection of his ministerial nominees.
DP says the inability to pick ministers should open the doors to talks with the president about a next step.

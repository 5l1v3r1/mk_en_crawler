NICOSIA, Cyprus -- General Yasar Buyukanit, Turkey's chief of general staff, said on Saturday (March 29th) that Turkish troops would not withdraw from Cyprus until a reunification agreement is struck and security is re-established.
Buyukanit, who wrapped up a four-day visit to northern Cyprus, insisted the presence of the Turkish troops guarantees peace on the island.
He also said that Turkey fully supports efforts to end the decades-long division and the recent agreement between new Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat to resume negotiations in June.
More immediately, the two leaders agreed to re-open the Ledra Street crossing in Nicosia.
That is likely this week, in fact, after mine-clearing efforts and other preparations are complete.
On Friday, a UN mine-clearing expert stepped on a mine in Athienou, east of Cyprus, and lost part of a leg.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Paddy Ashdown, the international community's high representative in BiH, told Bosnian Serb authorities on Friday (31 December) that they must finally start to arrest war crimes suspects if they want their country to join the EU and NATO. 
"New spirit and hopeful words are not enough. 
Results have to be delivered," Ashdown said in his New Year's message.
In other news, General David Leakey, the British commander of EUFOR, said that Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic are probably hiding outside BiH, but returning to the country often. 
He said that retired Croatian General Ante Gotovina, the UN tribunal's third most wanted suspect, might be spending most of his time in Croat-dominated areas of BiH, rather than in Croatia or other countries.
On Monday, meanwhile, the six main parties in Republika Srpska resume talks on forming a new entity government. 
They face a Saturday deadline.

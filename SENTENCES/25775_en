SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The foreign ministry said in a statement Friday (February 19th) that Bulgaria has held no official talks with Washington on hosting elements of the planned US missile defence shield. 
The statement came in response to Russia's request on Thursday for an explanation, after Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said last week that preliminary talks with Washington will be held. 
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Vesela Cherneva said on Friday that Sofia has received no official invitation to such talks, adding that the country will continue to adhere to NATO's joint security and defence decision-making policy.

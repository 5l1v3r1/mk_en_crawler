ZAGREB, Croatia -- The deadline set by the Croatian government for all ministries to submit their answers to the European Commission's questionnaire expires Friday (22 August).
The ministry of European integration will review the information and submit a compilation to the government for discussion within the next 30 days.
The cabinet is expected to submit the completed questionnaire to Brussels in early October.
The lengthy document includes over 2,000 questions and is key to eventual EU membership.

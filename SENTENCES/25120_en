ZAGREB, Croatia -- The trial against former Defence Minister Berislav Roncevic and his assistant, Ivo Bacic, began in a Zagreb court Friday (January 29th).
The anti-corruption office, USKOK, charged them in late October with abuse of power over a 2004 procurement deal involving military trucks.
Prosecutors say the contract cost the state millions of kunas.
Roncevic, who has been stripped of his immunity as a lawmaker, has said he will prove that the accusations are groundless.

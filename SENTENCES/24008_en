SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko said on Thursday (April 16th) the country's leaders should view the current economic crisis as a chance to implement economic reforms. 
"The crisis is a time of chances, just as it is a time of changes," he noted. 
Inzko said the government must speed up reforms in order to activate an IMF loan worth 675m euros.

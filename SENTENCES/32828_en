ANKARA, Turkey -- During a meeting in Ankara on Wednesday (4 December), Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis and his Greek counterpart George Papandreou pledged to find a quick solution to the Cyprus dispute.
This was Papandreou's first official visit to the Turkish capital since the government of Prime Minister Abdullah Gul was formed last month.
Both sides want progress before next week's EU summit in Copenhagen.
The UN has proposed a peace plan, which Athens supports.
Turkey and the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" still have reservations about it.

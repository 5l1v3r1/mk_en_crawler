ZAGREB, Croatia -- A new report by the OSCE praises the progress achieved by Croatia in prosecuting war crimes cases over the past 18 months, but urges stepped-up efforts to consolidate the trend. 
Among other things, the document highlights the need to implement uniform standards of criminal accountability and eliminate ethnic bias when deciding to pursue cases.
In related news Thursday, parliament began debating draft amendments to the law on criminal proceedings, to be introduced next year.

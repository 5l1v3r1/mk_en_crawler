PRISTINA, Kosovo -- European Parliament (EP) rapporteur for Kosovo Ulrike Lunacek has recommended that calls coming from some political entities to organise new general elections this year should be taken seriously.
In an e-mailed interview with public broadcaster RTK on Tuesday (January 11th), Lunacek suggested officials should review the process for irregularities and implement necessary reforms in the electoral law in the wake of the December 12th snap elections.
However, she said that a new government and parliament should initially be established to continue addressing important issues, such as appointing the president and starting talks with Serbia.
In Pristina, International Civilian Office spokesperson Andy McGuffie called on Kosovars to take Lunacek's statement seriously, in light of continuing reports of electoral irregularities.

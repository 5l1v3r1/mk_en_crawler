SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have reached an informal agreement to establish a joint venture for the South Stream gas pipeline project by November 15th, the government said in a press release Thursday (October 21st).
The joint company will handle construction work on Bulgarian territory, the two leaders agreed in a telephone conversation.
According to current estimates, pipeline construction is set to begin in 2013 and it is to become operational as of 2015.
South Stream will provide an alternative to the Ukraine route for Russian natural gas deliveries to Italy and Austria.
The agreement between the two prime ministers confirms Bulgaria's participation in the project.
A memorandum of intent signed by Romania and Gazprom on October 13th had sparked rumours that Bulgaria could be excluded.

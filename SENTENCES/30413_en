TIRANA, Albania -- Civil society -- a group of NGOs -- wants to start debating how the president is elected and the structure of parliament. 
The Civil Forum 2010 initiative, led by former presidents Alfred Moisiu and Rexhep Mejdani, unveiled a two-year plan and objectives Thursday (December 16th). 
"Albania needs a head of the constitutional state that is elected by the citizens and respected as a symbol of the people's unity," Moisiu said. 
Currently, Albanian presidents are elected by parliament. 
Another initiative to be discussed is creating a parliamentary system divided in two chambers, instead of the current single-chamber system. 
Civil Forum 2010 hopes the new format would help overcome political stalemate and prevent it from happening again in the future.

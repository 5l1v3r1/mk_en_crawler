PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Parliament voted on Monday (December 27th) to strip Djordje Pinjatic, a fellow member from the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists, of his immunity, clearing the way for an investigation. 
According to the State Prosecutor's office, Pinjatic abused his power in the so-called Zavala affair. 
He was arrested last week along with nine Budva municipality officials as part of an investigation into illegal construction on the Zavala peninsula in Budva.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- In a surprise move, President Traian Basescu told a press conference Thursday (October 7th) that he will not promulgate the pension law, but will send it back for parliamentary debate. 
Basescu said he based his decision on an amendment that raises the retirement age to 65 for both men and women. 
He insists it should be 63 for women. 
"Women do double work in Romania," Basescu explained, referring to obligations women have in their households.
The president's decision followed a ruling Wednesday by the Constitutional Court that amendments to the pension law are constitutional, thus rejecting appeals submitted by the opposition. 
Basescu had been expected to promulgate the bill, as the pension law should have been approved last month, according to an agreement with the IMF. 
Pension system reform is one of the most important structural reforms to be implemented this year, given the budget deficit.

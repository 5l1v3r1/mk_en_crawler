SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A Serbian citizen wanted in connection with the murder of prominent Croatian publisher and journalist Ivo Pukanic will be extradited to Croatia, the BiH Court decided on Wednesday (February 17th).
Bojan Guduric turned himself in to police in Banja Luka on February 1st.
His lawyer says Guduric could be handed over to Croatian authorities early next week and that he would rather go to Croatia than Serbia.
Belgrade has issued an arrest warrant of its own for Guduric, citing several alleged crimes.
Pukanic, co-owner and editor-in-chief of the weekly Nacional, died in a car bombing in downtown Zagreb on October 23rd 2008, along with the newspaper's marketing director, Niko Franjic.
Investigators say Guduric activated the bomb.
Four other suspects in the case went on trial on February 3rd in Zagreb.

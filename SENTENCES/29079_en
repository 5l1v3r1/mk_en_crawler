LONDON, United Kingdom -- Former Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) presidency member Ejup Ganic told a London court during his extradition hearings Monday (July 5th) that he cannot receive a fair trial in Serbia. 
Ganic was arrested on March 1st at London's Heathrow Airport, based on a warrant issued by Belgrade. 
Serbia wants him in connection with a May 1992 attack in Sarajevo against a Yugoslav National Army convoy, which left more than 40 soldiers dead. 
On Monday, Ganic said Serbia hopes "to rewrite history, because this is a country that committed genocide â¦ They are trying to confuse the British judicial system, to say 'we are an organised country that can give a fair trial'," he said outside the court.
Lawyer James Lewis, representing the Serbian government, insists Ganic ordered the attack on ambulances and troops who had surrendered. 
"We say on the face of it that is a clear war crime," he said. 
Hearings in the case continue.

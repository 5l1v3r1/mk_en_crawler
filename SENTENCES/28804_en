PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A court in Pristina charged seven people Thursday (November 11th) with alleged involvement in an international organ trafficking network. 
EU prosecutor Jonathan Ratel said the organised crime group trafficked people to Kosovo to remove "human organs for transplant to other persons". 
The investigation revealed that around 20 foreign nationals from Moldova, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkey, were "recruited with false promises of payments" in exchange for their kidneys in 2008. 
Each of them was promised up to 15,000 euros, while the recipients had to pay between 80,000 and 100,000 euros. 
Last month, the special prosecutor's office pressed charges against five people for international trafficking of human organs and organised crime. 
Among those charged were doctors and a senior official at the health ministry.

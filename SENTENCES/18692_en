TIRANA, Albania -- The cabinet endorsed a new draft law on higher education Wednesday (March 7th), aimed at fulfilling the standards of the so-called Bologna Process, which envisions creation of a common European Higher Education Area by 2010.
Among other things, the bill consolidates various universities, raises salaries in the higher education sector, modernises infrastructure and enables internet access at all schools.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- A report on corruption issued by Transparency International Romania says political parties' anti-corruption messages remain unsatisfactory. 
While topics related to fighting corruption were widely used in politicians' speeches --usually in verbal attacks on opponents -- the parties rarely undertake concrete anti-corruption actions, the report concludes. 
The document was prepared in collaboration with the Romanian Press Monitoring Agency-Academia Catavencu.

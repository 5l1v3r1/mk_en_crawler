VUKOVAR, Croatia -- More than 25,000 people gathered in Vukovar on Saturday (November 18th) to mark the 15th anniversary of the city's fall to the Yugoslav Army and Serb rebel forces in 1991. 
More than 1,000 people died during and after the three-month siege, while as many as 22,000 non-Serbs were expelled from the area after the city was captured.
Saturday's gathering also commemorated the massacre of some 200 prisoners of war who were taken by Yugoslav and Serb forces to a farm on the town's outskirts and executed there. 
Three former Yugoslav army commanders are currently awaiting trial in The Hague in connection with atrocities at Vukovar, and courts in Serbia have jailed 14 paramilitary group members for up to 20 years each.

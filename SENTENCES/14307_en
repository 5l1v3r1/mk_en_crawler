ATHENS, Greece -- Peach producers in northern Greece staged a protest on Wednesday (10 August), demanding that the government introduce higher purchasing prices for their produce. 
Farmers blocked the Thessaloniki-Edessa national motorway for several hours, but agreed to lift the blockade after meeting with Agricultural Development and Foods Minister Evangelos Basiakos. 
He says he promised that the cabinet would work to meet their demands.

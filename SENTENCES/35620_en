SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Federation of BiH (FBiH) police have arrested the deputy director of Interpol in BiH, Asim Fazlic, for alleged abuse of power, bribery and confidential information leaks, said FBiH Interior Ministry spokesman Robert Cvrtak on Thursday (5 February).
He added that with a court order, police were searching Fazlic's home and files.
Local media are reporting that he has been linked to last month's bombing in Sarajevo, which killed alleged mafia boss Taib Torlakovic.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan unveiled a series of economic and cultural initiatives Saturday (March 15th) for the mainly Kurdish population in Turkey's troubled southeast.
In an interview with The New York Times, Erdogan said up to $12 billion would be spent during the next five years to improve agriculture in the mostly rural region.
Most of the money will be earmarked for building dams and irrigation projects as well as clearing mines from a large area along the border with Syria.
The projects are expected to provide much-needed water for arid agricultural fields, help avert a future energy bottleneck and create new jobs.
Erdogan also said a multilingual television channel would be launched shortly that would include Kurdish-language programming.
Erdogan has said a solution to the longstanding conflict with the Kurds could not be based solely on security measures, but must also include economic development and cultural rights.

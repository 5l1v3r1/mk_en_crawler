CRAWFORD, United States -- President George W Bush and German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed on Sunday (November 11th) that talks between Belgrade and Pristina on the future status of Kosovo are in a crucial stage.
During a visit to Bush's Texas ranch, Merkel appealed to both sides to do whatever it takes to reach an acceptable solution.
Meanwhile, in an interview Friday in the Dallas Morning News, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice conceded that post-war developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Kosovo are not in line with expectations.
According to her, BiH, with its three presidents, three police forces and three armies, does not function as "a real state".
As for Kosovo, Rice pointed out the province essentially has no economy.

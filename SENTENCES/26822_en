BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Emil Boc on Tuesday (March 9th) gave a green light to opening all remaining documents related to the 1989 anti-communist revolution.
Up to now they have been classified as secret.
Boc says the move will help reveal the truth about what happened in the bloody revolt that toppled dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
The defence ministry will open about 8,000 pages of documents to the public.

DIYARBAKIR, Turkey -- Ahmet Turk, leader of a pro-Kurdish formation, the Democratic Society Party (DTP), has unexpectedly called on the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) to observe a unilateral ceasefire.
At a special news conference of DTP leaders in Diyarbakir on Monday (11 September), Turk warned that the recent surge in violence jeopardises the chances for achieving sustainable peace.
The same day, police announced that they had detained 27 members of an illegal Marxist-Leninist Communist Party, suspected of planning attacks on strategic targets and senior military officials.
The police operation took place last week in eight Turkish towns.
In other news Monday, Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus President Mehmet Ali Talat accepted the resignation of the government of Prime Minister Ferdi Sabit Soyer.
Talat's Republican Turkish Party reportedly wants to quit its partnership with the Democrat Party and form a new right-centre coalition cabinet.

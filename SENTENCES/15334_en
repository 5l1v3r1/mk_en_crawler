ANKARA, Turkey -- Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni arrived on Sunday (28 May) in Turkey for a two-day visit aimed at strengthening bilateral ties.
This is the first high-level contact between the two countries since February, when a visit by a Hamas delegation to Ankara strained relations.
Turkey defended the talks as an effort to put pressure on Hamas to renounce violence against Israel.
"The fact that the minister chose Turkey for her first official visit reflects the importance which we attach to our relations with Ankara," AFP quoted an Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying.

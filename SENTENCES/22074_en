ANKARA, Turkey -- Kurdish protesters again clashed with police during a rally Sunday (October 19th) in support of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in the eastern towns of Siirt and Sanliurfa. 
Media reported two protesters suffered injuries and police detained 15 others in Siirt. 
The rallies, the latest in a series over the past two days, expressed support for imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, after his lawyers said a prison guard assaulted him and threatened him with death. 
Justice Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin says his ministry conducted an immediate investigation. 
"There has not been any mistreatment," he told reporters.

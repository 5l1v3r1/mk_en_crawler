THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The judges in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic announced on Monday (18 October) that they might subpoena witnesses who refuse to testify for the defence.
The announcement came after Milosevic's lawyer, Steven Keyes, complained to the court that he could not persuade anybody to testify on Monday.
He went on to add that some witnesses were still awaiting permission from their governments to appear before the tribunal.
According to Keyes, between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of the witnesses have refused to testify.
Presiding Judge Patrick Robinson said a subpoena was a measure of last resort.
In other news Monday, a court in Zadar, Croatia ruled that there was not enough evidence to convict an ethnic Serb on war crimes charges.
Milenko Radak had been accused of taking part in the murders of Croatian civilians in the village of Skabrnje in November 1991.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The new parliament will hold its first session sometime next week, according to an announcement by the electoral council Wednesday (6 November).
The assembly must meet within five days of official election results, expected Friday.
Preliminary data suggests that the Justice and Development Party (AKP) will get 363 out of a total of 550 seats.
In interviews with local and international media, AKP leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed his party's Islamic past and said it would respect the secular character of the country.
He also adopted a more conciliatory stance towards the EU, saying relations with Western Europe would not suffer if the Union failed to set a date for launching accession talks with Ankara at next month's EU summit in Copenhagen.

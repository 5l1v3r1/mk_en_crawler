ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) opened talks on forming a coalition government with the Croatian Peasants' Party (HSS) of former Parliamentary Speaker Zlatko Tomcic on Thursday (27 November).
Leaving the HSS headquarters in Zagreb, HDZ leader Ivo Sanader seemed optimistic, saying that the two parties were "inching closer to agreement", but not yet disclosing any details.
Tomcic was more reserved, saying that an HDZ-HSS government was "possible but not absolutely".
The two formations will set up a working group to tackle economic issues.
Also Thursday, Sanader said he offered coalition co-operation to the Croatian Social Liberal Party and the Democratic Centre.
Talks with these parties are set to continue in the next days.
Meanwhile, Milorad Pupovac, one of three deputies from the Independent Serb Democratic Party, said he would not accept a ministerial post in the government, but implied the party would support an HDZ-led coalition cabinet on condition that extreme right-wing coalition partners are not included.

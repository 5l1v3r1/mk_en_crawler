PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari told Kosovo Serbs on Thursday (24 August) that progress had been made during his meetings with the Kosovo Albanian negotiators regarding decentralisation, but discussions are continuing.
He was due to address reporters later on Friday.
According to local media, the key points of contention are the number of Serb-run municipalities and their competencies in relation to the central government.
Ahtisaari has said good governance should include transferring jurisdiction in the areas of healthcare, education, and the rule of law.
In other news, local RTK TV reported that Kosovo authorities have begun work on establishing an intelligence service.
A government spokesman is quoted as saying UNMIK has given the cabinet permission to explore the issue, though no decisions will be made until Kosovo's status is resolved.

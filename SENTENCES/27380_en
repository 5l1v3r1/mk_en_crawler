BELGRADE, Serbia -- Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac told Serbia's weekly Nin on Thursday (May 27th) that an "historic agreement" in the field of the defence will be signed with Croatia next month in Zagreb.
"After all the wars, the Serbian and Croatian armies will bilaterally meet for the first time in order to sign a [co-operation] agreement," Sutanovac said.
The accord will cover "the possibility of joint exercises, training, education, exchanges of experience and information," he added.

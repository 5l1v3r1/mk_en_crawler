ANKARA, Turkey -- Author Nedim Gursel, who was charged with insulting Islam in his book The Daughters of Allah, has been acquitted by a local court, news channel CNN Turk reported on Thursday (June 25th). 
Gursel's book on the origin of Islam in the 6th century was published in Turkey last year. 
Ali Emre Bukagili, a construction engineer, filed a lawsuit against the author, arguing that the book's depiction of the Prophet Mohammad, his wives and the Koran were insulting to Muslims.
In other news Thursday, Turkish European Affairs Minister Egemen Bagis told a press conference in Brussels that demonstrating the fact that Turkey has a future within the EU would send a positive signal to the Muslim world. 
"What kind of message do we want to give to 1.5 billion Muslims in the world who have the feeling of being pushed away by the West," Bagis asked. 
He reiterated that Ankara wants nothing short of full-fledged EU membership. 
Several EU members, including Austria, France and Germany, oppose Turkey's bid.

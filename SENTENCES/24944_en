PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The goal of the EU's mission in Kosovo, EULEX, is to re-integrate the Serb-dominated north into the rest of the country and prevent any partition, the head of the International Civilian Office (ICO) in Kosovo, Pieter Feith, said on Sunday (November 30th). 
"Reality on the ground has changed, and this is a bitter reality, but we have to deal with it," Feith said in an interview with public broadcaster RTK. 
He added that one cannot expect the EU to change the situation overnight and that the ICO's long-term goal is to establish a multi-ethnic and safe environment. 
EULEX will open a small office in Belgrade that will handle technical rather than political issues, according to media reports Monday. 
European officials reportedly said that this technical office will allow for international police co-operation in terms of combating organised crime and other criminal activities in the region.

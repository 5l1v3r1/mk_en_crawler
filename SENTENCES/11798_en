SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The major opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) objects to the government's draft of a new penal code and will not back the bill at parliament, BSP parliamentary caucus deputy leader Mihail Mikov said Wednesday (18 May). 
His statement came after Justice Minister Anton Stankov presented the draft to legal experts from the main parliamentary groups. 
Mikov said the BSP planned to draft a new bill that would be more precise.

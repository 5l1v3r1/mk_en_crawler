SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The country's anti-discrimination commission ruled on Tuesday (1 August) that a ban on wearing headscarves at schools where uniforms are required is not an act of discrimination.
The case at hand relates to the economic college in Smolyan, where two Muslim co-eds say they were not allowed to wear the scarves during classes.
The case was the first one of its kind in Bulgaria, which has an ethnic Turkish minority.
The commission rejected the case as groundless.

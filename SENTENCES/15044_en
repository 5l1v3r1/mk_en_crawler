BUCHAREST, Romania -- Three new outbreaks of avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, have been discovered in southeastern Romania, the government reported Thursday (1 December). 
Dozens of dead birds have been found in the villages of Bumbacari and Dudescu, and veterinary workers are culling more than 8,000 fowl in the area. 
Scientists are working to determine if this is a recurrence of the deadly H5N1 strain.

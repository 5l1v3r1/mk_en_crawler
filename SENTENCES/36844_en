MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Croat member of the BiH presidency, Dragan Covic, said Sunday (11 July) he doubts the country would file a lawsuit against Croatia like the one it filed against Serbia-Montenegro. 
In that case, launched in 1993 at the International Court of Justice, BiH demanded that Serbia-Montenegro be sued for genocide against BiH citizens, as well as for breach of human rights and interference in internal affairs. 
Covic says he views the lawsuit against Serbia-Montenegro as a legal rather than a political issue. 
He noted, however, that the allegations would be hard to prove in court.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The presidents of Croatia and Turkey, Stipe Mesic and Ahmet Necdet Sezer, told a business conference in Zagreb on Thursday (3 July) that the two countries are looking for ways to strengthen economic co-operation.
Sezer said he was not satisfied with the annual volume of trade between Turkey and Croatia, which is less than $50m.
He said he hopes that the free trade agreement that went into effect Tuesday would boost the figure.
Sezer also met with Prime Minister Ivica Racan and Parliament Speaker Zlatko Tomcic, expressing full support for Croatia's NATO aspirations.
Friday, he visits the Adriatic resort town of Dubrovnik.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Signalling a new spirit of reconciliation, the presidents of Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro on Wednesday (10 September) exchanged apologies for the pain their countries inflicted on each other during the 1991-1995 war. 
Croatian President Stipe Mesic added, however, that a number of problems remain. 
One of them is Croatia's lawsuit against Serbia-Montenegro in the International Court of Justice in The Hague. 
Zagreb wants Belgrade to pay billions of euros in damages for encouraging Serb separatists during the conflict. 
Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic suggested that bilateral relations would improve if this lawsuit were dropped. 
The two presidents also discussed their common desire to join the EU. 
Mesic is the first Croatian head of state to visit Belgrade since the 1991 breakup of the former Yugoslavia.
In other news, a Croatian travel company announced that it would restore the air link between Zagreb and Belgrade. 
Initially, there would be two charter flights a week.

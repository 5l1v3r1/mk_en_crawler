BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia introduced a value-added tax (VAT) on Saturday (1 January), meeting a long-standing demand by international financial institutions.
The government will collect 18 per cent VAT on most products and 6 per cent on basic foods, pharmaceuticals, utilities and certain services.
Previously, most goods were taxed at 20 per cent.
Authorities anticipate short-term price hikes until merchants and producers understand how the new tax works.
In other news, President Boris Tadic, Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus and Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic issued separate statements Friday concerning the political situation.
All three described the government as stable, but none ruled out early parliamentary elections.

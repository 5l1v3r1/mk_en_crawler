ANKARA, Turkey -- The electoral commission decided on Saturday (4 October) not to hear any formal requests for a rerun of last year's parliamentary elections. 
Several political parties had been calling for a new vote after it was found that the Democratic People's Party had used false papers to register for the election. 
The decision, which is not subject to appeal, ends months of uncertainty and media speculation.
In other news Saturday, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said the government would likely specify the duration of any deployment to Iraq in the proposal it will submit to parliament. 
He said an end date would show Turkey intends to be present for a limited period of time, as long as peacekeeping help is needed.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was in Rome on Saturday, participating in the convention to discuss the EU Draft Constitutional Treaty. 
Erdogan described Turkey's involvement as historic.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Social Democratic Party (PSD) leader and presidential candidate Mircea Geoana said late Monday (December 7th) that his party will go to court to challenge the results of Sunday's run-off. 
Geoana lost by a razor thin margin to incumbent Traian Basescu of the Liberal Democratic Party (PDL), amid what Geoana says was significant electoral fraud.
His PSD will also maintain its alliance with the National Liberal Party (PNL) and the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians, in an effort to form a new government. 
The PSD and the PNL control around 60% of all seats in parliament.
Leaders of Basescu's PDL also met late Monday and insist the election results are accurate, though opinion polls just ahead of the vote predicted a comfortable win for Geoana. 
The PDL says it looks forward to forming the next government.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The UN mediator in the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece, Matthew Nimetz, said on Thursday (September 24th) that there are enough ideas on the table for both countries to think creatively about a solution.
Nimetz was speaking to journalists after meeting in New York with Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov and the country's chief negotiator in the talks, Zoran Jolevski.
Nimetz added he expects a new impetus to the talks after Greece holds snap elections on October 4th.
Negotiations will resume once those elections are over and a government is in place, Nimetz explained.
Ivanov and Jolevski assured him that Macedonia will continue to work towards a solution that would be acceptable to both sides.

ANKARA, Turkey -- EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou said on Thursday (13 October) that the strain of virus detected in Turkey is the lethal H5N1, which killed more than 60 people in Asia last year. 
Kyprianou added that there is a direct relationship to viruses found in Russia, Mongolia and China. 
The EU is reviewing precautionary measures it will take to prevent the further spread of the virus and is issuing a special warning to EU citizens travelling to Turkey and other countries with outbreaks of avian flu, including Romania. 
So far there are no reports of the virus being transmitted to humans. 
In Bulgaria, health authorities said they tested 30 different species of dead birds but detected no bird flu.

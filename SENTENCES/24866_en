TIRANA, Albania -- Albania has started implementing a visa regime for foreign visitors, media reported on Tuesday (June 2nd).
Under the new regulations, the visitors will have to follow procedures similar to those Albanians must follow when travelling abroad.
In order to obtain a visa, foreigners will have to book a hotel, have a return ticket, medical insurance or a work permit.
The move aims to strengthen border control in a bid to meet EU criteria for lifting visa restrictions on Albanian citizens.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg of the ruling NMS-II party plans to seek a second term in next year's parliamentary elections. 
Saxe-Coburg's spokesman, Dimitar Tsonev, said on the national TV channel bTV that NMS-II would ask future coalition partners to support the incumbent's bid. 
But Sergey Stanishev, leader of the main opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party, said recent polls show his party currently enjoys higher public support than any other party.
In other news, the Bulgarian government late last week endorsed two separate agreements on co-operation in the police and border management sectors with neighbouring Greece and Romania. 
The documents envision increased partnership in fighting trans-border crime and illegal migration.

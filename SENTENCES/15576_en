ANKARA, Turkey -- US Ambassador to Ankara Ross Wilson says Turkey and the United States are co-operating closely in the fight against Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terrorists. 
"I assure you that the United States is working for more effective measures in dealing with the PKK," the Anatolia news agency quoted Wilson as saying during a Turkish-US business forum in Ankara on Monday (24 July). 
Over the last several days, US President George W. 
Bush has telephoned Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan twice to discuss the PKK issue, while US Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice has assured Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul that Washington will not tolerate terrorist actions mounted from northern Iraq.
In related news, a Turkish policeman was wounded Monday in an exchange of fire between police and PKK members in the southeast Hakkari region of Cukurca. 
The same day, Turkish security forces found an apparent PKK arms depot at a village in the eastern province of Agri.

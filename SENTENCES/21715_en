BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu announced on Tuesday (September 23rd) that he has accepted the resignation of Labour Minister Paul Pacuraru, who was suspended by presidential decree Monday for his alleged involvement in corruption schemes.
Pacuraru was informed of the charges against him Friday.
Prosecutors say his son's company was awarded a contract with a state-owned company in exchange for Pacuraru keeping one of the heads of the Gorj Labour Inspectorate at his post.

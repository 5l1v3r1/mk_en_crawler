ZAGREB, Croatia -- EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini told Prime Minister Ivo Sanader on Thursday (April 12th) that Zagreb must do more to fix its judiciary and curb corruption.
Frattini said he was encouraged by the government's claims that it had reduced the backlog of cases by 30% in 2006 and by the adoption of new legislation.
However, he added, "legislative reforms are not enough;
we need their implementation".
Frattini also urged more investigations into corruption at all levels of government to demonstrate that "no one is above the law", and requested more concrete data to illustrate the government's efforts in these areas.
Judicial reform is a key condition for Croatia's accession to the EU.
On Friday, Frattini served as chairman of a meeting of justice and interior ministers from countries participating in the Southeastern European Co-operation Process.

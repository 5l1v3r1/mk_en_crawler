ATHENS, Greece -- Two French passengers -- a man and his teenage daughter -- remain missing after their cruise ship "Sea Diamond" sank near the Greek island of Santorini early on Friday (April 6th), according to local media reports Monday. 
Over 1,500 tourists and crewmembers were evacuated after the ship hit a reef the previous day and began taking on water. 
As divers and a robotic submarine continue searching for the two passengers and the ship's data recorder, authorities reportedly have launched a criminal investigation against the captain and five crewmen.

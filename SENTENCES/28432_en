TIRANA, Albania -- The government has declared two groups, Islamic Jihad and al-Qaeda, illegal in Albania.
During a meeting Wednesday (June 16th), the cabinet also announced a list of 62 businessmen and nine commercial companies believed to be connected with al-Qaeda and the Taleban, groups that the UN considers sponsors of terrorism.
Entities and individuals related to these organisations will now be subject to asset confiscation if found in Albania.

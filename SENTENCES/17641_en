PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Foreign Minister Milan Rocen returned from talks in Rome with Italian counterpart Massimo D'Alema on Wednesday (July 25th), saying they had focused on future bilateral relations "and not on past things", according to a quote in Thursday's Vjesti daily. 
Italian prosecutors recently completed an investigation into former Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic and several other Montenegrins' alleged involvement in cigarette smuggling and money laundering.

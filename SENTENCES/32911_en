ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government reported Thursday (29 May) that it has frozen two bank accounts that may have been used to finance Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network.
The government provided no other details, but said the decision was made when those operating the accounts appeared on a UN list of individuals suspected of funding the terrorist group.
In other news, five labour union federations agreed Thursday to organise a referendum on the government's draft amendments to the labour act.
Around 450,000 union members will vote from 16 June to 18 June.
If 75 per cent of them oppose the amendments, the unions will call a national strike.
The union vote reportedly will coincide with a parliamentary vote on the reforms.

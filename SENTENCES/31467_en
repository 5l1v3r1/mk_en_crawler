BUCHAREST, Romania -- Eneko Landaburu, the European Commission's (EC) general director for enlargement, said during a visit to Bucharest on Thursday (23 January) that the EC's accession report this fall this year might recognise Romania as a fully functioning market economy. 
However, he warned that the government must maintain the pace of reforms to meet all criteria. 
Romania is currently the only official EU candidate without functioning market status.

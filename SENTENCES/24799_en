PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The heads of eight Southeast European countries adopted a declaration Thursday (June 4th) on managing cultural heritage and making its protection a top priority. 
Issuing the joint statement were the presidents of Bulgaria, Albania, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro, following their conference in Cetinje. 
UNESCO Director-General Koichiro Matsuura and Council of Europe Secretary-General Terry Davis also attended the forum. 
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu was not invited, as his country is not a member of the UN and UNESCO.
On the sidelines of the forum, Slovenian President Danilo Turk and Croatian counterpart Stipe Mesic agreed to try to restore bilateral ties, strained by a long-standing border dispute.

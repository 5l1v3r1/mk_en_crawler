THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Vojislav Seselj, the jailed leader of the Serbian Radical Party, can defend himself in his trial at The Hague, the UN tribunal ruled on Monday (23 October).
A different panel of judges had appointed a lawyer to defend the nationalist leader because of what was described as the Seselj's obstructive and disruptive behavior.
He is accused of being part of a criminal conspiracy to evict non-Serbs from areas in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, and has also pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from the 1991 Vukovar massacre.

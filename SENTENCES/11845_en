SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The poignancy of the ceremony earlier this week marking the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre was nearly overwhelming, said High Representative Paddy Ashdown. 
In an interview in Friday's (15 July) Dnevni Avaz, Ashdown described the emotional moments he shared with a man who buried his child -- one of hundreds of recently identified victims interred in the memorial cemetery during the commemoration. 
Ashdown also announced plans to address the BiH Parliament on Tuesday to outline his priorities during the next six months. 
Chief among them are reforms necessary to start negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.

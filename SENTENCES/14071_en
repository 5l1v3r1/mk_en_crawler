COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- NATO's parliamentary assembly has adopted a resolution on Kosovo, calling for the continued application of UN Security Council Resolution 1244.
The resolution, voted on at the assembly's 51st meeting, backs the implementation of standards, the decentralisation process and protection of minorities.
The assembly stopped short of a planned declaration of support for conditional independence.
Kosovo was also on the agenda of talks in Belgrade Sunday (13 November) between Serbian President Boris Tadic and Czech Prime Minister Jiri Paroubek.
At a joint press conference, Tadic said Serbia is ready to launch negotiations on Kosovo's future status, but reiterated Belgrade's opposition to independence for the province.
On Monday, Paroubek met with Serbia-Montenegrin President Svetozar Marovic, while Tadic kicked off a three-day official visit to Russia.

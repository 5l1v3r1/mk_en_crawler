SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic on Tuesday (17 February) rejected the Bosnian Serb candidate for the newly established post of defence minister because of his wartime past. 
Terzic said that the appointment of Branko Stevic would jeopardise the country's chances of joining NATO's Partnership for Peace programme. 
Stevic was a police chief in Bijeljina during the war at a time when the area was subjected to an ethnic cleansing campaign. 
The prime minister asked Borislav Paravac, the Serb member of the tripartite presidency, to nominate a new candidate. 
The office of Paddy Ashdown, the top international officer in BiH, welcomed the move.
Also Tuesday, two men were killed and a third injured after a landmine exploded in the central BiH village of Vesela. 
The three had entered a marked mine field left from the country's 1992-1995 war.

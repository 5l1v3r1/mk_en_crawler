The US firm Lockheed Martin signed a deal on Tuesday (22 August) to build Albania's maritime surveillance system. 
Speaking to reporters, Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu said the new system would be instrumental in fighting terrorism and trafficking, as well as enhancing safety on the sea. 
The project is expected to be completed in four years.
The $17m agreement was firstly approved in 2005, by the socialist government of former Prime Minister Fatos Nano. 
The document was then modified and finally adopted by Sali Berisha's cabinet this month.
"This investment is in the framework of the programmes for increasing regional integration, and is part of the strategies of the Albanian Armed Forces to prevent possible negative phenomena in the coastal areas and the country's sea territory," the Council of Ministers said in a statement. 
Authorities are establishing a new structure that will deal with implementation of the contract.
Lockheed Martin also is undertaking the modernisation of Albania's air traffic management infrastructure, under a contract extension approved last year. 
The company already performed a rapid refurbishment of the decades-old infrastructure in time to handle air traffic during the 2004 Olympics in neighbouring Greece. 
The overhaul is part of the country's National Airspace Modernisation Project.
The renovations include a new air traffic control operations building, airport control tower, long-range radar, communications and navigation aids, and new air traffic automation computers and displays. 
The effort also includes additional training for controllers and engineers and other infrastructure modernisation.
Future work includes integration of the Skyline system with new communications, navigation and surveillance capabilities that will link the air traffic system to other airports in the region.

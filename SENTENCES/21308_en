BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission adopted a plan Monday (September 29th) involving financial aid to candidates and potential candidates for EU membership. 
The commission will grant 4.5 billion euros in aid by 2010 to six Balkan countries and Turkey, including a separately listed grant to Kosovo worth 359.1m euros. 
The assistance will focus on improving governance and the rule of law, supporting economic and social development and helping candidate countries adopt laws in line with those of the EU, as well as building their capacity to implement laws. 
It will also support some multi-beneficiary programmes related to cross-border co-operation.

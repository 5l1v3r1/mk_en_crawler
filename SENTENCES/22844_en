TIRANA, Albania -- The Socialist Party (SP) has criticised the government's lack of a strategy to develop the country's farming sector, which is the poorest in the region.
"The Albanian farmer is three times poorer than a farmer in Macedonia," the SP's Ervin Bushati said Sunday (July 6th).
The accusations came a day after a report by the World Bank on agriculture that indicated that the revenues of the average Albanian farmer came to around 1,600 euros annually, compared with 4,800 euros for a farmer in Macedonia.
Albania has the lowest agriculture productivity in Europe, said Bushati.

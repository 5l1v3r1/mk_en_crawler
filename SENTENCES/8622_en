The honourary guest has up till now always been an individual country, but this time it was a language – Portuguese, which is spoken by 250 million people in the world, in eight countries.
The motto of the honourary guest's presentation was "One Language, Many Cultures".
Many Portuguese and Lusophone writers -- Angolan writers Ondjaki and José Eduardo Agualusa, Portuguese writers Gonçalo M. Tavares, Lídia Jorge and Rui Zink, and Mozambican Mia Cuoto -- were represented at the fair.

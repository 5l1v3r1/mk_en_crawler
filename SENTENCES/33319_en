BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- EU security chief Javier Solana said Friday (6 June) that Serbia and Montenegro could advance towards EU integration only as a union. 
Wrapping up a visit to Belgrade after meeting with senior officials, Solana said Serbian authorities are "mistaken" if they think Serbia could enter the EU on its own. 
After meeting Solana, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic said that the Action Plan, which outlines economic harmonisation between the two republics, should be forwarded to Brussels soon.
In other news, Solana said Belgrade and Pristina would likely open a dialogue at the EU summit in Thessaloniki on 21 June. 
Signals from Belgrade and Pristina have been mixed on the possibility of starting talks on the status of the province.

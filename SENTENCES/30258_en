NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu has undergone successful heart surgery in Ankara, Tevfik Ali Kucukbas, the head of the Guven hospital where the operation was performed, announced on Monday (December 20th).
On Sunday, Osman Ertug, Eroglu's spokesperson, said the surgery will not impact talks to reunify the island, though a meeting scheduled for Tuesday has been cancelled.
Eroglu had a partially blocked artery, and doctors recommended the operation as a precaution.

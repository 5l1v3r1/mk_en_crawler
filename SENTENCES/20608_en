ZAGREB, Croatia -- A Croatian man has pleaded not guilty to the 1991 murders of three police officers, a watershed incident which many see as the trigger for four years of fighting in the country.
Antun Gudelj is charged with the murder of Josip Reihl-Kir, the police chief of Osjek, who died trying to mediate between Serbs and Croats in a bid to defuse rising nationalist tensions.
Two of his aides also died.
When he was tried in 1994, Gudelj pleaded not guilty by reason of temporary insanity, saying he had heard rumors that his parents might have been killed by Serbs.
He was sentenced to 20 years in prison but was freed in 1997 under an amnesty and moved to Australia.
Though Croatia's Constitutional Court ordered his retrial in 2001, Australia only extradited him in July.

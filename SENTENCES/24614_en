BELGRADE, Serbia -- Russia and Serbia will sign a strategic energy co-operation accord by year's end, Alexey Miller, the head of Russian gas giant Gazprom, said on Friday (December 5th) in Belgrade, where he met government representatives and President Boris Tadic. 
Miller said the package will contain not only the sale of Serbian state oil and gas firm NIS to Gazprom's oil arm, Gazpromneft, but also the construction in Serbia of part of the South Stream gas pipeline and an extension of the Banatski Dvor underground gas storage facility. 
Miller said Russia is 100% ready to proceed with all three projects. 
Acknowledging the need to iron out some details, he insisted there are no major disagreements.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski has written to European Commission (EC) President Manuel Barroso regarding the recognition of the Macedonian minority in Greece, local media reported on Sunday (July 20th). 
The letter came on the heels of a recent one Gruevski sent to Greek counterpart Costas Karamanlis on the issue. 
In his letter to Barroso, Gruevski said Greek authorities have disputed the rights of Macedonians and their identity for years in contradiction of international law. 
He urged the EC president to ensure protection of the right of free expression of ethnicity in Greece. 
"We expect Greece, as an EU and NATO member, to start fulfilling the European Commission's recommendations," Gruevski wrote.

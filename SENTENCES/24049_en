ANKARA, Turkey -- The foreign ministry on Wednesday (December 17th) accused Cyprus of using its veto right over Turkey's bid to join the EU to strengthen its position in the ongoing Cyprus reunification talks.
At issue is Cyprus's decision to block the opening of the negotiation chapter on energy in Turkey's EU accession talks over a row with Ankara on oil exploration activities in the Mediterranean Sea.
"Putting the Cyprus issue as an obstacle before Turkish-EU relations will make things more difficult, and we don't believe this will contribute to reaching a solution in Cyprus either," said foreign ministry spokesman Burak Ozugergin.
In other news, Cypriot Justice Minister Kypros Chrysostomides resigned on Wednesday following the escape of a prisoner serving a life sentence.
Antonis Prokopiou Kitas, sentenced for the brutal rape and murder of two foreigners in 1994, escaped from a hospital last week and remains at large.

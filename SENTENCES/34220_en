BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Justice Minister Vladan Batic said Monday (7 July) that a local war crimes prosecutor has been selected and would be appointed soon. 
Though the law on forming a prosecution team has been adopted, parliament has not yet finalised a law on processing war crimes that is required before local courts take on cases.

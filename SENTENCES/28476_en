BELGRADE, Serbia -- Future talks between Belgrade and Pristina do not mean that Serbia will recognise Kosovo, Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic said on Wednesday (September 15th). 
"For Serbia, the red line is that the talks do not, in any way, mean indirect recognition of Kosovo," he told TV B92. 
Last week, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for EU-backed dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina aimed at promoting co-operation. 
Neither the timing of the talks nor the specific topics are clear. 
Djelic says neither Serbia nor Kosovo will be able to join the EU unless both first agree on the Kosovo issue.

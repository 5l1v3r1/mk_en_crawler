BUCHAREST, Romania -- A new poll released Thursday (29 April) found that the ruling Social Democratic Party and its leader, Prime Minister Adrian Nastase, still enjoy the highest public support. 
The survey by the IMAS polling agency suggests Nastase would get 51.2 per cent of the vote if presidential elections were held now. 
That would be enough for a victory in the first round.

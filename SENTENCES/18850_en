PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The US envoy for the Kosovo status talks, Frank Wisner, urged support Monday (February 5th) for Martti Ahtisaari's status proposal, saying it would mark a new beginning for the province. 
The plan contains mechanisms protecting all Kosovo citizens, particularly Kosovo Serbs, he said during a visit to Pristina. 
He met there with Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu, Prime Minister Agim Ceku, members of the Kosovo negotiating team and representatives of the Serb Ticket for Kosovo and Metohija. 
On Tuesday, Wisner travelled to Belgrade for talks with Serbian President Boris Tadic.
Tadic, meanwhile, met with representatives of the various political parties Monday. 
Most agreed that he should go to Vienna on February 13th and request a ten-day postponement of consultations on Kosovo status, until after the new Parliament in Belgrade is formed.

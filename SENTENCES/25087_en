BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor voiced expectations Thursday (October 29th) that an arbitrage agreement with Slovenia, to resolve the border dispute between the two countries, could be signed next week, if the deal receives enough backing in parliament.
Kosor believes that concerns expressed by the opposition can be overcome and consensus will be reached during a meeting Friday.
Opposition parties have said some of the provisions may damage Croatia's interests.
But supporters note the prospect of the agreement has allowed Croatia's EU accession bid to gain momentum.

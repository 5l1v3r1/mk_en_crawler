SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The House of Representatives of the parliament of Federation of BiH (FBiH) unanimously adopted a declaration Wednesday (April 27th) saying that none of the entities can challenge state institutions. 
Representatives of the Croat parties HDZ BiH and HDZ 1990 did not attend the session.
The declaration calls on High Representative Valentin Inzko to act within his powers and quash all decisions that violate the Dayton Peace Agreement. 
Prompting this was the April 13th decision by Republika Srpska's (RS) parliament to call a referendum on High Representative-imposed laws, particularly regarding the BiH Court and Prosecutor's Office.

LONDON, United Kingdom -- International Community High Representative Paddy Ashdown was in London on Thursday (20 May) launching a campaign to attract British tourists to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
He told the BBC that BiH has become safe for tourists once again, describing the country as an "adventure" that should not be missed.
In other news, the head of the Bosnian Serb special police has resigned following a botched attempt to detain two war crimes suspects. 
Dragan Lukac initially ignored pressure to step down in connection with a failed operation last month that left an innocent man dead. 
Lukac's deputy, Dragan Ribic, finally stepped down too.
In Sarajevo meanwhile, government officials presented a project to restructure the police forces in BiH over the next six to seven years. 
The number of police personnel would be reduced by nearly 5,000 from the current 18,000.

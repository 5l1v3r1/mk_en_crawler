TIRANA, Albania -- The EU issued a statement Friday (7 November) that says the slow pace of reforms in Albania could jeopardise the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement -- the first step toward membership in the EU. 
The government was urged to "take immediate action to address the many shortcomings" that were identified in two days of talks between EU and local government officials. 
"Without full attention to reforms, it will not be possible to successfully address the important challenges ahead," the EU warned. 
European Commission Envoy for the Western Balkans Reinhard Priebe expressed serious concern about the slow pace of reforms, especially in regard to fighting corruption, implementing laws and proper functioning of administration. 
Albania hopes to sign an association agreement in 2004.
In other news, the European Commission announced on Friday (7 November) that it has negotiated a readmission agreement with Albania. 
Under the accord Albania agrees to accept return of its illegal immigrants. 
Talks on readmission agreement are currently being held with Turkey.

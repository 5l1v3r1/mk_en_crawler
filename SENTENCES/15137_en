MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling is urging young people to vote in the 1 October legislative elections. 
In a speech Tuesday (29 August) at the Nansen Dialogue Centre in Mostar, Schwarz-Schilling said this election would be particularly important: those in power after these polls would be responsible for the future of the country, since the Office of the High Representative is expected to close in June 2007.

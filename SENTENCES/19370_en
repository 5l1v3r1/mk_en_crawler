SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A team of 60 Macedonian fire fighters returned from the Bogorodica-Evzoni border checkpoint between Macedonia and Greece on Monday (August 27th) after Greek officials told them the country did not need their assistance in fighting fires that have ravaged the country.
"I don't want to believe that this action is politically motivated," Pande Lazarevski, director of the Macedonian Crisis Management Centre, told local media.
Late in the afternoon, the foreign ministry received an official letter from Athens in which the Greek government expressed its gratitude to all countries that helped battle the devastating fires.
The letter added that for the time being, Greece needs no further help.

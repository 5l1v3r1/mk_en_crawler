BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Ion Iliescu ratified a free trade agreement with Serbia on Monday (17 May), during a visit by Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
Talks focused on bilateral relations, the visa regime and joint projects, especially those in the energy field.
Also Monday, Bucharest began hosting a two-day summit of justice and home affairs ministers from countries of the Southeast European Co-operation Process.
Romania took over the rotating chairmanship last month.
The summit aims to draft a joint policy against organised crime and corruption in the region.

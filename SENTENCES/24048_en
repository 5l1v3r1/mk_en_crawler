ANKARA, Turkey -- Anti-terrorism police on Wednesday (December 17th) detained 30 suspected members of the al-Qaeda terror network, half of them in Istanbul.
Authorities seized documents and other materials in the co-ordinated operations.
In 2003, al-Qaeda militants killed more than 60 people in a series of bombings in Istanbul.
Also Wednesday, a Turkish prosecutor charged two Turkish nationals with a deadly attack on the US Consulate in Istanbul in July.
The armed assault on a guard post at the main entrance of the consulate killed three Turkish policemen.
Separately Wednesday, Turkish prosecutors charged nine suspected members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) with involvement in a double bombing that killed 17 people in western Istanbul on July 28th.
More than 150 people suffered injuries in the attack, which occurred on a shopping street in a residential area.
Meanwhile, Turkish warplanes continued air strikes on PKK positions in the mountainous region of Qandil, northern Iraq, for a second day Wednesday, according to the General Staff.
No information was released on damage and casualties.
In other news, German prosecutors have charged a Turkish national in connection with a foiled plot to bomb US targets in Germany, media reported on Wednesday.
The suspect, Attila Selek, was arrested in Turkey's central province of Konya on a German warrant in 2007.
In November, police extradited him to Germany to face charges of participating in the plot.

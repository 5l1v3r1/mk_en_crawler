NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Police said on Wednesday (January 13th) that the murder of local media mogul Andy Hadjicostis does not appear to be politically motivated. 
Hadjicostis, 41, was gunned down late Monday outside his home in downtown Nicosia. 
His company, Dias, owns the second largest TV channel in the country and a local newspaper. 
Both outlets had adopted a hard-line policy towards reunification efforts on the divided island. 
Police said on Wednesday that the investigation is moving in a "specific direction" but refused to elaborate. 
Investigators noted, however, that a friend of Hadjicostis working in the local intelligence service had warned him that his life was in danger.

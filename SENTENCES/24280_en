ANKARA, Turkey -- A group of Turkish intellectuals and academics are planning to publish an Internet statement apologizing for genocide against Armenians, Cengiz Aktar, a professor at the Bahcesehir University in Istanbul said on Friday (December 12th).
Aktar, one of the organisers of the campaign, said the group plans to post its statement on Monday.
An internet petition will also be launched to collect signatures in support of their initiative.
Aktar said 200 writers, intellectuals and academics have already joined.
Turkey officially denies that genocide took place, arguing that the massacres early in the 20th century occurred during a civil war in which Turks also died.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Monday (18 July) confirmed the 13-year sentence of Croatian Serb leader Milan Babic for his role in a campaign to drive Croats out of the self-proclaimed Serb republic of Krajina in 1991-1992. 
He surrendered voluntarily and pleaded guilty as part of a plea bargain with prosecutors, who dropped several charges against him and proposed an 11-year sentence. 
But the tribunal's appeals chamber said the judges on the original panel were right to ignore that recommendation and impose a longer sentence.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) said on Friday (22 September) that it reviewed the draft accord for special parallel ties to be sealed between Republika Srpska (RS) and Serbia and found it very similar to one drafted in 2001, which the OHR viewed as acceptable.
The statement, however, said the OHR is seeking additional clarification regarding some parts of the agreement, due to be signed on Tuesday in Banja Luka.
Bosniak politicians have objected to the agreement and called for OHR intervention.

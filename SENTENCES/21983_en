BERLIN, Germany -- The European Commission (EC) is asking Germany to explain its decision to restrict the number of Romanian and Bulgarian low-skilled workers it admits until 2011, Romanian and Bulgarian media reported on Monday (July 21st). 
The German government demanded the EU postpone its restrictions on Eastern European workers until 2011 even though Germany urgently needs labour. 
"Germany must provide an explanation, and then I will see if the arguments are convincing," Vladimir Spidla, EU commissioner for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities, told the daily Allgemeine Zeitung in Bonn on Saturday. 
An EU member state can decide to close its borders to foreign workers until 2011 if the government proves there is a serious risk of labour market disruption, he added.

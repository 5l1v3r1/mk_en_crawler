SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The foreign ministry announced Tuesday (27 January) that the seven NATO invitees -- Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia -- might join the Alliance in April rather than May. 
Ministry spokesman Lyubomir Todorov said the NATO foreign ministers had agreed in December that the invitees could join as soon as all NATO members had ratified accession treaties. 
The sole holdout, France, is expected to complete the process in February. 
Thus, the seven acceding states could participate in NATO's June Istanbul summit as full-fledged members.

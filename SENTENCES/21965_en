ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic unveiled a new anti-corruption action plan Monday (June 16th) aimed to help the country complete its EU accession negotiations next year.
"I am not satisfied.
Despite many institutions being involved in anti-graft activities, the problem persists," Mesic said after a meeting with Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and Parliament Speaker Luka Bebic.
"We've yielded some results, but there have to be more steps," Sanader said.
Anti-corruption measures and judicial reforms are among the main requirements Croatia must meet to end its EU accession talks next year.
The country hopes to join the bloc in 2010 or 2011.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former British Foreign Secretary David Owen, who served as Europe's representative in the Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) peace talks in the early 1990s, told the UN war crimes tribunal on Monday (3 November) that Slobodan Milosevic could have ended the conflict as early as 1993.
The British diplomat recounted meetings and conversations with the then Serbian president at which he had urged him to exert pressure on Bosnian Serb leaders to accept the provisions of a plan Owen had developed with former US Secretary of State Cyrus Vance.
During cross-examination, Milosevic admitted he sent aid to the Bosnian Serb authorities, but denied he had any control over their army.

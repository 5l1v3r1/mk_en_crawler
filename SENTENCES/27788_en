BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliament adopted amendments to the criminal procedure code Friday (October 22nd) that are expected to boost the fight against hooliganism and violence. 
The changes would extend the pre-trial detention of those arrested for taking part in street riots or at sports venues from eight to 30 days. 
The catalysts, earlier this month, were riots during Belgrade's Gay Pride parade and riots by Serbian hooligans in Genoa, Italy, that forced the cancellation of the Italy-Serbia European Championship qualifying match. 
Tomo Zoric, spokesperson for the state public prosecutor's office, refuted criticism by some opposition parties who suggest the changes could lead to human rights violations.

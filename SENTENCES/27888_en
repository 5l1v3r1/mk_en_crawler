BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government adopted a law on lustration Wednesday (May 19th) that limits the involvement of former communist officials in politics. 
The bill was supported by 203 of the 343 members of the Chamber of Deputies; 40 voted against it and 12 abstained. 
The Senate adopted it in April 2006, which means it will take effect after the president signs it.

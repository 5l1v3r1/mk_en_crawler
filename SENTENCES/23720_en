SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Chief Prosecutor Milorad Barasin confirmed on Thursday (July 23rd) that an investigation is under way against General Atif Dudakovic following a video that surfaced this week purportedly showing Dudakovic ordering his Muslim troops to shoot and kill two captured Serb soldiers 1994. 
Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik says the footage, aired by Bosnian Serb television RTRS, proves that BiH judicial institutions cannot be trusted. 
He noted that three years ago, RS filed charges against Dudakovic for war crimes, but prosecutors never followed through. 
Dudakovic challenges the authenticity of the footage, calling it propaganda. 
He says the soldiers allegedly killed in the video are alive.

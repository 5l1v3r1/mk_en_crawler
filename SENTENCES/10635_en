ATHENS, Greece -- An estimated 4,000 Greeks and Albanians marched together in downtown Athens on Thursday (9 September) to protest recent violence between football fans from the two countries.
An Albanian man was stabbed to death and several others were injured during fighting in a number of Greek towns after Albania's football team upset Euro 2004 champions Greece in Tirana on Saturday.
The march was organised by the rights group Albanian Immigrants Forum and various Greek anti-racist groups.
There was a smaller rally in Thessaloniki.

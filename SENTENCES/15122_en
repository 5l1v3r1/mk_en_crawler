THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Wednesday (30 November) acquitted two former members of the KLA -- one of them a senior commander -- and sentenced a third defendant in the same case to 13 years in prison.
The judges said prosecutors had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Fatmir Limaj, currently a leading member of Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo, and Isak Musliu had any direct role in a prison camp in Lapusnik where Serbs and Albanian "collaborators" were tortured and murdered in July 1998.
A third defendant, Haradin Bala, was convicted of taking part in the killing of nine prisoners.
He is the first ethnic Albanian to be sentenced for war crimes.

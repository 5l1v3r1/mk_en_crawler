ZAGREB, Croatia -- Heavy snow earlier this week hampered travel in parts of Croatia and Romania. 
Significant delays were reported by airlines, rail and bus companies on Wednesday (8 January). 
Conditions virtually cut off Croatia's Adriatic coast from the rest of the country. 
The biggest threat in Romania is avalanches. 
Tourists have been urged to avoid several popular mountain areas.

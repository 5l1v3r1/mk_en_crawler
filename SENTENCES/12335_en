SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The United States will provide $15m in assistance to Bulgaria for army modernisation projects, it was announced after a meeting Thursday (7 July) between Foreign Minister Solomon Passy and US Ambassador to Bulgaria James Pardew. 
Pardew praised Bulgaria's contribution to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as NATO missions in other countries.
Also Thursday, members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to expel the president of the Bulgarian Olympic Committee on corruption charges. 
The BBC aired a tape last year in which Ivan Slavkov discussed ways to bribe IOC members with journalists who were posing as promoters of London's bid for the 2012 Olympics.

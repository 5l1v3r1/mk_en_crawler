BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu told Romanian TV Thursday (September 27th) that a planned no confidence vote against the cabinet of Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu is not a priority.
Although "worthy of full appreciation", the vote mainly reflects a power struggle within the PSD, he said.
Basescu added that organising European Parliament elections is more important right now.
The deadline for parties to submit their candidates expired on Thursday.
The elections are scheduled for November 25th.

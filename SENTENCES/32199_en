PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- President Ibrahim Rugova on Friday (8 November) appointed former US senator and presidential candidate Bob Dole as Kosovo's honorary representative in the United States. 
"Dole is a great friend of Kosovo who has been supporting Kosovo's fight for freedom, independence and democracy for more than a decade", a statement issued by Rugova said. 
An UNMIK spokesperson, criticising the move, stressed that only UNMIK chief Michael Steiner is authorised to handle Kosovo foreign policy.

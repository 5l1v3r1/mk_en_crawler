PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Voters went to the polls Sunday (10 September) for the first elections since Montenegro split from its union with Serbia in late May.
At stake are 81 parliamentary seats, seen as especially crucial since the new parliament will be adopting a constitution for Montenegro.
Mayors of 13 municipalities are also being elected, along with councillors in 14 municipalities.
Around 2,500 observers are monitoring the election.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Sorin Ducaru, Romania's permanent representative to NATO, said on Tuesday (October 23rd) that negotiations are under way on an additional project, aimed at protecting the southeastern part of the Alliance from missile strikes. 
It would cover Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, southern Italy and Croatia, if it is invited to join NATO. 
Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey are not part of the proposed US missile shield in Europe because it is aimed to protect countries from intercontinental ballistic missiles and this zone is not vulnerable to such missiles, Ducaru explained.

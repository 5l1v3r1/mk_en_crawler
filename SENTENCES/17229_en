SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Supreme Court on Tuesday (December 26th) acquitted a former Bosnian Serb army soldier, Pero Radic, of committing crimes against prisoners of war in BiH.
Following an appeal, the top magistrates overturned an eight-year sentence handed down by the Livno Cantonal Court in March.
The high court ruled there was no firm evidence that Radic was responsible for the murder of a Croatian soldier in Glamoc on April 11th, 1992.
Radic was immediately released.
He had surrendered to Glamoc authorities last October.

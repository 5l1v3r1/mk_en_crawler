Miroslav Kostadinov, better known by his artistic name Miro, will represent Bulgaria at the 2010 Eurovision Song Contest in Oslo with his "Angel Si Ti" (You are an angel).
"Bulgarians need victories" to boost their national ego, said the singer and songwriter.
Following a controversial pick for the competition in 2009, the selection system was replaced with one organised by the Bulgarian National Television (BNT).
Under the new rules, a panel of 51 music experts was asked to choose the country's representative for the Oslo contest.
Miro won the nomination by getting ten votes.
"This is a responsibility one must accept," he said when the results were announced.
In early February, Miro presented the five songs -- written especially for him -- from which voters made their selection.
The final contest, held February 28th, was broadcast live by both the BNT as well as the Bulgarian National Radio.
Nearly half of the viewers voted for "You Are An Angel" while the runner-up trailed by more than 20%.
Renowned choreographer Venol King, who has assisted such stars as Michael Jackson, Prince and Tina Turner, went to Sofia in mid-March to help Miro prepare for Oslo.
This year's competition will bring together participants from 39 countries, including the five -- Britain, France, Germany, Norway and Spain -- that have already qualified for the May 29th finals.
Miro is scheduled to appear at Oslo's 23,000-seat Telenor Arena in a semi-final round on May 27th.
He began his musical career in 1993 and had won several awards by 1999 when he met singer Galina Kurdova, who performs under the name Galya.
They formed a group called KariZma.
By 2007, KariZma was among the most popular music groups in Bulgaria.

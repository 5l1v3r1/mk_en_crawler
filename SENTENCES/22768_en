BELGRADE, Serbia -- New Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic assumed his duties on Tuesday (July 8th) after a swearing-in ceremony in Belgrade. 
He replaces Vojislav Kostunica. 
Cvetkovic, 57, said EU accession would be his cabinet's main priority and pledged to push ahead with ratification of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU. 
He also vowed that his government would never recognise Kosovo as an independent state.
On Monday, meanwhile, a Serbian Democratic Party spokesperson announced that former Prime Minister Kostunica will not be an MP "for the time being". 
Instead, Kostunica will head the political council that a party meeting on Tuesday established.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Defence Minister Vesselin Bliznakov returned from Brussels Tuesday (22 November), where he and counterparts from Cyprus, Greece and Romania sealed an agreement on establishing an EU rapid reaction combat force. 
The structure -- to be led by Greece -- is to become operational in June 2007 and would handle any emerging crisis in the Balkans.

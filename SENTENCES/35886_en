SOFIA, Bulgaria -- General Prosecution Office officials met on Tuesday (20 January) with a Europol delegation headed by the Chief Commissioner of Police for The Hague region, Jan Wiarda.
They discussed issues of co-operation.
The Bulgarians reiterated their commitment to providing assistance to Europol's joint research team, established to monitor implementation of the action plan against human trafficking.
It was adopted last year at the Crete meeting of EU member police chiefs.
In June, Bulgaria and Europol signed an agreement on co-operation in the fight against international organised crime, including the exchange of personal data.

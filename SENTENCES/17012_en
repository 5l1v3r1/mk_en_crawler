BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Speaker of the Republika Srpska (RS) Council of Peoples, Remzija Kadric, explicitly ruled out the possibility Wednesday (2 August) that the council would be abolished or have its powers reduced.
On Tuesday, RS Parliament Chairman Igor Radojcic had suggested that the Serb bloc might initiate changes to the RS Constitution aimed at redefining the powers of the Council of Peoples.
He argues that Bosniak and Croat representatives are damaging entity interests by using the mechanism for protection of vital national interests to block key legislation.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The former editor-in-chief of the weekly newspaper Novi Brodski List, Miroslav Juric, heads to jail on Monday (19 July) after refusing to pay a fine imposed for libel.
The Pozega Municipal Court fined Juric 1,700 euros for an article alleging that the Slavonski Brod county prosecutor and a county court judge were corrupt.
Juric instead will spend 70 days in jail.
Such sentences were recently condemned by the OSCE.
In other news, Croatia and Macedonia signed an agreement Friday on co-operation in the fields of science, technology and education.
The four-year agreement is aimed at boosting ties between the countries' academic communities.

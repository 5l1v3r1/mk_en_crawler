VIENNA, Austria -- The next round of Kosovo decentralisation negotiations between teams from Belgrade and Pristina will take place on 4-5 May in Vienna, UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's office confirmed on Thursday (27 April). 
According to a statement from the office, the focus will be on the formation of new municipalities in the province.
In other news, the first group of 24 Serb refugees have returned to the town of Istok and the Blagaca village in northwest Kosovo, according to media reports Thursday. 
They are staying at centres for displaced persons until their homes -- destroyed during the Kosovo conflict -- are rebuilt under an ongoing UNMIK project.

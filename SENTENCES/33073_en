BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Authorities in Banja Luka are stepping up security measures, in advance of Sunday's (22 June) visit by Pope John Paul II. 
Leaders of all the ethnic communities said they expect the pope will deliver strong messages urging improved relations among Serbs, Muslims, and Croats in the entity. 
They also expect an appeal for forgiveness and for the faster return of refugees. 
According to local statistics, of the estimated 29,000 Muslims who left, only 6,000 have returned since the conflict ended in 1995.

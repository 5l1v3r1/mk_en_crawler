SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Boris Trajkovski, Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski and Army Chief of Staff General Metodi Stamboliski met on Monday (26 January) to discuss the progress of defence sector reforms and adoption of the Strategic Defence Review, necessary for eventual NATO membership.
The review outlines main parameters for defence development over the next few years.
It will be forwarded to parliament for approval by the end of March.
A senior NATO delegation visits Skopje soon to assess military reforms.

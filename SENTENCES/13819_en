BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU Council welcomed on Monday (20 March) the agreement on crucial BiH constitutional reforms reached by leaders of the main BiH political parties at the weekend.
At a meeting in Brussels, the EU foreign ministers said the accords represented a significant step towards strengthening BiH state institutions and boosting the country's ability to meet European standards.
The Council called on local leaders to ensure the amendments are in effect before the October general elections.
On Monday however, three smaller Bosniak parties -- the Party for BiH, BOSS and the Social Democratic Union -- refused to support the reforms.
They had wanted to remove the principle of ethnic voting in the BiH House of Representatives, under which a certain percentage of deputies from each entity must support a decision.
In other news, prosecutors in Mostar are charging two Bosnian Croats with war crimes.
They say Miroslav Marijanovic and Ante Buhovac committed crimes in 1993 against Bosniak civilians and prisoners of war at the Heliodrom camp, where the two served as guards.

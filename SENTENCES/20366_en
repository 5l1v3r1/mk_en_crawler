ANKARA, Turkey -- President Abdullah Gul managed on Tuesday (November 13th) to bring together for the first time Israeli and Palestinian counterparts Shimon Peres and Mahmud Abbas. 
Meeting at the presidential palace in Ankara, the three leaders signed an agreement to implement a joint project to build two industrial zones on the West Bank. 
They are aimed at boosting the economy of the Palestinian territories and ensuring stability in the Middle East. 
The Palestinian Authority will provide the land, Turkey is to implement the project, and Israel is to guarantee its security.
Abbas praised Turkey for its readiness to mediate peace efforts in the Middle East, a sentiment echoed by Peres in an unprecedented speech to Turkish lawmakers. 
It marked the first time an Israeli leader addressed the parliament of a predominantly Muslim country.

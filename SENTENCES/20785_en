ZAGREB, Croatia -- The defence ministry estimates that joining NATO may save the country $3 billion dollars in military spending over time. 
According to findings presented on Thursday (September 6th), the biggest savings would come from personnel cuts: instead of maintaining between 50,000 and 250,000 personnel, Croatia would provide for a 16,000 member professional army. 
Compulsory military service is being eliminated next year. 
Army modernisation costs would run about 52m euros a year if Croatia joins NATO, compared to 129m euros a year, if it does not.
In other news Thursday, police arrested the commander of the firefighting service in central Sibenik County, who dispatched a group of 23 firefighters to battle a blaze on Kornat Island last week. 
Eleven have died from burns sustained when the wind shifted and they became trapped by flames.

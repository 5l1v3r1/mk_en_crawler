ATHENS, Greece -- The parliament approved a new set of government austerity measures intended to cut Greece's huge budget deficit on Friday (March 5th).
The opposition voted against the plan, while the Communist Party boycotted the vote.
The plan aims to cut spending by an extra 2.4 billion euros while raising the same amount in revenue.
The vote came as thousands of people protested the measures outside the parliament building.
The demonstration turned violent as young people threw stones at police who returned volley with tear gas.
A small group of demonstrators attacked the leader of the main private sector labour union -- GSEE head Yiannis Panagopoulos -- as he was delivering a speech.
The GSEE and public sector union ADEDY on Friday urged their members to join a general strike against the government's anti-crisis measures on March 11th.
Meanwhile, at a press conference with Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou in Berlin on Friday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Athens has not asked for financial assistance to handle the crisis.
Papandreou again said that Greece would go it alone.
Earlier in the day, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said that Greek financial problems should be resolved within the eurozone and ruled out any help from the IMF besides technical assistance.

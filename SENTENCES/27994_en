ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Leaders from the region wrapped up a Southeast European Co-operation Process (SEECP) summit in Istanbul on Wednesday (June 23rd). 
In a final declaration, they reiterated their commitment to European and Euro-Atlantic integration and vowed to strengthen co-operation and boost ties. 
"We want the EU to support the membership of countries and to refrain from taking steps that delay the process," Turkish President Abdullah Gul told the wrap-up press conference. 
EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele attended the summit and had urged Turkey to speed up its reform process. 
Turkey, which assumed the chairmanship of the organisation in June 2009, transferred it to Montenegro.
At a trilateral conference, Gul and Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic were joined by Serbian counterpart Boris Tadic, whose country will take over the chairmanship from Podgorica. 
Tadic is expected to pay his first official visit to Montenegro in July, describing the trip as an opportunity to discuss a range of topics concerning bilateral and regional co-operation, as well as the EU integration process. 
Vujanovic said Montenegro wants to boost co-operation with Serbia, especially in the economic sector.
Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou also attended the conference, meeting briefly on the sidelines with Macedonian counterpart Nikola Gruevski about the longstanding name dispute. 
Both leaders reiterated that they want to find a mutually acceptable solution.

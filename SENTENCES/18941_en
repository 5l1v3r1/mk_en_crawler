ATHENS, Greece -- The Appeals Court upheld on Thursday (May 3rd) the convictions of members of the November 17th terrorist group, responsible for a series of assassinations of prominent Greek and foreign targets between 1975 and 2000. 
The five judges pronounced their final verdicts under extremely tight security in a specially constructed courtroom at Korydallos Prison in Athens. 
They reportedly confirmed life sentences for six November 17th members, including founder Alexander Giotopoulos, and upheld eight-year sentences for seven other extremists.

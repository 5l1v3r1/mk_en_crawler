WASHINGTON, United States -- Kosovo will need an estimated 1.3 billion euros in financial assistance over the next few years to build its economy and institutions, Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried told a senate panel in Washington on Tuesday (March 4th).
"We cannot simply assume that Kosovo is on autopilot and walk away.
This is going to take high-level sustained attention through the end of this administration and into the next," Fried said.
He added that the EU could secure half the necessary support, the US has earmarked about 230m euros, and the rest could be provided by international financial institutions.
Fried also announced that a major donors' conference to benefit Kosovo will be held in June.
As for the latest developments in Serbia, Fried said the United States hopes Belgrade will change its course and pursue EU integration.

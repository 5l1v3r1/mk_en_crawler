BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu on Tuesday (January 15th) nominated Defence Minister Teodor Melescanu to serve as interim justice minister, pending the appointment of a permanent one.
President Traian Basescu rejected nominee Norica Nicolai, citing her misconduct as a senator and her negative public image.
On Tuesday, Basescu approved Melescanu's nomination and appointed him to the post.
Tudor Chiuariu resigned from the position in mid-December, amid a criminal investigation against him.

ATHENS, Greece -- Authorities announced on Wednesday (December 29th) that they have detained a pro-Kurdish politician from an outlawed party in Turkey after he entered Greece with fake papers.
Mustafa Sarikaya, former deputy leader of the Democratic Society Party (DTP), was stopped last week at the Thessaloniki airport.
He had arrived from Cyprus with fake Bulgarian papers and requested political asylum.
A court in Thessaloniki cleared him of charges of entering Greece illegally, accepting that he faced political prosecution in Turkey where he spent a total of 20 years in prison.
Asylum proceedings are pending.
Turkey's Constitutional Court banned the DTP last year over its alleged ties to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party.

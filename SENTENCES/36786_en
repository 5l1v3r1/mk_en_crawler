ATHENS, Greece -- A 26km tram network connecting Athens with the coastal suburbs begins operation Monday (19 July). 
Built for next month's Olympics, the network will operate on a 24-hour basis and is capable of transporting 80,000 passengers per day. 
Transport Minister Mihalis Liapis says it should help ease traffic congestion in southern Athens.

TIRANA, Albania -- Environment Minister Ethem Ruka told the AFP on Monday (24 May) that his country faces a potential environmental crisis as a result of toxic gas emissions into the atmosphere.
Ruka says 90 per cent of Tirana's 100,000 vehicles are too old and 70 per cent use diesel fuel.
The use of leaded fuel releases large amounts of sulfur into the atmosphere.
Ruka is asking the international community to provide financial assistance to back government efforts to reduce emissions.
In other news Monday, two cousins were killed and at least ten people seriously injured during a mine-clearing demonstration in Kukes.
Authorities are trying to determine why a live mine was used in the lesson for local residents.

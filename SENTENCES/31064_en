SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Thousands of people gathered on Sunday (December 5th) in Skopje to protest government policies and seek early elections. 
Crowd estimates varied widely, but independent observers put it at more than 15,000. 
Branko Crvenkovski, leader of the main opposition Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM), accused the government of corruption and poor management. 
He announced that the opposition bloc led by the SDSM has drafted three documents for submission to parliament -- an initiative to amend the election law, a proposal to establish a committee to monitor election lists and a request to dissolve parliament and call snap elections. 
The rally ended without incident.

DUBROVNIK, Croatia -- Serbia should turn its attention to efforts to join the EU and give up its opposition to independence for Kosovo, US Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Daniel Fried said in an interview published on Saturday (July 7th).
He said Slobodan Milosevic lost Kosovo years ago, and that Serbs will again live in one political entity only when all countries of the former Yugoslavia and the Balkans join the Union.
Fried also praised a French proposal to delay a decision on Kosovo's future by six months.
Meanwhile, during a visit to Podgorica Friday, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic warned neighbouring states against unilateral actions concerning Kosovo, including recognition of independence.
He was the first Serbian foreign minister to visit Montenegro since its split with Serbia last year.

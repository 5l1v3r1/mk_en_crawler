SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- International community High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling will meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Thursday (January 11th).
The talks with Merkel, whose country assumed the rotating EU presidency earlier this month, are expected to focus on the situation in BiH in the light of Peace Implementation Council plans to close the Office of the High Representative within months, replacing it with the Office of the EU Special Representative.

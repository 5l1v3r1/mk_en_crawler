ANKARA, Turkey -- Police arrested ten suspects, including two generals, for their alleged participation in the ultra-nationalist secularist group Ergenekon, which authorities suspect of plotting a coup against the government, Anadolu Agency said Saturday (July 5th). 
Authorities detained retired generals Sener Eruygur, former commander of the gendarmerie forces, and Hursit Tolon, former commander of the First Army, on Tuesday. 
They formally arrested them on Saturday and sent them to Istanbul prison early on Sunday, Hurriyet said. 
Defence attorney Filiz Esen denied accusations that the two were among the leaders of Ergenekon. 
On Friday, prosecutors said they would delay their indictment of Ergenekon to accommodate new arrests and revelations.

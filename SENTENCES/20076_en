SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The World Bank has approved a new four-year country strategy entitling BiH to receive up to $400m between 2008 and 2013. 
That is double the current amount of IMF loans to BiH. 
After presenting the strategy in Sarajevo on Monday (December 17th), Marco Mantovanelli, country manager for the BiH, said the funds would target investments in infrastructure, community development, transport, energy, the business environment and reforms to the judicial and social security sectors. 
Mantovanelli explained the new strategy is based on partnership and thus is much different from the old post-war strategy. 
This would open access to financing from the International Development Agency and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, underscoring growing international confidence in the BiH's economy, Mantovanelli said.

SMOLYAN, Bulgaria -- Foreign Minister Solomon Passy said on Wednesday (13 August) that the country plans to open a new border checkpoint with Greece at Elidzhe in 2005.
Construction of the road from the southern town of Rudozem to the future border crossing is to begin next year.
The tender for the construction of the 10km road segment, which is estimated to cost 11m euros, will likely be completed in April.
The EU has allocated 8m euros under the PHARE programme to finance the project.
Road construction on the Greek side is expected to begin next year as well.

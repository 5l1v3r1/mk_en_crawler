ZAGREB, Croatia -- Government sources told the Croatian news agency HINA last week that ten EU members are expected to ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Croatia by the end of June. 
So far, the document has been approved by the parliaments of Germany, Denmark, Ireland, Austria, Spain and the Netherlands. 
The Dutch government, however, has blocked passage of the document to EU headquarters because of delays in the war crimes case against Croatia's retired Gen Janko Bobetko. 
France and Greece are expected to sign the Agreement in March and June, respectively. 
According to diplomatic sources, the other two EU members intending to complete the procedure are Belgium and Sweden.

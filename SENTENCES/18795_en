BELGRADE, Serbia -- With the latest set of talks proving fruitless, efforts to reach agreement on a coalition government in Serbia remain mired in a dispute over ministerial posts. 
On Sunday (May 6th), Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica publicly blamed President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party (DS), saying it had rejected all "compromise". 
In turn, Tadic said his party was ready to hash out a deal, but would insist on taking over top posts in law enforcement and security. 
Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia, it said, has failed to deliver reforms in those areas, and co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal has stalled. 
Serbia's EU integration talks were frozen last year as a result.
On Monday, Parliament hopes to complete its constituent session, which was suspended on February 14th. 
All parties say they plan to attend the session, during which a new speaker and deputy speakers are to be appointed. 
Unless the legislature elects a new government by May 14th, new parliamentary elections would have to be held.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey's National Security Council (NSC) will convene on Friday (19 September) to discuss the issue of sending peacekeeping troops to Iraq. 
The NSC, which has no longer decision-making power but remains a strong influence on public opinion, is expected to support President Ahmet Necdet Sezer's view that Turkish troops should be dispatched to Iraq only within the framework of a UN resolution. 
Commenting on the issue, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Thursday that such a resolution was very important.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Foreign Minister Solomon Passy leaves for Libya on Tuesday (18 May), the first such diplomatic visit since a court in Benghazi issued death sentences to five Bulgarian nurses accused of intentionally infecting nearly 400 Libyan children with HIV.
Efforts are likewise underway to arrange a visit by Libyan leader Moammar Khaddafi to Bulgaria.

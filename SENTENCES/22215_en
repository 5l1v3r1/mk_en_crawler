SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Chiefs of staff from NATO's 26 member countries discussed the situation in the Caucasus following the Georgian-Russian conflict, at a three-day conference of the Alliance's military committee in Sofia. 
"We looked at the strategic implications," the head of NATO's military committee, Italian Admiral Giampaolo Di Paola, told a press conference Sunday (September 14th). 
"What is important now is to stay cool and not to react emotionally as sometimes easily happens in the heat of an event," he said, adding participants considered several possible scenarios for the situation in Georgia, future challenges and the Alliance's possible responses.

Before the Kostelic family transformed it, Alpine skiing was not a popular sport in Croatia. 
The country lacks mountains, and ski lovers usually travel to neighbouring Slovenia for winter sports -- or even further, to Austria and Italy.
However, sports fans across Croatia, and indeed across the world, have been gripped by the determination of Janica Kostelic, her brother, Ivica, and their father Ante.
Janica was born on January 5, 1982, in Zagreb. 
In her youth, she participated in, and won, all the junior categories in the sport. 
In her last junior season, 1996-1997, she won the Topolino and Pinoccio in slalom and giant slalom.
Kostelic retires as a triple overall winner in the Federation Internationale de Ski (FIS) World Cup in 2000-2001, 2002-2003 and 2005-2006, and with four Olympic gold and two Olympic silver medals -- Salt Lake City 2002 and Turin 2006.
She was five time gold medallist in two FIS World Championship in alpine skiing -- St. 
Moritz 2003 and Bormio/Santa Caterina 2005.
In the FIS World Cup, Kostelic won 30 races in all five alpine disciplines. 
She won three Crystal Globes in the FIS World Cup slalom.
At St. 
Moritz in 1999, Kostelic tore four of the seven ligaments in her right knee. 
After numerous injuries, her return to the 2000/2001 World Cup was remarkable -- she won seven of the eight slalom events. 
However, she then had problems with her thyroid gland, which was surgically removed in 2004.
Croatian media are now taking stock of her achievements and her well-deserved place in sports history. 
Most comments have a common thread -- that perhaps one day Janica will return to alpine skiing. 
At the same time, commentators say her wish for a normal life is understandable.
The Kostelic legacy is enormous. 
In Croatia, there are new ski princesses who await their shot at the throne, and Kostelic has been an inspiration to them all. 
Not bad for a little girl who, as her mother remembers, "kept falling and getting into the other children's way, and we thought that she'd never learn how to ski".
Every time Janica won a major championship or returned with her gold medals from the Olympics, Croatians flocked to welcome her back -- their hero.

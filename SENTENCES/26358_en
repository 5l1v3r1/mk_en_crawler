LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor and her Slovenian counterpart Borut Pahor reached an agreement on unfreezing Zagreb's EU accession talks and continuing negotiations on solving their border dispute, the two officials announced following their meeting in Ljubljana on Friday (September 11th).
The deal was reached after Croatia decided to withdraw all documents submitted to the European Commission that may pre-judge the border conflict.
Kosor has already sent a statement to the Swedish EU presidency saying that no document or statement during the negotiation process will have any legal impact on resolving the border issue.
The two sides will continue talks with the mediation of the EU.
The resumption of Croatia's negotiations can be expected shortly after the Slovenian parliament supports the proposal to lift the blockade.
Negotiations were blocked at the end of 2008, resulting in a postponement of the country's EU bid by almost one year.

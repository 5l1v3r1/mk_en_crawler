NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul pledged on Monday (19 July) Ankara's continued support for the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. 
He added the Turkish authorities would make every effort to defend the Turkish Cypriots' case and help them develop politically and economically. 
He called on Greek Cypriots to display the same goodwill Turkish Cypriots demonstrated when they approved a UN plan to reunify the island in April.

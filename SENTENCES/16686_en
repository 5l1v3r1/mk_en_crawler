ZAGREB, Croatia -- The parliamentary committee for mandates and immunity decided on Tuesday (9 May) to propose that lawmakers lift the immunity of Branimir Glavas, a former Croatian Democratic Union deputy, now serving as an independent. 
The panel convened at the request of prosecutors, who recently confirmed that they would launch proceedings against Glavas for alleged war crimes committed against Serb civilians in Osijek in 1991. 
He was a head of the regional defence headquarters at that time. 
Glavas denies the accusations, calling them groundless and politically motivated.

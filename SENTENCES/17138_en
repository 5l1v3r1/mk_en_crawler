THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal on Friday (30 June) sentenced Naser Oric, the Bosnian Muslim military commander at Srebrenica during the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to two years in prison for failing to prevent the torture and murder of Serb prisoners in 1992-1993.
It acquitted Oric, 39, of all charges of direct involvement in the atrocities and cleared him of allegations that he ordered the destruction of Serb villages.
The three judges said Oric was totally inexperienced and had no communications with superiors outside the enclave.
The court took into account the three years Oric has already spent in detention and released him from custody.
The ruling was welcomed in Sarajevo but sharply criticised in Belgrade and Banja Luka.
In separate statements, Serbian and Bosnian Serb leaders said the decision reflected dual standards and undermined the tribunal's credibility.
Serbian President Boris Tadic called the sentence "scandalous".
Prosecutors had asked for an 18-year term.
In other news, the United States has extradited two Bosnian Serbs wanted by Sarajevo's special war crimes court.
The two are "suspected of participation in war crimes and genocide committed in July 1995 in Srebrenica", a federal prosecutor said.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- In a joint declaration Monday (28 June), leaders of the NATO countries said the Alliance's doors remain open to new members and encouraged Albania, Croatia and Macedonia to continue reforms that would bring them closer to accession.
The declaration stopped short of meeting a request from the three countries' foreign ministers, who had asked that NATO start evaluating their preparedness for accession immediately after the summit's end.

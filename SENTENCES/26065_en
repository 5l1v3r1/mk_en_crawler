PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Central Election Commission (CEC) released preliminary results Monday (November 16th) of Sunday's municipal elections, determining that 20 of the 36 municipalities will have to hold another round in December.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party won in five municipalities in the first round, followed by the opposition Alliance for the Future of Kosovo with four and the Democratic League of Kosovo with three municipalities.
Serb parties won in three new municipalities, while the Turkish Democratic Party of Kosovo won in Mamusha/Mamusa.
CEC Chairwoman Nesrin Lushta said final results are expected by week's end.
Irregularities were minor, she added.
But the opposition party New Kosovo Alliance has released video that seems to show members of election commission in Gjakova filling ballot boxes after the polling station had closed.
Local media released videos from Viti showing the same thing.
Meanwhile, representatives of six Serb parties that competed for the Gracanica municipality accused the Independent Liberal Party (SLS) and the Kosovo government of manipulating voters and are demanding that the results be nullified.
The parties say Prime Minister Thaci supported the SLS financially in order to influence voters.

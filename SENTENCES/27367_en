ANKARA, Turkey -- Two years after blocking access to the website due to material deemed insulting to the country's founder, Turkey has lifted its ban on YouTube. 
Transport Minister Binali Yildirim, who oversees Internet issues, said the government has contacted Google, which owns YouTube. 
Yildirim said there is no reason for the ban, now that the offending videos are gone. 
Insulting Mustafa Kemal Ataturk or "Turkishness" is illegal in Turkey. 
Appearing on local television Saturday, Yildirim said the ban had been lifted after "common sense prevailed".

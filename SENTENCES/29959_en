PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Newly elected President Behgjet Pacolli walked over the Ibar River bridge that separates Mitrovica into the Serb-dominated north and the Albanian-dominated south on Saturday (February 26th), saying his visit demonstrates that institutions have not forgotten residents of the divided town. 
"To me, there is no north or south; there is geographically, but not in political or administrative sense," Pacolli said.

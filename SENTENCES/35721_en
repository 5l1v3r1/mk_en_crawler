BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Socialist Party of Serbia deputy head Milorad Vucelic said Sunday (1 February) that the party is ready to support a cabinet and parliament speaker proposed by the democratic parties. 
Vojislav Kostunica has implied that his Democratic Party of Serbia could turn to the Socialists for support to end the current stalemate. 
Vucelic says his party is not seeking any post in the new government but would support the democratic parties' proposal simply to resolve the situation, which has dragged on now for weeks.

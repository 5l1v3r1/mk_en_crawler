BUCHAREST, Romania -- EU Agriculture Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel urged Romania and Bulgaria to step up the pace of reforms, to ensure entry into the EU in January 2007, as planned.
During talks in Bucharest on Thursday (16 March), Boel also stressed the need to boost the rate at which Romania absorbs EU funding.
In a message she echoed later in Sofia, Boel called for greater efforts to launch agencies to handle EU financing in the agricultural sector, and for more programmes to train staff in this area.
In Sofia, meanwhile, during a meeting with ambassadors from EU member states, Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev stressed that all government institutions are working actively to address areas of concern cited in the European Commission's most recent monitoring report.
The next one is expected in May.

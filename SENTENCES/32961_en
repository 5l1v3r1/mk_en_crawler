TREBINJE, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Police pressed charges Monday (26 May) against former Republika Srpska (RS) Energy Minister Bosko Lemez and the former head of the Elektroprivreda RS power utility, Svetozar Acimovic, over a recent embezzlement scandal involving 80m euros.
The two are charged with abuse of office and mismanagement that resulted in huge losses for the electricity company last year.
The scandal emerged after an international audit early this year.
Meanwhile, a delegation from RS visited Ljubljana on Monday to discuss economic co-operation.
RS Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic urged Slovene businessmen to invest in RS and participate in the privatisation of strategic companies.

TIRANA, Albania -- A group of citizens in Tirana submitted a request to the Central Elections Commission (CEC) on Monday (August 9th) to organise a referendum on whether ballots from the June 2009 elections should be recounted. 
The group suggests the following questions to be answered by a simple YES or NO -- should the ballots from the 2009 parliamentary elections be counted? 
Should the recount be led by the civil society, and should the recount be done by the CEC? 
One of the referendum initiators, Andi Gjoliku, said that the time has come for citizens to decide for themselves by voting, a right guaranteed by the constitution. 
The CEC must reply within 20 days. 
The ballots and investigations into them have divided the government and the opposition for more than a year, slowing EU-related reforms.

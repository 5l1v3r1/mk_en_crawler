SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Richard Holbrooke, architect of the peace agreement that ended the 1992-1995 conflict, says BiH has made little progress since the signing of the Dayton Accord. 
During a meeting Friday (April 11th) with Presidency member Zeljko Komsic, Holbrooke said the Accord states clearly that neither entity may be separated. 
He urged the country to fully establish constitutional order, saying this will help it on the road to EU and NATO membership. 
Holbrooke was making a private visit to the country.

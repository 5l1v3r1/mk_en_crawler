ATHENS, Greece -- Police found 195kg of explosives Saturday (April 17th) at a hideout of terror organisation Revolutionary Struggle.
"It is a quite big quantity," police spokesman Thanassis Kokkalakis said, adding that "it could have brought down a six-storey apartment block." The explosives were discovered in an apartment rented under a fake identity by one of six suspected members of the group, who were arrested earlier in the week.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Police have tightened security measures ahead of Friday's (February 16th) expected verdict in the trial of 73 alleged al-Qaeda supporters, charged with the November 2003 suicide bombing in Istanbul.
A total of 58 people were killed and hundreds injured in the bombings at a British-owned HSBC Bank, the British consulate and two synagogues.
The prosecution is seeking a life sentence for Syrian defendant Loa'i al-Saqa and four Turks, the alleged ringleaders.

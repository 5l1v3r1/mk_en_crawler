ATHENS, Greece -- Addressing parliament on Friday (February 26th), Prime Minister George Papandreou declared the country's financial crisis is worse than previously thought and that drastic action is needed immediately.
Speaking after EU and IMF experts arrived in Athens to evaluate measures to address the emergency, Papandreous said:
"...
our biggest fears were confirmed.
It is our duty today to forget the political price and think only of the survival of our country.
We must do whatever we can now.
Tomorrow will be too late."
Repeating that he was not seeking a bailout from other countries -- even as German bankers arrived to offer 300 billion euros of refinancing -- Papandreou promised his government would cut huge budget deficits to avoid destabilising economies throughout the eurozone.
While the prime minister did not hide the grim assessment of the financial specialists, he again blamed the huge deficit on the previous government.
Papandreou announced Friday that he plans to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel on March 5th.
He is also scheduled to meet US President Barack Obama on March 9th.

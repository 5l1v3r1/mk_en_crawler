ATHENS, Greece -- About 50 of over 280 migrants who have been staging a hunger strike in Thessaloniki and Athens for five weeks now have been admitted to hospital, local media reported on Tuesday (March 1st.) The migrants, most of them from North Africa, have been insisting on receiving resident permits.
The government, however, refuses.
Supporters of the protestors say some have stopped drinking water.
According to local reports, supporters gathered outside the parliament building in Athens, where they clashed briefly with the police.

CAIRO, Egypt -- A total of 1,444 Turkish citizens have been evacuated from Egypt by several airplanes mobilised by the country over the past two days, authorities announced on Sunday (January 30th). 
The foreign ministry says it is closely watching the situation in the African country, the scene of unprecedented massive protests against the rule of President Hosni Mubarak for a week now. 
At least 102 people have been killed since the protests began.
Greek authorities decided on Sunday to send military aircraft to evacuate all Greeks wishing to leave Egypt. 
Cyprus, meanwhile, said it is preparing to receive foreign citizens evacuated from Cairo. 
Other countries in the Balkans have urged their citizens to avoid travel to Egypt, advising those already there to obey restrictions that have been imposed or leave.

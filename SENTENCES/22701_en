BELGRADE, Serbia -- Armed gendarmerie officers launched an operation on Monday (November 10th) at a plastics plant in the country's southeast, with the aim of locating fugitive war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic and his supporters, war crimes prosecution spokesperson Bruno Vekaric confirmed. 
The plant, located near the village of Valjevo, is owned by two brothers, Vidoje and Vladislav Vujic.
The officers, who arrived at the place in jeeps, did not allow journalists to enter the factory or take any photos. 
The house of the Vujic brothers, near the factory, has also been blocked. 
An unnamed interior ministry source, quoted by the AFP, said that the operation was designed to corroborate information suggesting Mladic may be hiding there.

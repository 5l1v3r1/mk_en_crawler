BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Appeals Court in Belgrade on Friday (July 30th) upheld the prison sentences of four Serb Muslim members of the Islamic Wahhabi movement.
The men were arrested by the Serbian police in the Sandzac region bordering Kosovo in 2007, when a secret weapons and munitions hideout was discovered.
A lower court convicted them of terrorism, illegal weapons possession and membership in foreign terror groups, handing down sentences ranging between four and eight years.

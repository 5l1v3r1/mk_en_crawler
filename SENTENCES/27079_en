ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic said on Sunday (August 2nd) he may ask the Constitutional Court to rule on a temporary new tax, covering those with monthly incomes above 400 euros, which is scheduled to remain in effect through next year.
There are two different rates:
revenues from wages, pensions, dividends and bonuses between 400 and 800 euros are taxed at 2%;
those who exceed that are taxed at 4%.
Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor says the new solidarity tax does not violate the constitution, but noted that Mesic has the right to question it.
Several other new taxes took effect over the weekend as part of the cabinet's measures to boost state revenue.
These include a higher VAT of 23% (an increase of 1%), a 6% tax on revenues from mobile phone services, as well as higher excise taxes on luxury cars and yachts.
The government has agreed with food retailers and representatives of state-controlled companies to keep prices unchanged.

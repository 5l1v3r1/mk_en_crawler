SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government endorsed on Thursday (10 March) the NATO Security Investment Programme, covering the modernisation of Bulgarian military airports ahead of the eventual deployment of US troops in Bulgaria. 
Under the project, NATO will invest 59m euros to adjust airport infrastructure, creating one multipurpose airfield for transport aircraft at the "Bezmer" airport, and one base for airborne interception tactical fighters at the "Graf Ignatievo" airport. 
Though Bulgaria will not participate in the funding of these projects, the cabinet asked the defence ministry to co-ordinate the activities of the state institutions involved.

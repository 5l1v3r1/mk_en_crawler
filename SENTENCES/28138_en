SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has sent a letter to the BiH tripartite presidency, urging authorities to resolve the issue of defence property allocation, local media reported on Monday (June 21st). 
There are 69 military facilities that must be allocated between Republika Srpska and the Federation of BiH. 
Clinton noted this is a key condition for implementing the Annual National Programme within NATO's Membership Action Plan. 
She expressed hope that property registration could be finalised by this autumn and suggested that after the October elections, BiH leaders waste no time in refocusing on constitutional reform.

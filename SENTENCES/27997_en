BUCHAREST, Romania -- Former Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu on Thursday (October 21st) criticised the publication of private telephone conversations between journalists and media tycoon Sorin Ovdiu Vantu, who was recently charged over suspected links to a person convicted of fraud.
The recorded transcripts were leaked and published in the local media earlier this week.
Prosecutors explained they were made to "illustrate the character" of Vantu.
Tariceanu, who served as prime minister from 2004 to 2008 and is currently in opposition, compared the Romanian justice system to "Big Brother".
Vantu, who owns the media group Realitatea-Catavencu, is suspected of transferring huge sums to the bank accounts of Nicolae Popa, a fugitive who fled the country in 2006 after being sentenced to 15 years in prison for organising a pyramid scheme.

ATHENS, Greece -- Public Order Minister George Voulgarakis announced on Wednesday (21 December) that new passports with higher security specifications would be issued in police departments across the country, starting in January. 
He said the new documents would be better protected against forgery and would be issued by police instead of the prefectures.

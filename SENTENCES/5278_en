Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi, a Mitrovica native, served as Kosovo's first prime minister in 2002.
A surgeon by profession, he served as a field doctor for the Kosovo Liberation Army during the war in 1999.
Rexhepi spoke to SETimes about the security situation in Kosovo's north and how it affects the country's overall security.
SETimes:
How much does the situation in northern Kosovo impact security in the rest of the country?
Rexhepi:
The situation in northern Kosovo remains tense but is under control.
It doesn't have a direct security impact on the rest of Kosovo.
However, it still is fragile.
SETimes:
Do Serb illegal structures and units of Serbia's interior ministry operate there?
Rexhepi:
The presence of illegal structures in the northern part of Kosovo is a fact.
According to our intelligence, a solid number of officers are operating there.
We are co-ordinating our efforts with EULEX and KFOR to minimise their role and then eradicate them completely.
SETimes:
What is your communication with the local population in the north like, and do they trust the Kosovo Police (KP)?
Rexhepi:
We do have communication with the local communities living in the north and they do trust the KP but are afraid of the MUP [Serbia's Ministry of Internal Affairs] and other illegal structures.
SETimes:
Are the Kosovo special police units in the north, and do they perform regular police work or special missions?
Rexhepi:
No, they are not permanently in the north.
It is not part of their concept of operations to be permanently in an area.
They do operations in specific cases as needed or as requested by EULEX, or as support to the KP investigative units.
SETimes:
An unknown group in the north issued a statement of independence.
How would you react if such statements are stated publicly?
Rexhepi:
If anyone intends to declare the independence of the north, we will consider it an illegal act.
We will act in accordance with the constitution to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Kosovo.
SETimes:
Are media reports of an order to attack Kosovo special police in the north true, and if so, how would you react?
Rexhepi:
This information was circulated in the media.
Hypothetically, we can say that it could happen.
However, the reaction from the legal security mechanisms of the Republic of Kosovo will be appropriate.
SETimes:
How is co-operation with KFOR and EULEX progressing?
Are you happy with the EULEX reaction in the north?
Rexhepi:
Co-operation with KFOR and EULEX is very good.
However, we feel that the time has come for EULEX to do more in the north, to support us in implementing the rule of law there.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) has welcomed the readiness of Republika Srpska (RS) to co-operate with the BiH State Court and the international community in combating organised crime in BiH.
In a statement issued Sunday (18 May), the OHR cited the work of the RS Interior Ministry and the constructive role it played in resolving a slavery case.
In that case, six East European women were released from a nightclub in Prijedor, while the club's owner was arrested and charged.
In other news, the international mediator for RS and the Federation of BiH, Christian Schwartz-Schilling, is calling for reforms and ethnic reconciliation.
At a news conference Saturday, Schwartz-Schilling reiterated that BiH authorities should assume responsibility for the establishment of a free-market economy, property laws implementation and other economic reforms needed to ensure the country's integration into the EU.

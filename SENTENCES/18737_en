ISTANBUL, Turkey -- The latest operations against members of the terrorist organisation Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in Europe are the result of co-operation between European and US security services, according to reports Thursday (February 8th) in the Turkish press. 
They cite a statement by US Ambassador to Turkey Ross Wilson, regarding a sweep against suspected PKK financiers in France. 
He suggested that the United States assisted with the operation and that Europe views the PKK as the second most dangerous terror organisation after al-Qaeda.
On Monday, police in Paris detained 13 Kurds suspected of laundering money for the PKK. 
Twelve of them are Turkish citizens and one has Australian citizenship. 
French authorities say the detentions were part of an operation that began last July, when two Kurds were apprehended after trying to convert 200,000 euros into US dollars.

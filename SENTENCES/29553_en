SOFIA, Bulgaria -- After a lengthy debate, an impeachment procedure against President Georgi Parvanov was shelved in parliament Wednesday (March 31st), when the required majority of two thirds -- or 160 votes -- could not be reached. 
The reason was tension between Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and Yane Yanev, leader of the Order, Law and Justice Party. 
Yanev withdrew the support of his party's eight lawmakers, who had initially supported the motion. 
Borisov's ruling European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) party initiated the impeachment procedure after Parvanov made public the contents of a closed-door meeting with Finance Minister Simeon Djankov.

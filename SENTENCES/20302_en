ATHENS, Greece -- Interior Minister Prokopis Pavlopoulos indicated on Monday (August 13th) that general elections would be held as expected next year, despite growing speculation about an early vote.
Asked about it during a press conference in Crete, where he attended a ceremony marking the 63rd anniversary of the destruction of Anogia village by German occupation troops, Pavlopoulos seemed to dismiss the possibility.
Nevertheless, reports persist that aides are urging Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis to call the elections as early as September 16th.

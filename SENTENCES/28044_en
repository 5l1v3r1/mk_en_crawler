TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister Ilir Meta reacted on Thursday (August 19th) to reports that a document has been circulated in northern Mitrovica calling for the independence of the Serb-dominated north from the rest of Kosovo. 
Sovereignty and territorial integrity is untouchable, Meta said. 
He also called for the isolation of all extremist elements that question borders in the Balkans. 
The recently surfaced "declaration of independence" for the "Association of Municipalities of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo" was not signed, nor its authors identified.

ANKARA, Turkey -- International co-operation in the fight against terrorism must continue and should be strengthened, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said Monday (24 November) upon his arrival in Turkey. 
Describing terrorist activity as the enemy of all democratic countries, he said Germany, Turkey and the EU have a common goal in fighting it. 
As for Turkey's EU accession process, Fischer said there had been shortcomings in implementation of EU-related reform legislation, but added that progress could be made in the coming year. 
In December 2004, Turkey hopes to get a date for starting accession negotiations.

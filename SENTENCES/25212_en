PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A delegation from the European Commission (EC) kicked off a three-day meeting with officials in Pristina Wednesday (January 27th) to discuss developments in legal matters, freedom of movement and security. 
Technical aspects of the EU visa liberalisation process will be a key topic, said the EC office in Pristina.

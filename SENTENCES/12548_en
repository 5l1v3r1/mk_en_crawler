ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic said Friday (7 January) that the government should quickly draft and pass a long-term strategy for economic development in order to advance EU accession prospects.
According to Mesic, the strategy should offer solutions to acute social and corporate sector problems.
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, meanwhile, criticised Mesic for making his comments ahead of next Sunday's presidential run-off against the candidate of the ruling HDZ party, Jadranka Kosor.
In other news, a landmine killed a man who was hunting Sunday near the town of Drnis in southern Croatia.
The Croatian Mine Centre estimates 700,000 landmines and pieces of unexploded ordnance from the 1991-1995 conflict remain uncleared.

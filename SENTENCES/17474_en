BELGRADE, Serbia -- UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari said on Sunday (February 25th) that he would finalise his proposal to resolve Kosovo's future status between March 2nd and 10th and submit it to the UN Security Council by the end of March.
In a joint statement for TV KohaVision and Serbia's B92, Ahtisaari specified that the plan would include "a certain word for status", adding that the Contact Group had made it clear that the will of the Kosovo majority must be taken into consideration.
UN-mediated negotiations between the Belgrade and the Pristina teams resumed Monday in Vienna, focusing on decentralisation-related issues.
Meetings last week made no real progress on any essential aspect of Ahtisaari's plan.

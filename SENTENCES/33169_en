SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The ruling Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM) and the main opposition party, VMRO-DPMNE, continued their disputes over several key laws related to implementation of the Ohrid peace accord.
In order to overcome disagreements, VMRO-DPMNE sent a letter to SDSM Friday (13 June) demanding that both parties form expert teams to negotiate on these issues.SDSM said it has not received such a letter, adding that there is no need to negotiate because the necessity of the legal changes is clearly defined in the Framework Agreement.
Meanwhile, most of the members of the small opposition party VMRO-True Macedonian Reform Option said Saturday they would rejoin VMRO-DPMNE.
Their decision came in response to the resignation of former VMRO-DPMNE Chairman Ljubco Georgievski.

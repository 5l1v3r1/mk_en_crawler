PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A traffic patrol was attacked by local Serbs on the Mitrovica-Zubin Potok Highway on Sunday (February 13th), their car reportedly pelted with rocks and other objects as they drove by. 
No injuries were reported and no suspects have been identified.
In other news Sunday, Kosovo Police Director Reshat Maliqi said he wants the police, EULEX and KFOR to create a joint plan for northern Kosovo in order to improve the security situation there. 
Mechanisms include increased police patrols, establishment of a multiethnic unit and engagement by special investigation units. 
He says he asked EULEX "to establish joined patrols with Albanian and Serbian policemen and thus build up a concept 'police in community' and increase the feeling of security among citizens", in areas of the north with a mixed population.

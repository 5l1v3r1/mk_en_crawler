SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Chairman of NATO's Military Committee, General Raymond Henault, said Bulgaria should balance the resources it spends on army modernisation with those spent on foreign missions. 
Speaking during a visit to Sofia, he noted that NATO's current task is developing expedition forces in response to the global terrorism threat. 
In this respect, he said, the Alliance expects Bulgaria to more actively participate in NATO foreign operations. 
While in the Bulgarian capital, he met with Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev, Defence Minister Veselin Bliznakov and chief of the Army's General Staff, General Nikola Kolev.

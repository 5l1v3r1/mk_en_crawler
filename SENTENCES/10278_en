BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic on Monday (25 October) accused former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and Serbian ex-security chiefs Radomir Markovic and Milan Radonjic of having organised the attempt on his life in Budva in 2000.
Draskovic testified as a witness in the trial for that attempt and for the assassination of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic the same year.
He described the attack on him as a result of a "state terrorism" policy pursued by Milosevic's regime.

TIRANA, Albania -- The Council of Europe's Venice Commission believes the controversial Lustration Law adopted by parliament last year violates the Albanian Constitution, media in Tirana reported on Thursday (October 15th).
The so-called "clean hands" law bans from government service anyone who worked for the communist-era secret police.
It was adopted amid fierce criticism from the opposition and international organisations in December 2008.
The Venice Commission is the Council of Europe's advisory panel on constitutional matters.

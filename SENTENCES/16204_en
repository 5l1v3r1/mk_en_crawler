SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Education sector trade unions plan to organise protests on 24 May because of delays in their salaries. 
Union official Dojcin Cvetanovski said on Tuesday (16 May) that workers have not yet received their April wages. 
He blames the ministry of education, which he says delayed implementation of the new collective labour contracts sealed between the government and the unions.

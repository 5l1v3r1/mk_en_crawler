BUCHAREST, Romania -- The country's Supreme Defence Council decided on Tuesday (March 25th) to raise the national terror alert to "moderate" from "cautious", as part of security arrangements ahead of the NATO summit in Bucharest, which begins on April 2nd.
Raising the alert activates a series of special collaborative measures among state institutions.
Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu noted the summit would serve as a major test of Romania's public order and security services.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Taped conversations involving Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, customs agency head Vanyo Tanov and his former deputy Antoniy Strandzhev leaked into local media on Friday (January 14th). 
The conversations, whose authenticity has not been confirmed, imply that the officials were involved in corrupt practices. 
This is the third time that tapes of alleged conversations among officials were leaked in the media, but it is the first one that directly incriminates the prime minister. 
The source of the leaked information is unknown. 
Some speculate the tapes originated from an investigation into Tanov early last year, which utilised special investigative means, including wiretapping. 
Borisov says the tapes were doctored and their authenticity will be determined.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Republika Srpska (RS) opposition, led by the Union of Independent Social Democrats, held a rally in Banja Luka Tuesday (23 March). 
About 10,000 people gathered to protest economic difficulties in the entity and demand the government's resignation. 
The demonstrators want early elections in October, coinciding with the local polls. 
RS President Dragan Cavic has rejected the idea.
In other news, the European Commission Delegation's chief in BiH, Michael Humphreys, met with BiH presidency Chairman Sulejman Tihic in Sarajevo on Tuesday.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government has struck a deal with Israeli company ImageSat over the price of a spy satellite, Borko Stefanovic, a member of Serbia's negotiating team, said on Wednesday (December 29th). 
Under the agreement, the government will pay the firm 27.8m euros instead of 40m euros. 
The settlement means Serbia won't have to cancel the order entirely. 
The initial deal was signed in 2005 by then Serbia and Montenegro Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic, who allegedly failed to consult the cabinet about it.

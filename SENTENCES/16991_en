BUCHAREST, Romania -- A new scandal has shaken the education sector, after a journalist managed to obtain the subjects of the language and literature school tests before they were administered Monday (3 July), according to local media reports. 
Journalist Melania Vergu of the Gandul daily "bought" the three versions of the test for around 1,000 euros on the "black market" late last week. 
She then informed the ministry of education, which immediately switched to other tests before they were administered to students.
In June, a journalist from the Adevarul newspaper managed to obtain copies of the national history test directly from the education ministry, after posing as an inspector from a regional directorate.

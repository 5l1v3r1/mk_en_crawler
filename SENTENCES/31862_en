SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Two laws, one on power decentralisation and the other on equal representation of all ethnic groups in state administration, will be parliament's main legislative priorities in 2003, according to Justice Minister Ismail Dardhishta.
He said Monday (30 December) that the two laws would underpin smooth implementation of the Ohrid peace accord.
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski insisted that the government is ready to implement Ohrid in full and without further debate.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Corruption exists in many forms and has spread through all Kosovo institutions, a study by the European Commission (EC) in Pristina concludes on Wednesday (December 9th), the International Day Against Corruption.
The report describes a general lack of willingness and political interest in fighting this phenomenon, which has affected public trust in the judiciary.
Kjartan Bjornsson, head of operations at the EC office, said on Tuesday that the study's conclusions should be used in a constructive and effective way to fight graft.
Anticorruption Agency Director Hasan Preteni said that the number of corruption cases is higher this year than last, and that of the more than 500 cases reported since February 2007, virtually none has been investigated completely.

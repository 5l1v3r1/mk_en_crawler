TIRANA, Albania -- The European Commission's (EC) progress report is objective and reflective of Tirana's progress towards EU integration, Integrations Minister Majlinda Bregu said on Wednesday (October 14th). 
She added that Albania is no longer considered a country that cannot organise democratic elections. 
Prime Minister Sali Berisha vowed that "objective criticism towards the government and other institutions will be seriously considered." The opposition Socialist Party (SP) says the report is positive for Albania but not for Albanian politics. 
SP official Ditmir Bushati said all sides should work in order to reach the required standards.

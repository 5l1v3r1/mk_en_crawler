PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Representatives to Kosovo from France, the US, the UK, Germany and Italy say they support EULEX's intention to sign a controversial protocol on police co-operation with Serbia. 
"Instruments for technical co-operation ... 
are in compliance with [EULEX's] mandate for strengthening border management and have no impact on Kosovo's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity issue," the representatives said in a joint statement Thursday (September 10th).
Meanwhile, Kosovo leaders reiterated opposition to the protocol, which is expected to be signed soon. 
"Kosovo is not part of this attempt for technical arrangement, but Kosovo ... 
will continue its serious co-operation in combating corruption and organised crime," Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said on Thursday. 
Local media, citing an unnamed European diplomat, have reported that Pristina will soon drop its objections to the agreement, clearing the way for the signing.

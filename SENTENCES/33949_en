ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Norwegian counterpart Kjell Magne Bondevik discussed bilateral co-operation in energy, the situations in Iraq and the Middle East, and Turkey's progress towards EU membership at their meeting Thursday (6 November).
They also reviewed NATO-EU relations, as both countries are members of NATO but not of the Union.
Also Thursday, the foreign ministry announced that US Secretary of State Colin Powell had sent a letter to Gul thanking Turkey for its contribution during last month's Madrid donors conference for Iraq.

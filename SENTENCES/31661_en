BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic on Saturday (12 April) rejected criticism from several quarters that the assassination of his predecessor, Zoran Djindjic, has been used as an excuse to curb human rights. 
Both the Council of Europe and Human Rights Watch criticised new legislation adopted on Friday. 
It would allow prison sentences beyond the current maximum of 40 years, if multiple crimes are involved. 
It allows police to detain suspects for up to 60 days without charges. 
Zivkovic said the measure was designed to keep underworld figures in jail while they were investigated. 
He dismissed allegations that the state of emergency is being used to persecute political opponents, saying "there is no danger that Serbia will become a police-run state." (AP, Tanjug - 12/04/03; Reuters - 11/04/03)

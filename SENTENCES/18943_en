THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The Appeals Chamber of the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague decided on Tuesday (April 3rd) to reduce the sentence of Bosnian Serb political leader Radislav Brdjanin by two years, to 30 years.
The chamber upheld most counts in the initial verdict, but reversed his convictions on charges of aiding and abetting torture and committing acts of destruction in the municipality of Bosanska Krupa.
Brdjanin, 59, was political leader of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb region of Krajina in the early part of the 1992-1995 conflict.
The accusations against him include the murder of more than 1,600 Muslims and Croats and the deportation of tens of thousands of civilians.
Brdjanin did not personally take part in the cleansing attempt, but supported the plan.
In custody since 1999, he is eligible for parole in 2020.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Albanian residents of Serb-dominated northern Mitrovica have been standing guard overnight since December 30th, media reported on Thursday (January 8th). 
The shifts run from 6pm to 6am. 
Some say they took the measure as a precaution, while others describe it as a peaceful response to scattered violence. 
"EULEX's work seems to be nothing. 
They were here for only one day, and KFOR comes only after troubles happen," neighbourhood resident Bujar Shala said.
Meanwhile, incidents in the area continue. 
Vandals damaged two vehicles, one belonging to an Albanian and the other to a Serb, on Tuesday evening in the village of Suhadoll, north of Mitrovica. 
Afterwards, about 50 Serb and Albanian residents of the village blocked the main road.
Former special EU envoy to Kosovo Wolfgang Petritsch said on Wednesday that tensions in Mitrovica will continue until the disputing sides resolve the Kosovo situation. 
He added that Mitrovica is a security issue requiring security measures on the part of the EU, supported by NATO.

Albania on Wednesday (8 March) confirmed its first case of the H5N1 avian flu virus.
According to the agriculture ministry, a chicken found in Cuke, southern Albania, was infected with the deadly virus.
Samples sent to the United Kingdom tested positive, Agriculture Minister Jemin Gjana told journalists.
"We got the results on Tuesday evening.
There is no need for panic.
We sent a task force to Saranda, including foreign experts, while the area has been put under a quarantine extending 3km," Gjana said.
"As of now we suspect that 60 chickens, found dead in the Cuke area of Saranda, near the Butrinti lagoon, could have had bird flu.
We are testing another thousand birds," he said.
According to the Veterinary Research Institute (IKV), Albania is surrounded by countries affected by bird flu and is on the path of migrating birds.
"The migratory birds could have brought the virus from Greece.
We don't think that the virus has been transmitted to humans," IKV head Dashamir Xhaxhiu said.
Albanian state structures have been placed on alert.
At a cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Sali Berisha sought to reassure the public."I want to make it clear:
there is no bird flu epidemic, but just a sporadic case, Berisha said.
"Its discovery in Albania was due to the professional work of our task force, and there is no need for panic," he added.
Berisha, a doctor, urged people to observe basic hygiene rules such as frequent washing of hands, and to make sure that chicken is cooked at a temperature of 70 degrees centigrade.
Earlier this year, Albania tightened preventive measures against bird flu.
Imports of chicken, livestock and dairy products from countries affected by the disease have been curtailed.
A task force has been established by the country's minister of health for handling any eventual bird flu cases and preparing a strategic programme in case of an outbreak.

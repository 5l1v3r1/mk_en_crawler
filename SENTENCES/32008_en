PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- A group of six US senators visited Kosovo on Saturday (23 November) to meet with NATO's top military commander in Europe, US Gen Joseph Ralston, and other officials.
The bipartisan delegation, led by Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, is studying ways to improve US participation in KFOR.
"This visit demonstrates the continued interest and commitment of the United States to fulfilling KFOR's mandate of creating a safe and secure environment in Kosovo," said Reno Harnish, the head of the US office in Kosovo.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Local media reported Wednesday (9 June) that Croatia expects to receive the go-ahead early next year for the start of accession talks with the EU.
The reports quoted a draft agenda for next week's EU summit suggesting that European leaders would agree to launch negotiations with Zagreb.
That could mean Croatia would join the Union in 2007, together with Bulgaria and Romania.
In other news, Croatian Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul criticised the UN war crimes tribunal for allowing Slobodan Milosevic to make public political statements ahead of the Serbian presidential election.
He said his country was looking with "a certain level of nervousness" at next week's vote in view of the fact "obvious war criminals" are participating.

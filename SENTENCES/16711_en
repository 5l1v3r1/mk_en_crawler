BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU security chief Javier Solana encouraged the Albanian government to continue with required reforms Thursday (6 April), especially those related to fighting corruption and organised crime.
Meeting with Albanian Foreign Minister Besnik Mustafaj in Brussels, Solana called for joint efforts by the political parties to fulfil Tirana's commitments related to the upcoming Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
Mustafaj met also the EU Commissioner for Enlargement Olli Rehn, who said Albania should ensure reforms are implemented "to convince the member countries of the seriousness and the political will of the government".
Talks between Tirana and the European Commission, launched in 2003, were concluded in February.

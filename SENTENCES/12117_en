TIRANA, Albania -- Members of parliament's security committee have agreed on draft constitutional changes related to the country's bid for NATO integration, says panel chairman Neritan Ceka.
On Friday (11 March), he noted that the defence ministry had suggested the amendments, which refer to the deployment of foreign military troops in Albania as well as Albanian troops in international military missions abroad.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The World Bank says future assistance to BiH, including a new $12m loan for an Urban Infrastructure and Service Delivery Project, would depend on the progress of reforming Mostar's status. 
The Bank on Wednesday (21 January) also cautioned that failure to unify the ethnically divided city would send a bad signal and jeopardise the international investment summit scheduled in Mostar next month.
In other news Wednesday, the head of the OSCE mission to BiH, Robert Beecroft, warned that unless the BiH Parliament adopts a key bill on higher education by the end of March, the country might lose World Bank credits worth $62m.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The UN confirmed on Tuesday (4 July) that the next, seventh round of Kosovo decentralisation talks, due to take place in Vienna on 11 July, will be postponed at Belgrade's request. 
No new date was announced for the round, expected to deal with protecting cultural and religious heritage.
In other news, local media are reporting Wednesday about an attack on a Serbian returnee house in the Kosovo village of Grabac last night. 
Gunmen reportedly opened fire and threw a grenade at the house, causing damage but no casualties.

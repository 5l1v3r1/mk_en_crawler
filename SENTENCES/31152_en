BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) said on Tuesday (January 4th) that Bucharest cannot exit the Verification and Co-operation Mechanism (CVM) of its own accord. 
This was after Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Baconschi warned on Monday that the country may leave the mechanism, aimed at helping deal with shortcomings in fighting corruption and in implementing judicial reform that Romania promised to address when it joined the EU in 2007. 
Baconschi's statement was spurred by France and Germany's proposal to delay Romania and Bulgaria's accession to the Schengen zone. 
"The phasing out of the CVM would be based on a decision of the Commission" after four benchmarks are met, EC spokesperson Mark Gray said on Tuesday. 
"This will be best achieved through continued political commitment to reform and close co-operation between the Romanian authorities and the Commission," he added.

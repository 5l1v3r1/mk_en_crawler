SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn urged Bosnian leaders on Monday (October 19th) to agree on key reforms needed to move the country towards EU and NATO accession. 
On the eve of a second round of talks involving senior EU and US officials with leaders of the main Bosnian, Serb and Croat parties, Rehn said BiH needs more structure to meet all criteria. 
Tuesday's talks at Camp Butmir near Sarajevo will focus on constitutional changes, as well as state and military property issues.
On Monday, High Representative Valentin Inzko welcomed the continuation of the Butmir dialogue, aimed at ending the longstanding political stalemate. 
"BiH leaders must realise the significance of this moment and do their best to succeed. 
They owe it to the citizens and this country," Inzko stressed.

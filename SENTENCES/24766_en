BERLIN, Germany -- The European Commission (EC) will recommend lifting visa requirements for compliant Western Balkan countries by mid-July, Swedish Migration Minister Tobias Billstrom predicted on Friday (July 3rd). 
The recommendation, in turn, should mean visa-free travel by the end of the year, Billstrom said in an interview with Germany's Deutsche Welle Radio. 
"I am, of course, referring to Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia", he added. 
Serbia, however, still needs to solve some issues related to border control with Kosovo and its process of issuing passports to Kosovo citizens, Billstrom said.

NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council called on Pristina and Belgrade on Tuesday (August 3rd) to use the momentum gained from the International Court of Justice (ICJ)'s advisory opinion on Kosovo to discuss important issues.
During the council's meeting on Kosovo, members expressed continued support for UNMIK, as well as the need to reduce intercommunity tension.
"The UN preliminary legal assessment is that the opinion does not affect the status of UNMIK, or our status-neutral policy," Zannier said after presenting the second quarterly report for this year on Kosovo.
He added that Kosovo has been relatively stable, although the potential for instability remains, as seen by some incidents in the north.
Kosovo Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni and his Serbian counterpart Vuk Jeremic both said that they are willing to resolve disagreements.
Jeremic said the ICJ had narrowly examined the language of the unilateral declaration and had left room for a "dangerous misinterpretation" of the court's view.
Hyseni, however, said the court's advisory opinion was explicit and left no room for doubt that it was in favour of Kosovo.
He again called on the Security Council to replace Resolution 1244 with one that reflects the reality of an independent Kosovo.

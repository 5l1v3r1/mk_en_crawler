TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha on Saturday (January 19th) denied that Albania has any desire to unite with or annex Kosovo, in an interview with Austria's APA agency. 
Berisha insisted that even if Kosovo declares independence, Albania would not seek to make it part of its territory. 
He noted that "the division from one century ago created two very different Albanian realities -- one in Tirana, another in Pristina", and stressed that Albania's focus is EU and NATO integration.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The coalitions led by the pro-EU Democratic Party (DS) and the Serbian Socialist Party (SPS) have agreed to form a government, B92 reported Thursday (June 19th). 
Although SPS officials claim that they have not held talks with the DS and the DS says there is no agreement yet, local media report that an announcement on the new government is expected early next week.
In an interview with Vecernje Novosti, Serbian Radical Party (SRS) leader Tomislav Nikolic said that he believes that SPS leader Ivica Dacic decided to side with the DS. 
The SPS has held official talks only with the SRS and the Serbian Democratic Party-New Serbia coalition.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Appeals judges ruled Monday (1 November) that former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic should be able to lead his own defence, provided he stays healthy. 
Under the ruling, two court-appointed lawyers will remain involved in the case, but Milosevic will be given the right to choose witnesses and question them before the court. 
"When he is physically capable of doing so, Milosevic will take the lead in presenting his case," the judges said.

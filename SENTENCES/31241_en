ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia abolished visas Saturday (January 1st) for Albanian citizens travelling to its territory. 
Previously, only summer travel was visa-free. 
Under the new rules, Albanians will be able to spend up to 90 days in Croatia without a visa. 
The foreign ministry in Tirana welcomed the move, saying it would boost cultural and economic ties.

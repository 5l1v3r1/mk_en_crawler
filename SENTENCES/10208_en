NEW YORK, United States -- The government of Kosovo must provide security to the Serb community, UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen said in a report to the UN Security Council released Monday (29 November). 
"The authorities must ensure that all communities feel safe and secure and are able to live normal lives, free of fear and intimidation," he wrote. 
Jessen-Petersen also highlighted the need for a continued international military presence in the province. 
He noted that security in Kosovo has "improved significantly" but warned that the situation in the entire region would not stabilise unless the issue of the province's final status is addressed.
Also Monday, EU security chief Javier Solana repeated concerns about former guerrilla commander Ramush Haradinaj becoming the next prime minister of Kosovo. 
Speaking to reporters in Brussels, Solana said the EU questions whether a person interviewed by The Hague tribunal because of possible involvement in war crimes is a suitable candidate for the post.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Swedish Ambassador to Belgrade Krister Bringeus expects the process of ratifying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between Serbia and the EU to get under way in June.
In an interview with Tanjug news agency on Saturday (May 8th), Bringeus said that a positive signal in that direction is expected by the middle of this year.
Sweden supports the ratification, Bringeus said, adding that Serbia is co-operating fully with The Hague war crimes tribunal (ICTY) and is doing its best to arrest the remaining war crimes fugitives.

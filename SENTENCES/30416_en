BELGRADE, Serbia -- War crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic said on Thursday (December 16th) that an investigation he led has revealed at least 500 victims of alleged organ trafficking by ethnic Albanian guerrillas in 1999. 
Vukcevic told reporters there is evidence of organ removal among about 400 Serbs and 100 "non-Albanians". 
Referring to a Council of Europe report written by Dick Marty that accuses Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci of heading a group that dealt with many illegal activities, including organ trafficking, Vukcevic said that his office's investigation is "way ahead" of Marty's. 
Vukcevic offered materials related to it to his colleagues in Kosovo and Albania. 
"Without co-operation between prosecutors in Kosovo, Albania and Serbia, there will be no progress in this investigation," he said. 
Thaci says Marty's report is "scandalous" and "full of slanders and lies".

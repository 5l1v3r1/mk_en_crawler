ANKARA, Turkey -- General Staff chief Ilker Basbug on Sunday (March 14th) denied media speculation that army commanders have threatened to quit in large numbers. 
The reports appeared after dozens of officers were arrested in late February, suspected of plotting a 2003 government coup in 2003 known as "Sledgehammer".

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government has turned down a request by Russian natural gas supplier Gazprom for a revision to the contract that runs out in 2010. 
The Russian company wanted to amend provisions that set the price at which gas is transited via Bulgaria to Greece, Turkey and Macedonia. 
Bulgaria paid higher prices than most other European countries for natural gas when the contract was signed in 1998, but it is now benefiting from a weaker dollar coupled with skyrocketing fuel prices.
In other news, the interior ministry announced on Monday (16 January) that the Bulgarian National Service for the Fight Against Organised Crime seized 40kg of heroin in Sofia in an operation conducted with the US Drug Enforcement Agency. 
The heroin has an estimated street value of 1.2m euros.

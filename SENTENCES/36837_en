ATHENS, Greece -- A prosecutor ordered an emergency investigation Tuesday (13 July) into the source of a massive power outage that affected more than half of Greece on Monday. 
Investigators are to determine whether a similar outage could strike during the Olympics, now only a month away. 
Findings will be released in eight days, said government spokesman Panos Livaditis. 
"We will determine the causes and make immediate corrections," he said.
In other news Tuesday, Olympic organisers called on Greeks to snap up unsold tickets to avoid empty stadiums during the Games. 
Athens 2004 chief organiser Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki went on local radio and urged Greeks to pick up the slack and put on a good show in front of the world's cameras.
Meanwhile, the journalists' union in Greece is threatening to stage a 48-hour strike beginning Wednesday. 
The journalists are demanding a 15 per cent salary increase.

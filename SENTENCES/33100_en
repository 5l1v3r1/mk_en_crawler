BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Defence ministers of the EU countries announced on Monday (19 May) that the new 60,000-strong European Rapid Reaction Force is now ready to take part in peacekeeping missions. 
The new force already has a small number of troops in Macedonia, and EU leaders want it to take over NATO's peacekeeping operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the start of 2004. 
Officials are also contemplating sending troops on a UN-led peacekeeping mission in Congo. 
EU security chief Javier Solana warned, however, that much remains to be done. 
The ministers agreed that the force is still months away from being ready to deploy in full strength within 60 days.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Federation of BiH (FBiH) Prime Minister Nedzad Brankovic said Tuesday (May 26th) that he intends to resign Wednesday.
He announced his decision after Sulejman Tihic was re-elected leader of the Party of Democratic Action (SDA), Brankovic's party.
Tihic will serve for four more years.
This is his third term as head of the main Bosniak party, beating out Bakir Izetbegovic and Adnan Terzic, former allies who have openly criticised his work.
Both announced plans to leave their posts as party officials.
Brankovic did not comment on the reasons for his move but in late March, prosecutors launched an investigation against him over alleged abuse of power and misappropriation, in acquiring a luxury apartment in Sarajevo.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia can complete its EU accession talks by June, the head of the EU Delegation to Croatia Paul Vandoren and Hungarian Ambassador to Zagreb Gabor Ivan said on Wednesday (January 19th). 
They agreed that the two most demanding negotiation chapters remain, judiciary and competition. 
Ivan reaffirmed that the enlargement process is among Hungary's priorities as EU presidency holder and said his country is committed to the goal of completing Croatia's negotiations by mid-year. 
Vandoren said that Croatia is on track to wrap up the talks though still must tackle judicial reform, corruption and organised crime and must restructure the shipbuilding sector.

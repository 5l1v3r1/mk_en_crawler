BELGRADE, Serbia -- The two main parties in Serbia's ruling coalition, the Serbian Socialist Party and the Democratic Party of President Boris Tadic, will sign a political reconciliation agreement by the end of this month, the Blic newspaper reported on Monday (August 11th), citing party sources.
The idea for an accord came from Tadic, who hopes all other government parties, as well as some parties from the opposition, will endorse it.
The document will stipulate a common political resolve for the protection of Serbia's integrity and the development of a democratic, economically stable and socially responsible country.

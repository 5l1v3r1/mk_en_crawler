ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament began discussing the government's report on the armed forces and the pace of defence reforms Wednesday (1 February).
Presenting the document, Defence Minister Berislav Roncevic said that modernising the army is the top priority, not only with regards to Croatia's NATO membership bid but also its ability to deal with terror threats.
In other news, national TV announced on Wednesday that an international police operation smashed a major drug trafficking attempt involving Croatian citizens.
The operation -- reportedly conducted by Interpol, Austria, Croatia, Germany and Britain -- resulted in the seizure of two tonnes of drugs at the British port of Dover.
Six people were detained in Croatia earlier this week as a result.
Also Wednesday, Croatian prosecutors confirmed that they would not indict Macedonian Chief of General Staff Miroslav Stojanovski on war crimes charges.
Veterans had accused him of allowing soldiers under his command to commit atrocities during the Yugoslav Army's advance into Vukovar in 1991.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Macedonian government has decided to raise its office in Pristina to the level of embassy and named the current chief of the Liaison Office, Stojan Karajanov, as ambassador.
"I think it is a positive step after the recognition of Kosovo's independence and establishing diplomatic relations ...
and I hope Kosovo will nominate its own ambassador soon," Deputy Prime Minister Abdilaqim Ademi said on Wednesday (November 11th).
The decision comes two weeks after Kosovo and Macedonia established diplomatic ties.
Pristina and Skopje are expected to boost relations by signing a series of agreements involving energy, police, the economy, infrastructure and social policy.

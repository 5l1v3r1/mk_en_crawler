PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Irregularities during the December snap elections in Kosovo can also affect the country's EU visa liberalisation process, European Parliament Rapporteur for Kosovo, Ulrike Lunacek, warned on Thursday (January 13th) in Brussels.
However, she urged European officials not to punish the public.
Brussels, she added, has not kept its promises regarding Kosovo's visa liberalisation process.
She blamed the interior ministers of EU member states who deal with the issue directly.
The government expected to receive the questionnaire in September.
Kosovo's outgoing European Integration Minister Besim Beqaj insists that his country has met all EU requirements for visa liberalisation.

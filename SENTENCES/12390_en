ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis told Romanian counterpart Calin Popescu Tariceanu on Wednesday (6 July) that Greece would soon ratify the EU Accession Treaties of Romania and Bulgaria. 
During their meeting in Athens, Karamanlis stressed that Greece wants to be one of the first EU states to complete parliamentary ratification of the accession documents. 
He and Tariceanu also discussed ways to boost bilateral ties, particularly economic co-operation.
On Friday meanwhile, Greece plans to hold an international tender to lease three vacant sites from the 2004 Olympics: a badminton arena, the international broadcasting centre, and a canoe-and-kayak facility. 
This will be the first in a series of such tenders, designed to offset some of the cost of staging the Games.

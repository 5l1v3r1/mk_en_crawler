PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Serbia is asking Montenegro to refrain from establishing diplomatic relations with Pristina until The Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ) decides on Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence, local media reported on Sunday (December 6th). 
Serbian Ambassador to Podgorica Zoran Lutovac is said to have made the request during a meeting with local officials at the Montenegrin Foreign Ministry headquarters. 
Podgorica says the establishment of foreign relations has not happened so far due to technical reasons. 
Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic has said his country would re-evaluate its decision to recognise Kosovo if the ICJ rules that the unilateral independence declaration was illegal, adding however, he doubts this will happen.

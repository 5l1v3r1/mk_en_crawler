BUCHAREST, Romania -- Foreign Minister Mihai Razvan Ungureanu met with his Hungarian and Serbia-Montenegro counterparts, Ferenc Somogyi and Vuk Draskovic, on Saturday (28 May).
He said they had agreed to step up co-operation in preventing natural and ecological disasters.
The purpose of the meeting, in the Hungarian border town of Szeged, was to review a regional development project.
At Romania's initiative, however, they also discussed joint measures that could be undertaken for tackling disasters.
The ministers will now suggest that their governments open early warning centres in Szeged, in Arad, Romania, and in Novi Sad, Serbia-Montenegro.

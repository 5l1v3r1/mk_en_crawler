ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis on Monday (November 10th) expelled parliament member and former Deputy Culture Minister Petros Tatoulis from the ruling New Democracy's (ND) parliamentary caucus.
In a letter to Parliament Speaker Dimitris Sioufas, Karamanlis cited an interview with Tatoulis that appeared in Monday's edition of the daily Ethnos, in which he attacked the government's unpopular economic measures and the wave of corruption scandals involving senior government officials.
His comments are unacceptable at a critical time, Karamanlis contended in the letter.
The decision to expel him reduced the ND's fragile majority in parliament to only 151 of 300 seats, as the government tries to secure approval of a 28 billion euro plan to shore up the banking sector.

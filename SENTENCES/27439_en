PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The NATO Military Committee is praising the Kosovo Security Force (KSF) but notes that it is still early for local forces to take over the protection of Kosovo's borders. 
Military Committee Chairman Admiral Giampaolo Di Paola said that the KSF is "doing an excellent job and we are satisfied with the progress we have seen so far", during a visit to Kosovo on Tuesday (September 28th). 
However, he did not comment on the future of the KSF. 
Security Force Minister Fehmi Mujota said it aims to reach its full operating capacities by 2012.

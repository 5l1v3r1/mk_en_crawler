BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU should not intervene in bilateral disputes in the Balkans, Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Sunday (November 23rd) in an interview with the EurActiv online bulletin. 
He added that unresolved bilateral issues should not hamper countries' EU accession processes and called for their resolution through negotiations rather than through lawsuits filed at the International Court of Justice (ICJ). 
"Countries are entitled to address the International Court of Justice, as in the previous case of Bosnia's suit against Serbia ... 
However, a process of reconciliation is necessary in those societies and between the regional societies, which demands much more thorough consideration and a leaving of the past behind," Rehn said. 
Last week, the ICJ agreed to hear a case Croatia has filed against Serbia, sparking promises of a countersuit by Serbia.

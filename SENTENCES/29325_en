STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- The country's Migration Board decided on Wednesday (November 3rd) to suspend the deportation of a group of asylum seekers to Greece amid Athens' efforts to deal with the growing influx of illegal migrants entering its territory via Turkey. 
Under EU laws, asylum seekers must be sent to the first EU country they entered, which in many cases is Greece. 
Therefore, Greece has been scrambling to process all requests and has been criticised for its treatment of illegal immigrants. 
After Greece requested help from the EU, a team of 175 Frontex experts was deployed recently to bolster local forces at the border. 
Sweden's decision affects about 100 people. 
Austria, Norway and Finland have also stopped returning asylum seekers to Greece.

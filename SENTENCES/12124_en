BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's government will launch a special commission to combat organised crime, according to a government decree promulgated in the State Gazette on Tuesday (14 December). 
The panel would be tasked with implementing all activities outlined in a regional action plan adopted in Brussels late last month.
In other news, the OSCE Mission to Serbia-Montenegro warned on Tuesday that following the 19 September local elections, some municipal and city assemblies in Serbia had not yet begun work. 
The deadline spelled out in the law on local self-government has nearly expired.
In other news, a commission investigating the death of two soldiers at a secret compound of the Serbia-Montenegro Army said Tuesday its findings differed significantly from those of an earlier military inquiry. 
There has been speculation in Belgrade that the soldiers were killed because they learned accidentally about the presence of war crimes fugitives in the facility. 
The army insisted that the two men had shot each other while on guard duty. 
But the commission found that a third party was involved.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Council of Europe Secretary General Walter Schwimmer welcomed on Thursday (15 July) the decision to retry four former Kurdish parliamentary deputies. 
Earlier this week, the Turkish Court of Cassation revoked an Ankara State Security Court verdict and called for a retrial in a civilian court. 
The security court had confirmed the 1994 verdict, which stipulated a 15-year prison sentence. 
The politicians had already spent 10 years behind bars before their release last month. 
"This decision is a clear example of the positive impact of recent constitutional amendments, which are aimed at ensuring the direct application of the European Convention of Human Rights in the Turkish legal system," said Schwimmer.

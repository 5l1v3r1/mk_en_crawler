PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The mayor of the Suhareka/Suvareka municipality, Blerim Kuci, was ordered to be detained for one month Tuesday (April 5th) for ignoring EULEX calls to testify in a war crimes case. 
Kuci was summoned as a witness in the Klecka case, in which 11 former Kosovo Liberation Army members are accused of war crimes committed in a prison camp in 1999. 
"If he is ready to give his testimony earlier, he may be released earlier," EULEX spokesperson Kristina Herodes said. 
Kuci cannot be questioned further under the terms of Kosovo's Penal Procedure, and his detention ends all obligations to co-operate with prosecutors. 
The Association of Kosovo Municipalities expressed deep concern over his arrest.

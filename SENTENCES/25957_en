ANKARA, Turkey -- The government will redouble its efforts to implement reforms aimed at expanding the rights of the Kurdish minority, despite recent tensions and violence, Interior Minister Besir Atalay said on Thursday (December 17th).
"We will continue our initiative decisively," Atalay told a press conference.
"Measures are mostly related to setting up an independent commission to prevent discrimination acts and violence on the part of security forces," he explained.
Last week, the Constitutional Court decided to ban the only pro-Kurdish party in parliament, the Democratic Society Party, for its links to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
The decision sparked a series of sometimes violent protests in the Kurdish-dominated southeast and in Istanbul.

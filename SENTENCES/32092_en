BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO should extend its presence in Macedonia until the EU is ready to take over, but not beyond 15 June 2003, the International Crisis Group (ICG) suggested in a report issued Friday (15 November). 
The ICG said that despite the successful stabilisation and political transition in Macedonia, an international security presence remains indispensable. 
Although the EU hoped to assume responsibility for security after the mandate of NATO's Amber Fox mission expires on 15 December, the ICG urged NATO to remain in the country until the EU is ready.
On Sunday, the International Census Monitoring Mission praised the way Macedonia's census was conducted earlier this month. 
According to media sources, the mission reported no major incidents during the first phase of the headcount, from 1 November to 15 November.

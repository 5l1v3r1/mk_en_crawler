TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Democratic Party (DP) and the opposition Socialist Party (SP) exchanged their nominations to fill the vacant seat in the Central Election Commission (CEC), DP headquarters said on Tuesday (20 June). 
Each party presented four names -- two of which are to be endorsed by the opposite faction and then submitted to the High Council of Justice (HJC).
CEC acting head Klement Zguri warned the parties that the continued delay to complete the CEC composition would negatively affect the preparations for the next municipal elections, due to take place this winter.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Sofia city court on Monday (April 13th) once again denied the registration of the Union of Democratic Forces' (UDF) new leadership, arguing that the new method of election was not democratic.
In particular, the court referred to the anonymous voting process, which included all members of the party, rather than the previous procedure, in which delegates -- elected by local chapters -- selected party leaders.
The new leaders hope to appeal the ruling, but that would further delay the formal registration of the coalition between the UDF and the Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria (DSB), the two largest right-wing parties, ahead of parliamentary elections in July.
Separately Monday, parliament decided to increase the electoral threshold for coalitions to 8% from the current 4% for all parties.
Supporting the controversial doubling were the two ruling coalition parties -- the Bulgarian Socialist Party and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms -- and two opposition parties -- the Order, Law and Justice (OLJ) Party and the ultra-nationalist group Attack.
The OLJ Party proposed the amendment, arguing it would prevent coalitions consisting of small, obscure parties from entering parliament.
But the right-wing opposition says it is an attempt by the ruling parties to block the new coalition between the UDF and the DSB.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Police reported on Sunday (February 4th) the arrests of eight people suspected of circulating propaganda for an Islamist terrorist group.
The suspects were picked up in the southern province of Adana for spreading Hizbullah propaganda at meetings of the Mustazaflar Association, a legal Islamic organisation.
Hizbullah, which is not linked to the Lebanon-based Hezbollah, killed several Kurdish activists in Turkey in the late 1990s.
It wants to topple Turkey's secular order and found a state based on Islamic Sharia law.

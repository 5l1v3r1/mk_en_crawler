SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH government plans to send a multiethnic platoon to help destroy thousands of tonnes of explosives in Iraq, the country's defence minister said Friday (15 April).
According to Nikola Radovanovic, 50 soldiers representing all major ethnic groups have nearly completed their training under US instructors.
BiH hopes this deployment will boost its bid to join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.
In other news, the UNHCR announced on Friday that the number of displaced persons in BiH has fallen sharply in recent months.
The UN body had more than 300,000 refugees on its lists at the end of 2004.
But earlier this year, only 180,000 people still considered themselves displaced.
Also Friday, EU Police Mission (EUPM) Chief Kevin Carty met with representatives of police trade unions from the two BiH entities -- Federation of BiH and Republika Srpska (RS) -- as well as the Brcko District.
They discussed the unions' stance and role in crucial police reforms, part of EUPM's initiative for broadening dialogue on the issue.

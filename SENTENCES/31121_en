SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Police have seized large amount of weapons near the town of Tetovo, the interior ministry announced on Friday (March 4th).
Nine people between the ages of 19 and 47 were detained for suspected membership in an international weapons smuggling ring.
The investigation started late last year.
Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska says the suspects were modifying signal pistols bought from Turkey into firearms at an improvised workshop in the village of Dzepciste.
The guns were allegedly resold for 100-150 euros each in Macedonia and beyond.
The price in Western Europe was purportedly 300-350 euros per weapon.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The EU foreign ministers will likely discuss the next steps in BiH's EU integration process in late February or March, Maja Kocijancic, spokesperson for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, told Srna news agency on Saturday (January 22nd).
The ministers were to debate BiH this month but decided to postpone it until the new entity and state-level governments are installed.
Elections were held in early October.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH expert commission on security reforms completed its work on a draft law to set up a common intelligence structure for the country's entities. 
The office of High Representative Paddy Ashdown reported Saturday (2 August) that it received the document by Friday's deadline. 
Ashdown will review the draft and send it on to international specialists. 
A discussion of possible amendments is expected in September. 
The draft law sets up a centralised intelligence agency incorporating existing line structures at the republican levels. 
The bill applies European standards to support the fight against terrorism, organised crime, and other threats to the state and the region.

ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who also serves as president of the ruling party, PASOK, announced Wednesday (2 July) that all members of PASOK's executive bureau who also hold a post in the cabinet must choose between those duties. 
Six ministers, including Foreign Minister George Papandreou, hold senior party posts. 
A reshuffle had been expected, given PASOK's drop in popularity: latest polls indicate the party is headed for its worst election defeat in 25 years.
In other news Wednesday, the government unveiled plans for incentives aimed at attracting both foreign and domestic investment. 
Greece is considered the least attractive country for investors in the euro zone.

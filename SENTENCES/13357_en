MAMAIA, Romania -- A new initiative for a Black Sea Euro-region -- seeking to promote co-operation and democratisation of the area -- was presented on Thursday (30 March) during a conference gathering representatives of the ten Black Sea rim countries in the Romanian resort of Mamaia.
Council of Europe (CoE) Secretary General Terry Davis and CoE Congress of Local and Regional Authorities President Giovanni Di Stasi expressed support for the initiative, noting that such Euro-regions would contribute to the dismantling of the existing dividing lines in Europe. 
Russia, however, has voiced reservations, saying the initiative overlaps goals pursued by already existing bodies for co-operation in the Black Sea region. 
Russian representatives did not sign the political declaration presented at the end of the conference Thursday.

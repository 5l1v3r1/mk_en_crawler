STRASBOURG, France -- The far-right faction in the European Parliament (EP) collapsed on Wednesday (November 14th) after its Romanian members left over recent immigration tensions with Italy. 
EP Vice-President Edward McMillan-Scott said the Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty (ITS) group was dissolved because it no longer had the minimum 20 members required by EP regulations. 
The ITS faction was formed in January when Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU. 
It included five Romanians and one Bulgarian member. 
Most other MEPs applauded news of the collapse.

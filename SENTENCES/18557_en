BELGRADE, Serbia -- In a retrial of the case, prosecutors demanded the maximum 40-year sentence Monday (February 12th) for the suspects in the 1999 murders of four Serbian Renewal Movement officials and the attempted murder of party president Vuk Draskovic.
In 2003, the notorious criminal Milorad "Legija" Ulemek, former State Security chief Rade Markovic and ten other former police members were sentenced to up to 15 years in the case, but the verdict was overturned last year due to irregularities.

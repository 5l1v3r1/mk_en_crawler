SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Interior Minister Rumen Petkov announced on Sunday (19 March) that a large-scale inspection of fuel producers and distributors is under way across the whole country.
He noted that the action, conducted jointly by police and tax authorities, stems from a case being processed by the Supreme Cassation Prosecution.
He did not elaborate, saying only that the state loses over 150m euros annually due to shadowy deals in the fuel sector.

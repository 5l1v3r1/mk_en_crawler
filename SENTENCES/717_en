The Albanian government said it will seek talks with Turkey's Calik Enerji concerning a renegotiated agreement on the privatisation of 76% of Albtelecom. 
Prime Minister Sali Berisha and his cabinet had earlier wanted to annul the 120m-euro contract with the Turkish company, which won an international tender sealed by Albania's previous Socialist government. 
However, the Berisha administration now appears ready to renegotiate some terms of the agreement, rather than initiate a brand-new tender. 
Local media reports suggested the change in position followed Berisha's recent visit to Turkey, where he met with Calik Enerji's president, Ahmet Calik.

Serbia signed a debt-for-investment agreement with Germany, one of the Paris Club creditors. 
Under the agreement, 25m euros of Serbian debt to Germany will be written off, in exchange for a 5.5m-euro investment by the Serbian government in a project revitalising remote heating systems. 
Serbia will be relieved immediately from paying interest on the debt, while the principal will disappear from the books once the project is completed. 
After the accord was signed, Serbian Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic said his country would explore other such arrangements.

VATICAN CITY -- Church sources said Tuesday (9 September) that the Vatican considered breaking with centuries of tradition and canonising Mother Teresa of Calcutta directly, without the intermediate process of beatification. 
Vatican officials gave what one source called "serious consideration" to the idea. 
Mother Teresa died in 1997.

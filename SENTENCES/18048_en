SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The opposition ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) again left parliament on Monday (July 16th), with their colleagues from the Party of Democratic Prosperity voicing strong dissatisfaction with the ruling VMRO-DPMNE's proposal for new parliamentary regulations.
DUI's Xhevat Ademi said the bill on use of languages was not among a list of 46 bills due to be passed under the so-called Badinter Principle, which envisions approval by a majority of minority party deputies.
Ademi says inclusion of the bill was part of the deal recently struck with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski that ended DUIâs lengthy boycott of parliament.

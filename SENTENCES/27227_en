BRUSSELS, Belgium -- As expected, the European Parliament approved on Wednesday (February 3rd) the nomination of Bulgaria's Kristalina Georgieva as commissioner-designate for international co-operation, humanitarian aid and crisis response.
She became the nominee after Rumyana Zheleva faltered during confirmation hearings.
Georgieva received full support from both the European and Bulgarian parliaments.
The final vote by the European Commission will be held next week.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament unanimously passed a resolution Friday (14 October) on the country's strategic guidelines in accession negotiations with the EU. 
The resolution reads that everything should be done to ensure that Croatia enters the EU before 2009, and that Croatian negotiators must seek the best possible terms in adjusting national legislation to EU laws.
At the weekend meanwhile, the interior ministry announced that some 58,000 cases of illegal migration were prevented during the past five years. 
Ministry spokesman Josip Paradzik said most cases involved Albanians and Kosovo Albanians.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey wants to sign a new stand-by agreement with the IMF once the current arrangement expires in 2005, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday (6 August). 
Under the original agreement, signed in February 2002, Turkey received $16 billion in loans and imposed a strict programme of fiscal discipline and reforms.
Meanwhile, the IMF announced Friday that it has approved a new $141m stand-by arrangement with Croatia, aimed at helping the government rein in its growing debt. 
The Fund warned that the $25.45 billion debt, amounting to 80 per cent of GDP, was much higher than the average figure for Central and Eastern Europe. 
The IMF urged tax changes to curb the budget deficit from its current level of 5.9 per cent to 3 per cent or less. 
All candidates for EU membership, as well as those already in the eurozone, are required to maintain budget deficits of no more than 3 per cent.
Also on Friday, the IMF Executive Board endorsed a 25-month, $146m precautionary stand-by arrangement for Bulgaria. 
The agreement is intended to support the Bulgarian government's reform programme until 2006. 
IMF Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chairman Takatoshi Kato said the Fund had appraised Bulgaria's performance as "broadly satisfactory, with robust economic growth, favourable debt dynamics, and strong financial market confidence".

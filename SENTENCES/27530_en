SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska has warned that free movement within the EU does not mean the possibility of asylum seeking. 
At a meeting with residents of Skopje on Saturday (November 27th), she said that Macedonia is a stable and safe country, respecting freedoms and rights and as such, any request for asylum would be turned down. 
The authorities launched an information campaign on the visa liberalisation regime after abuses were reported. 
Earlier this year, visa-free travel unleashed a wave of asylum seekers who claimed economic hardships but were later sent home.

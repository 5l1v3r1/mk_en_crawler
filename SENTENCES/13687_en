WASHINGTON, United States -- As expected, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has appointed career diplomat Frank G. Wisner as the US special envoy for Kosovo status talks.
A press release issued Monday (19 December) said the talks are crucial to stability in Southeast Europe.
In other news, the commander of NATO's south wing, US Admiral Harry Ulrich, re-affirmed the Pact's determination to ensure security for all citizens of Kosovo, during talks with Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic in Belgrade Monday.
Ulrich added that the March 2004 ethnic riots and violence in the province must not be repeated.
Also Monday, Belgrade and Kosovo Serb representatives criticised the expected launch of two new ministries -- interior and justice -- in Kosovo, saying they would pre-determine independence for the province.
UNMIK says an announcement about the new ministries is expected this week.

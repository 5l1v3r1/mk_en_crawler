NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon received the final Kosovo status settlement proposal prepared by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari on Thursday (March 15th).
Ahtisaari's deputy, Albert Rohan, delivered it.
The plan would give Kosovo the right to conclude international agreements, seek membership in international organisations and take more responsibility for governing itself, thus gaining a form of supervised independence.
Serbia rejects the plan, while Kosovo Albanian leaders support it, in anticipation of full independence.
The UN Security Council is expected to begin discussing the proposal on March 26th.

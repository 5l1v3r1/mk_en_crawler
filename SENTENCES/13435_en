VIENNA, Austria -- Deputy UN envoy for the Kosovo status talks Albert Rohan is urging Belgrade and Pristina to demonstrate more realism in the negotiations.
In a speech to an EU-Southeast European interparliamentary conference in Vienna Tuesday (28 March), he stressed that the negotiations do not mean automatic independence.
He also noted that creating a multiethnic Kosovo is a strongly desired goal but hardly achievable within a short time.
Rohan added that all sides must focus their efforts on ensuring the peaceful co-existence of ethnic groups in the province.
The next round of status talks is scheduled for 3 April.

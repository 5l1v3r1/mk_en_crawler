BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government approved on Wednesday (August 20th) a proposal by Economy Minister Mladjan Dinkic to amend the anti-corruption agency law and oblige all state officials to declare their personal assets, as well as everything they have received for use from the state. 
Dinkic also insists on publicising these asset statements. 
His ministry drafted the proposal after media reports revealed some former ministers continue to use state apartments and other property. 
Under current law, officials must provide information about property to the Committee for the Prevention of Conflicts of Interest, but they do not have to make this information public. 
The obligation does not include property received from the state for use at the beginning of their term. 
Dinkic hopes the move will help limit corruption and misappropriation in the state administration.

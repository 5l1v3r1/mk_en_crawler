ATHENS, Greece -- Representatives of Bulgaria, Russia and Greece ratified the trilateral agreement on establishing an international company that will build and operate the Bourgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline late Thursday (January 10th) in Athens.
An official signing ceremony is expected later this month in Sofia.
The new facility will allow the transport of oil from Black Sea ports to the European, US and Asian markets via a new route through Bulgaria and Greece.
Russia will hold 51% of the consortium, while Greece and Bulgaria will hold 24.5% each.
On Friday, meanwhile, Turkish Energy and Natural Resources Minister Hilmi Guler announced that an estimated 280 billion cubic metres of Iraqi natural gas reserves will be exported to Europe via Turkey.
The gas will be produced in five fields north of Baghdad.
Guler told CNN Turk television that Turkey, the United States and Iraq agreed to boost energy co-operation during a meeting in Istanbul last March.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Opposition parties rejected an agreement on settling the border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia that was presented by Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor at an extraordinary meeting Wednesday (October 28th).
Kosor wanted to reach a deal with the opposition before receiving support from the cabinet.
However, the opposition claimed that the agreement lacks transparency and contains potentially harmful provisions, primarily involving open-sea access for Slovenia.
Zoran Milanovic, leader of the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP), insisted more discussion is needed and called on President Stipe Mesic to present his opinion of the agreement as well.
Kosor stressed the importance of consensus, acknowledging that Slovenia can again block Croatia's EU accession talks.
She meets with SDP representatives again on Friday.
Any agreement with Slovenia requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.

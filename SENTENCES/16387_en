SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Former Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski confirmed on Thursday (October 12th) that he would not seek another term as leader of the main opposition party, the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM) during a party congress on November 5th. 
Buckovski recently lost a SDSM confidence vote over the party's poor showing in last month's parliamentary elections. 
So far, only Radmila Sekerinska, former deputy prime minister and European integration minister in Buckovski's cabinet, has announced a bid for the SDSM leadership spot.

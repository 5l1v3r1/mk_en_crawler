BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling again warned that raising the issue of a Republika Srpska (RS) separation referendum is irresponsible and provocative, in an interview with the Srna news agency published on Sunday (25 June). 
He repeated that RS is an entity and integral part of BiH and, as such, has no jurisdiction to organise such a poll. 
Nor, he said, would the international community tolerate any threat to BiH's sovereignty. 
RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik first raised the issue after Montenegro's recent split from Serbia.
In other news, BiH prosecutors for war crimes announced at the weekend that they issued 13 indictments in the past 18 months. 
These resulted from 86 investigative procedures against a total 245 people. 
The UN tribunal has transferred three cases involving six indictees to the BiH judiciary.

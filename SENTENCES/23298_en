ZAGREB, Croatia -- A court in Zagreb on Wednesday (May 27th) sentenced two university professors and one person who acted as mediator in the so-called Index affair, in which professors took bribes from students to enrol them in universities illegally. 
Dragan Badanjak from Zagreb University's faculty of transport was sentenced to two and a half years in prison and was banned from teaching for five years. 
His co-worker, Mladen Budor, and the mediator, Kresimir Somek, received suspended sentences of ten months each. 
Ten students also got suspended for offering bribes. 
The corruption scandal surfaced in September. 
While university enrolment in Croatia is free, only a limited number of students are admitted every year.

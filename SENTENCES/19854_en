NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat said on Monday (February 18th) that he is ready to resume joint efforts with the next Greek Cypriot president aimed at reaching a "just and comprehensive solution" to the Cyprus issue. 
His statement came a day after incumbent Tassos Papadopoulos lost to two other candidates in the first round of presidential elections. 
Conservative Ioannis Kassoulides and communist leader Demetris Christofias square off again on February 24th. 
In a statement issued after the official election results were published, Talat said that Papadopoulos' defeat brings hope for the resumption of reunification talks between the two communities. 
In a 2004 referendum, Papadopoulos helped convince Greek Cypriots to reject a UN proposal aimed at ending decades of division.

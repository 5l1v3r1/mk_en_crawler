VIENNA, Austria -- A regional court in the city of Linz has turned down former Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader's appeal against his detention, the prosecution office announced on Thursday (January 20th). 
The court still views him as a flight risk. 
This means that Sanader will likely remain in custody in Salzburg until his next detention hearing on March 18th. 
He was arrested on December 10th in Austria based on an international warrant issued by Croatia, where he is being investigated for possible criminal actions and abuse of power.

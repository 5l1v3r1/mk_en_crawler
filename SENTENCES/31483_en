BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A Bosnian man has filed a lawsuit against himself, local media in Republika Srpska reported on Thursday (23 January). 
Marinko Djurkovic became disillusioned with authorities during the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH and spent the following years shoplifting, walking out of restaurants without paying and riding public transportation without a ticket. 
Repentant, Djurkovic made the decision to charge himself when he realised that no one was willing to turn him in. 
He had previously filed two lawsuits against himself but the courts refused to hear them.

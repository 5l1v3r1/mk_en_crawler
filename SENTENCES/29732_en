BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Constitutional Court on Tuesday (December 28th) ruled that next year's state budget and two wage laws are legal, rejecting a challenge by the opposition.
Thus, the government will be able to go ahead with reforms as part of its 20 billion-euro agreement with the IMF.
The 2011 budget aims to reduce the deficit to 4.4% of GDP from the projected 6.8% this year.
The wage bills envision a 15% increase in public salaries next year, raises tied to professional performance and experience.
The opposition had first filed no-confidence votes against the bills.
The appeal to the Constitutional Court was a last âditch effort to prevent implementation.

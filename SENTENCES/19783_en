STRASBOURG, France -- The European Commission must be allowed to open more chapters in negotiations with Turkey, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said in an address to the European Parliament on Wednesday (October 24th). 
"All member states continue to support accession negotiations with Turkey. 
We should therefore open further chapters without delay, as soon as they are technically ready," he said. 
Turkey has so far opened only four chapters in its accession talks with the EU, compared to 14 for Croatia, which launched negotiations with the European Commission at the same time. 
The EU has blocked talks in four areas in response to Turkey's refusal to open its ports and airports to Cypriot traffic.

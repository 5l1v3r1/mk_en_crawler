BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Leaders of eurozone countries formally approved a three-year bailout plan on Friday (May 7th) for debt-ridden Greece. 
They also agreed to set up a mechanism to preserve the stability of the eurozone in order to prevent the Greek crisis from spreading to other countries. 
"We will defend the euro whatever it takes. 
We have several instruments at our disposal and we will use them," European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said.
The EU/IMF loan package amounts to 110 billion euros. 
On Friday, the two chambers of the German parliament green lighted an allocation of 22.4 billion euros over three years. 
Germany will provide 8.4 billion euros as part of the package.

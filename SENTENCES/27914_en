ATHENS, Greece -- Former Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis formally announced the establishment of her new Democratic Alliance Party.
The ceremony Sunday (November 21st) was attended by about 5,000 people who were invited to sign the party's founding declaration.
Bakoyannis, now an independent in parliament, told supporters that the party will be "an independent democratic movement", which will fight for transparency and will emphasise individual liberties and private enterprise.
The party's inaugural congress will take place in March.
Bakoyannis, a former member of the opposition New Democracy Party, was expelled from the party's ranks after she supported the country's bailout package.
She served as foreign minister between 2006 and 2009.

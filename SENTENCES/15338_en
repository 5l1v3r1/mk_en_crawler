BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik has invited leaders of the main parties in BiH to a meeting in Banja Luka on Wednesday (November 29th) that would focus on police reforms. 
Dodik, leader of the Union of Independent Social Democrats, announced the move after a meeting Monday with British Ambassador to BiH Matthew Rycroft. 
Dodik said he hopes the talks would help form a new central government, still up in the air nearly two months after elections.
Also Monday, the BiH Presidency's Serb member, chairman Nikola Radmanovic, called on parties in the BiH House of Representatives to submit their candidates for the post of prime minister, if they have not done so already. 
Separately, Radmanovic expressed dissatisfaction with word of an unannounced meeting held recently between the presidency's Croat and Bosniak members, Zeljko Komsic and Haris Silajdzic, and Croatian President Stipe Mesic. 
Radmanovic said he only learned of the Zagreb meeting from the media. 
Komsic says it was nothing more than "a normal friendly dinner".

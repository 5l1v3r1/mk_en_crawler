BELGRADE, Serbia -- About 1,000 Serbian veterans staging a protest clashed with police in Serbia on Sunday (December 21st), leaving nine people injured. 
Police arrested four veterans following the clashes on a bridge over the Toplica River, near the Merdare crossing at the border with Kosovo. 
The veterans of the 1999 Kosovo conflict attempted to break through a police cordon, but about 300 gendarmes and riot police blocked them. 
The protesters occupied the Nis-Pristina road for several hours, demanding back pay for combat they saw in 1999. 
The veterans also seek the release of two fellow veterans imprisoned for war crimes in Kosovo and are protesting the creation of a police and security force in Kosovo.
Serbian Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac said on Saturday the establishment of the Kosovo Security Force is "completely unacceptable". 
Serbia "totally disagrees" with its formation, Sutanovac told reporters in the village of Rasevac.

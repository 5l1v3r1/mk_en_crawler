SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The tripartite presidency is considering sending soldiers on peacekeeping missions abroad, Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic said on Tuesday (12 August), suggesting that such a move would send a strong message about growing stability in the country. 
He did not rule out the possibility that troops could be dispatched to Iraq before the end of the year. 
The Bosnian Serb military reported that a transport unit of 30 soldiers from both entities has already been trained for participation in international peacekeeping missions.

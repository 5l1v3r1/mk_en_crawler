DAVOS, Switzerland -- The EU should not become a "club of Christians", Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan said on Saturday (January 26th) in Davos, where he took part in the World Economic Forum.
The minister also said that Turkey's EU accession will add new richness to the Union.
Babacan reiterated that Turkey is preparing to become a member of the EU despite opposition by some leaders, such as French President Nicolas Sarkozy.
He also promised that his country will continue to develop and will boost its image in Europe.

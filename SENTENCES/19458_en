ATHENS, Greece -- The number of racist, violent and criminal acts has been on the rise in the past few years, according to an annual report by the Greece Observatory on Racism and Xenophobia.
The report was forwarded to President Karolos Papoulias on Wednesday (January 23rd), with excerpts appearing in local newspapers Thursday.
The report lists 30 racist crimes, two of which ended in death, in 2006.
That triples the previous year.
Moreover, the NGO says the number of racist crimes rose sharply after last year's parliamentary elections.
Arab, African and Asian immigrants were mentioned as the most frequent victims, though there were several reports of attacks against Albanians as well.

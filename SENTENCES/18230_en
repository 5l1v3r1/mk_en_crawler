TIRANA, Albania -- The five opposition parties in parliament formally registered on Tuesday (January 16th) to participate in the February 18th municipal elections.
The deadline for registration is January 20th.
An internationally mediated deal hammered out last week ended months of deadlock over electoral reforms, clearing the way for the February vote.

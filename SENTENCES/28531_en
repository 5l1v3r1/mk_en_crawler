SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Embassy in Belgrade has sent a note to Serbian authorities, protesting the arrest of a BiH officer. 
According to a statement Tuesday (June 15th), embassy personnel were denied access to Mirsad Salkic on Monday. 
He had been arrested on Saturday at the Serbian-Croatian border. 
Though Zagreb's military prosecutors charged him in 1991 with weapons theft, Croatia never issued an arrest warrant for him. 
The charges were reactivated in 2005 by Belgrade prosecutors.

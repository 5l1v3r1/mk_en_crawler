ATHENS, Greece -- The government announced on Wednesday (January 12th) it will send representation to The Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ) in a lawsuit seeking German war reparations. 
The plaintiffs are relatives of those massacred in the Greek village of Distomo during World War II. 
Greece had until Friday to decide whether to join the case, which will decide whether the relatives are entitled to compensation from Germany over the 1944 massacre that left 218 people dead. 
In a marathon of lawsuits between 1998 and 2000, Greek courts ruled in favour of the victims, demanding Germany pay compensation of up to 60m euros. 
The country rejected the ruling, insisting the case should be examined by German courts. 
Ultimately, it was transferred to another EU member state -- Italy, where a court awarded compensation of 25m euros plus interest. 
Germany is appealing that decision at the ICJ.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The High Court acquitted on Wednesday (December 27th) a man charged in connection with the 2004 murder of Dusko Jovanovic, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper Dan.
The judges ruled there was insufficient evidence that Damir Mandic, 34, was in the car from which gunfire killed Jovanovic in Podgorica on May 27th, 2004.
Mandic was released from custody later in the day.
Dan's current editor-in-chief, Mladen Milutinovic, described the court's decision as scandalous.

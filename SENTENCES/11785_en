SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The final report of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) on this spring's municipal elections highlighted the need for political will to strengthen the electoral process. 
The report, published Friday (17 June), contains the findings of the ODIHR observation mission about the conduct of the vote, as well as a series of recommendations on eliminating problems. 
The international experts stressed that the perpetrators of election violations should be sanctioned, to restore the rule of law and confidence in the elections process. 
They also called for implementation of the government's plan for election legislation reform, resulting from a wide political consensus among local parties.

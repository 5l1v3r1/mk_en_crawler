TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi begin talks with Albanian leaders and international representatives Friday (May 7th), in another bid to end the political stalemate that is threatening the EU integration process. 
After meetings with Deputy Prime Minister Ilir Meta, US and European Commission ambassadors, Topi's office announced that the discussions once again stressed the importance of resuming institutional dialogue. 
On Saturday, Topi spoke by phone with opposition leader Edi Rama. 
Diplomatic sources said that while they made some progress, there has been no agreement. 
The government says opening the ballot boxes would be unconstitutional.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Chamber of Deputies endorsed on Tuesday (February 6th) an opposition-backed change in the referendum act that will facilitate presidential impeachment.
The amendment allows the dismissal of the president by referendum if 50% + 1 of voters who participate back the measure.
The current legislation requires the support of 50% of all registered voters.
The amendment was tabled earlier this month by the main opposition Social Democrat Party (PSD), whose leader, Mircea Geoana, announced that PSD might submit an official request to Parliament next week, seeking the provisional removal of President Traian Basescu from office and the scheduling of a national referendum.
Basescu's Democratic Party says it will contest the matter before the Constitutional Court.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Transfer of military command from SFOR to an EU-led force would not mean that the United States and NATO are departing from BiH, US Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of State Robert Bradtke told the Fena news agency.
Washington's priorities include strengthening BiH's Euro-Atlantic integration process, Bradtke said.
In other news, a SFOR spokesman announced Tuesday (2 March) that the NATO-led peacekeepers have completed the destruction of 3,000 shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles.
The weapons were collected from both entity armies during the past several months.

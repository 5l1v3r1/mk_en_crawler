SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Parliament's lower house on Wednesday (June 13th) endorsed a state-level higher-education law, one of the key reform bills outlined in the country's European Partnership commitments. 
The legislation aims to bring higher education in BiH into line with EU practises and the Bologna Process requirements, thus ensuring recognition of BiH higher education diplomas and degrees within the European Higher Education Area.
The move came on the same day that outgoing High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling delivered a toughly worded farewell address to Parliament, warning that failure to push ahead with reforms was jeopardising the country's European future. 
Slovak diplomat Miroslav Lajcak will take over from Schwarz-Schilling on June 30th.

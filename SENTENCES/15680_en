ANKARA, Turkey -- A Kurdish man was arrested in the eastern Turkish town of Semdinli on Wednesday (21 June), a day after a court sentenced two paramilitary soldiers for blowing up his bookstore.
Seferi Yilmaz was charged with belonging to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party.
Two gendarmerie non-commissioned officers were sentenced to nearly 40 years each when the court found them guilty of carrying out last November's blast, which left one person dead.

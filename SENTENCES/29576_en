SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Miroslav Lajcak, European External Action Service Managing Director for Europe and Central Asia, said on Thursday (April 28th) that Republika Srpska's decision to call a referendum on High Representative-imposed laws, particularly regarding the BiH Court and Prosecutor's Office, is irresponsible. 
He added that this decision resolves no problems and would only contribute to further divisions. 
Lajcak added that the EU expects High Representative Valentin Inzko to present a plan in response to the Bosnian Serbs' decision. 
Lajcak is in Sarajevo for talks through Friday on the political situation and BiH's European integration process.

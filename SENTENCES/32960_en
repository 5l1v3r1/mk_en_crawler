ZAGREB, Croatia -- The opposition parties -- the Croatian Democratic Union, Croatian Social Liberal Party, Democratic Centre and Croatian Party of Rights -- threatened on Thursday (26 June) to boycott work in parliament next week following a scandal in eastern Osijek-Baranja county.
At issue are the resignations of 26 opposition members in the 51-member county assembly, which created the lack of a quorum.
By law, the resignations should have led to the dissolution of the body and new elections.
But the assembly continued to work, raising tensions between the opposition and the ruling Social Democrats.
In Zagreb, opposition parties warned that members would attend a session solely to vote on aligning Croatian laws with EU standards, boycotting all other hearings.

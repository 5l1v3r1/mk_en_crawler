THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal launched its biggest trial on Friday (14 July), when seven defendants accused of carrying out the 1995 Srebrenica massacre faced four judges in a courtroom in The Hague. 
Five of the suspects are accused of genocide -- Ljubisa Beara, a chief of security for the Bosnian Serb Army; Ljubomir Borovcanin, a deputy commander for the Bosnian Serb special police; Vinko Pandurevic, the commander of the brigade that led the attack on Srebrenica; Drago Nikolic, the brigade's chief of security; and former military police chief Vujadin Popovic. 
Two former aides of Ratko Mladic -- Radivoj Miletic and Milan Gvero -- will face charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. 
An eighth suspect, Milorad Trbic, will probably be tried in Bosnia and Herzegovina for health reasons. 
The trial at The Hague is expected to last at least a year.
In other news, Serbian prosecutors have indicted ten people suspected of helping Mladic evade justice. 
According to the indictment, the suspects provided shelter and other help to the fugitive. 
Prosecutors also urged the judges to take into account the toll the suspects' alleged actions have taken on the country. 
On Monday, the Serbian government plans to present its action plan for co-operation with the war crimes tribunal, particularly regarding Mladic, to the EU.

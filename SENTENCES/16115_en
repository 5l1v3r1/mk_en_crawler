ANKARA, Turkey -- Veteran politician Bulent Ecevit, 81, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a stroke late Thursday (18 May).
Earlier in the day, he had joined thousands of pro-secularist Turks at the funeral of Judge Mustafa Yucel Ozbilgin, who was gunned down in court on Wednesday.
Ecevit, who was prime minister five times, is perhaps best known for authorising the 1974 invasion of Cyprus, which led to its division into Greek and Turkish sectors.
According to the hospital in Ankara, he is paralysed on his right side following a four-hour operation to stop bleeding in his brain.

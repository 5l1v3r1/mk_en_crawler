SKOPJE, Macedonia -- During a meeting with the ambassadors of EU member states to Skopje on Tuesday (21 December), Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski asked for continued support of his country's EU integration bid.
He told the diplomats that Euro-Atlantic accession is a priority of his administration.
Also Tuesday, the state anti-corruption commission backed an initiative to remove some of the discretion and immunity rights of government members.
Last week, Buckovski had pushed for such a move, in order to stamp out corruption.
In other news Tuesday, 32 members of the Macedonian Army were welcomed home from a six-month tour in Iraq.
At the ceremony, officials stressed that the successful completion of the mission contributes to Macedonia's preparations for NATO membership.

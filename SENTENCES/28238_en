SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia and Serbia agreed on Saturday (September 18th) to allow their citizens to cross the common border with ID cards instead of passports.
The initiative was announced after a meeting in Skopje between Macedonian Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska and her Serbian counterpart, Ivica Dacic.
The measure will initially be implemented only for people living in the border zones.
Further regulations are needed before it can be implemented for all citizens of Serbia and Macedonia.
The two ministers also agreed to continue co-operation in the fight against organised crime, terrorism and corruption.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Secretary of State Colin Powell has urged the BiH government to do more to fight international terrorism, the foreign ministry in Sarajevo said Friday (31 January). 
Powell sent a letter to newly elected Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanov telling him that the "legal basis necessary for tracing and prosecuting suspected terrorists must urgently be strengthened." He also urged the BiH Parliament to adopt a law on export controls. 
This request comes several months after it was found that a Bosnian Serb company had exported military hardware to Iraq.
In a separate move, US Ambassador to BiH Clifford Bond urged local political and religious leaders to condemn recent incidents involving violence against returning refugees. 
"We are witnesses of increased violence, and I think that this was stirred up by the fact that nationalist parties are back in power again," Bond told the Bosnian Serb newspaper <I>Nezavisne</I> on Saturday. 
He signalled that the international community would not allow a return to the situation of the early 1990s.(AFP - 01/02/03, 31/01/03)

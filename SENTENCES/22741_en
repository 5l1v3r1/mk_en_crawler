BUCHAREST, Romania -- Over 100,000 public servants staged a warning strike Thursday (October 9th) to demand a 50% pay hike.
The Federation of Public Servants' Unions Sed Lex organised the protest after negotiations with the finance ministry failed last week.
Public servants stopped work for two hours, blocking activity in tax offices, pension departments, city halls, financial administrations, customs and local councils.
Protesters also picketed the government's headquarters in Bucharest for two hours.
Fresh talks with the government are scheduled for Friday.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Some 2,000 Muslims and Croats marked the 14th anniversary of the dismantling of the Omarska prison camp Sunday (6 August).
Many were executed there by Serb forces or died while imprisoned between May and August 1992.
In other news, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica on Friday called the mass exodus of Serbs from Croatia in August 1995 a "great unpunished crime".
In a statement issued on the 11th anniversary of the Croatian Army's "Operation Storm", Kostunica said that something must be done to address the injustice.
Echoing that sentiment Sunday, Serbian Interior Minister Dragan Jocic urged authorities in Croatia and BiH to conduct an immediate investigation and identify perpetrators of crimes committed against Serb refugees.

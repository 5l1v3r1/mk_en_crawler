SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The country's opposition Unedited Democratic Forces (UDF) is at serious risk of losing membership in the European People's Party (EPP), Europe's largest political party. 
On Friday (March 9th), the EPP recommended the suspension of membership over UDF Chairman Petar Stoyanov's decision to join the rival Movement for European Reform. 
EPP leaders say Stoyanov's behaviour was inappropriate and unacceptable and contradicted a statute that forbids dual membership in other European-level parties. 
The final decision will be made in mid-May. 
That in turn could affect the outcome of European Parliament elections on May 20th.

War, communism and the post-1989 transition have come and gone.
Romania's history has been turbulent, but you wouldn't guess it while riding Vaser Valley's famous mocanita narrow gauge railway.
Its steam engines operate the way they have always done, hauling their cargo of logs from deep in the mountains.
Built prior to World War II, the railway was renovated in 2004 and transformed into a tourist attraction, although it is still also used for logging.
The main line is 43km long, spanning the route from Vişeu de Sus to Comanu.
The ride takes three to four hours each way.

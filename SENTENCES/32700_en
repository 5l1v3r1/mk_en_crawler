ZAGREB, Croatia -- On Wednesday (18 December), Parliament approved the government programme for EU membership as well as a separate resolution defining the process as a strategic national goal.
The documents support the government plan to submit an official membership application by the end of February and encourage state authorities to speed up reforms.
Opposition parties criticised some texts of the government programme but agreed on the strategic goals.
Given the political consensus, the government plans to close accession talks in 2006.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Court of Accounts warned political parties Monday (20 September) about numerous violations of the law on funding political parties and campaigns for local ballots. 
At a news conference, court official Paul Miercan said that over 500 cases were registered. 
He added that most referred to the way banners were tailored and the lack of transparency in making financial reports public, as there were large discrepancies in terms of spending.

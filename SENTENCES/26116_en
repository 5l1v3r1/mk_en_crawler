BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic spoke with Slovenian counterpart Borut Pahor about Saturday's (March 20th) EU-Balkans summit in Slovenia, Tadic's cabinet confirmed on Thursday. 
Pahor visited Belgrade late Wednesday. 
During the talks, Tadic reiterated Serbia's stance that its participation at the Brdo conference will depend on whether Kosovo will be represented according to UN Security Council Resolution 1244 or as an independent state. 
Pahor told Slovenian journalists that the success of the forum does not depend on any one person.

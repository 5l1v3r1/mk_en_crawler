BUCHAREST, Romania -- Severe storms and snow have created problems in several Balkan countries, according regional media reports Wednesday (28 December). 
Romania was one of the hardest hit areas, with emergency situations declared in several southern counties. 
Meteorologists have warned of new flooding there.
Flooding is also an issue in southern Bulgaria. 
Authorities deliberately cut power supplies to 15 settlements in the southern Kurdjali district, to avert significant storm-related damage to the electricity distribution system.

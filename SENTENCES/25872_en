PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu confirmed on Wednesday (August 19th) that Kosovo institutions still oppose the signing of a police co-operation protocol between EULEX and Serbia.
He and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci are to meet on Thursday with EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon.
"Kosovo institutions will express their joint stance for building democracy ...
defending its integrity and the functioning of institutions at all levels," Sejdiu said.
Thaci added "Kosovo institutions are the only ones that have executive authority in Kosovo as far as bilateral relations are concerned." EULEX spokesperson Karin Limdal insisted in a written statement Wednesday that the protocol on co-operation does not interfere in the competencies of Kosovo police but is part of EULEX's executive functions.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In an interview published Friday (28 May) in the Banja Luka daily Nezavisne novine, EU security chief Javier Solana said the Union fully backs sanctions imposed by High Representative Paddy Ashdown against Republika Srpska (RS).
Solana said that eight years after the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords, politicians and institutions in RS have yet to fulfill the major obligation of co-operating with the UN war crimes tribunal.
Outgoing OSCE Ambassador to BiH Robert Beecroft paid a farewell visit to Banja Luka Thursday, reiterating that BiH would not be admitted to Euro-Atlantic structures as long as top war crimes indictees remain at large.

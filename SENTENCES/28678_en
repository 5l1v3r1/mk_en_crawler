ANKARA, Turkey -- The opposition Republican People's Party requested a delay on Monday (April 12th) of three controversial constitutional amendments until next year's general elections. 
All three are part of a larger constitutional reform package, drafted by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). 
The three involve making party closures more difficult, changing the structure of the Constitutional Court, and changing the structure of the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors. 
Analysts say the three changes would effectively boost the power of the executive branch and reduce that of the judiciary. 
The AKP appears to have agreed to consider the three amendments separately from the rest of the package, in order to guarantee the adoption of the others.

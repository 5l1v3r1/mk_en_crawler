SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The two main Bosniak formations in BiH, the Party of Democratic Action (SDA) and the Party for BiH (SBiH) are reacting strongly to news that Republika Srpska (RS) and Serbia plan to seal an accord on special parallel ties.
The signing, planned for 26 September in Banja Luka, was agreed to last week, during RS President Dragan Cavic's visit to Belgrade.
In separate statements at the weekend, SDA leader Sulejman Tihic -- who is also the Bosniak member and chairman of the BiH presidency -- as well as SBiH chairman Haris Silajdzic called on High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling to stop the signing.
They say the agreement would be illegal, as the preceding negotiations failed to include Bosniak and Croat representatives.
RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik insists that the entity has the right to seal agreements on special ties and says Banja Luka would be approaching Croatia and Montenegro with similar deals.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prime Minister Igor Luksic signed an initiative Thursday (April 28th) establishing RECOM, a regional commission for truth-seeking and truth-telling about war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia. 
He said that facing the past is the best way to embrace the future and voiced hope that the initiative will attract broad support. 
A coalition of several NGOs started collecting signatures in eight cities across the region Tuesday. 
The campaign, called "One million signatures for RECOM", is under way in Belgrade, Zagreb, Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Ljubljana, Pristina, Skopje and Podgorica, and will end on June 6th. 
In two days, organisers got 9,000 signatures.

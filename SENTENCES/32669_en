The opposition presented copies of transcripts and asked for the resignation of Interior Minister Georgi Petkanov, saying that intelligence services were being used illegally for political purposes.Petkanov's ministry rejected the allegations, but admitted that former security services chief Gen Atanas Atanasov had been wiretapped because of suspicions he had spied for foreign intelligence services.
During the investigation, Atanasov's conversations with opposition leaders and media directors were recorded, the ministry said.But UDF said some of its transcripts dated from before the investigation.

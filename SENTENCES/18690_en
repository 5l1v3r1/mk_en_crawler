ANKARA, Turkey -- Thousands of people gathered in Ankara's Tangodan Square Saturday (July 7th) to protest the growing number of terrorist attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
Three-dozen groups supported the rally, including the main opposition Republican People's Party.
In a statement aired by NTV on Friday, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul confirmed that a plan is in place for a cross-border operation targeting PKK bases in neighbouring Iraq. 
Later Friday, Turkish troops shelled two villages in northern Iraq. 
No casualties were reported.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN tribunal convicted two Croatian generals Friday (April 15th) of war crimes stemming from the 1995 military operation Storm. 
The court found retired General Ante Gotovina guilty of almost all charges and sentenced him to 24 years in prison, concluding that he participated in a joint criminal enterprise aimed at forcibly and permanently removing the ethnic Serb population from the Krajina region of Croatia. 
Co-defendant Mladen Markac was sentenced to 18 years in prison, while the third general, Ivan Cermak, was acquitted of all charges. 
The trial opened in March 2008. 
The verdicts are subject to appeal.

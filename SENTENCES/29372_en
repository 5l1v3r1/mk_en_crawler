TIRANA, Albania -- Former government official Almir Rrapo will be detained for three more months, a court in Tirana announced on Thursday (September 2nd). 
Rrapo is wanted by US authorities for his alleged role in a series of crimes committed in New York: murder, extortion, arson, kidnapping and racketeering. 
Albanian police arrested him in early July at the US Embassy. 
Reports suggested he was a senior administrative assistant to Foreign Minister Ilir Meta. 
Rrapo's lawyers sought his release, while prosecutors insisted he should remain behind bars pending a decision on extradition.

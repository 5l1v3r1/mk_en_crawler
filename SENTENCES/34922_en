ZAGREB, Croatia -- The president of the Croatian Social Liberal Party, Drazen Budisa, resigned from the post Wednesday (17 December) following the party's poor performance in last month's parliamentary elections. 
Budisa is known for his nationalist views and his party is considered a key ally of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), which is working to form the new government.
In other news, HDZ leader and Prime Minister designate Ivo Sanader signed an agreement Wednesday with Furio Radin, who will represent the Italian minorities in the new parliament. 
The deal is expected to ease pressure in the county of Istria, where most of the Italian minorities live. 
The county threatens to hold an regional autonomy referendum if the new government does not observe their rights.

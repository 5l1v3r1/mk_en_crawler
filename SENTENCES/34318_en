TIRANA, Albania -- Doris Pack, the head of a European Parliament delegation, said Tuesday (28 October) that Albania must resolve its political problems.
Pack called on Prime Minister Fatos Nano and former Foreign Minister Ilir Meta to end their dispute and move forward in rebuilding institutions.
She added that the cabinet cannot function with two deputy ministers and urged that the situation be rectified to ensure the normal work of government.
She also urged that the controversy over the local election in Tirana be resolved and official results be published.
Pack said these challenges hinder the country's integration into Europe.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The 7th EU reform package reportedly limits the powers of the joint civilian-military National Security Council (NSC).
On Wednesday (16 July), NTV reported that the package calls for NSC meetings every two months, rather than on a monthly basis.
Furthermore, the secretary general of the council could be a civilian, appointed by the prime minister.
The influence of the NSC on Turkish politics has long been criticised by the EU.
In other news, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul announced on Wednesday that he would travel to Washington next week to meet with his US counterpart, Colin Powell.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Western diplomats have called on the future Serbian government to fully co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
US Ambassador to Belgrade Nicholas Burns, speaking to BK Television, warned that Serbia-Montenegro would not be able to join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme while top fugitives like Bosnian Serb Ratko Mladic -- believed to be hiding in Belgrade -- remain at large. 
Meanwhile, US Congressional Commission on Security and Co-operation in Europe's staff advisor Robert Hand said that any actions by the new government showing a lack of political will to arrest and bring war criminals before justice could affect bilateral relations with the United States.
In other news, the former chief of staff of the Yugoslav Army denied on Friday (27 February) that he was involved in a plot to kill opposition leader Vuk Draskovic. 
Retired General Nebojsa Pavkovic admitted that he provided uniforms and transportation to a special police team for an operation in Montenegro in June 2000. 
He said he was acting on orders of Slobodan Milosevic and had no idea that an assassination was being plotted.

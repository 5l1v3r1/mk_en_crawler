ATHENS, Greece -- The rating agency Fitch cut on Friday (May 20th) Greece's long-term credit rating by three levels from BB+ to B+ with a negative outlook. 
The agency said the move reflects the debt-ridden country's problems to implement necessary fiscal and structural reforms.
Greek finance ministry criticised Fitch's new rating for the country saying it was influenced by media speculations. 
"The decision ignores the additional commitments that the Greek government has already made in order to achieve its fiscal targets for 2011, and to accelerate the privatization program," a press release issued by the ministry reads.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Republika Srpska (RS) Assembly will discuss two key laws on BiH defence reforms at a session on 30 August, according to RS Parliamentary Speaker Dusan Stojicic. 
The new legislation envisions the abolishment of entity armies and defence ministries and the creation of a single state-level, professional army and defence ministry in BiH. 
Its adoption is expected to enhance BiH's chances to join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme. 
The entity government in the Federation of BiH endorsed the legal changes Thursday.

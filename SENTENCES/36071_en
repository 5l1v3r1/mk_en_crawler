SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The interior ministry, in co-operation with the OSCE Spillover Monitor Mission in Skopje, has launched a project to improve communication and co-operation between citizens and the police.
As part of the initiative, local television will broadcast video clips intended to educate citizens about their rights and the obligations of police with regard to crime and security.
The goal is to restore public confidence in the police.
Radivoje Jovanovski, a state secretary within the interior ministry, told reporters that the current level of co-operation between police and the public is unsatisfactory.

WASHINGTON, United States -- The IMF Executive board approved the extension Friday (25 April) of the fourth tranche of around $76m under the current 18-month stand-by arrangement. 
The decision was made after the board completed its third quarterly performance review under the current arrangement, signed in October 2001. 
Prior to this tranche, the IMF had extended $186m in 3 tranches out of a total of around $413m.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic on Saturday (25 March) again called for fulfilling all obligations to the UN tribunal.
In a speech to his Democratic Party's main board, Tadic warned that the public must stop being misled about the chances for Euro-Atlantic integration if this requirement is not met.
The EU has said Stabilisation and Association talks with Belgrade could be put on hold if the remaining obligations -- particularly the handover of Ratko Mladic and other war crimes indictees -- are not addressed.
Separately, Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic also called for full co-operation, in several media statements at the weekend.
He stressed that time was running out and that the Mladic case must be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
According to Draskovic, handing over Mladic would help boost Serbia's negotiating position in the Kosovo status talks.

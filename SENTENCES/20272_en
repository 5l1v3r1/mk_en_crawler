WASHINGTON, United States -- Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki said on Tuesday (February 12th) that the United States strongly supports Macedonia's NATO bid. 
"There is not a single NATO member who supports Macedonia's NATO accession more strongly than the United States," Milososki told reporters after talks with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in Washington. 
"This support corresponds to our strategic relations with the United States when it comes to Afghanistan, Iraq, and regional issues."
Referring to the name-dispute between Athens and Skopje, Milososki said it was the "only risk factor" which could have a negative influence on Macedonia's chances of getting a NATO invitation at the Bucharest summit. 
He said Rice urged the continuation of efforts to reach a solution during talks mediated by UN special envoy Matthew Nimetz. 
The next round of talks is scheduled for February 19th.

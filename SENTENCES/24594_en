SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A modified version of a proposal made in October will be the basis of further negotiations aimed at resolving the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece, says UN mediator Matthew Nimetz.
"The meeting was quite successful and I have the feeling that we will find a solution," Nimetz said after meeting in Skopje Tuesday (July 7th) with Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki.
According to the proposal, the constitutional name Republic of Macedonia will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia" for use internationally.
Domestically, it would remain Republic of Macedonia.
Nimetz arrives in Athens on Wednesday to meet with Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis.

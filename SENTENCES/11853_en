BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The head of Serbia-Montenegro's national council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, stated Friday (17 December) that he expected concrete steps towards full co-operation, including the extradition of indictees, by March.
He called on Serbia's people to be aware of the consequences of non-co-operation, and stressed that the state union's priority is to ensure a positive decision by the EU on a feasibility study for the country.
Ljajic's statement came a day after Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica pledged in Brussels that Belgrade would intensify co-operation with the UN tribunal.
In other news, the World Bank's Board of Executive Directors has approved a new three-year Country Assistance Strategy for Serbia-Montenegro.
The strategy will provide support for the federal union to reach $550m by June 2007.

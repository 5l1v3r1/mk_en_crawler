SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in BiH, submitted to parliament Wednesday (17 December) a draft law that would create a single intelligence agency for the entire country. 
"Bosnia and Herzegovina can no longer afford to have an intelligence security sector effectively operating outside proper state control," he said, criticising the government for failing to make the move on its own. 
Ashdown sidestepped the ministers and forwarded the bill directly to parliament, urging adoption by 1 March. 
The new legislation was drafted by a special commission, established after scandals surfaced in the intelligence sector. 
US Ambassador Clifford Bond said reforms are needed, given the dual threats of terrorism and organised crime. 
He met Wednesday with Republika Srpska Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic and expressed concern that some of the Bosnian Serb Army's shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles might fall into the hands of terrorists.

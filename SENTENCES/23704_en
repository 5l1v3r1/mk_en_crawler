SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Spanish Foreign Miguel Angel Moratinos pledged his country's support Thursday (May 21st) for BiH's efforts to join the EU.
Spain is to assume the rotating presidency of the 27-nation bloc in January.
Meeting with Bosnian counterpart Sven Alkalaj in Sarajevo, Moratinos said BiH has enough time between now and then to implement reforms required for a visa-free regime with the EU.
Also Thursday, Moratinos met with High Representative Valentin Inzko and discussed the current political situation.
Inzko reiterated that BiH authorities are responsible for implementing the required reforms, especially those arising from the country's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
He warned again that negative rhetoric and nationalist agendas are hobbling BiH's progress towards EU membership.

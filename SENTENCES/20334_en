TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama demanded on Monday (February 11th) the urgent resumption of work by the parliamentary committee on electoral reform, which, he said, is being held hostage by party interests. 
Rama described current electoral reform efforts as a failure. 
He threatened to ensure the opposition boycotts elections next year unless identity card issues are resolved and international elections standards are met.
Separately Monday, ruling Democratic Party leader Sali Berisha said work on electoral reforms is proceeding.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia's main opposition party, VMRO-DPMNE, elected Nikola Gruevski as its new leader on Sunday (25 May). 
He will succeed former Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski, who announced his retirement from politics several months ago, but will stay on as honorary chairman. 
Gruevski, 33, served as finance minister in Georgievski's cabinet.
In other news, the second round of mayoral elections was held Sunday in the municipalities of Kocan and Orizari. 
Local authorities said there were no irregularities during the voting, but that turnout was again very low. 
Results are expected in a few days.

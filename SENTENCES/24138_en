PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The European Commission Liaison Office (ECLO) launched a new twinning project Wednesday (July 15th) aimed at boosting the rule of law in Kosovo.
Twinning has proven to be an effective tool in enhancing the capabilities of local institutions in drafting, adopting and enforcing EU standards and legislation.
This particular project is part of a larger EU strategy directed at securing Kosovo's borders and boundaries.
The 2.6m-euro initiative is expected to last for 18 months.

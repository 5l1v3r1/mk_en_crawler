ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday (April 5th) accused the opposition pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) of provoking tension in the Kurdish-dominated southeast, ahead of the June 12th parliamentary elections. 
The BDP has been ramping up its campaign for civil disobedience, urging Kurdish minority members to seek more cultural and political rights. 
"Instead of suggesting plans and projects, the BDP is using a politics of provocation and exploitation as propaganda prior to the elections," Erdogan told members of his ruling Justice and Development Party during a meeting in parliament.

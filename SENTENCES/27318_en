SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A Bosnian Serb wanted by Republika Srpska (RS) authorities for war crimes against civilians has been arrested in Georgia. 
BiH Justice Ministry official Jusuf Halilagic said on Saturday (January 30th) that Sasa Lipovac, 40, is in custody pending extradition. 
The RS Supreme Court issued an arrest warrant for Lipovac in 2008 after he failed to appear at trial for war crimes against Bosniaks committed in the village of Liskovac during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.

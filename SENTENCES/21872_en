BUCHAREST, Romania -- At a congress organised by the Romanian Mediation Centres Union on Friday (September 19th), President Traian Basescu said justice has become "almost a luxury" for many, as it is a complicated and expensive process.
Basescu insisted that Romania's judiciary could become more efficient through mediation and by avoiding a series of suits that can be settled outside court.
In the past, he has said that for the European Commission's judicial-system monitoring to end, the judiciary must be depoliticised.

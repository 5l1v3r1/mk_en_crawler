SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko says there are no indications so far of any new international conference for BiH, dubbed "Dayton 2", according to media reports Sunday (May 10th).
The original peace agreement, struck in 1995 in Dayton, Ohio, ended the conflict in Bosnia and divided the country into two mini-states, linked into one by common institutions.
During a visit in Zagreb with President Stipe Mesic, Inzko suggested waiting for US Vice President Joe Biden's visit to BiH in mid-May to hear his views on the matter.
Concerning recent calls for the resignation of Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, Inzko said he is ready to dismiss any politician who presents a threat to the country.
The call for Dodik's resignation came from the Croat member of the three-member presidency, Zeljko Komsic, who denounced Dodik's appeal to Serb soldiers to boycott NATO military exercises in Georgia.

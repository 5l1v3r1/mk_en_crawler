WASHINGTON, United States -- Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou meets with President Barack Obama on Monday (March 8th) in Washington, the latest stop in Papandreou's tour of Western capitals to discuss Greece's severe financial crisis.
On Sunday, he was in Paris for talks with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who promised Greece could count on eurozone support if necessary.
Speaking at a joint press conference afterwards, Sarkozy said France opposes Greece seeking help from the IMF.
"The main actors on the European stage [have] decided to do whatever is needed to make sure Greece is not isolated," Sarkozy said, adding that French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde and her colleagues in the Eurozone and Europe are "working on a certain number of precise measures if Greece needs them".
Papandreou arrived in Paris from Berlin where he met with Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday.

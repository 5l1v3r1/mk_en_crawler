THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The appeals panel of the UN war crimes tribunal commuted the sentences of two former Bosnian Army commanders Tuesday (April 22nd).
The court reduced Enver Hadzihasanovic's sentence from five years to three and a half years, and Amir Kubura's from two and a half to two years.
They were among the highest-ranking Bosnian Muslims to stand trial at The Hague.
Both faced charges over crimes during the 1992-1995 conflict, particularly concerning command responsibility for crimes perpetrated by foreign mujahedeen fighters.
The appeals panel ruled that the mujahedeen were beyond the control of Hadzihasanovic's 3rd Corps of the regular Bosnian Muslim army.
The men received credit for time served and will be released.
In other news Tuesday, the war crimes court in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) sentenced four Bosnian Serbs for war crimes.
It found three guilty of gunning down a group of civilians, including women and children, in the western town of Jajce in September 1992.
Two received sentences of 21 years in prison, the third up to 29 years.
In a separate case, a man charged with the persecution, killing, imprisonment and rape of non-Serbs in the notorious Keraterm detention camp got nine years in prison.
Also on Tuesday, EUFOR personnel and local police raided the home of Goran Marinkovic in the Banja Luka suburb of Petricevac.
Marinkovic allegedly helps finance the network used by fugitive war crimes indictees to evade justice.

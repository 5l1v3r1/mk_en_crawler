LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Slovenia found itself in a bind on Friday (January 25th), when Ljubljana-based newspaper Dnevnik published a document in which US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried suggested that current EU presidency holder Slovenia should be "among the first EU members to recognise the independence of Kosovo". 
The document is transcript of a conversation between Washington and Slovenian diplomats on December 24th 2007. 
The US embassy in Ljubljana refused to comment on the authenticity of the diplomatic memoranda.

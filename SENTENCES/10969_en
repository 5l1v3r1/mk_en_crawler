SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov vetoed the latest amendments to the key law on excise duties Monday (30 May) and returned the text to parliament for further consideration.
His office says Parvanov objects to changes that abolish the excise tax on coffee products, as they appear to favour certain business lobbies.
Parvanov also worries that removing the excise tax on coffee might significantly affect budget revenues this year.
Since parliament is out of session in advance of next month's elections, the measure will likely be reviewed in August at the earliest.

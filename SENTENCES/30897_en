ATHENS, Greece -- An Italian anarchist group is responsible for a parcel bomb sent to the Korydallos maximum-security prison in Athens, Greek police announced on Friday (April 1st).
The bomb addressed to the director of the facility was detonated on Thursday.
In an acclamation included in the envelope, the Informal Anarchist Federation voices solidarity with anarchists jailed in Greece, Switzerland, Chile and Germany.

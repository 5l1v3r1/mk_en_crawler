ATHENS, Greece -- Gunmen fired at a police van in the Goudi district of Athens early Tuesday (December 23rd), failing to injure any of the riot police inside. 
Investigators are examining a possible link to the massive anti-government riots during the last three weeks triggered by the death of 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos, whom a policeman shot on December 6th. 
Youths have targeted police stations and torched police vehicles, but this was the first reported incident involving a firearm.
In other news, Russia's Aeroflot flight from Athens to Moscow returned to the Athens international airport Monday following a bomb threat. 
An anonymous caller told airport personnel there was a bomb on board. 
Police searched the plane but found no explosives.

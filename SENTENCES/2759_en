While still lagging behind the rest of the Southeast European (SEE) countries in terms of economic freedom, Romania and Turkey are among the countries that achieved greatest improvements in this area in 2005, a report released Wednesday (4 January) indicates.
"The most improved country in this (North America and Europe) region is Romania, followed closely by Armenia, Georgia, and Turkey," the Heritage Foundation and the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> said in their joint annual Index of Economic Freedom. 
"Romania improved by 0.39 points this year, making it the world's second most improved country."
The 2006 Index ranked 157 nations on the basis of ten factors. 
These include trade policy, fiscal burden of government, government intervention in the economy, monetary policy, capital flows and foreign investment, banking and finance, wages and prices, property rights, regulation and informal (or black) market activity.
Each country is given a rating of 1 to 5 for each measure, with 1 being the best. 
Those scores are then averaged to create an overall score, which determines an individual country's classification in one of four groups. 
Of all 157 countries surveyed, 20 are classified as free economies, 52 as mostly free, 73 as mostly unfree and 12 as repressed.
As in all 12 previous annual editions of the Index, Hong Kong and Singapore finished 1st and 2nd in the rankings. 
They are followed by Ireland, Luxembourg, Iceland, Britain, Estonia and Denmark and -- jointly in ninth place -- Australia, New Zealand and the United States.
Despite its notable progress over the past 12 months, Romania -- with an average score of 3.19 -- was ranked 92nd. 
Turkey, which improved by 0.30 points, received a rating of 3.11 and was ranked 85th. 
The two countries, along with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), which was ranked 74th on the basis of an average score of 3.01, are the only SEE countries classified in the "mostly unfree" group.
Romania's worst scores of 4.0 are for monetary policy, property rights, regulation and informal market. 
Its best scores of 1.5 and 1.9 are for government intervention and fiscal burden, respectively.
Turkey's worst ratings of 4.0 are for monetary policy and regulation. 
The country scored best in terms of trade policy and government intervention, with 2.0 and 2.5 points, respectively.
BiH, where economic freedom has been steadily improving since 1998, received the best possible score of 1.0 for its monetary policy. 
However, ratings of 5.0 for property rights and regulation suggest a need for serious improvements in those areas.
Of the other SEE countries, Macedonia, Albania and Croatia have also improved their scores, by 0.20, 0.18 and 0.17 points, respectively.
Of all SEE countries, Albania is ranked highest -- 52nd on the basis of an average score of 2.75. 
Croatia took 55th place with an average score of 2.78, and Macedonia 57th with a score of 2.80. 
All three countries received the best possible score of 1.0 for their monetary policies. 
Their worst grades of 4.0 are for factors such as property rights and regulation.
Greece, which shares the 57th position with Macedonia and Jordan, retained its score of 2.80. 
The country received its best scores of 2.0 for trade policy, government intervention and monetary policy, while fiscal burden was graded worst, at 4.0.
Of all the SEE countries, economic freedom appears to have deteriorated in Bulgaria in 2005 -- for the first time since 1998. 
The country's average score of 2.88 is 0.14 points lower than last year, placing it 64th in the world. 
Its best grades of 2.0 are for foreign investment, banking and finance and wages and prices. 
As in the case of Albania, Croatia and Macedonia, Bulgaria's worst grades of 4.0 are for property rights and regulation.
"Notwithstanding a dramatic increase in the foreign ownership of land, the legal system remains largely ineffective, allowing organised crime and corruption to hamper investment," said the authors of the 2006 Index.

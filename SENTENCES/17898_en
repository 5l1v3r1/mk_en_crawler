SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The country's natural gas distributor Bulgargaz and the Russian company Gazprom signed a new agreement Monday (December 18th) on the delivery and transit of natural gas through 2030.
Under the terms, the price at which Bulgaria buys gas from Russia will rise gradually until it reaches the average EU market price in 2012.
Under a previous agreement, Bulgaria paid $258 per 1,000 cubic metres of gas.
Russia, on the other hand, paid transit fees for exporting gas to Turkey, Greece, and Macedonia via Bulgaria.
Amid rising fuel prices in recent years, the existing deal -- set to expire in 2010 -- increasingly favoured Bulgaria, and Russia has been pressing for changes.

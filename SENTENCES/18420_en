TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister Besnik Mustafaj and Macedonian counterpart Antonio Milososki agreed that tourism and boosting bilateral co-operation in the energy and infrastructure sectors are shared priorities, during Milososki's visit to Tirana on Friday (January 12th). 
Citing the ongoing electricity crisis in Albania, Milososki stressed that Macedonia's determination to build a new 400kW power transmission line would be hugely important to Albania in terms of power imports. 
The officials also discussed Kosovo, with Albanian officials insisting that Kosovo's independence would contribute to regional stability. 
Milososki reiterated that Macedonia would respect Special UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's proposal, which is expected within weeks.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Police have detained 91 illegal immigrants in the provinces of Edirne and Bolu, the Anadolu news agency reported on Sunday (August 15th).
The immigrants came from Myanmar, the Palestinian territories, Afghanistan, Somalia and Iran.
In other news, Culture Minister Ertugrul Gunay said on Friday that police raided a residence used by suspected illegal antiquities' dealers and found two tunnels leading to an underground tomb that housed an ancient marble coffin and frescoes.
According to Gunay, the 2,800-year-old sarcophagus probably belonged to Hecatomnus, who ruled the region of Milas in western Turkey.

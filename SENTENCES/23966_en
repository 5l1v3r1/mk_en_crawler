ANKARA, Turkey -- Investigators unearthed nearly 20 pieces of human bone on Monday (March 16th) at a second excavation site in Turkey as part of the search for the bodies of Kurds allegedly murdered in the 1990s.
They found the bones in an empty field in the town of Cizre in the southeastern province of Sirnak.
Excavations there followed those in the district of Silopi, where excavators found a skull, burnt clothes and bones.
Last month, prosecutors ordered the examination of oil wells in southeastern Turkey amid allegations that the bodies of Kurds executed by Turkish security forces were dumped there.

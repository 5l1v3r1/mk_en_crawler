PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The independence of Kosovo will soon be recognised by members of CARICOM, an organisation of 15 Caribbean nations and dependencies, according to the office of Albanian Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli.
Pristina-based media reported on Thursday (September 2nd) that Topalli has received a letter from her counterpart in Grenada, George McGuire, saying that a decision on Kosovo's independence from all 15 countries is expected soon.
Topalli's office credits continuous lobbying in Grenada after Pristina declared independence in 2008.
Kosovo Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni declined to comment on the matter, but expressed confidence that recognitions will come soon.
Kosovo has been recognised by 69 countries so far.

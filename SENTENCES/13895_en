SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament may discuss a no confidence motion this week against the government filed by the opposition group, VMRO-Narodna.
Last week, the party managed to obtain the signatures of 20 parliament members required to support the motion -- including members of another opposition formation, VMRO-DPMNE, and four independent deputies.
The signatures will be submitted on Monday (19 September) for consideration.
In other news, parliament endorsed a new law on referendum Friday.
The legislation, passed in the absence of the opposition, envisions restrictions regarding the organisation of referenda on fundamental issues such as defence, military and emergency situations, amnesty and the budget.

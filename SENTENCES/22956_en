BELGRADE, Serbia -- After analysing the recently signed Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU, the Serbian Democratic Party (DSS) concluded on Wednesday (June 4th) that it is legally invalid. 
"According to the Vienna Convention, at the moment of ratification in the Serbian parliament, the contractual parties should absolutely agree on the text of the agreement. 
Furthermore, in order for the SAA to be ratified, the text of the agreement should fully comply with the Serbian Constitution. 
These are clear and simple conditions," DSS experts said. 
The party called for further talks with the EU to clarify purported ambiguities.

NEW YORK, United States -- Talks on the final status of Kosovo could start during the second half of this year, UNMIK Chief Soren Jessen-Petersen told the UN Security Council on Thursday (24 February).
He warned that delaying the negotiations could prevent the region from moving toward EU membership.
The province has made progress in meeting the international set of benchmarks, but "much more has to be done to reassure the minorities that they have a future in Kosovo," Jessen-Petersen said.
He added that more action was needed "to guarantee freedom of movement for the minorities and to speed up the process of returns of displaced people.'' He voiced disappointment with the refusal of Serbs to join the political process in Kosovo.
A report submitted to the Council last week by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said the unwillingness of Kosovo Serbs to participate in the process is one of the major reasons talks are stalled.
Annan also blamed the Belgrade government for not encouraging Serbs in the province to get more involved in the process of institution building.

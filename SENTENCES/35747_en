PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- US General James Jones, the top NATO commander, said Sunday (1 February) that KFOR provides a test of the Alliance's new mission.
"NATO has signaled that it desires to be much more flexible and have a greater role on a global basis ...
It has been wonderful to see this transition occur right here in Kosovo", he said at the end of a two-day visit to the Serbian province.
Jones said that future NATO missions would be smaller in terms of numbers, but more efficient.
In other news, a KFOR spokesman insisted Sunday that NATO has no knowledge of Serbian spies in Kosovo, as claimed by Colonel Momir Stojanovic, the head of Serbia-Montenegro's Military Security Agency.

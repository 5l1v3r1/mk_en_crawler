ATHENS, Greece -- The government will not hesitate to take further steps if necessary to put its economy in order, Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said in an interview with the Athens-based daily To Vima on Sunday (January 17th).
"If there are omissions, we will take additional measures," he said, two days after Athens submitted a plan to the European Commission aimed at helping the country emerge from its grave economic crisis.
The programmes, which market experts describe as ambitious, are being discussed in Brussels on Monday by finance ministers of the 16 eurozone members.
"Markets are cautious and the climate is not positive," Papaconstantinou said, noting that while many countries are experiencing similar problems in their public finances, none has such a serious crisis in confidence.

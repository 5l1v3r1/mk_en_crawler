SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament finally elected members Thursday (April 5th) of a commission that will oversee the opening of the former Communist regime's State Security files.
The election came after a three-month delay, due to political wrangling between the ruling coalition and the right-wing opposition.
The commission's first task would likely be to check the backgrounds of candidates for members of the European Parliament.
In other news, two prosecutors were detained for suspected bribery Wednesday.
Investigators say Varna regional prosecutor Georgi Manasiev offered a bribe of 1,500 euros to Supreme Cassation Prosecution member Boyan Toshev -- who accepted it in exchange for boosting Manasiev's career.

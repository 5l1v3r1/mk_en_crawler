ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in Diyarbakir began hearings Monday (October 18th) in the case of more than 150 Kurds charged with membership in a wing of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
About 100 of the suspects were escorted to the court house, where hundreds of PKK supporters had gathered.
European human rights activists and lawyers are in Diyarbakir to monitor the case.
There are about a dozen elected mayors, including Diyarbakir's popular Osman Baydemir, among those charged.

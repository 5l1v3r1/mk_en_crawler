BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The presidents of Serbia and Republika Srpska (RS), Boris Tadic and Dragan Cavic, urged closer co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal on Monday (27 September). 
Tadic was quoted as saying that all defendants must appear before the international court. 
Cavic warned that time for RS was running out and the Bosnian Serb entity faced great dangers if it did not keep its commitments to the tribunal. 
He also met with Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica. 
The two leaders voiced opposition to calls for amendments to the Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Constitution. 
Sulejman Tihic, the current chairman of BiH's rotating presidency, recently told the UN that he favours amending the constitution to bring the country's three ethnic groups closer together.
In other news, Principal Deputy High Representative Donald Hays said BiH and its authorities must quadruple the pace of reforms, if the country wants to enter the EU before the end of this decade. 
His comment came during a conference in Neum.

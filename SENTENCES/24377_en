SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government on Thursday (April 9th) officially declared an emergency situation in the capital over the lack of adequate waste removal.
The cabinet says it is now a matter of national security, according to a report by the ministries of health, regional development and environment.
It concludes that by its inability to end the problem, the Sofia City Council has posed a serious threat to public health and the environment.
Streets have lain under mounds of rubbish for several weeks since the city council cancelled an agreement with the trash-hauling company.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- During an interview with local radio Saturday (22 May), Finance Minister Milen Velchev promised transparency in the country's accession negotiations with the EU.
Repeating a position expressed by Minister for EU Affairs Meglena Kuneva last week, Velchev said that his ministry would publish on its Web site full information about activities or plans related to the accession process.
On Friday, the opposition accused the government of restricting parliament's access to EU-related information.
In other news, Hristo Hristov, 26, a member of a Bulgarian expedition to Mt Everest, was found dead Monday, several days after he went missing.
He reportedly reached the peak on 20 May, but contact was lost as he made his way back down.

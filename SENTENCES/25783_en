ROME, Italy -- Police in the Italian city of Modena smashed an Albanian drug trafficking ring Monday (October 19th), arresting eight people, including the suspected gang leaders.
The ring controlled a drug distribution network in the Emilia Romagna region in northern Italy.
According to media reports, the police operation began in 2007.
Elsewhere, Scottish authorities have arrested 13 Albanian citizens who had made it to Glasgow, while attempting to reach England illegally.
Local media reported on Monday that the immigrants used fake passports to travel from Italy and Greece.
They say they paid between 8,000 and 10,000 euros to get to England.

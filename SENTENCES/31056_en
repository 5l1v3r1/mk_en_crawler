PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The State Prosecutor's Office has received 133 claims related to irregularities in the December 12th election process, media reported on Wednesday (January 5th). 
This election process has been described by some candidates and analysts as the worst ever organised in Kosovo, despite claims by some that the process was democratic and successful. 
In some polling stations, turnout was 150%, indicative of likely other fraudulent practices. 
Most of the claims submitted to prosecutors came from Pristina, followed by Prizren and Mitrovica.
Also Wednesday, three days of campaigning began in three municipalities were irregularities prompted officials to schedule a revote. 
That will be held on Sunday.

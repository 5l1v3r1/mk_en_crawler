STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament (EP) adopted on Thursday (15 December) reports on progress made by Romania and Bulgaria towards EU accession. 
The report on Romania focused on the rights of the Hungarian minority and international adoptions. 
In the Bulgarian report, the EP made further recommendations on judicial reforms and reproached the country for the slow integration of national minorities, such as the Romas, and for insufficient progress in fighting organised crime. 
The EP members also rejected a proposal by EP rapporteur for Bulgaria Geoffrey van Orden, who sought a more flexible approach regarding the closure of older units at the Kozloduy nuclear plant.

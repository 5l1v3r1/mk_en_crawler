SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Supreme Court of Appeals asked the Constitutional Court Thursday (16 June) about reforming the judiciary. 
In particular, the court inquired about which reforms require constitutional changes, which require a grand assembly, and which need only an ordinary assembly for completion. 
The European Commission has insisted that judicial reforms be accelerated and has threatened to activate a safety clause, delaying EU membership for up to a year, if reforms are not completed.

WASHINGTON, United States -- Nicholas Burns, US undersecretary of state, told a Senate hearing on Friday (27 January) that the resolution of Kosovo's final status must be sought through compromise.
The ethnic Albanians, he said, must prove that they are worthy of independence by assuring the Serbian minority that it has a future in Kosovo.
Serbian religious and historic sites must be respected, he added.
Burns said the US administration is not championing independence or autonomy for Kosovo.
He also noted that Belgrade cannot join NATO until the territorial dispute is resolved.
In other news, German Ambassador to Belgrade Andreas Cobel warned on Saturday that time is running out for Serbia regarding the implementation of obligations towards the UN war crimes tribunal.
Cobel was participating in Belgrade conference on the 1992 war crimes in Foca, in neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania respects religious freedoms, though some questions remain about the return of church property seized by the state during communist rule, according to UN Special Rapporteur for Religious Freedoms Abdel Fattah Amar.
He noted that these were preliminary findings.
While some "friction and tension" has occurred between various groups and communities, Amar said, it involved individual cases and did not represent trends.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Rasim Ljajic, the Serbian minister in charge of co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, revealed on Saturday (17 June) that fugitive Ratko Mladic hid in Serbia between 1997 and 2005. 
The security services, he said, have now established the exact locations where the general stayed during this period, contradicting government claims that Mladic had likely escaped across the border. 
Ljajic says Serbian authorities now are unaware of Mladic's whereabouts.
Separately, President Boris Tadic said Serbia has a vital interest in arresting Mladic, as his continued freedom hampers the country's EU integration process. 
War crimes suspects must not be allowed to walk free, he added.

TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha announced on Friday (October 9th) that Tirana has officially requested that the remains of Mother Teresa be returned from Calcutta, India and buried in Albania by the 100th anniversary of her birth in August 2010. 
Mother Teresa, who held Indian citizenship, was born to an ethnic Albanian family in Skopje. 
Macedonia and Albania have been leading bitter disputes about her national identity. 
She fled to India in 1929 to dedicate her life to charity, and died in Calcutta in 1997.
Also Friday, Berisha said that his country wants to repatriate the remains of the late King Ahmet Zog, who reigned from 1928 to 1939, from France.

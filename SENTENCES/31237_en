ANKARA, Turkey -- A powerful blast at a construction machinery factory in Ankara left at least three people dead on Thursday (February 3rd), injuring about 30 others, local and international media reports said. 
Several people are said to have been trapped beneath debris, as the force of the blast collapsed two floors of the building. 
The cause is under investigation, but authorities were quoted as saying oxygen tanks at the plant may have exploded.

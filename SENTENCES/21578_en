BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Two Bosnian Serbs were sentenced to prison for the 1992 murders of four Muslims, the district court in Banja Luka announced on Thursday (November 27th). 
Mile Zgonjanin was sentenced to four years and Nikica Zgonjanin got three years. 
The victims, including two women, were neighbours of the pair in the north-western town of Novi Grad. 
According to the indictment, the two Serbs tied down their victims, splashed gasoline on them and set them on fire, before shooting them dead.

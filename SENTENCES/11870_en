ZAGREB, Croatia -- The ruling party and opposition announced on Tuesday (18 January) that they are joining forces in accession talks with the EU.
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and opposition leader Ivica Racan said co-operation is essential to achieving membership in the Union, which they described as Croatia's chief goal.
On Wednesday, parliament is to adopt a joint statement by lawmakers and the government as well as a document containing the principles Croatia would observe in the course of the accession process.
The assembly will also appoint a 19-member commission to monitor negotiations with the EU.
In other news Tuesday, Interior Minister Marijan Mlinaric said his ministry is working hard to locate fugitive retired General Ante Gotovina, one of the UN war crimes tribunal's top indictees.
His handover to the tribunal is a chief condition for starting accession talks in March.

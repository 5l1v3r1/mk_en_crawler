SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President-elect Branko Crvenkovski left his prime ministerial post on Tuesday (4 May), thanking cabinet ministers for their efforts on behalf of the country. 
Crvenkovski is expected to assume his presidential duties on 10 May, provided the Supreme Court rules on complaints of election fraud by the main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE. 
Local media reports suggest Interior Minister Harry Kostov will assume the post of prime minister.

DAVOS, Switzerland -- Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou insisted on Thursday (January 27th) that his country will not default on its debt payment obligations.
Speaking to participants at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he also ruled out any debt restructuring, but said he expects that the repayment period for the 110 billion-euro bailout package from the EU and IMF will be extended, and its interest rate cut.
Papandreou told business leaders that he hopes his country would return to capital markets this year, after the austerity measures undertaken by his government.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Possible dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade enjoys public support, according to a survey released on Tuesday (September 14th).
Around 60% of respondents consider the talks acceptable, according to the NGO Foreign Policy Club.
The public favours mediated talks and would prefer to see the United States and the EU share this role.
Kosovo Albanians and Serbs agree that the issue of missing persons, freedom of movement, northern Kosovo and the situation of Albanians in Serbia should be covered.
They also agree that this process should not include the status issue or division, rather, should stick to the guidelines of former envoy Martti Ahtisaari's package.
The poll also found that the best rated leader in Kosovo is Vetevendosje (Self-Determination) Movement's Albin Kurti.
As for President Fatmir Sejdiu's view of potential talks, he drew a red line Tuesday regarding Kosovo borders but did not rule out talks on technical issues and issues of public interest.

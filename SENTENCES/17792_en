PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- In an interview for the Russian media on Thursday (March 22nd), NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said resolving Kosovo's status cannot serve as a precedent for South Ossetia, Abkhazia or any other region that is considering independence.
De Hoop Scheffer was responding to a recent warning by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who suggests granting Kosovo independence --via an internationally-imposed solution -- would set a dangerous precedent in the other volatile European regions.
After arriving from New York on Thursday, Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu told local media that he met with Russia's Ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, and left with the impression that Russia is not against independence.
"They just see the need for further talks on this issue, which was unacceptable," Sejdiu added.

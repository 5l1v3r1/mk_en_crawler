ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament approved four draft laws on NATO expansion Wednesday (5 November). 
The drafts concern the inclusion of Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Slovakia in the North Atlantic Treaty and were approved with the support of both the ruling Justice and Development Party and the opposition Republican People's Party. 
Members of parliament described NATO's eastward expansion as a positive development, prompted, some argue, by the threat of terrorism.

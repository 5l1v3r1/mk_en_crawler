SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Milk producers on Thursday (August 14th) temporarily suspended protests after the agriculture ministry promised to pay -- in part -- their long-delayed milk subsidies. 
Farmers across the country have held protests for weeks demanding a year-round subsidy for the fresh milk they produce. 
Milk producers have been suffering losses since the European Commission decided to block around 800m euros in aid to Bulgaria over suspected fraud and mismanagement of funds by local authorities.

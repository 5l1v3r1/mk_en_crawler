BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader was in Brussels Monday (30 January) for meetings with NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer and members of the North Atlantic Council at NATO HQ. 
Sanader told reporters in Zagreb that he would use the opportunity to lobby again for Croatia's speedy NATO accession.
In other news, a new poll suggests the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) is once again the most popular party in Croatia. 
Support for HDZ fell in December after the arrest and extradition to The Hague of war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina. 
The new poll by the Puls agency finds 25 per cent of the public support HDZ, compared to 22 per cent for the main opposition Social Democratic Party. 
President Stipe Mesic remains the most popular politician.

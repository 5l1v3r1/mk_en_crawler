PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Some members of parliament say they will oppose the law on official holidays unless key dates from Albanian history are included.
The government adopted the bill on Monday (May 19th) and sent it to parliament for approval.
It lists 11 official holidays, but excludes November 28th, Albania's Independence Day, June 12th, Liberation Day, and March 5th, the Day of Martyrs.
The bill passed the first vote on Tuesday, but opposition deputies, backed by some members of the ruling coalition, warned that they would not vote for it at the second reading.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci says the bill is in line with the comprehensive proposal for Kosovo's final status framed by former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari.
In other news Tuesday, President Fatmir Sejdiu met with head of the OSCE mission in Kosovo Tim Guldimann.
They discussed new forms of co-operation between Kosovo's institutions and the OSCE, especially after June 15th, when the Constitution enters into force.
Sejdiu has called on UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to make a decision soon on transferring responsibilities to local institutions.

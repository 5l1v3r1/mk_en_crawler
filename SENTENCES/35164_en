SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Polls opened across Macedonia on Wednesday (28 April) for the second round of presidential elections. 
Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski of the ruling Social Democrats and Sasko Kedev of the opposition VMRO-DPMNE are running for the post, which became vacant when Boris Trajkovski died in a February plane crash. 
Polls give Crvenkovski a significant lead. 
He enjoys the support of the Democratic Union for Integration, the country's most influential ethnic Albanian party and a member of the governing coalition. 
Observers, however, are concerned about the possibility that low turnout could invalidate the results and create a vacuum in the government. 
By law, at least 50 per cent of the country's 1.7 million voters must cast ballots for the election results to stand. 
About 55 per cent took part in the first round on 14 April.

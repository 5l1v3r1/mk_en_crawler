BUCHAREST, Romania -- The European Commission (EC) announced on Tuesday (2 September) that it was launching an investigation to determine how EU contracts for 150,000 euros had been given to family members of Romanian European Integration Minister Hildegard Puwak. 
The EU's Leonardo da Vinci Centre financed four projects proposed by the minister's husband and son. 
Puwak initially denied the charges, claiming that the funding had been awarded prior to her appointment in December 2000. 
It was discovered, however, that family members applied for funding for two of the projects in 2001. 
She says she welcomes the decision to send EC auditors to clarify the situation. 
The ruling Social Democrat Party has expressed full support for Puwak.

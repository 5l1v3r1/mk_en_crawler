ANKARA, Turkey -- The Higher Election Board on Wednesday (11 December) established some of the criteria for special elections in the province of Siirt, where results from last month were cancelled due to voter irregularities. 
The repeat vote gives ruling party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan a chance to enter parliament and become prime minister if parliament amends the constitution by Sunday, as expected. 
A conviction disqualified him from seeking office in November. 
Siirt's special election will be held on 9 February.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Wrapping up a two-day meeting in Sarajevo on Friday (3 December), the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) steering board's political directors again warned that BiH's continued failure to co-operate with The Hague tribunal is blocking the country's reform agenda. 
The PIC board, which heard reports by UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte and BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic, repeated that unsatisfactory co-operation by Republika Srpska (RS) particularly jeopardised BiH's bid for integration in Euro-Atlantic structures. 
Afterwards, High Representative Paddy Ashdown issued a statement saying he is considering "firm measures" regarding RS's non-co-operation.

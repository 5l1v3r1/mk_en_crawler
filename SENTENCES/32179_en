ANTALYA, Turkey -- An international conference on the cross-border fight against drug smuggling opened in the seaside resort of Antalya on Monday (11 November).
The chairman of Turkey's Anti-Smuggling and Organised Crimes department, Coskun Hayal, admitted that the country faces a serious problem with illegal drug traffic, particularly with synthetic drugs.
He noted that Turkey's geographic location exposes it to double pressure by traffickers from the Middle East and southwestern Asia and the synthetic drug producers from Europe, especially Russia.

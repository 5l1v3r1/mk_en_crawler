BELGRADE, Serbia -- A court in Belgrade will hand down verdicts on January 25th against 14 suspects charged in the brutal beating death of French soccer fan Brice Taton, media reported on Tuesday (January 18th).
As the trial wrapped up Tuesday, all of the defendants reiterated their innocence and asked the court to acquit them.
Prosecutors, on the other hand, claimed they proved the charges and insisted that the defendants be punished.
Taton, 28, was attacked by fans of the Partizan team in downtown Belgrade on September 17th 2009.
He died about two weeks later.

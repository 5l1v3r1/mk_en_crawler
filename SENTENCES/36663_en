BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian authorities are trying to find out what happened to about 600 monkeys brought into the country two years ago, Reuters reported Friday (30 April). 
A total of 1,000 apes were imported from Tanzania, according to Serbia's Statistical Office. 
Local pharmaceutical firm Torlak Institute purchased 400 monkeys to test polio vaccines, but the fate of the other animals is a mystery.

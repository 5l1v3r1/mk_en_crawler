SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Police in BiH arrested on Tuesday (October 14th) four Bosnian Serbs suspected of committing crimes against humanity in 1992.
Officers of the Agency for Investigation and Protection arrested Milorad Skrbic, Milorad Radakovic, Gordan Djuric and Ljubisa Cetic in the municipalities of Prijedor and Sanski Most in a co-ordinated operation.
The four allegedly executed more than 200 Bosnian Muslims and Croats on Vlasic Mountain in August 1992.
In other news, two mass graves containing the remains of murdered Roma from Skelane and Srebrenica have turned up in a Catholic cemetery in the village of Bosanski Dubocac, local media reported.
Nijaz Causevic Medo, a former high-ranking Croatian Army officer, says a number of Croatian generals ordered the killings.
He has offered to testify before a BiH court in exchange for protection.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The opposition Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) has collected 100,000 signatures from citizens demanding that the sale of Telekom Srbija be suspended.
The petition was handed over to Minister of Culture, Media and Information Society Predrag Markovic on Wednesday (March 16th).
Telecom sector trade unions plan to protest the ongoing privatisation Saturday.
They want the sale postponed due to the very low global share prices.
The government is accepting bids for a 51% stake in the telecom through Monday.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Monday (31 January) that full and unconditional co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal is the main condition for a positive Feasibility Study for Serbia-Montenegro. 
He added that such co-operation must be demonstrated by the end of March. 
According to Rehn, the Feasibility Study is nearly complete, but will not advance further until the co-operation issue is resolved. 
Separately, Serbia-Montenegrin President Svetozar Marovic suggested Monday that Montenegro's plans to hold a referendum on independence are tied to Serbia's lack of co-operation with the tribunal.

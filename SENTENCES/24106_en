BELGRADE, Serbia -- An investigating judge at Belgrade district court questioned four police officers Friday (March 13th) on suspicion they committed war crimes against civilians and prisoners of war during the 1998-99 conflict in Kosovo. 
The judge ordered the suspects remain in custody for up to a month. 
Radoslav Mitrovic, the commander of the unit in which the four served during the conflict, is on trial for war crimes at the same court in Belgrade. 
He is believed to have ordered the murder of 48 Albanian civilians in southern Kosovo in 1999.

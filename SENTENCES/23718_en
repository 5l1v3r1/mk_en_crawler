ZAGREB, Croatia -- At least six people were killed and more than 40 were injured when a passenger train traveling from Zagreb to Split derailed at around noon Friday (July 24th). 
Complicating the rescue effort is the location of the crash; the area is making access difficult. 
It was unclear how many people were aboard the train.

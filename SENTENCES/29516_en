BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government has reached an agreement with the IMF to unfreeze public wages and pensions, as of January. 
Public wages would be raised three times during 2011, Finance Minister Diana Dragutinovic confirmed on Tuesday (August 31st) after an official visit by an IMF team making the fifth review of Serbia's 2.9 billion-euro stand-by agreement. 
The first increase will be in January, when public salaries will be indexed to the six-month inflation or a little less than 3%. 
In April, they will be raised by the three-month inflation and half of the GDP growth at the time. 
In October, public wages will again be adjusted to the six-month inflation. 
Meanwhile, parliament must adopt the law on fiscal responsibility by September 20th, which would put strict limits on government spending. 
Serbia has frozen public wages and pensions for the last two years due to commitments to the IMF. 
However, some members of the government have been calling for hikes, in light of the improved budget performance.

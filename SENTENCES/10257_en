BUCHAREST, Romania -- A survey conducted by the CURS agency suggests a narrowing gap between Romania's ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the National Liberal Party-Democratic Party (PNL-PD) opposition alliance, ahead of the 28 November general elections. 
The survey results, presented Tuesday (26 October), indicate that if the elections were held now, PSD and its coalition with the Humanist Party would win 41 per cent of the vote, while PNL-PD would get 38 per cent, followed by the nationalist Greater Romania Party with 11 per cent and the ethnic Hungarian minority party UDMR with 5 per cent. 
As many as 35 per cent of the respondents describe themselves as undecided.

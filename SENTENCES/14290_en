STRASBOURG, France -- The European Court of Human Rights on Thursday (10 November) upheld Turkey's ban on wearing headscarves in educational institutions.
A female student had sued her country to get the ban revoked.
Voting 16-1, the judges said the restriction was rightfully imposed "to preserve the secular character of educational institutions" and met the "legitimate aims of protecting the rights and freedoms of others and maintaining public order".
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul objected to the ruling, saying the country cannot move forward with such bans in place.
Also Thursday, Gul said that the government's perception of the most recent EU progress report on Turkey is positive.
He noted that the authors had used "careful" language in the report, an improvement over previous reports.
This one urged Turkey to speed up implementation of reforms and to pay more attention to human rights issues and minority rights.

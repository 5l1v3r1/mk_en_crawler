TIRANA, Albania -- USAID Administrator and Director of US Foreign Assistance Henrietta Fore urged the Albanian government Monday (May 19th) to commit more to completing reforms and fighting corruption.
In light of elections next year and the recent invitation to NATO membership, "it is important that the government shows its commitment to implement election reform and judicial reforms," said Fore.
"Albania should work hard combating corruption, applying tough measures for criminals through independent and un-politicised trials," she added.
Separately Monday, former Deputy Transport Minister Nikolin Jaka and six other officials were convicted of corruption charges, stemming from the illegal fixing of road project tenders.
Jaka was arrested in September following a lengthy investigation.

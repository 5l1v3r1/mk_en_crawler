BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serb President Dragan Cavic tapped outgoing Bosnian Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic to form the new Republika Srpska government. 
Cavic intervened Saturday (7 December) after parties failed to agree on a candidate. 
Mikerevic, a 47-year-old economist, is a member of the moderate Party of Democratic Progress and a former minister of European affairs. 
He will have 40 days to propose a cabinet, which by law must consist of eight Serbs, five Muslims and three Croats.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serbs headed to the polls on Sunday (December 9th) in early presidential elections called after late President Milan Jelic died of a heart attack on September 30th.
Ten candidates will be competing in the elections, but polls show that Union of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) and the Socialist Party candidate Rajko Kuzmanovic will likely be the winner.

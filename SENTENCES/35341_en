BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- At an emergency session Tuesday (20 April), Republika Srpska's (RS) government appointed Milan Bogdanic as head of the commission investigating the July 1995 massacre in Srebrenica. 
Bogdanic, a member of the commission, replaces Marko Arsovic, who resigned from the position following sharp criticism from the international community. 
Late last week, High Representative Paddy Ashdown imposed sanctions on RS. 
He cited the inefficiency of the commission, resulting from constant obstruction by senior RS government officials.

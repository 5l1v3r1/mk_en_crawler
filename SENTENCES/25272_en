BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Emil Boc reiterated on Saturday (March 27th) that teachers will not receive more than a 17% salary hike due to budgetary constraints.
The issue started in 2008, when the previous government, led by the National Liberal Party, decided on the 17% hike.
But parliament adopted a change to the law -- initiated by President Traian Basescu, and supported by the now ruling Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) -- boosting that raise to 50%.
When elections put the PDL in power, it reneged on the 50% hike, due to the economy, and amended the legislation.
Unions representing teachers will not drop the issue and now threaten a general strike, which could make problems this year for graduations.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A Turkish and a Greek F-16 collided while shadowing each other in disputed airspace on Tuesday (23 May).
The accident occurred when two Greek aircraft were scrambled to intercept two Turkish planes over the Aegean.
The Turkish pilot was picked up by a commercial ship and was taken by helicopter to his home base.
A search was continuing for the Greek flier.
Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis and her Turkish counterpart, Abdullah Gul, were quick to say that the incident should not affect bilateral relations.
Army chiefs from the two countries agreed to establish a direct phone line between the respective Aegean Sea air bases to prevent future risky interceptions.
Greek and Turkish warplanes often shadow each other over the Aegean.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A senior EULEX official was targeted while driving in Pristina on Tuesday (November 23rd), his back window broken, but apparently not by a bullet. 
The official, identified by local TV Kohavision as EULEX Police Head of Executive Department James Albrecht, was not injured. 
EULEX condemned the attack, describing it as deliberate, and sealed off the area for an investigation.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is expected to begin meetings with the opposition on Monday (March 22nd) to introduce details of its proposed constitutional reform package. 
The meetings will include parties in parliament first, and then extend to opposition parties outside parliament. 
The draft constitutional amendments cover the structure of the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors, the banning of political parties, and trials of military personnel in civilian courts, among others. 
The opposition -- including the Republican People's Party and Nationalist Movement Party -- remain firmly against the amendments. 
This has forced the AKP to look to a third opposition party, the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party, for possible support. 
In the end, the constitutional amendments will likely be put to a referendum.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Parliamentary House of Peoples (HoP) confirmed the appointment of Borislav Paravac as the Serb member of the tripartite presidency on Thursday (10 April).
His nomination was approved by the lower chamber, the House of Representatives, on Wednesday.
Paravac, nominated by the nationalist Serb Democratic Party, will fill the post left vacant by last week's resignation of Mirko Sarovic, over the so-called Orao affair.
In other news, BiH Council of Ministers Chairman Adnan Terzic addressed a joint session of parliament Thursday, telling lawmakers that the country has made full membership in the EU by 2009 a strategic goal.
He added that by October, BiH could fulfil all prerequisites for drafting a feasibility study leading to talks on a Stabilisation and Accession Agreement with the EU.

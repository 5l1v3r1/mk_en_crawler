SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said on Tuesday (August 25th) that a long-term solution to the refugees' return issue requires a joint effort by Bosnian authorities and the international community.
Guterres said a regional approach is necessary, explaining this is the reason for his visit to the Balkans.
In Sarajevo, he met with members of the tripartite presidency, prime ministers of the two entities, as well as with BiH Minister for Human Rights and Refugees Safet Halilovic.
He told Guterres that for the past two years, his ministry and other relevant institutions have earmarked 50m euros for the reconstruction and electrification of the refugees' settlement.
He added that about ten times that amount is needed to complete a refugee return project by 2014 and that the government is considering credit arrangements to provide the funding.
The 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict forced an estimated 2.2 million from their homes.
Just over half have returned so far, while 117,000 remain displaced within the country.

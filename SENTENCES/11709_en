VIENNA, Austria -- UN Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte said Thursday (19 May) that prosecutors will oppose granting provisional release to former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj. 
She would not explain the decision, but noted that witnesses had been intimidated in the province in the past.
In other news, del Ponte rejected rumours that one of the UN war crimes tribunal's top indictees, Radovan Karadzic, had been spotted having lunch with his wife in Republika Srpska. 
Del Ponte said most reports of Karadzic sightings are false alarms. 
The chief prosecutor also told reporters that Croatian General Ante Gotovina would be arrested soon if Zagreb is truly committed to bringing him to justice. 
Del Ponte explained that the fugitive would be captured if the Croatian authorities dismantle his powerful support network.
Also Thursday, an international court in Kosovo sentenced two ethnic Albanians for the murder of a Serb man during rioting in March. 
One defendant received a 16-year sentence and the other received 11 years. 
The panel of international judges also sentenced six others to lesser terms for rioting.

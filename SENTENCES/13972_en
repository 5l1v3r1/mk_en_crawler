NEW YORK, United States -- In his final report to the UN Security Council, outgoing High Representative Paddy Ashdown praised the "magnificent progress" Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) has made in moving towards European integration in the past 12 months. 
Sarajevo, he said, has moved decisively "to the marathon task of establishing good governance and the achievement of European standards". 
Ashdown cautioned, however, that the actual implementation of the reforms is just beginning.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Former Macedonian Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski has been charged with the murder of six Pakistanis and an Indian during a special police operation near Skopje in 2002, the Pula County Prosecutor's Office announced Saturday (26 February).
Together with three senior Macedonian officials and an external associate, Boskovski is accused of staging the killings and presenting them as a police action against international terrorism.
An investigation later revealed the victims were economic migrants.
Boskovski, who holds dual Croatian and Macedonian citizenship, was apprehended by Croatian authorities last September on an international arrest warrant.

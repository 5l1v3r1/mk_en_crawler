TIRANA, Albania -- Former Foreign Minister Ilir Meta said he would support either former President Rexhep Meidani or Tirana Mayor Edi Rama as head of the Socialist Party.
According to an article Saturday (15 November) in the Albanian paper <I>Shekulli</I>, Meta said the party needs Meidani, because he lacks any unhealthy ambitions to power.
But he also spoke highly of Rama, describing him as "an immediate, even long-term solution to the crisis in the party".
The new head will be elected at the party congress next month.

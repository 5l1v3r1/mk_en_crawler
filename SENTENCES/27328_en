THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Hearings on the legality of Kosovo's declaration of independence began on Tuesday (December 1st) at The Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ). 
Debate will continue until December 11th. 
Nearly 30 UN member-states have asked to make oral statements in the case, including the US, Russia and China. 
Serbia and Kosovo both present their arguments Tuesday. 
There is no deadline for the court to announce its ruling. 
In all, 63 countries -- including 22 EU member states -- have recognised Kosovo since it declared independence from Serbia in February 2008.

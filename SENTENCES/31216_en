TIRANA, Albania -- The Court of Appeals on Wednesday (March 2nd) ordered the release of three members of the National Guard after no substantial facts were found to hold them responsible for events in the violent January 21st protest.
The officers spent three weeks in detention after initial reports suggested they were involved in the killing of four demonstrators during the opposition rally against the government.
The opposition Socialist Party slammed Wednesday's court decision as hasty and accused the government of exerting pressure on the judiciary.
A fourth National Guard official, Major Agim Llupo, remains under arrest, for allegedly exceeding his authority, which led to the death of one protestor.

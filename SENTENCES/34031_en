TIRANA, Albania -- Deputy Foreign Minister Luan Hajdaraga will assume the role of foreign minister until September, Prime Minister Fatos Nano announced on Tuesday (29 July).
Parliament rejected Nano's nominee for the post, Marko Bello, on Monday.
The former foreign minister, Ilir Meta, resigned last week amid tensions within the ruling Socialist Party and because of personal conflicts with Nano.
Despite the rejection of his nominee, Nano indicated there would be no changes in the government's foreign policy.

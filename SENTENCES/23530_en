PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Unknown persons, possibly police officers, robbed the police evidence room in Pristina on Saturday (April 25th), said spokesperson Arber Beka. 
Much of the evidence had come from work by the anti-drug unit, including items related to organised crime cases. 
The evidence room sits behind police headquarters in Pristina.
In other news, Interior Minister Zenun Pajaziti said on Sunday that the government is not looking for a police solution to problems in northern Kosovo. 
He said the government was sending messages calling for co-existence to the north and that security measures undertaken by the Kosovo police are the last word to keep the situation in check. 
Pajaziti added that the EULEX presence should make Serb police officers, who refuse to serve in Kosovo institutions, return to their jobs.
Meanwhile, EU police used tear gas Monday to disperse about 100 Serbs protesting the return of Albanian refugees in the tense northern part of the country, a spokesman said. 
Hundreds of Kosovo Serbs have staged rallies in recent days against rebuilding seven destroyed houses belonging to Albanian returnees near Mitrovica.

ATHENS, Greece -- Thousands of farmers blocked border crossings and several major highways for the eighth consecutive day on Monday (January 26th), causing traffic chaos across the country.
They are protesting the government's farming policy and are demanding higher subsidies for agriculture, better pensions, guaranteed minimum prices for their products, a reduction of the refundable VAT and lower fuel prices.
Tractors are again blocking the Evzoni and Doirani crossings at the Greek-Macedonian border, as well as the borders with Bulgaria and Turkey.
Freight traffic across Greece's borders is paralysed, and only emergency medical supplies can pass.
Farmers also plan to block the bridge connecting the Peloponnese peninsula and Corinth.
The Association of Northern Greek Industries urged the government to resolve the problem quickly, saying the protests are hurting the economy.
On Sunday, the government invited farmers' trade unions to talks.
Agriculture Minister Sotiris Hatzigakis is scheduled to meet with representatives later Monday to discuss their demands.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The young country's future is bright and sooner or later it will be part of the EU, former UN Deputy Special Envoy Albert Rohan said on Tuesday (November 24th) during a visit to Kosovo. 
At the same time, he noted, UN membership will depend on Belgrade. 
"Kosovo will become a member of the UN when Serbia is ready to recognise Kosovo's independence and hence, withdraws its resistance at the UN. 
This is very simple," Rohan said.
In a speech in parliament, he assured lawmakers that Kosovo's independence is an irreversible fact, which eventually must be accepted by Serbia and the five EU member states that have not yet recognised it. 
He stressed that Kosovo should build democratic institutions, ensure the rule of law, guarantee media independence and harmonise its laws with the aquis in order to achieve EU membership.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal decided on Tuesday (13 December) not to split Slobodan Milosevic's trial into two separate proceedings. 
The judges had contemplated issuing a separate verdict on the defendant's role in the Kosovo proceedings. 
Prosecutors and Milosevic argued against the idea.
In a separate ruling, the court also rejected the defendant's demand for more time to present his case. 
The judges said Milosevic is deliberately focusing his entire defence on Kosovo, making little mention of the conflicts in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

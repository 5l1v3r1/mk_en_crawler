BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission voiced its strong disappointment Friday (16 December) with Turkey's failure to drop criminal charges against writer Orhan Pamuk.
Last week, a Turkish court decided to delay the proceedings against Pamuk, who is being tried on charges of "insulting" Turkish identity in comments to a Swiss newspaper.
Pamuk told the paper that mass killings of Armenians took place in 1915, and that as many as 30,000 Kurds have died in separatist clashes with security forces.
On Saturday, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan rejected the criticism coming from Brussels, accusing the bloc of trying to exert pressure on the Turkish judiciary.

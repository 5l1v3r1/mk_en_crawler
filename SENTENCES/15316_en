SKOPJE, Macedonia -- After two days of heated debate, the Macedonian Parliament on Saturday (26 August) approved the new government proposed by Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski. 
Gruevski said the cabinet's priorities will be improving the living standard and employment, generating annual economic growth, intensifying the fight against corruption, strengthening democratic institutions and improving inter-ethnic relations. 
Gruevski said under this government, Macedonia will be in line for NATO entry in 2008 and EU accession in 2010.
The two opposition ethnic Albanian parties -- Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) and Party of Democratic Prosperity (PDP) -- did not attend the session in protest for not being invited into the ruling coalition. 
On Friday, about 3,000 DUI supporters gathered in front of the assembly in Skopje to protest the partyâs exclusion from the new government.

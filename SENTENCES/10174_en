ATHENS, Greece -- Justice Minister Anastasios Papaligouras said Monday (27 September) the government had agreed in principle to fund the construction of a prison in Albania. 
The penitentiary is to house Albanian citizens serving long-term sentences in Greece. 
The move is aimed at solving the problem with overcrowded Greek prisons, where of the over 8,500 inmates, an estimated 1,800 are Albanians. 
Greece hopes to sign similar accords with Romania, Bulgaria and Serbia.

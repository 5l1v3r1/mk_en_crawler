THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal decided on Wednesday (August 22nd) not to allow retired Croatian General Ante Gotovina's provisional release, citing his fugitive status for four years and his potential for another escape. 
Hague prosecutors had argued against the release, despite guarantees from the Croatian government, Zadar's Archbishop Ivan Prenda, as well as from Gotovina himself. 
His lawyers say they will appeal the decision, with another ruling expected by the end of September.

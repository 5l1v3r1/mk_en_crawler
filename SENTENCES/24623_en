TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament on Wednesday (March 4th) dismissed Tourism, Culture, Youth and Sports Ylli Pango after a local TV station broadcast a video showing Pango asking for sexual favours from two young women applying for a job in his ministry. 
The video showed Pango scheduling private meetings with the two applicants. 
"The material shown in the media is unacceptable," the government said in a statement. 
Adrian Turku, head of the Elbasan prefecture, will replace Pango.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The authorities said Friday (February 2nd) that they have opened a probe regarding video footage that shows 17-year-old Ogun Samast, the suspected killer of the Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink, posing with police officers and the Turkish flag.
The video was first shown on a private TV channel, TGRT, and then broadcast on other channels.
It was apparently filmed after Samast's arrest.
Local media have blasted what they say is evidence that the assassin was being treated like a hero.

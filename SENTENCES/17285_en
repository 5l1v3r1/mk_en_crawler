CANNES, France -- Romanian director Cristian Mungiu won the Cannes Film Festival's top prize Sunday (May 27th) with "Four Months, Three Weeks and Two Days", the story of a student who helps a friend undergo an illegal abortion in communist-era Romania. 
The low-budget film was one of 22 movies competing for the top prize, the Palme d'Or."You don't necessarily need a big budget and big stars to tell a story that everyone will listen to," said Mungiu, 39, the first Romanian to win Cannes' top prize.

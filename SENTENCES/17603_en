SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH constitutional court decided on Saturday (January 27th) to deprive the two entities in BiH, Republika Srpska (RS) and the Federation of BiH (FBiH), of their symbols because they failed to harmonise them with the constitution. 
As a result, FBiH does not have a flag or coat of arms, while RS does not have an anthem or coat of arms. 
The court also rejected a request by the RS Parliament for more time to resolve the matter. 
RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik argued that the October elections and the process of forming a new government had been too time consuming.
In other news, BIH chief negotiator with the EU Igor Davidovic suggests a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) could be sealed with the Union in late June or early July. 
At a roundtable discussion Saturday, he said the timeline would work only if BiH manages to meet the necessary political criteria. 
Two years after the SAA is sealed, a country can apply for EU membership. 
As for NATO integration, Sven Alkalaj, head of the BiH mission to NATO, stressed that without the arrest of major war crimes fugitives, BiH could not hope to make progress.

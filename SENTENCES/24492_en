BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government's controversial decision to triple the registration tax for used cars came into force Tuesday (December 9th), despite strong opposition from used-car dealers.
They describe the measure, aimed at boosting new car sales, as "abusive" and "illegal".
Representatives of 40 used-car dealerships in northwestern Salaj county are calling for protests Thursday to demand repeal of the new tax.
In other news, President Traian Basescu is expected to name the new prime minister late Wednesday, following a fresh round of talks Tuesday between the two parties most likely to form a coalition government:
the Liberal Democratic Party, which won the November 30th elections, and the Social Democratic Party.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev predicted on Thursday (February 15th) that a row over the new bill on European Parliament (EP) elections would not affect the composition of the tripartite ruling coalition.
On Wednesday, a junior partner, the ethnic Turk Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), strongly protested parliament's adoption of a provision restricting the expatriate vote in the upcoming EP elections.
MRF relies largely on the votes of ethnic Turks, who left Bulgaria for Turkey during the 1980s while retaining their Bulgarian citizenships.
MRF members walked out of parliament in protest.
In other news, parliament member Toma Tomov announced on Thursday that he would surrender his parliamentary immunity, to be investigated for past corruption and abuse of power.
Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev had asked Parliament to lift Tomov's immunity.

TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi is urging parliament to sack Chief Prosecutor Theodhori Sollaku, to improve the performance of judicial institutions.
"The dismissal of the prosecutor is proposed by the parliament and then the request goes to the president, therefore I'm making this request," Topi said in a TV interview Thursday (October 11th).
He said Sollaku's successor should have both moral integrity and good communication skills.

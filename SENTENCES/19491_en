TIRANA, Albania -- New chief prosecutor Ina Rama told Voice of America on Sunday (November 25th) that she was not elected by the right wing majority, rejecting suggestions of connections to the ruling Democratic Party (DP).
Rama, 35, said her nomination was approved by parliament, with votes from members on the right and the left.
All three key leaders in Albania -- President Bamir Topi, Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli and Prime Minister Sali Berisha -- have welcomed her to the post of chief prosecutor, replacing Theodhori Sollaku.

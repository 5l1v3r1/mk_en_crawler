ZAGREB, Croatia -- The medical team at Zagreb's Dubrava clinic allowed 84-year-old Croatian Gen Janko Bobetko to spend the Easter holidays with his family.
The head of the team, Mijo Bergovec, confirmed Monday (21 April) that doctors let him leave Saturday and that Bobetko himself would decide when to return to hospital.
The UN tribunal in The Hague indicted him for war crimes allegedly committed during the Serbian-Croatian conflict in the 1990s.
But in February, the tribunal annulled its request for extradition and later suspended the arrest warrant, citing Bobetko's poor health.

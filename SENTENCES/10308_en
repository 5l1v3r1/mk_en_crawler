NEW YORK, United States -- Greece and Turkey plan to cancel parallel Cyprus drills in October, under an agreement reached during Monday's (20 September) talks between Greek Foreign Minister Petros Molyviatis and his Turkish counterpart, Abdullah Gul, in New York. 
Meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session, the two ministers discussed further confidence-building measures.
In other news, Molyviatis says that Greece's candidacy as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2005-2006 is being viewed favourably. 
Athens, meanwhile, reportedly plans to seek a breakthrough in the year-long negotiations on the constitutional name of its neighbour, Macedonia. 
The talks have been held under the auspices of the UN.

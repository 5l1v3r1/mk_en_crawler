PARIS, France -- Lawmakers on Thursday (December 4th) adopted the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and Albania during a special parliamentary session.
Greece is now the only EU member state that has not yet ratified it.
Completing the ratification will allow Tirana to apply for candidate status next year.
In other news Thursday, Albanian police arrested two Albanian emigrants with US citizenship suspected of belonging to an international drug-trafficking ring.
They detained the suspects in the town of Shkodra.
FBI agents participated in the operation, which the District Court in the US state of New Jersey requested.

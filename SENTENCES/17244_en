BUCHAREST, Romania -- In an address to the two chambers of Parliament on Wednesday (May 30th), President Traian Basescu asked for the cabinet's resignation as the first step to early elections.
Noting that a referendum to impeach him failed earlier this month, he said that the coalition opposing him had failed as well.
"In a country governed by true democracy, the result of the referendum would have automatically caused the cabinet's resignation and calling of early elections," the president said.
The main opposition Social Democratic Party was quick to respond.
Leader Mircea Geoana described Basescu's speech as one of "revenge and political vendetta", a theme echoed by the party of ethnic Hungarians, UDMR.
Basescu's rival, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, said such presidential intervention is not at all democratic.

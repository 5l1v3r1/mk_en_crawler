BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu-Tariceanu submitted a new nominee for the post of Romania's EU commissioner to European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso on Sunday (October 29th), after Senator Varujan Vosganian withdrew his candidacy.
Local media reports say the new choice is Leonard Orban, state secretary in the ministry for European integration and a former negotiator-in-chief with the EU.
Vosganian failed to receive EU backing last week, due to alleged ties to the communist era intelligence agency, Securitate.
He denies such links.

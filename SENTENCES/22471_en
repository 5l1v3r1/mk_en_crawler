NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat launched the key phase of talks aimed at reunifying their divided island Thursday (September 11th).
Observers expect them to focus on power-sharing and administrative issues.
Christofias and Talat met last week for what the UN described as a "historic" re-launch of official negotiations after several years of stalemate.
The two leaders are expected to meet at least once a week in a bid to find a settlement.
The two sides agree in principle to a bizonal, bicommunal federation, but sharp differences still remain on security, territorial issues and Turkish settlers.

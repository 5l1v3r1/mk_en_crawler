ANKARA, Turkey -- Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is serving a life sentence for terrorism, has submitted his "roadmap" for settling the Kurdish issue to the prison management, his lawyer announced on Thursday (August 27th). 
The document has been delayed several times, and coincides with the government's fresh initiative to give more rights to the Kurdish minority. 
No details of Ocalan's plan were revealed. 
Attorney Omen Gunes says only that Ocalan asked that it be distributed to relevant state institutions, the media and the European Court of Human Rights. 
Last week, Turkish President Abdullah Gul dismissed any such plan, saying Ocalan is not a partner for peace.

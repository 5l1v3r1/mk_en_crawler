ANKARA, Turkey -- A Turkish man staged a bizarre attempt to hijack an airliner on Tuesday (April 10th) before surrendering to police. 
Authorities say the man, identified as Mehmet Goksin Gol, was travelling from Diyarbakir to Istanbul when he suddenly warned the crew that he had an explosive device on board that could be activated by a cellular phone. 
He first demanded that the plane be diverted to Ankara but soon changed his mind and insisted on landing in Tehran. 
An F-16 escorted the airliner, a Boeing-737 with 178 passengers and six crew members, to Ankara where the hijacker surrendered to police. 
No explosives were found and there were no injuries. 
Officials believe Gol may have been on drugs.

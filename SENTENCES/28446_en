ATHENS, Greece -- Though the number of illegal entries in Greece fell last year compared to 2008, the country remains the main gateway for illegal immigrants to Europe, Gil Arias Fernandez, deputy executive director of the European border control agency, Frontex, announced in Athens on Wednesday (June 16th). 
In 2009, 48,000 people entered Greece illegally by land, while 30,400 entered the country by sea, compared to 56,000 and 31,700 respectively in 2008. 
The figures accounted for 50% of all illegal border crossings in the EU in 2008 and 75% in 2009. 
The trend continued in the first quarter of this year, when 6,600 illegal immigrants entered by land and sea, representing a drop of 7% compared to the same period in 2009. 
According to Frontex, the figure represents 88% of all illegal EU entries. 
At the same time, the number of illegal immigrants arrested in Greece last year dropped by 60% compared to 2008 and accounts for only 13% of all illegal immigrants detained in the EU. 
Most of the immigrants are Albanian.

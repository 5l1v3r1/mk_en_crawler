NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The government announced on Wednesday (May 14th) a safety-motivated ban on private boats ferrying people to and from Lebanon. 
Cypriot port officials explained that according to international agreements, transporting people by water must be aboard passenger ships, not yachts, which lack the necessary documentation. 
The only exception would be ferrying doctors from the Doctors of the World organisation to Lebanon. 
The move came amid local media reports that boat owners were charging large amounts of money to ferry people both out of and into Lebanon, where unrest and violence over the past week affected international links.

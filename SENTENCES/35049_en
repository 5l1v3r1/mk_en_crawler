SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The power decentralisation issue is a crucial part of the Ohrid Peace Accord and therefore is key to Macedonia's EU integration efforts, according to Nicholas Whyte, director of the European programme of the International Crisis Group. 
In an interview for Radio Free Europe on Sunday (27 June), Whyte urged political parties to reach broad consensus on the issue and find a solution acceptable to the public. 
He added that a much bigger challenge for Macedonia would be determining what authority local government would actually receive.

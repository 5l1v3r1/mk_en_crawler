BERLIN, Germany -- Serbian President Boris Tadic says it is in his country's interest to apply for EU membership as soon as possible, but only when the bloc appears open to talks on the issue, Serbian media reported on Sunday (October 4th). 
Tadic was in Berlin to receive an award on Saturday. 
He told Deutsche Welle radio that the Netherlands is the only EU member that has conditioned Belgrade's bid on capturing war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic, and that Belgrade is doing its best to locate the former Bosnian Serb commander.

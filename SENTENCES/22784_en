PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK Regional Administrator for Mitrovica Gerard Gallucci said on Wednesday (October 8th) the EULEX mission has no mandate to operate in Serb-dominated areas of northern Kosovo. 
Gallucci stressed that Kosovo Serbs and the government in Belgrade oppose EULEX's planned deployment in the north.
Also Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci announced the government will offer Kosovo's police officers a pay raise in November. 
Kuci said he met with representatives of police trade unions who assured him they would cancel a previously planned protest.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Interior Minister Besir Atalay met on Thursday (August 13th) with pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) leader Ahmet Turk, as part of the government's efforts to end the decades-long Kurdish insurgency in Turkey.
After the meeting, Atalay said the goal is to "bring forward a project of brotherhood and peace".
In turn, Turk said his party views the government initiative with both hope and caution.
"We don't want to be disappointedâ¦ We are making an effort for a new Turkey where Kurds and Turks embrace each other.
It has been understood that problems cannot be solved through violence and arms," he added.

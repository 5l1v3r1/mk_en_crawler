BELGRADE, Serbia -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz agreed during a visit to Belgrade on Monday (May 11th) that Serbia has made considerable progress in terms of submitting documents and providing access to archives and witnesses.
While praising this operational co-operation, he also stressed that prosecutors expect Serbia to soon meet its last commitment:
arresting war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic.
After the meeting, Rasim Ljajic, head of Serbia's national council for co-operation with The Hague, expressed confidence Brammertz would submit an objective report on co-operation to the UN Security Council in June.
In other news, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said on Monday that Serbia has implemented all commitments stemming from the visa liberalisation road map and now expects positive news from the European Commission (EC).
Dacic was speaking after meeting an EC delegation led by Pierre Mirel.
The decision on allowing visa-free travel to EU member countries is expected in the autumn.

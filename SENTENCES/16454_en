PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, who leads the coalition that won the Montenegrin general elections, said on Monday (11 September) that he is thinking about leaving politics. 
"I'm a bit tired and fed up with this jobâ¦ In the next few weeks, I'll think about stepping down," he said. 
The prime minister said he felt it was time to move on to other things now that he has achieved his most important goal of independence and stability for Montenegro.
Djukanovic also claimed that his alliance has won an absolute majority of 42 to 43 seats in the 81-seat parliament, which would make the task of forming the next cabinet much easier. 
Two polls support that contention. 
The official results are expected later on Tuesday.

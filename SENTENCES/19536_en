BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government officially asked parliament for a vote of confidence over a bill on the majority voting system Monday (October 29th).
The measure differs from the one that President Traian Basescu wants approved in a referendum on November 25th.
Although various parties are allowed to submit no-confidence motions against the government within three days, the Democratic Party, the Liberal Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party say they have no intention of doing that.
Basescu vowed not to endorse the measure proposed by Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu's cabinet before the referendum on his own version.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The government of Republika Srpska (RS) adopted a bill on constitutional amendments Wednesday (22 October). 
It would transfer functions from the entity institutions to the central federal administration. 
The bill also refers to ongoing defence reforms aimed at curbing the authority of the RS presidency and the National Assembly over the armed forces and in cases of national emergency. 
Parliament has not yet approved the bill.
Also Wednesday, the RS government approved a report by the Defence Reform Commission, seen as a prerequisite for signing the Partnership for Peace Programme this year. 
Opposition parties are criticising proposed reforms.

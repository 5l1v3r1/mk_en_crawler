BUCHAREST, Romania -- Foreign Minister Mihai-Razvan Ungureanu returned Friday (29 April) from a working visit to Syria, where he met with counterpart Farouq al-Shara. 
They discussed boosting bilateral relations, especially economic ties. 
They also talked about the three Romanian journalists kidnapped in Iraq last month.
In other news, the worst flooding in 50 years forced 3,700 people to abandon their homes in western Romania on Friday. 
But many residents reportedly stayed behind to protect their property from looters. 
Soldiers and rescue teams worked around the clock to ferry those seeking to leave to higher ground. 
The environment ministry said the floods were partly caused by broken 300-year-old dams on the Timis River.

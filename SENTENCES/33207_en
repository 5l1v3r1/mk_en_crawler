BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic said on Thursday (12 June) that there are no more organised crime groups in Serbia, due to the government's clampdown on crime following the March assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. 
Speaking before the 1st General Assembly of the Southeastern Europe Police Chiefs' Association, Mihajlovic said he hoped major unresolved crimes would be wrapped up in the near future. 
He also called for enhancing regional police initiatives.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey has made important reforms that bolster its EU membership bid, German Foreign Ministry State Secretary Klaus Scharioth said Thursday (18 March), in a speech opening the 10th meeting of the Turkish-German Co-operation Council.
Scharioth added that should Turkey maintain this positive dynamic, the decision to launch EU accession negotiations at the end of this year would be positive.
He noted that Ankara has already met most of the requirements outlined in the Copenhagen political criteria.

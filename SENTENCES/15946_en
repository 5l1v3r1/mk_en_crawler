PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Amnesty International has urged Montenegrin authorities to launch a full investigation into allegations that ethnic Albanians accused of plotting terrorist acts were abused by police. 
Some 14 suspects were arrested on September 9th, shortly before Montenegro's general elections. 
Five of the detainees say police repeatedly beat them. 
Local ethnic Albanian leaders condemned the arrests, saying most of the detainees were either members or supporters of a local political party.

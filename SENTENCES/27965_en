BELGRADE, Serbia -- The war crimes prosecution office announced on Tuesday (May 18th) it wants to open an investigation into a possible mass grave near Raska, in southern Serbia.
An investigative judge would visit the site and if preliminary information warrants it, authorise others to exhume remains, conduct autopsies and identify the victims.
The investigation would be conducted in the presence of representatives from EULEX, the Serbian government's commission for missing people and Pristina's working group for missing persons.
The mass grave near Raska may contain the remains of people killed in late May or early June 1999 during the Kosovo conflict.
Authorities believe the bodies were initially buried near Drenica, Kosovo, and moved later to Serbia.

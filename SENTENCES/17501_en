TIRANA, Albania -- Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov contacted his Albanian counterpart, Lulzim Basha, regarding the sale of weapons to Armenia, Azeri Press Agency (APA) reported on Friday (July 27th).
Mammadyarov said that according to a UN resolution, no country is allowed to sell weapons to countries that are experiencing a war.
Turkish authorities recently halted a shipment of 60 containers of weapons, apparently sent by Albania's Military Export-Import Company and bound for Armenia.
However, Armenia has publicly denied having ordered weapons from Albania, and said no weapons trading agreement exists between the two countries.
It is still unclear who ordered the weapons shipment.

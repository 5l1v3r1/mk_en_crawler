ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis on Thursday (27 May) presented his New Democracy (ND) party's platform for the upcoming European Parliament elections.
Karamanlis said the EU was the basis for ND's "New Greece" vision, which helped ND win the local parliamentary elections earlier this year.
In other news, Athens Mayor Dora Bakoyianni says that preparations for the Summer Olympics are going well and that 90 per cent of the projects will be finished by July.
The Games begin on 13 August.
Meanwhile, organisers have cancelled a contract with an Australian company to provide 75,000 seats for the main Olympic stadium.
The move came after the Australian government issued a travel warning about Greece.

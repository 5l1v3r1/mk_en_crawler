TIRANA, Albania -- The Central Election Commission announced on Wednesday (6 July) that votes have been counted in 99 of the country's 100 electoral districts.
The tallying was delayed by walkouts and disputes between the major political parties.
If all goes according to plan, the official results will be announced late Thursday.
Exit polls put the Democrats ahead of the ruling Socialists after Sunday's parliamentary elections.
President Alfred Moisiu has urged restraint, impartiality and transparency until the ballot counting is complete and final results are announced.

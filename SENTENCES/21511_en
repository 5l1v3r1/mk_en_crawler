THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Ian Bonomy of the United Kingdom will conduct the pre-trial process against former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.
Bonomy will preside when Karadzic makes his second court appearance, scheduled later this week.
Bonomy, 62, was appointed to the post Friday (August 22nd) by Judge Patrick Robinson of Jamaica.
He himself replaced Alphonse Orie as the presiding judge in Karadzic's trial Thursday.
The third member of the panel will be France's Michele Picard.
Meanwhile, Karadzic's family met with Bosnian Serb leaders Saturday, complaining that their bank accounts have been frozen and they are not allowed to work.
"They simply want to have the same rights as other citizens," Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said after meeting with Karadzic's wife, Liljana, and daughter, Sonja.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Prosecutors brought criminal charges against five people Tuesday (December 23rd) for a 2005 airplane crash that killed 121 people. 
Deputy Prosecutor General Akis Papasavvas said the five, whose names he did not release, allegedly committed manslaughter and caused death through negligence. 
The Cypriot Helios Airways plane crashed into a mountain near Athens on August 14th 2005 during a flight from Larnaca to Prague, killing everyone on board. 
A parallel inquiry by Greek investigators suggested human error. 
The investigation determined the plane flew on autopilot for nearly two hours before it crashed, with its pilots and everyone aboard likely unconscious because of a loss of cabin pressure.

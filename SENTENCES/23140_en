PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci predicted on Sunday (June 1st) that Kosovo authorities will establish the management structure of the Kosovo Intelligence Agency and will appoint its first director before the new constitution enters into force in two weeks.
"This issue is being discussed by the prime minister and the president, and I believe a solution will be found before June 15th," Kuci said.
Parliament gave fast-tracked approval to the law chartering the Kosovo Intelligence Agency as well as several laws envisioned in the plan by former UN envoy for Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari.
Local media reports note that, according to rumours, the two parties in the ruling coalition -- the Democratic Party and the Democratic League -- were running their own illegal secret services before forming a coalition.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Romanian President Traian Basescu said on Thursday (October 28th) that Bucharest will support the creation of a NATO anti-missile defence system, but not bilateral antiballistic shield agreements. 
"Romania has a bilateral agreement with the US regarding anti-missile defence, which meets the country's security needs. 
But our objective is that the antiballistic shield be a NATO reality and not a bilateral reality of the Romanian-American relation, or the Romanian-Dutch, or American-Dutch relations. 
This bilateral ground does not seem to me to be the right solution," Basescu told a joint press conference with NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen in Brussels. 
Rasmussen thanked Romania for understanding the threat posed by missile proliferation and for backing NATO's efforts to fight the threat.

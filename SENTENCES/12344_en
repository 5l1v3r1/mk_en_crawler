PALE, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO has confirmed that Aleksander Karadzic, son of wartime Republika Srpska leader Radovan Karadzic, was detained in Pale early Thursday (7 July).
General Steven Schook, commander of the NATO HQ in Sarajevo, said the younger Karadzic is suspected of helping war crime indictees elude capture.
He may also have information about others in the network of supporters.
Evidence gathered during earlier raids led to Thursday's action, Schook said.

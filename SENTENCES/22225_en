TIRANA, Albania -- A key witness in an investigation into illegal ammunition trade has turned up dead on a mountain road in eastern Albania. 
Businessman Kosta Trebicka died Friday afternoon (September 12th) in a car accident, according to initial police investigations. 
A team of US experts is also investigating the case and will file a parallel report. 
The general prosecutor's office says Trebicka had not requested protection after he testified about the illegal trade. 
In 2007, he told Albanian and US investigators that the US company AEY Inc. 
had bought old Chinese ammunition from Albania for use by the Afghan army and police. 
He said the firm was repackaging the ammunition in Albania to hide its origin.
In other news, the EU Police Mission to Albania (PAMECA) announced it will stay in the country for three more years to assist local authorities with projects worth 5.5m euros. 
In this third phase of assistance, the PAMECA will monitor police efforts to strengthen the fight against terrorism and organised crime, implement integrated border management and maintain law and order. 
PAMECA will also assist in applying DNA analysis for the first time.

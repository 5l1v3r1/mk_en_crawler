BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament decided on Monday (October 26th) to hold a vote of confidence on the new cabinet, proposed by Prime Minister-designate Lucian Croitoru, in a week.
Before then, his cabinet picks will be reviewed by the respective parliamentary committees.
By law, the confidence vote must take place no later than November 7th.
Croitoru's cabinet, announced last Friday, is a mixture of 14 Liberal Democratic Party members, former ministers and technocrats.
Still, the government has almost no chance at approval, as opposition parties continue to back their choice, Klaus Johannis, for prime minister.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Local elections will occur in November, while general elections are envisioned in 2011, presidential spokesman Xhavit Beqiri said on Thursday (January 15th).
President Fatmir Sejdiu's position is that general elections should take place after the current parliament's regular mandate expires, the spokesman said.
Special EU Representative in Kosovo Pieter Feith is expected to announce his position on the matter by the end of this month.
He is responsible for guaranteeing the compatibility of the election process with former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's blueprint for Kosovo.
In other news Thursday, the watchdog group Human Rights Watch (HRW) criticised Kosovo for failing to achieve the standards of a liberal democracy.
In its latest report, HRW concluded "Not only did Kosovo's declaration of independence in February fail to clarify its international legal status ...
it also brought no visible improvements to the human rights situation." The report also criticised the country's criminal justice system.

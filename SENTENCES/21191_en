ZAGREB, Croatia -- The European Commission has taken a tougher stance towards Croatia regarding the introduction of a protected environmental fishing zone (ZERP), according to sources quoted by the Zagreb-based newspaper, Vecernji list.
Vincent Degert, head of the EC's delegation in Croatia, met with Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and President Stipe Mesic on Thursday (January 31st) and reportedly told them time is running out for action.
Mesic said after the meeting that it was Croatia's sovereign right to introduce the ZERP.
However, he added, the country should meet Union standards and not cause conflict with members, such as neighbouring Slovenia.

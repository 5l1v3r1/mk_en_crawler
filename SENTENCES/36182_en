SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic on Tuesday (9 March) appointed Nikola Radovanovic as state defence minister. 
A government statement said the appointment has the backing of the international community. 
Radovanovic is the third candidate nominated to the post by the Serb Democratic Party, whose earlier nominees failed.
Also Tuesday, the BiH presidency moved to initiate the deployment of Bosnian troops to Iraq. 
In September, 36 troops will go there to help find and destroy unexploded devices.
Meanwhile, NATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe Admiral Rainer Feist visited Sarajevo on Tuesday. 
He said he expects the Alliance's June summit in Istanbul to result in an official invitation to BiH to join the Partnership for Peace programme.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Eurozone finance ministers continue discussions Tuesday (May 17th) in Brussels about ways to help Greece overcome its financial crisis. 
After the first day of talks Monday, Luxembourg Prime Minister and Eurogroup President Jean-Claude Juncker said that he does not rule out "reprofiling" of Greek bond maturities, or a voluntary offer from bondholders to accept repayment over a longer period of time. 
He reiterated that all political parties in Athens should approve further austerity and reform measures, including further privatisation of state assets.

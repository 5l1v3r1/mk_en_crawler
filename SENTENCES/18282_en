THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte on Wednesday (March 14th) criticised Europe's "muted" reaction to a recent ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which cleared Serbia of direct responsibility for the 1995 Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) but found Serbia could have prevented it.
Del Ponte specifically singled out statements by the German EU Presidency and EU security chief Javier Solana, criticising them for welcoming the closure of the ICJ case rather than stressing that Belgrade had violated the Genocide Convention.
She also slammed the EU for failing to force Serbia to hand over fugitives Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.
In Sarajevo, the Bosniak member of the BiH Presidency, Haris Silajdzic, said BiH must demand that Serbia respect obligations stemming from the ICJ ruling by arresting the remaining fugitives within 60 days and punishing other participants in the Srebrenica massacre.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- A court in Vukovar on Friday (10 December) sentenced nine Serbs to prison terms ranging from three years to four-and-a-half years for war crimes committed during the 1991-1995 conflict.
They were found guilty of looting, destruction of property and the expulsion of 69 Croatian villagers when the area was overrun by Serb separatists.
All the defendants were tried in absentia.
Meanwhile, Amnesty International issued a report on Monday that criticises Croatia for failing to prosecute war criminals.
It also claimed that returning Serbs "face discrimination when it comes to jobs, lodging and access to social and economic rights".

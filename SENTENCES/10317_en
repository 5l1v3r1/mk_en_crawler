BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic's son, Veljko, told a Belgrade court Tuesday (21 September) that his family never had any doubt that Slobodan Milosevic ordered his father's abduction and murder in the summer of 2000. 
"We knew Milosevic and his circle were behind it all. 
We never suspected it could be anyone else," he said. 
Stambolic's body was found in 2003 during the investigation of the assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.

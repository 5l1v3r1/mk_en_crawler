PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Parliament decided on Monday (10 July) that the country's next legislature, due to be elected this autumn, will have the mandate to adopt a new constitution.
The ruling coalition mustered the required majority to approve the decision, despite objections by the opposition.
The ruling Democratic Party of Socialists says the constitution must be updated, in light of Montenegro's independence.
Parliament also approved a measure boosting the number of deputies in the next legislature from 75 to 81.

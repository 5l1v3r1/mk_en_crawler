SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Three senior law enforcement officials in Sofia have been dismissed amid allegations of corruption and embezzlement. 
On Monday (21 August), General Kiril Voynov, chief of the National Fire Brigade, resigned from his post, after military prosecutors filed formal charges of abuse of office against him over illegally issued permits. 
Also Monday, Interior Minister Rumen Petkov dismissed the head of the Sofia road police, General Iliya Iliev, as well as the head of the road police's administrative service department, Tomi Tomov. 
They were charged last week with abuse of office and corruption stemming from an illegal car registration scheme.
News of the dismissals coincided with the start of a European Commission team's visit to Sofia on Monday to assess law enforcement reforms and the fight against corruption.

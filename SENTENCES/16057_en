SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Sulejman Tihic, the Muslim member of BiH's tripartite presidency, has allegedly received a death threat from Serbs living in the United States.
The president's office said on Monday (14 August) that the senders of the letter, which was mailed from Chicago, threatened to kill Tihic, war crimes convict Naser Oric, and their children.
Oric was convicted by the UN tribunal of failing to prevent atrocities against Serbs in Srebrenica but was released on the basis of time already served.
The country's security services are investigating the threat.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Anguel Donchev, a prosecutor at the Supreme Prosecution of Cassation, was arrested late Wednesday (December 20th) for accepting a 20,000-euro bribe. 
The arrest followed a sting operation in a Sofia restaurant, organised after Donchev's colleague, Emil Milev, told authorities Donchev tried to blackmail him. 
Donchev allegedly demanded money and implied Interior Minister Rumen Petkov would protect his job. 
Milev reportedly went directly to Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev about the blackmail attempt.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country needs approximately 130m euros to implement EU- related reform projects in 2007, according to figures announced during a conference organised by the BiH Directorate for European Integration in Sarajevo on Wednesday (April 18th). 
These projects are aimed primarily at fulfilling EU criteria in the political, social and economic sectors. 
Around 50m euros would come from the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance programme, while the BiH government would have to seek the rest from various EU member states and donor organisations.
In other news Wednesday, the OSCE's ambassador to Sarajevo, Douglas Davidson, again called for the fast adoption of a state-level law on higher education. 
He discussed the matter with top officials of the BiH Parliament's two chambers.

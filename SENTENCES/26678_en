TIRANA, Albania -- Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama said on Tuesday (October 6th) that the protest planned for Saturday outside the government building in Tirana is only the first of many.
The party has long criticised the June 28th general elections, insisting the results were manipulated.
The SP has demanded a thorough investigation.
Its 65 lawmakers have been boycotting work in parliament for weeks over the matter.
Rama warns that protests will spread to every street in the country until the opposition's demands are met.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Lawmakers from the main opposition Serb List political alliance and the Democratic Serbian Party announced on Friday (October 25th) that they will boycott parliament over the government's refusal to accept any of their proposals regarding recognition of Kosovo's independence. 
Other opposition parties distanced themselves from the Serb List and the DSS, announcing they will continue to work in parliament. 
Initially, the opposition had presented a united front in demanding reversal of the government's decision on recognition. 
It had also insisted on a referendum on the issue by year's end or early parliamentary elections.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Prime Minister Agim Ceku departed on Wednesday (November 29th) for a two-day visit to Moscow, where he is meeting with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Titov and parliamentary officials. 
The aim of the visit is to brief Russian authorities about developments in the UN-mediated status negotiations. 
But Pristina media reports suggest Ceku also is trying to convince Moscow to support Kosovo's independence. 
This is the first visit to Moscow by a Kosovo Albanian leader.
In other news, the Kosovo government condemned the violence Tuesday that marred a rally by the pro-independence Vetevendosje (Self-determination) movement in Pristina. 
UN police and local security forces had to use teargas to disperse a crowd that vandalised the parliament building and UNMIK headquarters.

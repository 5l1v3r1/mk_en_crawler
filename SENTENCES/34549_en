ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Simitis said Saturday (4 October) that the 2004 Summer Olympics would boost the country's economy and strengthen its tourism sector.
"The Olympics are a cultural and economic high-risk, high-dividend investment," he said in an interview for a local newspaper.
The government hopes the post-Olympics economic environment will help it cut its huge debt, he added.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton is visiting Pristina on Friday (May 27th) to "confirm the EU commitment to the European perspective of Kosovo". 
Ashton will also express support for the dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia as the essential move to eliminate obstacles on the path towards the EU. 
A statement released by Ashton's cabinet said that the EU wants all the Western Balkans to move forward in Europe. 
"We want to find practical solutions that can improve the daily lives of ordinary people," it added. 
The Koha Ditore newspaper reports that the chief of Kosovo's negotiating team in the dialogue with Serbia, Edita Tahiri will make three requests: accelerate the visa liberalisation process, enter contractual agreements with the EU and speed up the process that would help Kosovo gain EU candidate status.

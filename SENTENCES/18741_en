LONDON, United Kingdom -- Police announced on Wednesday (July 4th) that they had seized 1,800 forged passports and arrested five suspects -- three Bulgarians and two Albanians -- in what may be the largest such bust in Britain.
When officers broke into the premises, they purportedly discovered suspects printing a false driving license, fueling other concerns.

ANKARA, Turkey-- The restored 11-century-old Armenian Akdamar Church re-opened as a museum in eastern Turkey on Thursday (March 29th), as a goodwill gesture aimed at strengthening relations with neighbouring Armenia, and beyond that, Europe, the United States.
An Armenian delegation led by Deputy Culture Minister Gagik Gyurjyan and Patriarch Mesrob II, who heads the Armenian Orthodox Church in Turkey, attended the ceremony.
Patriarch Mesrob II suggested Turkey could further boost relations by allowing the church to hold religious services at least once a year.

TIRANA, Albania -- The two major formations -- the ruling Democratic Party and the opposition Socialist Party (SP) -- appear ready to accept either of two dates President Alfred Moisiu is considering for local elections -- either January 14th or January 21st, according to local media reports Monday (November 20th). 
SP political secretary Ben Blushi said the Socialists are dropping their previous demand that the vote be delayed until better weather in the spring. 
He did, however, voice concern that a vote on January 21st would coincide with parliamentary elections in Serbia, straining the resources of international observers.
On Friday, during a joint news conference with Prime Minister Sali Berisha in Tirana, European Commission Vice President and Commissioner for Justice Franco Frattini said the EU expects fair and transparent local elections. 
Berisha and Frattini met on the sidelines of an EU-Western Balkans Ministerial Forum, held in Tirana.

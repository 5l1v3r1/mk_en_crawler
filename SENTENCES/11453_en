ZAGREB, Croatia -- UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte may visit Zagreb next week, according to local media reports Monday (23 May), which cited EU diplomatic sources.
Her visit reportedly is related to the 16 June-17 June meeting of EU foreign ministers, who will discuss launching accession talks with Croatia.
In April, those talks were delayed over insufficient war crimes co-operation, especially in the case of fugitive Ante Gotovina.
In other news Monday, Croatian President Stipe Mesic, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and the OSCE Mission to Zagreb issued separate statements condemning weekend bombings in the Vukovar area.
The series of bomb attacks targeted settlements populated mainly by ethnic Serbs.

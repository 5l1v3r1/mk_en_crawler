OHRID, Macedonia -- A two-day regional conference on fighting money laundering ended on Friday (25 March).
Experts from all the countries in Southeast Europe, as well as from Belgium, Poland, Ukraine and the Council of Europe, attended the event.
They agreed that money laundering jeopardises countries' economies and security.
Since the problem is not confined to any one state, they said, countries must work together to confront it.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic vowed on Sunday (November 21st) to step up border control in order to stop immigrants from flooding into Western Europe.
He pointed out that over 8,000 Serbs -- mainly ethnic Albanians from southern Serbia and Roma people from Vojvodina -- have applied for asylum in Sweden, Germany and Belgium since the beginning of this year.
Dacic announced that police are investigating to determine whether there were organised trips.
Serbian citizens have been free to travel within most EU countries without visas since last December.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Former Croatian lawmaker Branimir Glavas was transferred on Monday (December 20th) from a Sarajevo detention centre to the Zenica prison in central BiH where he will serve his eight-year sentence for war crimes against Serbian civilians during the 1991-1995 conflict.
The BiH Appeals Court upheld his sentence a week ago.
Glavas was found guilty and sentenced for war crimes in Croatia, but left his country to neighbouring BiH to avoid prison.
Bosnian authorities arrested him in September.

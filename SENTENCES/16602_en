VIENNA, Austria -- Serbian and Kosovo officials met in Vienna on Monday (7 August) for another round of talks on the province's future status. 
Decentralisation is again the focus. 
During the Monday session of the two-day talks, the two sides failed to reach substantial agreement on healthcare, education and judiciary issues. 
The Serb side insisted that Serb minority should receive education under the Serbian system, while the Kosovo Albanian side demanded government control over educational institutions in Serb-dominated areas. 
Tuesday's round of talks is on the rights of minorities. 
Although Belgrade's representatives are participating, Kosovo Serb representatives are not. 
They say community rights should be addressed during concrete negotiations on Kosovo's status.
In other news, the London-based Minority Rights Group International warned in a report Monday that the divisions in Kosovo could lead to a new round of ethnic cleansing. 
The organisation said the current status talks offer the best chance for a solution.

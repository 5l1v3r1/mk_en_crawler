BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government has rejected rumours that the visa-free travel regime with the EU -- imposed last year -- may be suspended.
State Secretary of the Justice Ministry Slobodan Homen said on Thursday (May 5th) that the cabinet has worked to reduce the number of asylum seekers in the EU.
Two measures include fining travel agencies that facilitate asylum seekers and providing long-term financial aid to minority ethnic groups in order to facilitate their integration into Serbian society.
Earlier rumours suggested Belgium was preparing to suspend visa-free travel for Serbian citizens due to the large number of bogus asylum requests.
The Netherlands and Germany have faced similar problems.

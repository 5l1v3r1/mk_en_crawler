SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH's Constitutional Court ruled Friday (26 March) that 13 towns in Republika Srpska (RS) must change their names to eliminate the word "Serbian". 
Included on the list are Srpski Brod, Srpsko Gorazde, Srpski Sanski and Srpsko Sarajevo. 
The word "Serbian" was added to the names during the 1992-1995 war. 
Constitutional Court Chairman Mato Tadic told reporters the ruling was made to stop discrimination against Muslims and Croats in RS.
Also on Friday, the Bosnian Serb authorities announced that they have fired the police chief of Orahova because of his failure to prevent the bombing of a local mosque. 
The government in Banja Luka ordered tighter security around various institutions following the flare-up of interethnic violence in Kosovo.
In other news, Brcko Supervisor Susan R. 
Johnson issued an order Friday amending the statute of BiH's Brcko District. 
The largely technical changes were made after consultations with the district's interim assembly councillors and the district police.

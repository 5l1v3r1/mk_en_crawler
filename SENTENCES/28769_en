ANKARA, Turkey -- Voters headed to the polls Sunday (September 12th) for a national referendum on a series of 26 constitutional amendments. 
Supporters say the package will boost democratic standards and rights, compared to the current constitution, which was drafted by the military in 1982. 
In part, the amendments would require that senior military staff be prosecuted at the Supreme Court, while regular military personnel would be subject to civilian court trials. 
Banning political parties would become more difficult. 
The opposition says the government is using the referendum to seize control of the judiciary, as part of a back-door Islamist coup. 
The latest polls suggest the vote will be close.
Meanwhile, local media reported on Friday that one boy is in critical condition following clashes between protestors and police in several towns in eastern Turkey. 
They erupted on Wednesday and Thursday after authorities announced that nine suspected members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party had been killed in skirmishes with the army earlier in the week. 
Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse rock-throwing protestors.

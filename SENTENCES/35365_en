BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) said Monday (19 April) that it is too early to consider a cabinet reshuffle and the inclusion of new parties in the government. 
Dusan Prorokovic, a senior DSS official, was responding to a proposal by Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic of G17 Plus, who suggested bringing the Democratic Party into the government after the June presidential elections. 
DSS wants to wait until the government has been in office at least 100 days before reshuffle discussions begin.

ATHENS, Greece -- Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis said Monday (21 February) that preparations are under way for launching a new financial crimes unit, the Special Inspections Service. 
The establishment of a modern and flexible department, replacing the current Economic Fraud Squad, was a campaign promise of the now ruling New Democracy party.
Also Monday, Tourism Minister Dimitris Avramopoulos announced the launch of a new campaign to promote Greece as a top holiday destination. 
The move follows a disappointing season in 2004.

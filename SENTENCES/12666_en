ATHENS, Greece -- Authorities have launched an investigation into an alleged "baby trafficking" channel allegedly involving three Bulgarian nationals who were arrested in Greece late last week. 
According to press reports in Athens, the police detained the three on the island of Crete as they attempted to strike a deal worth 12,000 euros. 
Police say the scheme involved visits by pregnant Bulgarian women who gave birth in Greece where the babies were sold.
In other news, two young Turks were killed in a minefield while trying to enter Greece illegally late Saturday. 
The incident occurred on the Greek side of the border, near the village of Kastanies. 
Officials say the minefield was marked clearly with signs and was surrounded by a barbed wire fence.

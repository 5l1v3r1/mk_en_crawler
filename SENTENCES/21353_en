MOSCOW, Russia -- The last defence minister of the former Yugoslavia, Veljko Kadijevic, received Russian citizenship, Russian media reported on Sunday (September 28th). 
Kadijevic, 83, served as defence minister from 1988 to 1992. 
He headed the Yugoslav National Army (JNA) during military operations against the Croatian towns of Vukovar and Dubrovnik in 1991. 
The JNA completely destroyed Vukovar and drove out all of its Croat residents. 
It also created the first mass graves of the post-Yugoslav conflicts there. 
Kadijevic faces charges of war crimes in Croatia. 
According to Russian press reports, Kadijevic received his passport on August 13th following a presidential decree. 
The Russian constitution bars extradition of Russian citizens to other countries.

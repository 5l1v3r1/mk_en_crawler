SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The third round of technical talks on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between BiH and the EU was completed on Friday (28 July) in Sarajevo. 
At a news conference afterwards, the head of the European Commission's negotiation team, Dirk Lange, said the primary focus had been issues related to customs policy and trade. 
According to Lange, an agreement was reached on the gradual removal of customs duties imposed by BiH on goods imported from the EU after the formal sealing of the SAA deal. 
The EU wants to retain its current customs duties on imports of sugar, wine, fish and beef products from BiH.

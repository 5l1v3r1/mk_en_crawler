BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic said on Tuesday (July 1st) that Serbia would have a new democratic cabinet by Friday or Monday at the latest. 
"Serbia is being rebuilt. 
This government will exert more effort to restore infrastructure and build a more balanced society. 
These are our two goals," Tadic said to the 23rd congress of the Socialist International in Athens. 
He reiterated full membership in the EU would be the chief priority of the new government.
Also Tuesday, Serbia's parliament began debating an amendment to the government structure act proposed by the Democratic Party-G17 Plus caucus. 
Under it, future cabinets would have 23 ministries, one more than now. 
That would make a total of 26 cabinet members.

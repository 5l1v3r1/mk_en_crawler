NICOSIA, Cyprus -- UN Special Envoy to Cyprus Alexander Downer said on Tuesday (February 23rd) that talks to resolve the long-standing dispute between the Greek and Turkish communities on the island will be delayed by the April 18th vote to elect a new Turkish Cypriot leader.
The two main candidates to become "president" of the Turkish Cypriots are incumbent Mehmet Ali Talat and hardliner rightist Dervis Eroglou.
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Cypriot President Demetris Christofias -- ahead of another round of intensified talks Wednesday -- Downer said that "if Talat wins, there will be continuity;
if it is Eroglou, we don't know how he will approach it." (Cyprus Mail - 24/02/10;

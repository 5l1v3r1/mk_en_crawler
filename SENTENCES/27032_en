BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police arrested Stanko Ristic, a close associate of former Bosnian Serb army commander Ratko Mladic, local media reported on Tuesday (August 3rd).
Ristic's lawyer vowed to appeal the arrest.
This is not his first.
The retired military pilot was jailed for 162 days in 2006 during an investigation against him.
He denies prosecutor's claims that he and his son have been renting apartments to hide Mladic, the fugitive war crimes indictee.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Following criticism from domestic and international media, Jewish organisations and Israel, the government acknowledged on Wednesday (18 June) that the country took part in the Holocaust. 
On Saturday, Prime Minister Adrian Nastase shocked the international community by saying that there was no Holocaust in Romania between 1941 and 1945, although the country was Germany's ally at the time. 
But in a new press release, the government said it is ready to fully co-operate with international institutions studying the Holocaust. 
It said the current cabinet was the first to adopt and obey fully a law banning any Nazi, racist or xenophobic extremism in the country.

TIRANA, Albania -- Tirana Mayor Edi Rama said Tuesday (11 November) he would run for chairman of the ruling Socialist Party. 
The elections are to take place during the 12 December party congress. 
"The internal competition in a party cannot and should not be a declaration of war between groups or individuals," said Rama, referring to conflicts between the party leadership and cabinet ministers. 
Rama only recently joined the party, after running twice for mayor with its backing.

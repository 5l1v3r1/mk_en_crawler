PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that preparing for EU and NATO accession is the only long-term solution for the Balkans, especially for Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
Joining these organisations will bring new jobs, freedom to travel and many other opportunities, Albright told Sarajevo newspaper Dnevni Avaz, in an interview Wednesday (September 19th). 
She added that Kosovo should become independent, with a government that respects minority rights.
Also Wednesday, Danish Defence Minister Soren Gade wrapped up a brief visit to Pristina. 
He said he's concerned that violence may break out in Kosovo in light of the final status issues. 
Danish troops serve as part of NATO's peacekeeping force in the province.

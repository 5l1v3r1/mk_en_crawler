BUCHAREST, Romania -- European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Wednesday (December 19th) that in the year since Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU, integration must be declared a success.
Critics were wrong, Barroso told Radio France International.
Asked about the mechanisms of supervision and control applied to Romanian and Bulgarian justice and agriculture sectors, Barroso said monitoring has yielded results.
Paraphrasing the words of John F. Kennedy, Barroso said that Romania and Bulgaria should ask themselves what they can do for Europe, instead of asking what Europe should do for them.

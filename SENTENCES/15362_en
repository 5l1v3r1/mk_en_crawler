ANKARA, Turkey -- Commander of Land Forces General Ilker Basbug rejected on Monday (25 September) recent EU criticism of the Turkish military as being too involved in politics.
He warned that Islamic fundamentalism is gaining popularity in Turkey and said the military is obliged by law to defend the secular state.
His remarks, however, prompted a rebuke from a senior member of the ruling Justice and Development Party.
Faruk Celik said it is the government, not the army, that has the job of countering religious extremism.
Meanwhile, the European Parliament discussed the latest report on Turkey on Tuesday, with a vote on the document expected on Wednesday.
The report harshly criticises Turkey for slowing the pace of reforms.
On Sunday meanwhile, a 10-year-old boy was killed when a device he had picked up exploded in his hands.
The child's 12-year-old brother was wounded in the blast, which occurred in the city of Siirt.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The United Kingdom supports the independence and territorial integrity of Kosovo and opposes its partition, British Minister of State for Europe David Lidington said on Thursday (June 24th) in Pristina.
"We expect the opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to give us the possibility to move ahead," he said.
Lidington added that Kosovo and Serbia can discuss technical issues but not independence, which he says is a done deal.
In Pristina, he met with President Fatmir Sejdiu, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni.
In other news Thursday, European Parliament Rapporteur for Kosovo Ulrike Lunacek said that Kosovo and Serbia should approach EU accession as two independent states.
"I think that the future of Kosovo and Serbia lies within the EU," Lunacek told Radio Free Europe.
She also urged the Kosovo government and EULEX to fight corruption at all levels.

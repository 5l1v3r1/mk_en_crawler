ANKARA, Turkey -- At least one person was killed and two were injured during clashes between protestors and police Wednesday (April 20th) in the southeast city of Bismil, Diyarbakir province. 
The protests, which entered a second day Wednesday, followed a decision by the Higher Election Board to bar 12 Kurdish politicians from running as independents in the June 12th general elections. 
Police used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons to disperse the demonstrators, who hurled Molotov cocktails and fireworks at the officers. 
Local media reported that police also fired gunshots at the protestors, killing one person. 
Pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party leader Selahattin Demirtas cancelled a planned visit to Ankara to discuss the board's decision with President Abdullah Gul. 
Amid the violence, the Election Board said on Wednesday it will begin reviewing its decision to ban the Kurdish candidates for alleged past involvement in terror-related activities.

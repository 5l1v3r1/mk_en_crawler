BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Miroljub Labus announced Monday (11 November) that he does not intend to run in next month's Serbian presidential election.
He said voters are tired of disputes within the ruling coalition and that, in his view, the election cannot change anything.
Labus also announced that he has left Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's Democratic Party, due to its weak support of his prior bid.
He finished second in the runoff against Vojislav Kostunica on 13 October.
The vote was annulled because turnout was below the 50 per cent legal minimum, a provision that has since been revoked by Parliament.
Kostunica has still not announced whether he will run in the 8 December election.
Radical nationalist Vojislav Seselj, who ran third in the October vote, is the only announced candidate at this point.

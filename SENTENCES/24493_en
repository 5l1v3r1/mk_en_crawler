TIRANA, Albania -- Turkish police arrested a senior diplomat from the Albanian Embassy in Skopje on drug-trafficking charges, local media reported Thursday (May 7th).
Officials say Agim Haxhiu, who works as a second secretary in the embassy, used a diplomatic car to travel from Macedonia through Bulgaria and into Turkey, carrying 65kg of heroin.
The arrest purportedly occurred on May 2nd, but authorities announced it only on Thursday.
Albania's foreign ministry has dismissed Haxhiu from his diplomatic post, citing "unjustified abandonment of duties".

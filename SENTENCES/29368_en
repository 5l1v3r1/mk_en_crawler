PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier confirmed on Thursday (September 2nd) he wants the EU in the forefront of mediating talks between Pristina and Belgrade.
"The time has come for Europeans to take over a greater role.
We need to make sure that the international community is on the same page and that we don't have different agendas," Zannier said after meeting with Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi.
The UNMIK chief added that the International Court of Justice's July ruling on Kosovo's independence has created favourable conditions for talks between the two governments on topics of mutual concern.
Krasniqi reiterated that Kosovo and Serbia can discuss topics of mutual interest only as two independent states.

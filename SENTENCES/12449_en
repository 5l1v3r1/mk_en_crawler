BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Leaders of Serbia-Montenegro and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana reached a deal Thursday (7 April) on the election of deputies to the central parliament. 
The move averted a looming constitutional crisis in the loose union between the two republics. 
Under a 2002 EU-sponsored agreement, Serbia and Montenegro had appointed their deputies to a two-year term. 
The new deal provides for representatives in the central parliament to be elected when the two republics hold their regular parliamentary elections. 
Montenegrins will vote in early 2006 and Serbs in 2007. 
Solana said this might have been the last obstacle in the process of bringing Serbia-Montenegro closer to the EU. 
He also praised Belgrade's recent co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.

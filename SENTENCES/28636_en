STRASBOURG, France -- The European Commission (EC) believes that Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) have made considerable progress regarding the EU visa liberalisation process. 
EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Cecilia Malmstrom said on Monday (September 13th) that the EC has evaluated a report by experts who visited Tirana and Sarajevo in July. 
The document is sent next to the European Parliament (EP). 
Full liberalisation will likely be discussed at the Council of Europe by the end of autumn. 
Malmstrom was reporting to the EP's Home Affairs Committee.

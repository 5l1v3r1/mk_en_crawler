ZAGREB, Croatia -- The anti-corruption office, USKOK, launched an investigation Wednesday (August 19th) against former Defence Minister Berislav Roncevic and his deputy, Ivo Bacic, over the so called "truck affair".
A parliamentary committee had determined there is no need to strip Roncevic of his immunity as a member of parliament, in order to launch the investigation.
Prosecutors accuse him in connection with a 2004 deal to purchase 39 military trucks.
The questionable terms of the sale cost the state budget nearly 4.6m euros.

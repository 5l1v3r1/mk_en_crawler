SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Defence Minister Selmo Cikotic said on Monday (December 28th) that Bosnian soldiers could join the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan next year.
Authorities have received a request from NATO but the decision to deploy a unit requires the approval of the tripartite presidency and parliament.
Cikotic voiced hope that the Alliance will offer BiH a Membership Action Plan in the coming months.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH) authorities informed Croatia on Thursday (May 21st) that it should deliver all necessary documents concerning parliament member Branimir Glavas's extradition within the next 40 days.
Croatian Justice Minister Ivan Simonovic said most of these are available now, expediting the process.
He added that legal experts are working on a constitutional amendment that would allow Croatia to extradite citizens abroad if they are crime suspects.
A dual citizen, Glavas fled to BiH earlier this month after receiving a ten-year prison sentence from Zagreb for war crimes committed against Serb civilians during Croatia's war of independence in the early 1990s.
Last week, Bosnian police briefly detained him on an international arrest warrant issued by Croatia.
He obtained his release after the State Court ruled there were no grounds for detention because he had valid BiH citizenship documents.

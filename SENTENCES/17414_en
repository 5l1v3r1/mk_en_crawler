ANKARA, Turkey -- An Ankara court sentenced two Kurdish politicians, the leader of the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) Ahmet Turk and DTP deputy leader Aysel Tugluk -- to 1.5 years in prison on Monday (February 26th).
The two were convicted of breaching the Turkish law on political parties by distributing Kurdish-language political leaflets last year.
The material reportedly backed the terrorist organisation Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and praised imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan.
Turk and Tugluk's lawyer denied the charges and said they may take their case to the European Court of Human Rights.

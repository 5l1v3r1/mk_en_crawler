LONDON, United Kingdom -- Defence Secretary Des Brown met with his Macedonian counterpart, Lazar Elenovski, on Tuesday (January 22nd) to discuss Skopje's NATO integration bid.
Elenovski said he expects Britain to demonstrate its support for the bid both at a NATO meeting Wednesday in Brussels and at the Alliance's summit in April.
London was the last stop of Elenovski's lobbying tour ahead of the Brussels meeting, at which Macedonia is expected to announce it has implemented all reforms necessary for accession.
In other news, the Macedonian parliament adopted legislation Tuesday that regulates conditions public officials must meet.
According to the so-called Lustration Law, which covers the period from 1944 until today, each current and future candidate for public office must sign a declaration stating whether he or she collaborated with Communist-era secret services, including using information gathered by the services.

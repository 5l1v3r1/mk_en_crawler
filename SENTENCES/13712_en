ATHENS, Greece -- The tiny island of Kastellorizo is preparing for an invasion by astronomy fans and scientists ahead of a 29 March total solar eclipse invisible to the rest of Europe. 
Situated in the southeastern Aegean Sea, just a few miles from the Turkish coast, Kastellorizo is the only place on the European continent with a clear view of the eclipse, Greek astronomer Nikos Matzopoulos told AFP . 
Around 1,000 visitors are expected to descend on the island.

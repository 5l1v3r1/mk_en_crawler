ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor reiterated on Monday (September 6th) the government's position that it will not resort to assistance from the IMF in bringing public finances under control.
Her statement was in response to recent media headlines and editorials that such assistance would be required to help the cabinet implement much needed reforms.
Kosor recalled that the government's top priority will be to continue to implement its economic recovery programme, an initiative that has already received backing from both the IMF and the World Bank.
Implementation, she added, will require assistance from local employers and trade unions.

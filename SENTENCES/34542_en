ZAGREB, Croatia -- Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte travels to Zagreb on Monday (6 October) to press the government to arrest retired General Ante Gotovina, indicted for the massacre of ethnic Serbs in 1995. 
Tribunal prosecutors insist the fugitive remains in Croatia, while the government insists he has fled the country. 
After meeting with President Stipe Mesic, Prime Minister Ivica Racan and others over four days, del Ponte will submit a report on Croatia's co-operation to the UN Security Council. 
Britain and the Netherlands have vowed to block the start of Croatia's accession talks with the EU until they are satisfied with the government's co-operation on war crimes.

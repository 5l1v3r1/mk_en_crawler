ZAGREB, Croatia -- A final agreement on the composition of the new ruling coalition can be expected any day, Deputy Prime Minister Damir Polancec said on Thursday (December 20th).
He leads the ruling Croatian Democratic Union's negotiating team in talks with its future partners, the Croatian Peasants' Party and the Croatian Social Liberal Party.
Polancec says that out of 30 topics under discussion, only three remain.
The deadline for forming the new cabinet and winning parliamentary approval of it is January 14th.
Coalition talks were required after parliamentary elections last month gave no party the majority necessary to govern alone.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- During a summit of EU state and government leaders in Brussels on Tuesday (22 March), Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel reportedly proposed that a senior EU delegation visit Croatia to examine issues related to whether Zagreb is meeting its obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal. 
According to media reports, Schuessel suggested that the EU Troika -- including the previous, current and future holder of the rotating EU presidency -- conduct the mission. 
Earlier this month, EU foreign ministers delayed the launch of accession talks with Zagreb, citing insufficient war crimes co-operation.
In other news Tuesday, the leader of the Croatian Farmers' Union, Darko Grivicic, said protests would be launched soon, if the government fails to fulfil measures spelled out in a recent agreement with the farmers' associations. 
Grivicic blamed the cabinet for failing to establish working commissions, as promised.

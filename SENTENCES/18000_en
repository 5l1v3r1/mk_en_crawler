BUCHAREST, Romania -- The chief of Romania's intelligence service has resigned amid a scandal over alleged illegal wiretaps. 
Foreign Intelligence Service Director Claudiu Saftoiu admitted in testimony before a parliamentary commission that he authorised wiretaps with the approval of prosecutors instead of getting permission from a judge, as required by law. 
The move came during an opposition-initiated inquiry into what it describes as illegal activities by President Traian Basescu. 
Saftoiu was a journalist and adviser to the president before being appointed chief of the intelligence service in October.
In other news Monday, Basescu approved a request for an official investigation of Minister of Communications and Information Technologies Zsolt Nagy. 
At issue are allegations of fraud in the energy sector. 
Nagy is suspected of supervising private conversations between former Economy Minister Codrut Seres and an international consultant in energy privatisation. 
Five people, including Seres, are under investigation for espionage and revealing classified information.

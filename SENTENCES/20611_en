BUCHAREST, Romania -- A senior figure in the Romanian Orthodox church was a Securitate informer, the Council for Study of the Securitate Archives reported on Tuesday (October 9th).
According to media reports, Bishop Pimen conducted spying missions abroad, reporting back about Romanian expatriates and clergy members.
While Pimen, who serves as the archbishop of Suceava and Radauti, declined to comment on the matter, a spokesman for the Romanian Orthodox Church defended Pimen's actions, arguing he had collaborated with Securitate to protect the church rather than for personal gain.

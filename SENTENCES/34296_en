ZAGREB, Croatia -- Florence Hartmann, spokeswoman for UN war crimes tribunal prosecutors, welcomed on Wednesday (29 October) a decision by the Croatian government not to implement a move by parliament to provide legal assistance to war crimes suspects or indictees. 
This also means that no access to tribunal-related documentation would be granted to lawyers for fugitive suspects, particularly those representing General Ante Gotovina. 
Hartmann told the local news agency HINA that the government's stance demonstrates that it honours its obligations to The Hague tribunal.

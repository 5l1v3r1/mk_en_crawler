BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian and Kosovo governments signed an agreement Tuesday (6 June) to speed up the return of refugees to the province.
The deal binds both sides to guaranteeing physical and material security, freedom of movement, return of property, reconstruction of burned homes and equal employment opportunities.
According to the UN, Belgrade and Pristina will also work to create an environment that sustains returns.
"The protocol confirms that in spite of differences on various issues, there is a will to co-operate to end the situation of displacement, while duly respecting the right of the internally displaced to return to their homes and to freely choose their places of residence," said UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen.
Referring to a declaration by Kosovo Serb leaders that they would sever ties with Kosovo institutions and UNMIK to protest recent attacks on members of their community, Jessen-Petersen said he was not aware of any specific action being taken to make good on the threat.
He promised that UNMIK will find ways to "enhance security measures and reassure the Serbs that everything is being done".
Meanwhile, Kosovo Serb leader Marko Jaksic said Tuesday that Serb-dominated northern parts of Kosovo will continue to work with UNMIK but would suspend all contacts with the Kosovo government and institutions.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Defence Minister Nikolay Svinarov said Tuesday (22 March) that he opposes gradual reductions in the country's infantry battalion in Iraq. 
He told journalists that he preferred the troops be withdrawn at the end of their tour of duty, probably at the end of the year. 
Defence officials are to meet late Wednesday to draft a decision on the country's military presence in Iraq.
Deployment in Iraq was also the focus of Tuesday's talks between Svinarov and visiting Romanian counterpart Teodor Atanasiu. 
They discussed regional security, particularly the situation in the Western Balkans.
In other news, Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister Plamen Panayotov was in Brussels on Tuesday, where he met with Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn. 
Panayotov says Luxembourg will launch the ratification procedure for Bulgaria's EU accession treaty immediately after its signing on 25 April.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Aurel Cornea, leader of the Free Unions in Education, confirmed on Wednesday (September 30th) that public sector workers will stage a general Monday and as many as 800,000 civil servants are expected to participate. 
They are protesting the single wage bill, which was fast-tracked via a parliamentary vote of confidence. 
An estimated 500 workers protested on Wednesday outside the Bucharest headquarters of the Social Democratic Party and Liberal Democratic Party.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Outgoing NATO Secretary General Lord George Robertson said Thursday (2 October) that the doors of the Alliance are open to Skopje if it perseveres with necessary political and military reforms.
"There is a clear prospect ahead for this country," he told reporters during his farewell trip to Macedonia.
Robertson also said that NATO no longer regards the country as a "future trouble spot" and urged all political forces to honour the terms of the Ohrid Peace Accord as a means of ethnic integration.

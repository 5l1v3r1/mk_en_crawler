BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Democratic Party (PD), senior partner in Romania's ruling coalition, expelled from its ranks Monday (10 July) the deputy mayor of Ramnicu Valcea, Nicolae Dicu, who has been charged with accepting a bribe. 
The PD reportedly also is considering a similar sanction for a second member, Mircia Gutau, who has been implicated in the bribery scandal.
In other news, an independent UN commission has sided with Romania in its dispute with Ukraine over a canal running through the Danube Delta. 
Bucharest protested in 2004 that it was not consulted about the project, as required under UN treaties.

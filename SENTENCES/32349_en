THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Judges at Slobodan Milosevic's war crimes trial expressed concern about completing the case against him.
They adjourned Friday's (1 November) hearing because he complained of exhaustion.
Presiding Judge Richard May told the court of his concerns "in light of [Milosevic's] health and the length and complexity of the case." He asked that prosecutors expedite the process, submitting evidence within seven days.
In other news, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic said Thursday that outgoing Serbian President Milan Milutinovic will be extradited to The Hague tribunal.
Svilanovic made the pledge during an official visit in London, focusing on Yugoslav co-operation with prosecutors.
The Serbian government has refused to hand Milutinovic over before his term in office expires in early January.

TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament decided on Tuesday (19 September) to establish an ad hoc inquiry commission that would check the assets of all senior state officials.
The proposal by the ruling Democratic Party (DP) was passed with the votes of the DP-led majority, as the opposition rejected it.
DP says the initiative is an attempt to bring more transparency into government.
It is also a response to claims by the main opposition Socialist Party that Prime Minister Sali Berisha is hiding his family assets.

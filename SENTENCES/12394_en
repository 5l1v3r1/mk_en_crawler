NEW YORK, United States -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday (9 June) that his government was "distressed" over the UN Security Council's failure to ease economic restrictions on the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. 
He criticised the Council for failing to act on a May 2004 report by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, which recommended the lifting of political and economic sanctions on the breakaway republic. 
Erdogan was in New York for a meeting with Annan following a White House meeting with President George W. 
Bush.

NEW YORK, United States -- Serbian President Boris Tadic addressed the UN General Assembly on Tuesday (September 23rd), trying to persuade member states to back Serbia's initiative to bring the issue of Kosovo's independence before the International Court of Justice.
Tadic said Serbia insists that international law must be observed, noting that Belgrade has chosen a peaceful response to threats against its territorial integrity.
"Your vote in support of this resolution would serve to reaffirm another key international principle at stake -- the right of any member state of the UN to pose a simple, elementary question on a matter it considers vitally important to the competent court.
To vote against is in effect to vote to deny the right of any country -- now or in the future -- to seek judicial recourse through the UN system," Tadic said.
Back in Belgrade, the government adopted a draft resolution on Serbia's policy towards Kosovo, proposing that parliament declare Kosovo's Constitution legally null.
The government argues that the constitution violates international law, UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and Serbia's Constitution.

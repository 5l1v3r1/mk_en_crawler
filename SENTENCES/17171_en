ZAGREB, Croatia -- The trial of retired General Ante Gotovina is not likely to begin before 2008, Vecernji List newspaper reported on Friday (1 September), citing sources at The Hague.
Late next week, Gotovina will appear before UN war crimes tribunal judges for a preliminary hearing regarding his health.
The court is also expected to rule on the possible merger of his trial with those of two other Croatian generals, Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac, a move Gotovina's lawyers are trying to block.
All three generals are charged with crimes against humanity, allegedly committed in the Serb region of Krajina in the summer and fall of 1995.

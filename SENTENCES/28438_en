BUCHAREST, Romania -- The opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) on Wednesday (June 16th) filed an official appeal of the government's fiscal austerity plan with the Constitutional Court, which will review it next week.
The biggest bone of contention is a plan to cut pensions by 15%, via provisions that opposition lawmakers describe as completely unconstitutional.
On Monday, after a stormy parliamentary session, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) managed to get its candidate named to a vacant seat on the court, thus securing a majority of PDL-friendly justices.
Also Wednesday, Prime Minister Emil Boc dismissed rumours of personnel changes in his cabinet, but acknowledged there may be some structural changes.
Rumours swirled ahead of Tuesday's no confidence vote, which the cabinet survived.

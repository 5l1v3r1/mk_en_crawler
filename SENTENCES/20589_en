BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Council for Studying the Securitate Archives said on Thursday (August 9th) that it plans screen all top Orthodox clerics that might succeed the late Teoctist as patriarch of Romania's Orthodox Church for alleged collaboration with the former secret police, the Securitate.
The Council says that after the vetting is complete, the names of former agents would be published.
Some former Securitate officers recently told the press that the late Metropolitan Bishop of Ardeal, Nicolae Plamadeala, was a secret police colonel, implying many of the clergy were enlisted in Securitate.
Teoctist died last week at the age of 92.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EU Special Representative Pieter Feith says the publication Wednesday (October 14th) of the European Commission's Progress Report and Study on Kosovo reflects the gains made over the past year.
"The report also suggests areas where Kosovo authorities can enhance their efforts to implement further reforms in the field of governance, the economy and in strengthening Kosovo's democratic and multi-ethnic foundations," Feith said Wednesday.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said it confirms Kosovo's clear European prospects.
He added that Kosovo institutions are determined to commit more to implementing the standards required for integration in EU institutions.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A pilot deployment of 200 US troops to two Bulgarian bases -- the Novo selo training site and Bezmer air base -- is expected this autumn, says US Ambassador to Sofia John Beyrle.
He announced on Wednesday (March 21st) that this preliminary deployment would be aimed at testing procedures for joint use of the bases as well as organisational and technical capacities.
Eventually, Washington plans to deploy between 2,000 and 3,000 troops in Bulgaria and Romania, to boost stability in the strategic regions of the Black Sea and the Caucasus.

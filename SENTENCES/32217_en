TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Fatos Nano proposed changes to Albania's constitution on Monday (7 October), in a bid to improve the efficiency of the parliamentary system. 
Nano, acting also as leader of the Socialist Party, announced the idea after discussions with his party's executive council. 
He added that a bipartisan committee in parliament would draft amendments related to the election system and said he would look for a wider support in co-operation with other state institutions and opposition leader Sali Berisha. 
The changes would likely take effect before local elections next September.

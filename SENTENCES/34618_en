PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- All 29 countries that have contributed troops to KFOR should step up efforts to strengthen security and stability in the region, said NATO Commander for Southeast Europe US Admiral Gregory Johnson. 
After meeting with new UNMIK chief Harri Holkeri on Tuesday (26 August), Johnson said that NATO could increase troop strength if needed. 
He added, however, that he believes current levels are sufficient.

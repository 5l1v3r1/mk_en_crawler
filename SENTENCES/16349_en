BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn urged Turkey on Wednesday (12 July) to adjust its penal code to fully guarantee the freedom of expression. 
His call came a day after Turkey's top court upheld a six-month jail sentence issued for Hrant Dink, editor of a local weekly published in Turkish and Armenian, for insulting the Turkish state. 
Prosecutors have now indicted a Turkish academic, Elif Shafak of the University of Arizona, for a novel that allegedly insults Turkey.
In other news Wednesday, European Commission Ambassador to Ankara Hansjoerg Kretschmer expressed concern over falling public support for Turkey's EU bid. 
The latest Eurobarometer poll suggests that 44 per cent of respondents support membership now, compared to 85 per cent in 2004.

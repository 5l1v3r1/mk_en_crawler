BERLIN, Germany -- Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday (February 22nd) reiterated his country's position that a solution to the Kosovo issue must be acceptable to both Serbs and ethnic Albanians. 
"No one can impose this decision -- at least Russia will not participate in such a scheme," he warned, during a meeting in Berlin with German counterpart Frank-Walter Steinmeier. 
Lavrov also complained that the goals contained in the longstanding UN Security Council resolution on Kosovo have not been met. 
Refugees have returned in very small numbers and security for the Serb minority is insufficient, he said.
His comment followed a second day of talks in Vienna between Serbian and Kosovo Albanian negotiators, discussing UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's blueprint for Kosovo's future status. 
Neither side reported any progress. 
On Friday, the two delegations are discussing issues related to economy and property.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Maurizio Massari, the head of the OSCE mission in Serbia-Montenegro, said Tuesday (7 October) that his organisation is disappointed that the election law has not been changed for the upcoming Serbian presidential race. 
The OSCE had recommended eliminating the 50 per cent voter threshold during both the first and the second rounds to avoid invalidating the returns. 
Instead, local authorities removed the 50 per cent rule for the second round only.
In other news, British Attorney General Lord Peter Goldsmith visited Belgrade Tuesday and said London wants to assist Serbia in fighting organised crime and bolstering its justice system.

ANKARA, Turkey -- On Monday (30 June), President Ahmet Necdet Sezer vetoed part of a reform package intended to address human rights concerns expressed by the EU. 
The president objected to the removal of an old article that made it a crime to "propagate separatism". 
The government responded by vowing to pass the same bill without changes once again. 
The president would then have no option but to sign it into law.
In other news, Italy's European Affairs Minister Rocco Buttiglione, told reporters Monday that Ankara is not yet ready for EU membership. 
But Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has said he would fully support Turkey's efforts to join the Union. 
Italy assumed the rotating EU presidency from Greece on Tuesday.

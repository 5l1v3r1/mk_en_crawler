BELGRADE, Serbia -- A new poll finds support is roughly equal for the opposition Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), established a year ago by radical Tomislav Nikolic, and President Boris Tadic's ruling Democratic Party.
The NGO Centre for Free Elections and Democracy (CeSID) published its findings Wednesday (August 26th).
Both parties were backed by roughly 30% of voters.
CeSID says the SNS is attracting support because it appears to have abandoned nationalistic rhetoric and turned into a pro-European party.
Serbia's next scheduled general elections are not until May 2012.

ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Simitis and Foreign Minister George Papandreou are lobbying for closer EU ties with neighbouring Turkey.
During his meeting Friday (8 November) with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in Berlin, Simitis stressed that the policy statement of the new Turkish cabinet would be vital in determining Turkey's accession to the Union.
For his part, Papandreou maintained that isolating the country from the European integration process would be a mistake.
He was disagreeing with former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who heads Europe's constitutional convention.
In an interview with Le Monde, published Friday, d'Estaing said that Turkey is not a European country and that its admission would mark the end of the EU.

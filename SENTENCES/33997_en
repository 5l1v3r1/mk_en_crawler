BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Federal Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic told a local radio station on Sunday (2 November) that the UN war crimes tribunal is investigating three more former Serb officials.
He identified them as Blagoje Adzic, former Yugoslav Army chief of staff;
Milan Babic, former president of the self-proclaimed republic of Krajina in Croatia;
and Goran Hadzic, former head of the eastern Slavonia region in Croatia.
Svilanovic said these are expected to be the last Serbs indicted by UN prosecutors but a spokeswoman at The Hague refused to confirm that claim.

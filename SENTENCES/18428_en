PRIZREN, Kosovo, Serbia -- Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku urged local Serbs not to be afraid of independence, saying it would not trigger violence, but rather would help resolve remaining issues. 
During a visit to the ethnically mixed village of Musnikovo near Prizren, he also urged Serbs to return to their homes. 
"Kosovo is theirs too and there would be room for all in Kosovo," he said.
Separately, Friday (January 12th), Ceku urged ethnic Albanians in southern Serbia to participate in the January 21st parliamentary elections in Serbia. 
His call followed a meeting with leaders of local parties from the so-called Presevo Valley. 
Ethnic Albanian parties plan to participate for the first time in years.

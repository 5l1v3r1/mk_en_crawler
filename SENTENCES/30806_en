BELGRADE, Serbia -- The cabinet refuted media speculation Thursday (February 10th) that Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic has offered his resignation. 
The statement came after the daily Blic wrote that a recent rally by the opposition Serb Progressive Party (SNS) has made everybody agree that "a government reshuffle is necessary". 
According to Blic, Cvetkovic offered his resignation to President Boris Tadic over the lack of co-operation and co-ordination among ministries.

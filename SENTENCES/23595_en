ANKARA, Turkey -- Uighur protestors scuffled briefly with the police near the Chinese consulate in Istanbul on Sunday (July 26th).
Local news agencies broadcast footage showing about a dozen chanting protestors trying to break into the consulate.
According to the Anadolu news agency, the demonstrators burned a Chinese flag.
The group was protesting Beijing's actions against the Uighur minority in China.
Violence earlier this month between the Uighur and the Chinese resulted in about 200 deaths in western China.
Turkey has a large Uighur minority.

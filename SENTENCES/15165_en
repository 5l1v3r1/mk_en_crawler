BRUSSELS, Belgium -- UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn met on Thursday (29 June) in Brussels to discuss the Kosovo status talks. 
At a press conference afterwards, Ahtisaari reiterated his opinion that progress in negotiations on Kosovo's future status is impossible without a direct meeting of the two sides. 
On Friday, Ahtisaari is participating in a meeting of political directors from the Contact Group, made up of the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Germany and Russia.

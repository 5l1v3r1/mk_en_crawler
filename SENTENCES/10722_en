ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament voted on Tuesday (9 November) to put two former housing ministers on trial for corruption.
Koray Aydin and Yasar Topcu are accused of rigging tenders and illegally accumulating considerable personal wealth.
They will be tried by the Turkish Constitutional Court, which will sit in Ankara in its other capacity as Supreme Court.
Parliament has already voted to put former Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and five other former ministers on trial, part of the ruling Justice and Development Party's campaign against corruption.
In other news, one Turkish soldier and three left-wing Kurdish extremists were killed in a gun battle in Tunceli on Tuesday.
The clash erupted during an army operation in a local village.

WASHINGTON, United States -- In an annual report issued Monday (14 June), the State Department urged Croatia to step up efforts in the fight against human trafficking.
It said the measures taken so far have been considerable, but still not sufficient.
The report assesses the progress of 140 countries in the fight against human trafficking and puts Croatia in the group of countries that require additional monitoring.
It urges the government to secure adequate financial and political support for the anti-trafficking commission and to show more determination in prosecuting traffickers.

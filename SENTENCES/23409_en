BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic announced details of his constitutional reform initiative on Wednesday (April 29th). 
He told the Vecernje novosti newspaper he would like to see the number of parliamentary members shrink from 250 to 150. 
He also wants the law on party registration and financing revised to effectively consolidate similar parties and limit those with little support. 
He says this will help avoid the present situation where too many parties have representation, each with different commitments to voters. 
He also supports reducing the number of cabinet ministries to send an important public message about the government's readiness to cut spending.

ATHENS, Greece -- Prosecutors on Monday (23 June) filed charges against the agents and crew of a ship found to be carrying 680 tonnes of explosives in Greek coastal waters. 
Shipping Minister George Anomeritis told reporters that the vessel packed the power of "an atomic bomb". 
The crew of the Comoros-flagged Baltic Sky was accused of failing to disclose the nature of the cargo to the coast guard officers who came to inspect it. 
Authorities became concerned after realising the ship had been in the Mediterranean for six weeks without any apparent direction. 
According to the vessel's manifest, the explosives were loaded at Gabes, Tunisia, on 12 May and were to be shipped to a company in Sudan. 
Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said his government had cleared the shipment for use by several legitimate companies. 
Anomeritis, however, said authorities were exploring several versions of events, which include a terrorist plot and a business deal gone bad.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu on Monday (6 June) revealed details about the recent kidnapping and release of three Romanian journalists in Iraq.
The abduction plot, he said, was hatched by the reporters' guide and a wealthy Romania-based Syrian-born businessman who hoped the government would drop fraud charges against him if he arranged the hostages' release.
The situation, according to the president, spun out of control when an Islamic group took control of the three journalists and threatened to kill them.
Bucharest refused to pull its troops out of Iraq as demanded, offering humanitarian aid instead.
The hostages were finally released weeks later on 22 May, following an appeal by the Romania's Muslim community.
In other news, Romania will join Spain and the Netherlands in sending an extra battalion of troops to Afghanistan.
The move is part of NATO's plans to strengthen its peacekeeping presence there during the September elections.

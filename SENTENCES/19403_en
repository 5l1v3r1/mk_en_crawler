BUCHAREST, Romania -- No CIA plane ever landed at Mihail Kogalniceanu, a US air base in Romania, base commander Adrian Vasile said on Sunday (February 24th). 
He was responding to allegations that Washington used the base to transfer suspected terrorists. 
Romanian military staff has access to all buildings at all times, which rules out secret activity by the CIA, Vasile told the AFP. 
The EU recently demanded that Romania and Poland state clearly whether their territories were used to detain or transfer terror suspects.

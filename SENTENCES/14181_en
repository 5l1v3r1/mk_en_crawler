TIRANA, Albania -- NATO Deputy Secretary General Alessandro Minuto Rizzo was in Tirana on Friday (11 November) for talks with President Alfred Moisiu and Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu.
They discussed progress achieved by the country in defence reforms.
In particular, Rizzo lauded the Adriatic Charter initiative, which also comprises Croatia and Macedonia.
Tirana was the first stop on Rizzo's tour of all three Adriatic Charter countries.
Also on Friday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn met with Moisiu and Prime Minister Sali Berisha in Tirana.
He told the leaders that Albania faces two significant tests for its EU integration bid:
judicial reforms and the 2006 local elections.
Signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement does not mark the end of the integration process and the reform effort must be sustained, Rehn warned.

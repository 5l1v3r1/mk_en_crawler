ZAGREB, Croatia -- Ivo Sanader, leader of the major opposition party, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), says his party is ready to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal, if it wins Sunday's (23 November) parliamentary elections.
He said HDZ understands the importance of the issue to the country's bid for EU membership in 2007.
In an interview, however, he implied HDZ would still seek ways to dispute what he called "political indictments".
Also Monday, Croatian Justice Minister Ingrid Anticevic-Marinovic met with her Serbian counterpart, Vladan Batic, in Belgrade.
The officials confirmed that Serbia would return 515 certificates of births, marriages, deaths and land stolen during the conflicts of the 1990s in a bid to resolve disputed claims.
On Tuesday meanwhile, the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague announced the indictment of former rebel Croatian Serb leader Milan Babic, a central figure in the breakaway Krajina Serb republic in the 1990s.
He is charged with murdering and persecuting non-Serbs in an ethnic cleansing campaign.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian police reported that three shots were fired from a moving vehicle in the centre of Belgrade on Saturday evening (13 September). 
Information is still limited, but the incident reportedly took place in front of the Serbian government building, just a few metres from the spot where Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic was gunned down in March. 
Security was immediately increased and vehicles were checked. 
Government officials said the shots indicated the criminals' "state of panic" ahead of major court trials against those charged in the assassination.

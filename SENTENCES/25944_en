SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The interior ministry announced on Thursday (December 17th) that police have arrested members of a crime gang believed responsible for a series of recent kidnappings. 
Ministry Chief of Staff Kalin Georgiev said that 23 people, including the five suspected masterminds of the group, were arrested late Wednesday as part of an action to dismantle the gang, "which has terrorised society over the past two years". 
Bulgaria has seen a surge in kidnaps for ransom recently and authorities predict they will become even more frequent.

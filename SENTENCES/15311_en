ZAGREB, Croatia -- European Parliament (EP) member Elmar Brok paid a visit Friday (25 August) to Croatia and Albania.
In Zagreb, Brok told Prime Minister Ivo Sanader that Croatia is in the last part of the enlargement process -- and he expressed optimism that the country will become a full-fledged EU member before 2009.
In Tirana, Brok met with Prime Minister Sali Berisha and reassured him that the EP would ratify the Stabilization and Association Agreement between Albania and the EU, but he insisted that Albania meet all engagements made in the EU integration process, and called on the country's opposition to actively contribute to the reform process.

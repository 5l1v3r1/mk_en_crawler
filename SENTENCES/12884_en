SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown will tell UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte that Republika Srpska's (RS) war crimes co-operation has ground to a halt, despite progress reported at the start of the year, according to a statement Thursday (2 June) from Ashdown's office. 
The statement also reiterated that full and unconditional co-operation with the war crimes tribunal is a requirement arising from the Dayton Peace Accords, a document RS leaders cite repeatedly when discussing the issue of police reforms.
In other news, Ashdown insisted on Thursday that RS Police Director Dragomir Andan publicly retract comments he made on 10 May, claiming that terrorists from BiH were involved in the preparation and execution of the 2004 train attacks in Madrid. 
Ashdown says the remark was politically motivated and had no evidence to support it.

TRIPOLI, Libya -- Foreign Minister Abdelraham Shalgham said at a press conference Sunday (5 December) that Libya may review the death sentences handed down against five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor, if Bulgaria agrees to compensate the families of more than 400 children infected with HIV.
A court in Benghazi found the medics guilty of infecting the children, purportedly as part of an international conspiracy.
Bulgaria has denied the allegations, and two leading experts on HIV testified that the infection preceded any action by the nurses.
The EU and the United States have condemned the verdict.

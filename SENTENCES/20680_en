PARIS, France -- Scheduled to assume the rotating EU presidency in July, a cabinet minister said on Tuesday (January 8th) that France supports the further expansion of the Union. 
State Minister of European Affairs Jean-Pierre Jouyet told the Financial Times that EU enlargement does not worry him, adding that France supports the possible integration of Balkan countries, including Serbia. 
He indicated that France's position on Europe has changed since 2005, when its voters rejected the draft European Constitution.

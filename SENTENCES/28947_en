WASHINGTON, United States -- Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic reiterated on Sunday (August 8th) that Belgrade is ready for dialogue with Pristina institutions, but stressed that Serbia will not accept Kosovo's secession. 
"The only thing we say 'no' to is the unilateral proclamation of separation," Jeremic told CNN. 
He added that Serbia is defending its constitutional, political and democratic rights, as well as avoiding a dangerous precedent. 
Jeremic also noted "two thirds of the world" do not recognise Pristina's independence, and that Kosovo's status is a divisive issue within the UN, the EU and NATO. 
He was in the United States attending the UN Security Council meeting early last week.

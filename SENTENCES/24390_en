PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Four police stations in Serb-dominated northern Kosovo have decided to cut off official contacts with the regional police directorate in Mitrovica and report only to the EU's EULEX mission, local media reported on Friday (December 12th). 
The decision purportedly was made on Wednesday, after the commanders of police stations in Leposavic, Zubin Potok, Zvecan and in the northern part of Mitrovica met with the head of the EULEX police, Rainer Kuhn.

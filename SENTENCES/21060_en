ANKARA, Turkey -- Thousands of secularists rallied in Ankara on Saturday (February 2nd) to protest government plans to scrap the constitutional ban on wearing headscarves in universities.
An estimated 40,000 people gathered in front of the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk -- the founder of modern Turkey -- and marched to downtown Ankara, shouting slogans.
Protesters are concerned that lifting the ban, in place for more than two decades, would usher in a stricter form of Islam in Turkey and threaten secularism.
Backed by the ruling Justice and Development Party and the main opposition Republican People's Party, parliament is expected to approve the controversial constitutional amendment this week.
Turkey's university deans have denounced the plan.
They warn that lifting the ban would turn Turkey into a religious state.

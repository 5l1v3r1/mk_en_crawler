SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Supreme Administrative Court on Friday (May 29th) overturned a decision by the Central Election Commission (CEC) to deny registration to the right-wing Blue Coalition for the parliamentary elections on July 5th.
The ruling is final and cannot be appealed.
The newly-formed coalition unites the largest right-wing parties -- the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) and the Democrats for Strong Bulgaria (DSB).
On Friday, it sent a letter to the Czech Embassy in Sofia, urging the EU to dispatch observers for the July elections because of the risk the vote could be rigged.
"The CEC, dominated by members of the ruling coalition, is very politicised and is not capable of guaranteeing free and fair elections," the letter read.

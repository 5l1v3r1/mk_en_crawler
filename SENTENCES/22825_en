LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- The government will launch legal proceedings against a Finnish TV station that reported on allegations of corruption against Prime Minister Janez Jansa, according to media Thursday (September 4th).
The government will file a libel suit against the Finnish Broadcasting Company (YLE) and its journalist Magnus Berglund, who accused Jansa of accepting a bribe of several million euros to help clinch a deal between the Slovenian military and Finnish arms maker Patria for the sale of 135 armoured personnel carriers.
Jansa has dismissed the allegations as "completely untrue and absurd".

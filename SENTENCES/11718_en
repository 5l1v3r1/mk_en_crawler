BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The new Republika Srpska government, led by Prime Minister Pero Bukejlovic, was formally inaugurated Thursday (17 February) in Banja Luka.
The inauguration of the new 16-member cabinet followed confirmation by the Office of the High Representative that no irregularities occurred during the routine verification of the nominees.
At the ceremony, Bukejlovic reiterated that his priorities would be strengthening relations with the UN war crimes tribunal and continuing economic reforms.
The previous cabinet of Dragan Mikerevic resigned in mid-December in the wake of sanctions imposed on RS by High Representative Paddy Ashdown.

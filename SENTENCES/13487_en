BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Belgrade must realise that it can never rule Kosovo as it did before 1999 and should adopt a practical approach to negotiations on the province's final status, Rasim Ljajic, Serbia-Montenegro minister for human and minority rights, said on Monday (27 March).
Serbia must be ready to make concessions, he added.
In other news, members of Kosovo's Consultative Group on Communities, made up of ethnic Albanian officials and representatives of minority groups, met in the Albanian city of Durres on Monday.
They discussed a new minority rights package that would be presented to Belgrade in the next round of talks on the province's final status.
The 3 April session will focus on measures that would allow Serbs more self-rule in Kosovo.

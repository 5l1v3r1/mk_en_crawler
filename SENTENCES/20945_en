NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Tassos Papadopoulos and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat were due to meet on Wednesday (September 5th) in a bid to implement an accord sealed 14 months ago. 
Under the deal, the two sides are to establish technical commissions and expert groups that would work together on a mutually acceptable solution to the Cyprus problem.
On Tuesday, Talat met with Michael Moeller, head of the UN peacekeeping mission in Cyprus, telling him Turkish Cypriots see the establishment of a federation as the best solution. 
Papadopoulos, meanwhile, said Greek Cypriots are "committed to achieving a last and functioning solution to the Cyprus problem on the basis of the UN Security Council's resolutions ... 
and the values on which the EU is founded''.

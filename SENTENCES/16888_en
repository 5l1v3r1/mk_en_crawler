ANKARA, Turkey -- Wrapping up a three-day visit to Turkey on Wednesday (October 4th), EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn voiced his belief that Ankara and the EU would step up joint efforts to resolve problematic areas in the accession process.
Speaking at a news conference after a meeting with Turkish Justice Minister Cemil Cicek and Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, Rehn stressed the importance of freedom of speech.
He reiterated a call to change or annul the controversial Article 301 of the penal code, which has led to a number of trials against prominent intellectuals.
He also urged Turkey to accelerate the pace of reforms, and to fully implement the 2005 extended customs union protocol with the EU, including Cyprus.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel echoed that theme Wednesday during her first visit to Ankara, urging Turkey to make good on its promise to open its ports and seaports to Cypriot traffic.
Germany assumes the EU's rotating presidency on January 1st.

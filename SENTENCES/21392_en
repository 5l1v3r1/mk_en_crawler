BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Talks between Serbia, the EU and the UN on the EULEX mission's deployment in Kosovo are under way, media quoted a senior EU official as saying on Thursday (October 30th). 
Still unclear is whether the negotiations will result in a compromise, giving a green light to the deployment of 2,000 EULEX police, judges and prosecutors by November 7th, when the UN Security Council is due to convene. 
The EU mission's aim would be to implement the rule of law throughout Kosovo, including in predominately Serb-populated areas.
In other news, young ethnic Albanians and Serbs clashed on Thursday in the village of Suhadoll, near the divided town of Mitrovica in northern Kosovo. 
Police and KFOR ended up restoring order. 
The clashes apparently erupted when Serbs tried to halt the reconstruction of an Albanian's house.

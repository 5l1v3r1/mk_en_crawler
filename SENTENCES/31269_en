BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU Commissioner for International Co-operation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Prevention, Kristalina Georgieva, was named on Tuesday (November 30th) as European Commissioner and European of the year.
The awards followed an internet vote by readers of the prestigious European Voice weekly, and were handed out at a ceremony in Brussels.
Georgieva, a former World Bank vice-president, became Bulgaria's nominee to the European commissioner's post in February amid broad disappointment with the country's previous nominee, former Foreign Minister Rumyana Zheleva.
Georgieva has been managing the EU's response to large-scale humanitarian catastrophes such as the earthquake in Haiti and flooding in Pakistan.

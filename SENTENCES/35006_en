TIRANA, Albania -- The Albanian-Greek military agreement for the reconstruction of Bisht-Palla base in Durres is close to final approval, following a vote Friday (5 December) by the Greek Parliamentary Defence Committee. 
The measure moves next to the full parliament, where approval is expected. 
Albania's Parliament ratified it in June. 
The accord envisions construction of a command headquarters and personnel accommodations, as well as the deepening of the entrance channel of the Bisht-Palla sea base basin.
Also Friday, former US Ambassador to Tirana Marisa Lino returned for a visit on behalf of UNICEF and in her capacity of a head of the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, Bologna Centre. 
She met with leaders of the ruling Socialist Party but avoided the leader of the opposition Democrats, former President Sali Berisha, whom she had criticised during her years in Albania.

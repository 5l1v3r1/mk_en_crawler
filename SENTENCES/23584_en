SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria (DSB), one of the two largest right-wing parties, lost three more members of parliament Wednesday (January 28th) because of disagreements over the party's coalition strategy. 
Conflicts within the party have existed for a long time, mostly over opposition to the party leader, Ivan Kostov. 
As a result, the DSB will have just 13 seats in parliament, out of 17 won in the 2005 elections. 
The first defection came late in 2006, also because of disagreements with party leadership. 
The three new DSB lawmakers who left the party's ranks announced on Wednesday they will continue their work in parliament but will no longer belong to the party.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- After years of unrest, the Balkans have become one of the safest regions in the world despite widespread corruption and smuggling, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said on Thursday (May 29th) in a report covering Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Croatia, Macedonia, Moldova, Bulgaria, Romania, Montenegro and Serbia. 
"As surprising as it may seem, the Balkans are one of the safest regions in Europe and the stereotype of the Balkans as a gangsters' paradise no longer applies -- though serious problems remain," the executive director of the UNODC, Antonio Maria Costa, told a press conference in Brussels. 
"The vicious link between political instability and crime that plagued the Balkans in the 1990s has been broken," he said. 
According to the study, the homicide rate in the region fell by half over the past nine years and the percentage of theft and assaults is lower than in Western Europe.

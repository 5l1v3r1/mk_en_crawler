ATHENS, Greece -- Parliament approved a tax reform bill Wednesday (April 14th) in an effort to boost revenues amid the unprecedented debt crisis.
A total of 158 of the 300 members of parliament backed the reforms, while 126 voted against it.
Describing the new tax system as "revolutionary", Prime Minister George Papandreou said that the country must turn its back on practices incurring unnecessary costs if there is to be hope of economic recovery.
The reform will increase taxes levied on higher income groups, as well as taxes on the property and income of the Orthodox Church and offshore companies.
It will also end a series of tax breaks.
The move has triggered a series of strikes and protests involving taxi drivers, lawyers, teachers and public transport workers.

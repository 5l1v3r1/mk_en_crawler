TIRANA, Albania -- The head of the Central Election Commission (CEC), Ilirjan Celibashi, criticised the main opposition Democratic Party (DP) Thursday (7 July). 
Celibashi told a news conference that the DP has been pressuring the CEC amid the continued failure to complete the ballot counting and present final results from Sunday's parliamentary vote. 
Celibashi also denied DP accusations that he has held long closed-door meetings with a top official of the ruling Socialist Party, Foreign Minister Kastriot Islami.
Vote counting was further delayed Friday after three small parties -- the Socialist Movement for Integration, the Democratic Alliance and Social Democracy, and the Movement for National Development coalition -- requested a recount of some of the ballots, citing irregularities.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Criminal charges against former President Ion Iliescu for violently ending a miners' riot in downtown Bucharest in 1990 have been dropped due to an incorrectly drafted criminal procedure, General Prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi announced on Friday (December 7th). 
Kovesi added, however, that the investigation continues and Iliescu is still part of the miners' riot case and is to be heard next week. 
The ex-president allegedly sent some 20,000 miners to end demonstrations against his party. 
NGOs say more than 100 people were killed and 1,000 were wounded during three days of violence.

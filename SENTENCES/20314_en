NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Police in the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus are looking for a group of 16 people, most of them athletes from Iraq, who went out for a walk Thursday (January 10th) but never returned to their hotel.
Media reports suggest the group includes members of Iraq's karate, taekwondo and aikido teams, who arrived in the resort of Kyrenia for a match.
The 11 athletes, a trainer and four children are believed to have crossed over to the Republic of Cyprus.

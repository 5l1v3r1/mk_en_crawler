SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Judges decided on Thursday (8 June) to open a trial against two alleged major crime bosses, brothers Krasimir and Nikolay Marinov, known as "The Margins". 
They are charged with conspiracy to murder an underworld rival, Ivan Todorov, and with attempting to murder Nikola Damyanov, a finance expert, and Lyuben Gotsev, a former state security service general. 
The prosecutor's office said this is the first indictment against purported leaders of organised crime and definitely not the last. 
Defence lawyers, however, argued that the trial will be overly influenced by government efforts to impress the EU, which has repeatedly urged Bulgaria to crack down on organised crime.

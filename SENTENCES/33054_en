PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Moving ahead with the EU integration process does not run counter to holding an independence referendum for Montenegro, according to Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic. 
During a live Television Montenegro broadcast, he said Sunday (22 June) that holding a referendum is part of the Belgrade agreement that created the union. 
He also expressed satisfaction with the EU Summit in Thessaloniki, saying the EU's doors are open to Serbia-Montenegro. 
On Saturday, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic suggested the union could enter as early as 2007.
In other news, Djukanovic said Sunday the government stands ready to step in and remove any officials suspected of involvement in a sex scandal related to charges filed by a Moldovan woman. 
Those officials could be sacked despite a controversial ruling that halted prosecution, on the grounds that the woman lacked credibility.The ruling prompted international criticism.

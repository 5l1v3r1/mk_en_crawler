BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Just over a week ahead of the Montenegrin independence referendum, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica pressed the case for maintaining the state union, while his Montenegrin counterpart, Milo Djukanovic, reiterated the arguments for independence. 
Both were addressing the two-day Serbia-Montenegro Summit, organised by TGI Group International. 
The event, which concluded Saturday (13 May), drew together key political figures from both republics, the Serbian Orthodox and Muslim communities, and the European Commission (EC) Delegation in Belgrade.
"Only full statehood, in a modern sense, provides equality," Djukanovic said. 
Kostunica, meanwhile, insisted that "there is nothing more natural for Serbia and Montenegro than to remain and live together".
Miroslav Lajcak, the EU envoy for the independence referendum, reiterated that a pro-independence vote will only be considered valid if it passes a 55 per cent threshold. 
Brussels is less interested in the outcome than in a fair and transparent process, he said. 
Meanwhile, the head of the EC delegation to Serbia-Montenegro, Josep Lloveras, spoke about the state union's EU accession prospects. 
Talks could be relaunched and completed very soon, provided that Belgrade meets its requirements to the UN war crimes tribunal by handing over fugitive indictee Ratko Mladic, he said.

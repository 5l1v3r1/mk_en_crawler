LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- The EU will help find a solution to the Kosovo status issue and will not ignore its responsibilities to the public there, despite the failure of negotiations mediated by the international troika, security chief Javier Solana said on Tuesday (December 18th) in Ljubljana.
After meeting with Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, Solana told reporters there is no major division within the EU over Kosovo, and stressed that a unified EU position would be crucial to a lasting solution.
The UN Security Council begins debating Kosovo's future on Wednesday.
Separately, the EU envoy in the mediating troika, Wolfgang Ischinger, said he is certain that the status process will end peacefully.
Speaking in Berlin late on Monday, Ischinger downplayed the threat of Serbia using military force, should Kosovo declare independence.

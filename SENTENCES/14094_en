WASHINGTON, United States -- Macedonia's Ambassador to the United States, Nikola Dimitrov, told the Washington-based publication Diplomatic Traffic that he is optimistic about a dual-formula approach to resolving the dispute with Greece over its name, which Athens rejects for historical reasons.
Dimitrov, who also is Macedonia's negotiator in UN-mediated talks with Greece on the issue, cited recent international acknowledgement of the constitutional name "Republic of Macedonia".
In its dual-formula approach, Skopje has offered to use a special name in communications with Greece, and the constitutional name in communications with the rest of the world.

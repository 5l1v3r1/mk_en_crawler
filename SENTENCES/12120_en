SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown welcomed on Tuesday (14 December) the election of the new Mostar mayor, Ljubo Beslic, which resulted from a political consensus among the main ethnic political forces -- the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA).
Beslic's candidacy was endorsed at a session of the Mostar City Council earlier Tuesday after HDZ and SDA reached an agreement on the distribution of top jobs in the city administration.

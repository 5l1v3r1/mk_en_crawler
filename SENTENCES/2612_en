Each year, a series of summer festivals turns Macedonia into a destination of choice for lovers of classical music, opera, theatre, poetry, blues and jazz.
This cultural feast begins in May, with the renowned international Opera Evenings, and comes to a close at the end of August, with the Struga Poetry Evenings and the grand finale, the week-long Skopje Jazz Festival.
Some of the world's most famous artists and performers have joined these events.
Spanish tenor Jose Carreras opened this summer's Ohrid Festival.
The Skopje Jazz Festival has featured greats such as Ray Charles, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, Tito Puente and Cecil Taylor.
Joseph Brodksy, Allen Ginsberg and Justo Horhe Padron are some of the poets who have read at the Struga Poetry Evenings, which this year will award the Golden Wreath to W.S.
Merwin.
The Ohrid Festival was launched in 1961 with performances of music by Handel, Mozart, Beethoven and Grieg.
In the 44 years since then, all of the great classical works have been peformed many times by a variety of artists.
Hundreds of theatre performances and dozens of art and photography exhibitions have also taken place.
Plays by Shakespeare, Sophocles, Aristphanes, Brecht, Moliere and many other foreign and domestic playwrights have been performed on the Ohrid Theatre stage.
According to the Directorate of Culture and Art, this year's Skopje Summer Festival will include more than 70 cultural events.
In addition to classical music concerts, it will host blues, jazz and folk performers who will play at different venues around town.
Almost one out of three of the artists will be visiting from abroad.
Over the past ten summers, the summer cultural season in Macedonia has attracted thousands of members of the aid and peacekeeping missions in the Balkans.

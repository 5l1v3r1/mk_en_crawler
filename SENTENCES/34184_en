PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova and former KLA leader and current politician Hashim Thaci travelled to Urosevac on Thursday (10 July) to meet representatives of the province's minorities.
The move came as local ethnic Albanian leaders stepped up efforts to persuade refugees to return to their homes.
The leaders of Kosovo issued a statement last week promising returnees a better future.
Washington has pledged $14.4m to help the return of refugees.
In other news, a new report by the UNDP and the Swiss-based Small Arms Survey says there are 460,000 firearms in civilian hands in Kosovo.
Robert Piper, UNDP's representative in the province, said this arsenal impedes Kosovo's development.
KFOR has so far destroyed 18,000 firearms.

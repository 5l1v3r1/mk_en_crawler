PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The anti-corruption agency said on Thursday (March 11th) that public tenders are a serious source of corruption.
Presenting a report on the agency's activities in 2009, director Hasan Preteni cited the procurement office and court inefficiency as serous areas of concern in fighting graft.
Preteni warned that current procurement legislation protects government officials, which hampers investigations into their alleged involvement in corruption cases.
Preteni also announced that the number of corruption cases reported in 2009 grew by nearly 35%, compared to the previous year.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Romanian President Traian Basescu said on Thursday (January 31st) his country will not recognise a possible declaration of independence by Kosovo because a similar step could send wrong signals to other minorities and threaten international law. 
"My country will never recognise an independent Kosovo," regardless of whether it's a unilateral or co-ordinated decision, Basescu said after a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer in Brussels. 
He added that more time is needed for internationally mediated talks. 
Cyprus, which also opposes Kosovo's independence, reiterated that it does not intend to change its position. 
Foreign Minister Erato Kozakou-Markoullis said during a visit to Helsinki that Cyprus respects the position of the rest of the EU, but believes that a possible separation of the province would represent a violation of international law.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Former fashion model Katarina Rebraca pleaded not guilty Friday (November 5th) to charges she embezzled hundreds of thousands of euros from a breast cancer prevention foundation she heads. 
As her trial opened in Belgrade, she denied having used the money for personal needs, insisting instead that it went to public awareness campaigns. 
Rebraca was arrested in April along with four associates. 
The Katarina Rebraca Charity Fund, established four years ago, has been raising money for Serbia's first centre for early breast cancer diagnosis. 
Police suspect Rebraca stole more than 370,000 euros in donations.

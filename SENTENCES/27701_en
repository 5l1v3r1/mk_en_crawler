PRISTINA, Kosovo -- NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Friday (May 21st) that NATO will continue downsizing its troops in Kosovo.
He said that the Alliance plans to cut its troops to 2,000, but said the timeline will depend on the situation on the ground.
Rasmussen also said that Kosovo's security situation has generally improved.
"Of course, there are political complications and scattered security incidents, but the general trend is stable and moving in the right direction," he said.
NATO downsized its troops in Kosovo from about 14,000 to 10,000 in January.

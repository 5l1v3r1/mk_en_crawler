ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan again on Sunday (March 20th) urged Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to step down and insisted on an immediate end to all violence in the North African country. 
He has urged Gaddafi to step down on several occasions since the crisis began last month.
In Ankara, meanwhile, State Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc on Sunday criticised the launch of military operation by Western coalition forces in Libya. 
According to him, starting the war actions immediately after the UN Security Council resolution was passed indicates double standards.

TIRANA, Albania -- The head of the EU delegation in Albania, Ettore Sequi, said on Wednesday (April 27th) that Albania needs to commit to reforms in order to move ahead in its EU integration bid.
"For Albania to become an EU member, it needs to grant citizens rights in their country and then join other nations and citizens,â Sequi said during a round table on the benefits of visa liberalisation, organised by the NGO European Movement.
Albanians have been enjoying free movement since the end of 2010.
Lifting the visa regime was a big step, Sequi said, but pointed out that EU membership involves democratic maturity.

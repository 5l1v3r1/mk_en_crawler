ISTANBUL, Turkey -- At least 580 people were arrested during clashes between leftist demonstrators and police in Istanbul on Tuesday (May 1st). 
Riot police and Special Forces fired tear gas and water canons to break up crowds in the city's main Taksim Square and other areas. 
The protesters had gathered to mark an incident 30 years ago in which an unknown gunman opened fire on a May Day demonstration. 
Thirty-four people were shot or trampled to death in the ensuing mayhem. 
The local authorities have not allowed demonstrations in the square since 1980. 
On Tuesday they permitted a small group of trade union officials to lay wreaths at the site of the killings. 
Hundreds of people then began to gather in the square.
In neighbouring Greece, a May Day strike forced Olympic Airlines to cancel 42 flights to Britain, Cyprus, Egypt, France, Germany, Romania and Turkey, as well as to some of the Greek islands. 
Hundreds of passengers were left stranded in airports. 
Transport workers also planned brief walkouts in Athens.
In Albania, trade unions demanded better working conditions and urged the Democratic Party-led government of Sali Berisha to keep pre-election pledges for higher wages.

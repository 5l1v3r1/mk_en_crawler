BUCHAREST, Romania -- Nine people were reported dead and six missing after the latest floods and mudslides in northern Romania this week, according to an announcement of the Romanian Interior Ministry on Friday (23 June).
Over 150 people remained homeless after their houses were destroyed in the torrential rains.
In neighbouring Bulgaria, a woman and a child were injured, when the roof of a Billa market store collapsed under a heavy rainfall in Sofia on Friday.
The storm caused interruptions of traffic, communications and electricity in several parts of Sofia, as well as flooding of schools, residential blocks and the National Gallery for Foreign Art.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Marc Grossman, the US Undersecretary for Political Affairs, said Tuesday (30 March) that certification by the US administration of Serbia's war crimes co-operation could be postponed. 
Grossman is in Belgrade talking to authorities about the issue. 
The US administration had given Serbia until Wednesday to prove its co-operation or risk the loss of $100m in aid.
In other news, the Serbian Parliament adopted legislation Tuesday that would allow war crimes indictees being tried in The Hague to receive compensation for lost salaries and expenses related to their confinement. 
The controversial measure was proposed by the ultranationalist Radicals and supported by Slobodan Milosevic's Socialists.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The government on Tuesday (November 25th) accused a Greek Cypriot oil exploration mission in the Mediterranean of violating its territorial rights and vowed to lodge protests with international agencies over the incident.
Ankara was reacting to Cyprus's accusations that Turkey recently violated international law by obstructing its oil exploration activities.
That incident happened on November 13th when Turkish warships prevented a Norwegian-flagged vessel commissioned by the Cypriot government from conducting an exploratory survey within Cyprus's exclusive economic zone in the Mediterranean Sea.
Turkey claimed that the boat had entered its territorial waters.
"We consider it an adventurous move to carry out activities on Turkey's continental shelf at a time when negotiations for a comprehensive settlement are under way in Cyprus," Turkish foreign ministry spokesman Burak Ozugergin noted, adding Ankara plans to lodge official protests with international bodies against the Greek Cypriot administration in Cyprus.
Earlier, Cypriot President Demetris Christofias sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, accusing Ankara of continuing "its unacceptable policy of questioning the sovereign right of the Republic of Cyprus".
Separately Tuesday, Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat held their tenth round of talks aimed at reunifying the divided island.
They discussed the proposed federal judiciary, prosecution and police.

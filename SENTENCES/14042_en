TIRANA, Albania -- Authorities reportedly have suspended a privatisation deal for 76 per cent of the fixed-line phone operator Albtelecom. 
Late last week, parliament failed to ratify the sales contract, sealed with a Turkish consortium in mid-June. 
According to the media reports, the legislature -- dominated by the ruling Democratic Party -- refused to approve the deal signed with Turk Telekom-Calik Enerji by the former Socialist-led government. 
The Socialists (SP) have protested the suspension, noting the deal was overseen by a Western consultant and approved by the World Bank.
In other news, almost one-third of the SP chairmanship was replaced Saturday (15 October) at a session of the General Steering Committee. 
The reshuffle was made at the request of the new SP leader, Edi Rama, who said the party needed serious reform after its defeat in the July parliamentary elections.

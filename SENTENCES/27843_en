LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Parliament's foreign policy committee on Thursday (June 24th) okayed opening the judiciary negotiation chapter of EU accession talks with Croatia at the next inter-governmental conference.
Slovenian Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar says Zagreb will open this chapter by the end of the month, since the issue of Ljubljanska Banka will be discussed during talks on a separate, free movement of capital chapter.
Zagreb argues that the former Ljubljanska Banka owes 172m euros to Croatian citizens who deposited funds with it before the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
Zagreb has banned Nova Ljubljanska Banka's from accessing Croatia's financial market until the issue is resolved.

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- A poll conducted by a US firm, National Democratic Institute (NDI), found that Montenegro's ruling coalition still enjoys the most public support. 
The poll, released Monday (31 May), showed that 36 per cent of voters back the ruling coalition, while 33 per cent favour the opposition. 
About 29 per cent said they support the NGO Group for Change. 
Yet 62 per cent of those interviewed called for a government made up of experts, an idea suggested by the opposition and some NGOs.

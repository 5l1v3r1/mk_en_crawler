SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Republika Srpska (RS) government said on Wednesday (November 14th) that it would do everything possible to end the political crisis in the country. 
The cabinet denied that it had failed to present viable legal arguments against changes to the laws on the Council of Ministers and the BiH parliament that High Representative Miroslav Lajcak proposed on October 19th. 
The government insists it has sufficiently proven to OHR experts how the amendments to the quorum and ethnic voting rules would allow Serbs to be systematically outvoted by majority Muslims. 
Talks between the RS and those OHR experts will continue on Monday.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Defence Minister Boris Tadic told a Belgrade newspaper on Sunday (11 May) that an investigation has found members of the armed forces have maintained ties with war crime suspects wanted by the UN tribunal.
He said the last known contact with Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic was on 15 May 2002.
Tadic added that an investigation is under way to determine if any officers are continuing to protect the indictees.
According to the minister, one other top suspect, former Yugoslav Army officer Veselin Sljivancanin, was seen as recently as 16 January, trying to gain entry to a military facility.
He was turned back by the guards and has not been seen since.
Tadic is the first official to admit that the army has helped war crime suspects evade justice, an allegation made repeatedly by chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte.

TRIPOLI, Libya -- Judges meeting in court Sunday (May 6th) decided that they would rule on the slander case filed against six foreign medics -- including five Bulgarian nurses -- on May 27th. 
The six already have been sentenced to death for allegedly infecting hundreds of children with HIV. 
The slander charges were filed by several police officers, whom the medics say tortured them into confessing to the HIV infections. 
The sixth defendant is a Palestinian doctor. 
He and the Bulgarians have already spent more than eight years in custody.

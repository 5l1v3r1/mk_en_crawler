SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Foreign Minister Solomon Passy said on Saturday (10 May) that his country would back the United States and Britain in their initiative to lift sanctions against Iraq.
Bulgaria, a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, has been one of the staunchest supporters of the US-led drive to disarm the regime of Saddam Hussein.
In other news, Finance Minister Milen Velchev ordered an investigation Saturday into allegations that Sofia Airport Customs Director Boryana Emilova is involved in a smuggling ring.
She has been temporarily removed from her post.
Reports in local media suggest her name appeared in a recent interior ministry report on organised crime.

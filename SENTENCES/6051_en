Kosovo's justice system is considered one of the most important parts of the administration of the new state.
But the prosecutor's office is short of personnel and needs restructuring, says General Prosecutor Ismet Kabashi in an interview with SETimes.
SETimes:
How functional is the institution of the prosecutor's office, and what can be improved?
Ismet Kabashi:
The structure of the Kosovo prosecutorial system is relatively non-functional -- there are three levels of the prosecutor's offices with different powers, which cannot effectively handle the number of municipal court cases.
There are only seven municipal prosecutor's offices, with each covering four or more municipal courts.
The new Law on the State Prosecutor's Office was approved, which will require nine prosecutor's offices -- seven basic, one appeals and one state -- starting on January 1st, 2013.
SETimes:
How protected are the prosecutors in Kosovo, and what can be done to help them work independently?
Kabashi:
Kosovo prosecutors, appointed according to the Kosovo Constitution, are permanent in their duties after the process of appointment and re-appointment.
To exercise the permanent function of the prosecutor's office is a condition for independence.
The prosecutor's financial independence is secure, as the Kosovo Prosecutorial Council proposes and manages the budget of the offices.
Any prosecutor that [feels] in danger has the right to protection.
SETimes:
Which cases have priority at the moment?
Kabashi:
Organised crime and corruption.
Election offence cases are also a priority.
SETimes:
Which are the most sensitive cases handled by the Kosovo prosecution, and how are they run?
Kabashi:
Organised crime, corruption, money laundering and the gray economy are the most sensitive areas for the time being.
The task force against corruption and organised crime was formed, and a prosecutor is appointed for each office to deal with corruption cases.
Police officers are also assigned to each regional headquarters to support the prosecutors and help solve cases.
SETimes:
How protected is the prosecutor's office from political influence?
Kabashi:
The office is fully independent from political influence.
By law, every prosecutor can function freely under the prosecutorial system.
The prosecutor has a permanent function, enjoys immunity and enjoys economic independence.
SETimes:
How is your co-operation with EULEX in this field?
Kabashi:
Our co-operation with EULEX is good.
There are many cases in which local prosecutors work in mixed teams and these have been proven as successful.
SETimes:
How do you envision the prosecutor's office in the future?
Kabashi:
Kosovo still has a small number of prosecutors.
There are 78 in total, while we must have at least 148, according to the 2009 workload.
The lack of prosecutors results in negative consequences -- firstly, quality of work, secondly, lack of potential area specialisation of the prosecutors.
However, now we have the Prosecutorial Council to govern the system, which will be a key factor in the creation of the policies to strengthen the prosecutorial system.

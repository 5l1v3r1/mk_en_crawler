VIENNA, Austria -- Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey have joined Austria and Hungary in an effort to build a pipeline that would bring natural gas from the Caspian region to Central Europe. 
The energy ministers of the five countries signed an agreement to proceed with the 4.6 billion-euro project, which is to be completed by 2011. 
Five companies -- Turkey's Botas, Bulgaria's Bulgargaz, Transgaz of Romania, Hungary's Mol and Austria's OMV Gas -- have formed a joint venture, Nabucco Gas Pipeline International, to build the 3,300km pipeline. 
The EU has endorsed the project, which could potentially reduce its dependency on Russian natural gas.

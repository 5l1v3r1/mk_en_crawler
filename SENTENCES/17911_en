BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government completed the legal procedures Tuesday (March 20th) for the return of the Peles and Pelisor castles to the former Romanian King Mihai I. 
Both were confiscated when Mihai was ousted by the communist regime some 60 years ago. 
Peles is viewed as one of the most beautiful castles in Romania, and is one of the popular tourist attractions, complete with an art gallery and museum. 
Under the agreement, the king would sell the castle to the state for 30m euros by the end of the year, under the condition it remains a museum. 
The other castle in Pelisor will serve as a museum for three more years, then become a residence of the royal family.

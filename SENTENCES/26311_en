SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The police detained on Tuesday (March 16th) a dozen of people in Bratunac and Srebrenica on suspicions of inciting prostitution and sexual abuse of a minor. 
Among those arrested are local officials, teachers, police officers and an imam. 
The house of Security Minister Sadik Ahmetovic in a village near Srebrenica has also been searched. 
The operation was carried out after a minor Roma girl, student at a school in Bratunac, told the police that she was sexually abused by several people. 
Republika Srpska (RS) Interior Minister Stanislav Cadjo refused to comment whether Ahmetovic was involved in the affair but voiced regret that there are police officers among the arrested. 
Ahmetovic himself was interrogated by the police and said that he has nothing to do with the case.

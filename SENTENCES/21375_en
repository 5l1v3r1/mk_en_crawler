BUCHAREST, Romania -- Four NATO warships have docked at Constanta on Romania's Black Sea coast, local media reported on Monday (August 25th).
The German warship Luebeck arrived on Saturday.
The Spanish warship Juan de Bourbon and Poland's General Pulaski arrived on Sunday morning, while the USS Taylor arrived from the United States early Monday.
They will hold joint exercises with Romania's King Ferdinand warship in Romanian territorial waters.

The exercises begin on Thursday and are expected to end on September 10th.

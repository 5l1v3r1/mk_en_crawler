BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Constitutional Court ruled on Wednesday (May 4th) against opposition appeals of the wage cap in education law and the social code law, thus clearing them for promulgation. 
The cabinet approved the laws using the accountability procedure on April 19th, leaving the opposition the opportunity to file no-confidence motions against the cabinet. 
Yet, the opposition alliance Social-Liberal Union (USL) opted instead to challenge the measures before the Constitutional Court and threatened to submit s criminal complaint against Prime Minister Emil Boc. 
The so-called wage cap was introduced to avoid making good on steep salary hikes in the education sector, promised in 2008 -- hikes, Boc says, the budget cannot withstand.

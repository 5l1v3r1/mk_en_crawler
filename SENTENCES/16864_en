SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Outgoing Prime Minister Adnan Terzic says BiH would not enter the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) initiative unless Croatia and Serbia agree to amend some clauses of their bilateral Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with BiH. 
In an interview in Sunday's (November 5th) edition of Dnevni avaz, Terzic said BiH views some of the provisions -- specifically, those relating to duty-free imports of certain food items -- as damaging. 
Ten Southeast European states are expected to seal the CEFTA accord next month.

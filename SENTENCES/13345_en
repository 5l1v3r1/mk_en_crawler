SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown delivered his final warning on Thursday (22 September) to the SDS-led Republika Srpska (RS) government, urging them to adopt the police reform proposal based on the EU's three principles. 
Otherwise, he said, expect negative consequences to the RS leadership, which would be also felt by the citizens of BiH. 
Ashdown was accompanied by US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney, British Ambassador to BiH Matthew Rycroft and Michael Humphreys, head of the EC delegation to BiH. 
Immediately afterwards, the RS government announced it will soon introduce a brand new initiative for police reforms. 
The matter is crucial to the launch of Stabilisation and Association talks with the EU.

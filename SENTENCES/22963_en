TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha on Thursday (April 3rd) praised the hard-won reforms that created conditions necessary for Albania to join NATO. 
"The reforms started and shall continue in a systematic way and the results achieved up to now shall be irrevocable," Basha said after Albania was invited to become member of the Alliance at the organisation's summit in Bucharest. 
He added that the process of integrating into NATO is another test of Albania's capacities.
The next step is two rounds of negotiations with NATO and the drafting of an action plan that will outline how to proceed with reforms.

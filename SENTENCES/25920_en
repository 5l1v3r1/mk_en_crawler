PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The NATO Commander of Allied Joint Force Command Naples Admiral Mark Fitzgerald said on Friday (March 19th) that the transfer of the responsibility for the protection of a Serbian monument of Gazimestan from KFOR to the Kosovo police is a result of improved security situation in the country.
Fitzgerald made the statement in Pristina where he held talks with KFOR Commander Lieutenant General Markus Bentler of Germany, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and President Fatmir Sejdiu.
He said that KFOR has no mandate to deal with the implementation of the political plan for northern Kosovo.
The government's strategy for the north envisages integration of the Serb-majority with Pristina institutions.

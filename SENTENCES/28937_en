ATHENS, Greece -- Doctors in Thessaloniki said on Sunday (August 8th) that they suspect three elderly patients who died of encephalitis recently may have been infected with a rare virus. 
Of 22 patients hospitalised since Friday, seven have been told to stay in hospital, and two of them are "strongly suspected" of having the so-called West Nile virus, which is commonly spread by mosquitoes. 
Results of laboratory tests are expected later Monday. 
Many people contaminated with the West Nile virus never get sick at all, but some develop potentially deadly meningitis and encephalitis.

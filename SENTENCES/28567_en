PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci has dismissed the chief executives of three agencies in an effort to fight corruption.
In an announcement Tuesday (April 13th), Thaci's office said the officials headed up the Forest Agency, Statistical Office and Cadastral Agency.
The move follows the replacement of six ministers in late March as part of a government reshuffle.

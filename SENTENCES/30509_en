VIENNA, Austria -- Former Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, who was arrested in Austria in early December for suspected criminal actions and abuse of power, has filed a complaint against his detention, prosecutors in Salzburg announced on Thursday (January 13th). 
His detention was extended by 30 days late last month on the grounds Sanader is a flight risk who might try to tamper with evidence. 
He had asked to be released during the extradition procedure. 
The complaint he has now filed must be reviewed by the court, with a ruling expected in ten days to two weeks. 
That postpones a hearing in Sanader's case that was scheduled for January 27th.

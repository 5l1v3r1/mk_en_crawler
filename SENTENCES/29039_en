SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Bulgarian and Russian governments indicated on Tuesday (July 6th) they are willing to co-operate in the energy sector. 
Representatives of the two countries met in Sofia to discuss joint energy projects, including a proposed second nuclear power plant in Belene and the South Stream natural gas pipeline, as well as new gas delivery contracts. 
They hammered out a road map for the construction of the Belene plant; objectives include finding European investors, determining the cost, deciding on financing, and detailing where the produced energy will be sold and at what price. 
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said the two sides had reached an agreement that pushes the cost of the project to 7 billion euros. 
That is 3 billion euros higher than the original estimate. 
Some experts say the actual cost will be closer to 10 billion euros.
As for the South Stream natural gas pipeline, the two sides have yet to agree whether the existing pipes will be included in the project network. 
Borisov said negotiations will continue later this week in Moscow.

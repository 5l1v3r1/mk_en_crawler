BUCHAREST, Romania -- An aide to President Traian Basescu, Adriana Saftoiu, said on Tuesday (11 July) that she has gone to prosecutors about pressing charges against Defence Minister Teodor Atanasiu.
She refused to disclose the exact nature of the charges.
However, they may be connected to accusations Atanasiu has made, alleging the aide provided "off the record" information to reporters.
Relations between Basescu, on one side, and Atanasiu and Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, on the other, have grown strained over Romanian troop deployments in Iraq.
Basescu meanwhile criticised Tariceanu's cabinet for focusing lately on topics which were "not part of the governing programme".
Basescu's remarks followed a swearing-in ceremony Tuesday for new Deputy Prime Minister Bogdan Pascu.
Also Tuesday, the Bucharest Court of Appeals ordered the 29-day detention of Ramnicu Valcea Mayor Mircia Gutau, who is suspected of involvement in a bribery scandal.
He was first arrested on 7 July and was expelled last week from the ruling Democratic Party.
In neighbouring Bulgaria, meanwhile, Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev has decided to sack two prosecutors, Nikolay Ganchev and Lyuling Matev.
A recent investigation found they had ties to organised crime bosses.
The request becomes official next week after Velchev returns from a visit to the United States.

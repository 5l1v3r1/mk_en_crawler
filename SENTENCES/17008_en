BELGRADE, Serbia -- European Commission (EC) Ambassador to Belgrade Josep M. Lloveras said on Wednesday (2 August) that while the EC has no stance on the outcome of the Kosovo status talks, it hopes a solution is found soon.
Lloveras told national RTS TV that the Kosovo issue is not a matter of trading and must not be approached that way.
He stressed that the EC wants to see Kosovo as a multiethnic society with a European perspective.
Also Wednesday, an expert team from the office of the UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari visited Belgrade and met with representatives of the Serbian negotiating team.
They focused on issues related to the protection of cultural and religious heritage in Kosovo.
In other news, KFOR announced on Wednesday that 200 more German troops are being deployed in the northern part of the province.
The goal is to strengthen security and control potential tensions.

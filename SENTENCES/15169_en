BELGRADE, Serbia -- The team of Serbian negotiators for the Kosovo status talks met behind closed doors Monday (28 August), and issued a statement criticising recent comments by UN special envoy for status talks Martti Ahtisaari. 
Belgrade says Ahisaari was not acting according to the mandate he received from UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, when he said that the policies of Slobodan Milosevic "must be taken into account in the process of finding a solution for the future status of Kosovo". 
The team went on to say that Serbia will take diplomatic measures to mitigate the negative consequences of Ahtisaari's statement.
Also Monday, Beta news agency reported that UNMIK and the Kosovo government have prepared and forwarded to the European Commission an action plan on implementation of Kosovo's European partnership. 
Two main tasks are improving ethnic relations and fighting corruption.
In other news Monday, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Ivana Dulic-Markovic was in The Hague to meet with chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte. 
No details of their discussion were provided.

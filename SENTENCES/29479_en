BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Emil Boc presented two options at a meeting with lawmakers from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) late Wednesday (September 1st), the Gandul daily reported.
Boc suggested either a government reshuffle or the resignation of the entire cabinet.
This followed an announcement by the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) and National Liberal Party (PNL) that they will file a no-confidence against Boc's cabinet by year's end to reverse a 5% hike in the VAT and a 25% cut in public wages.
The two parties control 214 of the 471 seats in parliament.
Gandul reported that PDL lawmakers opted to replace some ministers, because it only requires the president's consent.
The prime minister announces nominees, who the president either approves or rejects.

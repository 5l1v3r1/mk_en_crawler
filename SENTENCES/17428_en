TRIPOLI, Libya -- A fourth Libyan plaintiff has joined the slander trial against five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor, sentenced to death for allegedly infecting hundreds of Libyan children with HIV. 
The criminal defamation trial stems from testimony by the nurses and the doctor, who said they were tortured into making false confessions. 
On Sunday (April 22nd), police officer Harb Amer joined colleagues Juma Mishri and Osama Awedan and doctor Abdulmajid Alshoul in denying those allegations. 
The court set the next hearing for April 29th.

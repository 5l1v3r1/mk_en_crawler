ANKARA, Turkey -- Army General Zeki Es has been arrested in connection with a landmine explosion that killed six Turkish soldiers in southeast Turkey a year and a half ago, local media reported on Sunday (November 7th).
Initially, authorities believed that the May 2009 attack was staged by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
But in September, a voice recording surfaced online, allegedly of a phone conversation between Es and Major General Gürbüz Kaya.
In it, Es is heard acknowledging that he gave orders for the mine to be planted in Hakkari province for security purposes, while Kaya consoles him for his "mistake".
After the blast, Turkey staged air strikes against the PKK across the border in northern Iraq.

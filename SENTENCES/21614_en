SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Federation of BiH (FBiH) lawmakers adopted a law Friday (October 24th) spelling out an oversight mechanism and a system of sanctions to ensure proper controls over the work and behaviour of public officials in the entity.
Republika Srpska lawmakers adopted a similar law in July.
In a statement Friday, the Office of the High Representative (OHR) welcomed the move in FBiH, stressing that harmonised legislation is particularly important in establishing controls over state officials before certification of early election results.
"This law is an important piece of legislation as it strengthens the rule of law, good governance and the fight against corruption in Bosnia and Herzegovina," the OHR concluded.
Also Friday, Brcko Supervisor Raffi Gregorian enacted the Law on Conflicts of Interest in the Institutions of Brcko District.

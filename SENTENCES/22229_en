BELGRADE, Serbia -- A court Thursday (June 12th) sentenced three former members of a paramilitary group to prison for the 1992 killings of Muslim civilians in eastern BiH. 
Dragan Slavkovic, Ivan Korac and Sinisa Filipovic received sentences of 15, 13 and three years, respectively. 
All were members of the paramilitary "Yellow Wasps" group, which was responsible for killing at least 25 Muslim civilians in the Zvornik area in 1992. 
Serb war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic expressed disappointment with the sentences. 
He had sought the maximum of 20 years for each of the three.

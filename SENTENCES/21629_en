BELGRADE, Serbia -- Former Serbian Radical Party (SRS) deputy leader Tomislav Nikolic announced on Wednesday (September 24th) that his new political party is called the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS).
He told journalists the party will be part of the opposition, but rather than "political enemies" it will have "opponents".
Nikolic resigned from the SRS earlier this month, after a disagreement with leader Vojislav Seselj over the party's position on ratifying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.

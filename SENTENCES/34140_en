TIRANA, Albania -- Italy is weighing into a simmering dispute over Mother Teresa's origins. 
Earlier this week, Albanian politicians criticised an effort by Macedonia to erect a statue of Mother Teresa in Rome with an inscription suggesting she came from Macedonia. 
On Tuesday (15 July), Italian Ambassador to Albania Attiglio Massimo Iannucci issued a statement saying Mother Theresa was indeed Albanian.

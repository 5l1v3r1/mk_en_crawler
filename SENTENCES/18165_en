ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan indicated on Thursday (April 12th) that his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) may wait until the last minute before announcing its presidential candidate.
The registration deadline is April 25th, with the election by Parliament expected shortly thereafter.
Local media have been speculating that Erdogan himself will run for the post, in a bid to succeed Ahmet Necdet Sezer.
However, analysts say Erdogan's Islamist roots will be an issue among secularists.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- More than 1,000 Kosovo Serbs demonstrated in the town of Granica on Wednesday (9 April), protesting the transfer of powers from UNMIK to local institutions.
The rally came a day after the Transfer Council held its first session in Pristina, effectively starting the initiative.
The leader of the Serb National Council of Northern Kosovo, Milan Ivanovic, urged UNMIK head Michael Steiner to adhere closely to the UN Security Council resolution on Kosovo.
Serbs in the province fear the transfers will lead to Kosovo's independence.

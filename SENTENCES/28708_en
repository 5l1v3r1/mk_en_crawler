JERUSALEM, Israel -- The head of Israel's general staff, General Gabi Ashkenazi, told an Israeli investigating panel Wednesday (August 11th) that he is taking responsibility for his troops' actions during the May 31st raid on a Turkish-led aid flotilla to Gaza that left nine people dead. 
Ashkenazi says the troops underestimated the threat and should have used more force to subdue the activists before boarding. 
"We should have ensured sterile conditions in order to dispatch the forces in a minimum amount of time," he said. 
"It would have lowered the risk to our soldiers but it would not have prevented the tension ... 
Once the decision was made to stop the ship, the conflict was inevitable," he said, adding he is proud of the Israeli soldiers. 
He also defended their right to shoot, arguing they felt their lives were in danger.

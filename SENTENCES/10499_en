BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic kicked off a five-day visit to the United States on Sunday (17 October). 
During his stay, he will meet with representatives of international financial institutions as well as with US businesses interested in investment opportunities in RS and BiH.
Before leaving, Mikerevic signed a bilateral agreement on international transportation with Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister Nikolay Vassilev. 
The deal is expected to boost co-operation in trade and tourism.
On Sunday, the rebuilt Serb Orthodox church "Presveta Bogorodica" reopened in Mostar. 
The 15th-century church was devastated in 1992 during the BiH conflict.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- At a meeting with High Representative Miroslav Lajcak on Tuesday (December 11th), leaders of the six largest parties in BiH agreed to establish a working group that will draft police reform legislation.
After the meeting, Lajcak told reporters that an important consensus had been reached on issues related to police reform and the EU integration reform agenda.
During a meeting Monday, EU foreign ministers welcomed the renewed commitment of local political leaders to police reform and other positive developments in the BiH, but also expressed concern over the slowdown of the reform process.
They praised the recent initialling of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, but reiterated that signing that agreement is contingent on police reforms and full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Former President Branko Crvenkovski was unanimously elected leader of the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM) on Sunday (May24th).
In his speech to the party's congress, he stressed that the SDSM has been in crisis for a long time and needs broad reform to become a real opposition to the ruling VMRO-DPMNE and to win the 2012 general elections.
Crvenkovski accused the ruling party of failing to attract sufficient foreign investments, tolerating political appointments and exerting pressure on the judiciary.
Crvenkovski led the SDSM until 2004 when he was elected president of Macedonia.
He decided not to seek a second term and did not compete in the March election, opting instead to focus on party leadership.

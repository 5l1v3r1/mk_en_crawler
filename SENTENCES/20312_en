ATHENS, Greece -- Police used tear gas on Saturday (January 12th) to disperse about 500 workers at the port of Piraeus.
They were protesting the planned privatisation of two of the three container terminals in the facility.
Protesters say the privatisation will boost export and import costs and lead to job cuts.
Four people were injured in Saturday's clashes, but there were no arrests.
In other news, two earthquakes measuring 5.2 and 3.8 on the Richter scale rattled Greece on Saturday.
The epicentre of the quakes was in the Aegean Sea, between the islands of Lesvos and Chios, about 220km southeast of Athens.
No injuries or damage were reported.

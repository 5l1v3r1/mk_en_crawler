LONDON, United Kingdom -- Britain has signaled that it would curb immigration from Bulgaria and Romania after the two countries join the EU, possibly as early as 1 January 2007. 
UK Trade and Industry Secretary Alistair Darling said on Sunday (20 August) that his government will abandon its open door policy and would allow only "properly managed" migration from the two countries. 
Britain was one of just three countries to open its labour market to people from the newly admitted EU members two years ago.

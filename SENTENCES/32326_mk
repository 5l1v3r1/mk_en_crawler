BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Adrian Nastase welcomed the position of the EU regarding the International Criminal Court (ICC) and immunity for US citizens. 
The EU Council of Foreign Ministers agreed this week that partial immunity could be applied.That position amounts to a compromise, given the Council's previous stance. 
Romania has signed an agreement with the United States, making any US citizen immune from ICC prosecution while on Romanian territory.

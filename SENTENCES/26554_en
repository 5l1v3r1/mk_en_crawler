ANKARA, Turkey -- Interior Minister Besir Atalay was unable Tuesday (November 10th) to present the government's proposed measures offering more rights to the Kurdish minority. 
He will try again on Thursday, as parliament debates the plan. 
Tuesday's session was interrupted by jeers from opposition nationalist lawmakers. 
Atalay said "the purpose of the initiative is to end terror and heighten the level of democracy." He added "We have not showed the slightest weakness on (fighting) terror. 
We want this suffering to end. 
Chronic terror has become a gigantic, evil business." (Zaman - 11/11/09; BBC, Reuters, Anadolu news agency - 10/11/09)

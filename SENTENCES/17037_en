TIRANA, Albania -- The Constitutional Court confirmed on Tuesday (2 May) that it has begun examining a dispute between Albania's central government and the local administration of Tirana over construction and legal issues. 
At issue is the Zog i Zi overpass, currently under construction in Tirana. 
It is the subject of a turf war between the city of Tirana and state officials. 
The wrangling has been criticised by the Council of Europe, which repeatedly urged both sides to resolve the problem.
In other news Tuesday, President Alfred Moisiu reiterated his concern over delays in the electoral reform process. 
He noted that there have been no tangible results since a political agreement was reached in December. 
Elections are to be held in the fall.

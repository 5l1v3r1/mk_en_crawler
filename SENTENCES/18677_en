ANKARA, Turkey -- Responding to attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the Turkish Army has launched a military operation in Southeast Anatolia -- the most extensive such action in years, local media reported Thursday (June 7th).
The army reportedly has imposed prohibited zones in three Turkish provinces and closed all border checkpoints with Iraq until September 9th.
It also has deployed troops and machinery along the border to control entry from Iraq.
The latest attack blamed on the PKK left seven Turkish soldiers dead in Anatolia on Monday.
A spokesperson says UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon is following the situation closely.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic on Thursday (24 November) formally proposed the division of Kosovo along ethnic lines. 
His plan, which was accepted by the government of Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, envisages an administrative division of the province and broad autonomy for ethnic Albanians. 
The proposal has already drawn fire from Serb nationalists, the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo and Western members of the international community.

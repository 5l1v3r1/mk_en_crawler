BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) issued an interim report on Bulgaria and Romania's progress Monday (February 4th), concluding that neither country has demonstrated sufficient progress in their anti-corruption efforts. 
Romania was reprimanded for the pace of high-level corruption cases. 
Bulgaria was urged to boost efforts against corrupt local authorities, and corruption in sensitive sectors such as healthcare and education. 
Despite the criticism, both Romania and Bulgaria were praised for efforts to reform their judiciaries.

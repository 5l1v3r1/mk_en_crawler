SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- World Bank Country Director for BiH Orsalia Kalantzopoulos warned on Friday (4 March) that the country risks losing $108m in assistance from the Bank because of delays in key social and economic reforms.
Kalantzopoulos, who is also the World Bank's co-ordinator for Southeast Europe, spent two days in BiH late last week meeting with officials from the central and entity governments.
She urged immediate action to prevent the loss of three Bank adjustment credits -- the Business Enabling Environment Structural Adjustment Credit, the Second Social Sector Structural Adjustment Credit and Economic Management Structural Adjustment Credit.
Kalantzopoulos said their cancellation could affect the attitudes of prospective investors and donors.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Prosecutors from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Croatia and Serbia arrived at the UN war crimes tribunal Wednesday (July 1st) for a six-month programme in which they will work alongside colleagues from The Hague. 
Welcoming them, tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz described it as a "new phase" in interaction between the Office of the Prosecutor and prosecution offices in the former Yugoslavia. 
He described the programme as "an important further step in ensuring the continuity of war crimes prosecutions, well after the tribunal fulfils its mandate".

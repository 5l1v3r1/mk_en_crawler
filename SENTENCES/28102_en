TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama said on Sunday (May 16th) that a formula to resolve the longstanding political crisis has been sent to the government. 
It calls for opening ballot boxes used during the disputed June 2009 general elections to an investigation by a third party, the Venice Commission. 
Prime Minister Sali Berisha, however, says he is unaware of such a proposal. 
Meanwhile, the hunger strike being staged by dozens of SP lawmakers and supporters is now in its 17th day. 
The protestors are demanding transparency regarding last year's vote and have warned they will not eat until a solution is found.

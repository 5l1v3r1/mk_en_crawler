SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Gjorge Ivanov said on Thursday (August 13th) that the Ohrid Framework Agreement demonstrates that Macedonia knows how to determine its future with the right decisions. 
To mark the eighth anniversary of the document's signing, the EU, the OSCE and the US missions to Macedonia issued a joint statement urging all politicians in the country to work harder to fully implement the Agreement. 
The opposition Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA), a signatory of the document, says the Agreement no longer functions and is calling for a new deal between Albanians and Macedonians. 
Imer Aliu of the DPA told a press conference Thursday that 95% of the agreement's provisions are not being implemented, including usage of the Albanian language and national symbols of the ethnic communities, equitable representation of ethnic minorities in state institutions, and decentralisation. 
The DPA is urging the junior partner in the ruling coalition -- the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration -- to leave the cabinet.

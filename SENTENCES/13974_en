THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The trial of the so-called "Vukovar Three" -- former Yugoslav Army officers Mile Mrksic, Miroslav Radic and Veselin Sljivancanin -- will start at the UN war crimes tribunal on 3 October, according regional media reports Tuesday (16 August). 
The three are charged in connection with the Ovcara massacre of nearly 300 Croatians and other non-Serbs who were removed from the Vukovar hospital and killed in Ovcara after being beaten and tortured. 
Their bodies were later buried in a mass grave. 
The tribunal recently decided to tackle the case itself, abandoning plans to transfer it to either Croatia or Serbia-Montenegro.

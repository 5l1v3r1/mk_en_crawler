BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Turkish Economy Minister Ali Babacan said on Tuesday (11 May) that local authorities are being patient about the progress of EU accession efforts and fully realise that it is a time-consuming process.
Speaking at a conference in Brussels organised by the World Bank, Babacan added that Turkey's membership would provide the EU a "bridge among cultures and religions" as well as an energy corridor.
Meanwhile, two crewmen are missing after a Turkish ship carrying trucks sank off the coast of Cyprus on Tuesday.

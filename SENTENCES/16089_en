SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Macedonian government will pay for former Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski's defence before the UN war crimes tribunal, under an agreement sealed between the outgoing cabinet and Boskovski's lawyer, Jedina Rasidovic, on Friday (14 July).
The justice ministry says the government approved the matter several months ago but decided to seal the accord only after the 5 July parliamentary elections.
Boskovski and former security official Johan Tarculovski are awaiting trial for crimes allegedly committed against ethnic Albanians in Ljuboten, during the 2001 interethnic conflict.

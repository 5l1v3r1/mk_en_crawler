SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Presidency Chairman Zeljko Komsic warned on Sunday (November 11th) that BiH will sue Croatia if Zagreb continues to build a bridge connecting the Peljesac peninsula with the mainland. 
Komsic was commenting on a statement by Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, who said in Mostar on Saturday that the bridge will be built regardless of opposition to it. 
BiH insists it cannot be built without complete agreement between the two countries, including issues related to the sea border in the Neum harbour. 
Sanader paid a short visit to Mostar to attend the convention of a main Croat party in BiH -- the Croat Democratic Union 1990.

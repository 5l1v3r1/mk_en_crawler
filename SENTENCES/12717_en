BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's security services are helping Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic evade justice, Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic said in an interview for the Financial Times on Monday (4 April). 
"Without that kind of protection, without that kind of network, it would be impossible for Mladic to be invisible," he said. 
Draskovic was also critical of Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's handling of the issue.

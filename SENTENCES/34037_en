PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UN police announced on Tuesday (29 July) that they seized 18kg of heroin worth more than $900,000 in an operation at the weekend.
A spokesman told reporters that two men and a woman have been arrested and that authorities are looking for a fourth suspect.
Police believe that the drugs were to be sold in Western Europe.
In other news Tuesday, a UN spokesman said Russian peacekeepers owe 500,000 euros to the Kosovo Electricity Company in unpaid bills.
The matter is being negotiated with the defence ministry in Moscow.
Russia pulled its troops out of Kosovo last week.

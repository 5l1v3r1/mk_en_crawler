ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police prevented about 100 farmers from using their tractors to block Croatia's border crossings with Hungary, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on Thursday (August 27th).
The farmers went to the crossings planning to protest low wheat prices.
However, they abandoned their plan after receiving assurances that Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor will meet with their representatives next week to discuss problems in the sector.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Police seized on Friday (July 3rd) more than 50kg of heroin at the Kapitan Andreevo checkpoint on the Bulgarian-Turkish border, media reported. 
The drugs were divided into 100 packages hidden under the seats of a Turkish-registered car. 
Two people were arrested.
Also Friday, police announced they have dismantled a major ring that printed counterfeit euro banknotes in the central town of Plovdiv. 
In a co-ordinated operation with Spanish police, police arrested 17 people in the area of Plovdiv and seized forged notes worth about 750,000 euros. 
The counterfeit banknotes first appeared in Spain in 2007, and later turned up elsewhere in Europe.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Media coverage of the presidential run-off has been suspended until after the polls close Sunday (February 3rd) evening. 
Candidates Boris Tadic and Tomislav Nikolic wrapped up their campaigning on Thursday with rallies that attracted thousands of supporters. 
"This is a decisive moment. 
There is only one option that will lead the country to a better life and joining the European Union," Tadic, the incumbent, told supporters in Belgrade. 
He also visited Kosovo, trying to attract the support of the Serb minority there.
Nikolic, in turn, talked about Kosovo to thousands of cheering supporters. 
"I don't mind the European Union and its values, but I have only one condition -- don't touch Kosovo," he said.

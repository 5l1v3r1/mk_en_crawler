SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Relations between Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian and the main Serb parties worsened again last week after Gregorian told some NGOs there is no freedom of press in the Republika Srpska (RS).
He added that the "RS media is veiled in darkness and torture".
On Friday (January 11th), RS's ruling Union of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) urged all Serb parties and administrative subjects to suspend contact with Gregorian.
According to the SNSD, Gregorian's claims are a "typical attempt to organise another strike at RS".
In a comment for the Dnevni Avaz newspaper Sunday, Gregorian insisted he was only trying to be constructive.

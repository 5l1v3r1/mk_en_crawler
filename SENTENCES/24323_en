BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prosecutors announced on Wednesday (March 11th) that they had dropped charges against Ion Iliescu, the honorary president of the Social Democratic Party. 
They had charged him with undermining state authority and communicating false information. 
However, criminal investigations on other charges are still under way, prosecutors noted. 
Iliescu was president of Romania between 1990 and 1996 and then again between 2000 and 2004. 
He has been under criminal investigation over his role in the June 1990 riots, which miners helped suppress, resulting in the deaths of about 100 people.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni predicted on Monday (July 20th) that Kosovo will become a UN member within the next five years, adding that the official request for candidate status has been initiated.
Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci noted however that this will also very much depend on events beyond Pristina's control.
"We expect to become a member of the UN as soon as possible but a lot of things will depend on the international geo-political developments," Kuci said.
The main obstacle would seem to be the lawsuit Serbia filed contesting the legality of Kosovo's independence, before the International Court of Justice.
In other news, Serb leader Milan Ivanovic in northern Kosovo was asked on Saturday to report to a police station in south Mitrovica, for suspected involvement in criminal acts.
Ivanovic said he had received a letter from a EULEX prosecutor.
He accused authorities of charging him with crimes he did not commit and said he will seek Belgrade's support.
He is suspected of organising and supporting terrorist groups, inciting ethnic, racial and religious hatred, and endangering UN and EULEX personnel.

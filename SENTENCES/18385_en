BUCHAREST, Romania -- At a rally late Wednesday (May 9th) suspended Romanian President Traian Basescu demanded the resignation of Tudor Chiuariu, the new justice minister.
Basescu said that he must intervene in the matter as would any responsible president who senses political influence over the judiciary.
Chiuariu recently sought the dismissal of a key anti-corruption prosecutor, Doru Tulus, a move critics -- including Basescu -- say is not justified.
In response Thursday, Chiuariu dismissed the comment as campaign rhetoric, in light of Basescu's battle to win next week's referendum on his impeachment.
Also Thursday, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu formally dismissed the head of the Internal Protection and Intelligence Department, General Virgil Ardelean.
He had submitted his resignation in July, along with the remaining intelligence services directors, after the escape of Omar Hayssam.
The Syrian businessman was the first citizen officially charged with terrorism in Romania, for alleged involvement in the kidnapping of three Romanian journalists in Iraq.
After a long search, Petre Albu, former chief of the Organised Crime Brigade, has been named to replace Ardelean.

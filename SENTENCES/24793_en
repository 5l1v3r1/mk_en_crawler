WASHINGTON, United States -- The US Helsinki Committee said on Thursday (June 4th) that Albania's general elections later this month presents an opportunity for the country to organise its first vote in line with international standards.
At a special session held in Washington, the committee urged Albania to address issues now, rather than on the eve of the June 28th elections.
The US Helsinki Committee is an independent government agency monitoring whether countries meet OSCE standards.
Albania's interior ministry has posted the names of eligible voters on its web site.
But local media reported on Friday that the lists include the names of dead people, something that has been an issue in past elections.

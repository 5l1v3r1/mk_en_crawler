ATHENS, Greece -- International police co-operation, asylum policies and migration problems were the main topics discussed during an Athens meeting Wednesday (April 20th) among the interior ministers of Bulgaria, Romania and Greece.
Bulgaria's Tsvetan Tsvetanov and Greek Citizens Protection Minister Christos Papoutsis proposed establishing a tripartite contact centre at the Bulgarian border checkpoint Kapitan Andreevo, together with Turkey.
They said they sent a letter to Turkish counterpart Osman Gunes outlining their idea.
The two ministers also agreed to dispatch Bulgarian police officers to patrol resorts in the Halkidiki peninsula in northern Greece, which attracts a substantial number of Bulgarian tourists every year.
Romanian Interior Minister Traian Igas thanked Greece for supporting Bucharest's efforts to join Schengen.
He stressed the need for further co-operation within Frontex, the EU's border control agency, and optimising information exchanges among Greece, Bulgaria and Romania aimed at fighting illegal migration and cross-border crime.

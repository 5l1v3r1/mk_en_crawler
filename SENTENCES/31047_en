PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Behgjet Pacolli on Monday (March 7th) visited the northern borders with Serbia accompanied by KFOR Commander General Erhard Buhler. 
They travelled on two KFOR helicopters that took them to border crossings controlled by Kosovo police and EULEX customs officials. 
"The goal of my visit there was to encourage people who are working at the customs checkpoints to continue working â¦ and to convey the message that they are not alone there and that they are under the care of Kosovo institutions," Pacolli said. 
The crossings do not tax imported goods; EULEX only registers them, which is an economic burden for authorities in Pristina.
Representatives of Serb parallel structures in the north slammed Pacolli's visit as a provocation on the eve of talks between Pristina and Belgrade.

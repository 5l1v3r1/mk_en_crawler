SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Turnout in next week's presidential runoff will again top 50 per cent, according to Georgi Kimov, head of the Brima Gallup polling agency.
He said Thursday (22 April) that the relatively low turnout in the first round was due to the common belief that none of the four candidates would win the post during that round.
Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski faces Sasko Kedev, of the main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE, on 28 April.

PRIJEDOR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The 14th anniversary of the killing of over 200 Prijedor Bosniaks by Bosnian Serb forces in Koricanske Stijene was marked on Monday (21 August) at the scene of the crimes. 
Relatives and friends gathered to honour the memory of the victims and to demand information from Republika Srpska authorities. 
Only one person has been convicted this far: in March 2004, the UN tribunal sentenced Bosnian Croat Darko Mrdja, a former member of the Bosnian Serb special police unit "Intervention Squad" to 17 years in prison, for crimes against humanity.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- EU Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten said Friday (6 December) that the Union would pledge 46m euros to Macedonia if it fosters economic reforms. 
During a two-day official visit, Patten met with Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski and President Boris Trajkovski. 
He said that Skopje must step up its economic reforms to make up for lost time, as neighbours Bulgaria and Romania are already much closer to EU membership. 
He also said the EU would wait until Macedonia signs a new arrangement with the IMF before releasing 20m euros in financial assistance. 
If the funds were utilised properly, Patten indicated, the European Commission would approve the additional 26m euros.
In other news, NATO Director for the Balkans Robert Serry met Sunday with President Trajkosvki and suggested that Ohrid could host the forthcoming regional conference on reducing poverty in the Balkans. 
Serry noted Ohrid's symbolic importance in terms of ethnic and political unification.

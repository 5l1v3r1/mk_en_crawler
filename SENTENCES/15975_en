BUCHAREST, Romania -- Two quarters of Bucharest have been quarantined because of bird flu suspicions, the national veterinary service announced Saturday (20 May). 
According to Bucharest Mayor Adrian Videanu, samples from birds found dead in the two sectors tested positive for the flu, but the strain has not been established yet. 
Local authorities started culling poultry and disinfection of the sealed-off areas. 
The disease has been found in some 60 localities in Romania, and another 25 are being examined for possible contamination.

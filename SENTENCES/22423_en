ATHENS, Greece -- Strengthening the status of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea Economic Co-operation (PABSEC) will raise the level of multilateral co-operation in the region, parliament speakers of PABSEC member countries said in a joint declaration after their meeting Monday (June 9th) in Athens. 
They were marking the 15th anniversary of the organisation's establishment. 
The statement pointed out that over the years, PABSEC has managed to create a secure foundation for gradual progress and has won the recognition of the regional community. 
PABSEC's creators sought to boost regional co-operation in fields like politics, environmental protection, trade, energy, transport, tourism, telecommunications, science and technology and the fight against terrorism.

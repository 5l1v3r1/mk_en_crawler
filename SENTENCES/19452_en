ZAGREB, Croatia -- In an interview for Croatian state television HRT, US President George W. Bush said on Thursday (March 27th) that he hopes he will have good news for Croatia following the NATO summit in Bucharest next week.
Croatia hopes to receive an official membership invitation, something Bush said the US "strongly supports".
He makes his first official visit to Croatia on April 4th, the day after the summit in Bucharest ends.
Separately Thursday, Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said he is upbeat regarding the summit.
Sanader said an invitation is certain, since Croatia has proved both its readiness to join NATO and the ability of its armed forces to meet NATO standards.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Security Minister Tarik Sadovic and EU Police Mission (EUPM) chief Vincenzo Copolla met on Wednesday (July 25th) and agreed that eventual police reform in BiH would not be "cosmetic", according to a statement from the Security Ministry afterwards.
"Reform isn't a revolution," he said, referring to police reform in Republika Srpska.
Rather, he said, change would be achieved over time.
Copolla and Sadovic both agreed BiH's Security Ministry and the EUPM could be partners in the police restructuring process.
Meanwhile, RS President Milan Jelic announced on Wednesday that the entity has completed 90% of its police reforms required by the EU, and that the remaining 10% involve technicalities.

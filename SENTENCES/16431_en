PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The Montenegrin parliament voted Friday (10 November) to approve the first cabinet since the country gained independence earlier this year.
"The goals of this new government will be to continue Montenegro's path to European integration and have our citizens feel safer and live better in our country, and be able to work honestly to provide a good life for themselves and their families," incoming Prime Minister Zeljko Sturanovic said.
Forty-two deputies backed the 14-member cabinet and 28 opposed it, while 2 abstained.
The new prime minister received the endorsement of 44 lawmakers.
Twenty-six opposed him, with four abstentions.
Most of the positions in the new cabinet are filled by the candidates from the Democratic Party of Socialists.
Its coalition ally Social Democratic Party has one deputy prime minister and two ministries, and the Albanian Democratic Union controls one ministry.

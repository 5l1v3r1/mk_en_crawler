TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament was the scene of heated debate Monday (January 17th) with the opposition Socialist Party (SP) insisting that the whole government step down.
The catalyst was the resignation last week of Ilir Meta, deputy prime minister and minister of economy and trade, over a video alleging corruption in awarding contracts.
At the start of the session, the first of this year, opposition lawmakers immediately started accusing the government of corruption and asked for early parliamentary elections.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha responded by accusing SP leader Edi Rama of deliberately preparing the video against his coalition partner, Meta.
Following Berisha's speech, opposition lawmakers blocked the speaker booth for hours.
Eventually, the majority adopted the changes in the new government as they were decreed earlier in the day by President Bamir Topi.
Nasip Naco will serve as economy, trade and energy minister, while Edmond Haxhinasto will take Meta's post as deputy prime minister.

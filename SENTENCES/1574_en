US Assistant Secretary of State Philip Gordon began a tour of countries in Southeast Europe with a stop in Belgrade.
He told officials that Serbia-US ties are on the mend despite differences over Kosovo, but cautioned that the issue could hamper EU accession.
He next travelled to Pristina, where he reiterated Washington's support for an independent Kosovo and said the United States is working to boost the number of international recognitions.
Kosovo and Serbia are sovereign states and any talks between them must be conducted on that basis, he added.
The final leg of Gordon's tour was Macedonia, where he called for a swift solution to the name dispute with Greece.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- EU representative in Macedonia Erwan Fouere is calling on the opposition to return to parliament and resume dialogue with the ruling coalition. 
After talks with the leader of the main opposition SDSM, Branko Crvenkovski, on Wednesday (February 2nd), Fouere voiced concern, stressing that a boycott is no solution to problems. 
Crvenkovski accused the cabinet of undemocratic rule.
Separately, visiting Slovenian Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar also voiced concern about the situation. 
After meeting with Macedonian counterpart Antonio Milososki, Zbogar reiterated Slovenia's support for Macedonia's EU bid but underscored the need for further reforms and a solution to the longstanding name dispute with Greece.

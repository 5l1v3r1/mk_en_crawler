BUCHAREST, Romania -- At an extraordinary meeting Monday (February 28th), the cabinet approved the final version of the labour code and sent it to parliament for emergency procedure initiation.
That means a bill is adopted without parliamentary debate or votes.
While it accelerates the process, it allows the opposition the opportunity to initiate a no-confidence motion against the cabinet.
Both trade unions and employers' associations are unhappy with changes to the labour market regulations included in the bill, and the unions have threatened to stage protests.
Crin Antonescu and Victor Ponta, leaders of the opposition alliance, the Social-Liberal Union, announced plans to submit a fresh no-confidence motion against the cabinet for the procedural move.
Analysts view the new no-confidence motion as a formality.
The opposition still lacks a parliamentary majority after failing to bring down the government several times late last year.

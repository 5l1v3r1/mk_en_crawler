SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government launched an official campaign Monday (January 21st) dubbed "I want light", aimed at building a basis to reopen two units of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant. 
They were decommissioned at the end of 2006 as a precondition for EU accession. 
Bulgarian and foreign experts suggested on Monday that the units should be reopened without the explicit permission of the EU, since they are safe and there is an electricity shortage. 
World Nuclear Association Chairman John Rich urged Bulgaria to inform European institutions of the reopening rather than seeking permission. 
But Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev was more moderate Monday, ruling out unilateral action.

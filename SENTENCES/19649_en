STRASBOURG, France -- The Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) reiterated concerns Tuesday (January 22nd) that Kosovo could become "a powder-keg and ultimately a frozen conflict in the Balkans". 
To prevent that, PACE urged the UN Security Council to do all it can to overcome differences and reach a compromise. 
In a resolution adopted on Tuesday, PACE called for a continuation of negotiations on Kosovo so a mutually acceptable solution is found.
In other news Tuesday, Romania reiterated its support for Serbia regarding both Kosovo and EU integration. 
Foreign Minister Adrian Cioroianu told visiting Serbian counterpart Vuk Jeremic that Romania believes Kosovo's future should be decided in accordance with the principles of international law, adding that if that does not happen, Romania would not recognise an independent Kosovo. 
He also said Romania is willing to provide expert support to Serbia in implementing EU-related reforms. 
Jeremic stressed that Serbia will be increasingly more creditworthy and stable as it aligns with the EU.

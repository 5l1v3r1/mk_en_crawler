PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Miroslav Lajcak, EU envoy for the Montenegrin independence referendum, disputed claims by the pro-union opposition that the vote was marred by serious irregularities. 
"The stories about stolen elections and a lynch mob atmosphere are not to be taken seriously," he told journalists in Podgorica Thursday (25 May), adding that he did not understand why the opposition leaders had asked the EU to mediate if they were not ready to obey the rules.
Supporters of preserving the state union with Serbia have submittted 241 complaints about alleged irregularities. 
They say discrepancies exist between the lists of eligible voters in polling stations and the ones in the central registrar. 
Unionists also claim that certain voters voted twice and that 5,700 people with permanent residence in Serbia, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina participated in the referendum. 
The Serbian government is reportedly providing the opposition with data to buttress its claims. 
The republican referendum commission, chaired by Czech diplomat Frantisek Lipka, will issue a ruling on the complaints.

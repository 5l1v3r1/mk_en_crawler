ATHENS, Greece -- The first working day of the New Year, Monday (January 3rd), started with fresh protests by employees in Athens' public transport, who have been striking for several weeks now. 
Trams, public buses, the subway and trains will not be running. 
Sector representatives have announced two other strikes -- on Wednesday and January 10th -- against government austerity measures that envision cutting salaries and restructuring public transport in the capital.

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic said on Saturday (4 January) that he did not feel responsible for the atrocities committed in Kosovo because they were beyond his control.
Speaking on national TV, Milutinovic said he would not resist arrest, but refused to disclose whether he would surrender to the international court in The Hague voluntarily.
His remarks came two days after a district court in Belgrade asked the Serbian government to authorise the execution of an international arrest warrant against him.
Serbian officials have said that a decision would be made after the Eastern Orthodox Christmas on 7 January.

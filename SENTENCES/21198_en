SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The main opposition group, the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia, demanded the resignation Sunday (September 30th) of Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska over her handling of an incident last week in which a TV Alsat cameraman was beaten by police. 
He had been taping the police as they stopped a vehicle containing two Democratic Union of Macedonia (DUI) members of parliament. 
The car with the MPs was allowed to go, but the police attacked the journalist and broke his camera. 
DUI says no charges have been filed against the police, despite Jankulovska's assurances to the contrary.

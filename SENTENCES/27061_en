BELGRADE, Serbia -- The country is co-operating fully with the UN war crimes tribunal, officials reaffirmed on Tuesday (November 3rd), ahead of a visit by Hague chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz. 
President Boris Tadic conceded the arrest of former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic is "a great obligation for the Serbian state and for its democracy" but warned against setting any deadlines for his capture. 
Rasim Ljajic, the head of Serbia's council for co-operation with The Hague tribunal, still believes that Mladic and fellow fugitive Goran Hadzic will be arrested by year's end. 
He has vowed to resign if this does not happen. 
Mladic's arrest is a key condition for moving Serbia closer to EU accession.

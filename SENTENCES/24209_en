SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Newly elected President Gjorge Ivanov wraps up a quick trip to Brussels Thursday (May 14th), where he travelled after his inauguration ceremony Tuesday. 
He and Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski met with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, who stressed that Macedonia belongs in the EU. 
He added that it is very possible for Skopje to start membership negotiations this year. 
Ivanov reiterated that Euro-Atlantic integration is a top priority for him. 
Earlier Wednesday, Gruevski met with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, discussing membership prospects and the long-standing name dispute between Macedonia and Greece.
In Skopje, meanwhile, Ilkka Laitinen, executive director of the European Agency for the Management of External Borders, FRONTEX, praised Macedonia on Wednesday for its progress in border management. 
Meeting with Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska, Laitinen noted that the decision to liberalise the visa regime for Macedonian citizens travelling to EU countries depends on the European Commission.

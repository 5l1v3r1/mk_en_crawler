ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Zagreb County Court rejected on Tuesday (October 31st) a request from lawyers representing parliament member Branimir Glavas to release him from custody.
He was ordered detained for 30 days last week, to prevent him from influencing witnesses.
He is charged with war crimes against Serb civilians in Osijek in 1991.
Glavas launched a hunger strike after he was arrested and reportedly was admitted to the prison hospital Monday evening.

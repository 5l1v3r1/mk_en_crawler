PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- UNMIK chief Michael Steiner suggested on Monday (2 December) that Kosovo still has long way to go before contemplating independence.
He met with Prime Minister Bairam Rexhepi to discuss whether the government has met the pre-requisites for launching a dialogue on independence.
"It is not easy to resolve everything at once, and most important is that progress is made in that direction," Steiner said, describing the meeting as useful.
In other news, the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague confirmed Monday that it is investigating potential war crimes committed by Albanians in Kosovo.
Florence Hartmann, a spokeswoman for the prosecutors, indicated that most of the evidence has come from Kosovo Serbs.
Belgrade continues to deny access to Yugoslav Army archives that could assist in the investigations.

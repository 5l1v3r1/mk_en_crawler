SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The international community's High Representative in BiH, Paddy Ashdown, told a news conference Monday (3 March) that he and the members of the so-called Bulldozer Committee expect local authorities to scrutinise and then implement 50 crucial legal amendments within a 39-day term. 
Suggestions for economic changes drafted by the Committee are aimed at eliminating bureaucratic obstacles in BiH. 
Ashdown formed the Committee last November, staffing it with successful businessmen, with an eye to creating job opportunities in the country.

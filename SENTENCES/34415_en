LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- The mayors of Zagreb, Belgrade and Ljubljana signed a letter of intent aiming to boost co-operation among the cities in the field of local governance. 
The three mayors signed the document Friday (17 October) during a meeting in the Slovene capital.
On Thursday, the Slovene government took another step in support of political and economic ties with Croatia by extending the validity of the bilateral fishing code, agreed on last year. 
Separately, the government sent a bill to parliament for ratification of a border control accord with Croatia on roads and railways.

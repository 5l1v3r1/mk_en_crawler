PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Incumbent Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, whose party won snap electons in December, said on Friday (February 11th) he has managed to secure support to form a coalition government.
He said his Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) will form a coalition with the New Kosovo Alliance (AKK) party, the Ibrahim Rugova List and other ethnic minority parties.
The parties that turned out second, third and fourth at the vote -- the Democratic Party of Kosovo (LDK), the Vetevendosje Movement, and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo -- have refused to join forces with the PDK.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Top war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic is hiding in Republika Srpska (RS) with the help of the local police, RS Vice President Ivan Tomljenovic said in an interview published Saturday (22 May). 
"It is certain that within the Bosnian Serb interior ministry there are people who co-operate with Karadzic, some because they are paid for it and some out of fear," he said.
On Friday, SFOR held an unannounced routine operation in the eastern BiH town of Bileca. 
SFOR officials said it aimed at "prevent anti-Dayton activities" and that it had been conducted jointly with the RS police.
Also on Friday, the Bosnian Muslim Commission for Missing Persons reported that it has completed work on a recently discovered mass grave near Vlasenica. 
Experts have found the remains of 62 of 72 Muslim civilians, including 16 children and 10 women, who were killed in the village of Zaklopaca in May 1992.

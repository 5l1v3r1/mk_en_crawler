TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Socialist Party (SP) said again on Monday (September 28th) that its members will return to parliament only if a thorough investigation is conducted into the June general elections, which it considered manipulated. 
SP secretary and parliament member Blendi Klosi said there can be no reforms when voting rights are not guaranteed. 
Prime Minister Sali Berisha is urging the SP to quit its boycott and start dialogue on the necessary reforms.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Republika Srpska (RS) President Milorad Dodik said on Thursday (April 28th) that Serbia should not interfere in Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) political situation but the country, as a guarantor of the Dayton Peace Agreement, should get involved if problems escalate with the High Representative and his imposed decisions.
In an interview with Belgrade-based B92, Dodik also said that RS will not drop plans to hold a referendum on High Representative-imposed laws, particularly regarding the BiH Court and Prosecutor's Office.
Commenting on Serbian President Boris Tadic's statement that Belgrade will not support a referendum that could ultimately lead to the division of BiH, Dodik said that it is logical and in line with Serbia's official policy.
He meets on Thursday with Patriarch Irinej and participates in a round table concerning the upcoming referendum in RS.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey and Iraq announced on Saturday (October 27th) that they are not planning new talks on the Kurdistan Workers' Party's (PKK) use of northern Iraq as a staging ground for terrorist attacks in Turkey.
In a meeting between senior ministers, Ankara rejected Baghdad's proposed measures for coping with the militants.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the Iraqi offer did not meet his government's demands and reiterated that his country will not tolerate the PKK's attacks.
Nevertheless, Turkish Chief of General Staff General Yasar Buyukanit said a cross-border operation will not be held before the November 5th meeting between Erdogan and US President George Bush in Washington.
On November 2nd, US Secretary of State Condoleeza Riceâs will travel to Ankara to discuss the crisis with Turkish authorities.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko said on Saturday (November 20th) that implementing EU-bound economic, social and constitutional reforms would directly address the economic and institutional challenges facing BiH. 
In a statement on the eve of the 15th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Agreement on Sunday, Inzko recalled that BiH's citizens have clearly stated what they want -- "a country that works, functionality strengthened, a country governed by the rule of law, a country that allows its citizens to live in dignity." According to him, this can be achieved if the parties "form governments without delay and get down to the work they were elected to do." (OHR, Radio Free Europe - 20/11/10)

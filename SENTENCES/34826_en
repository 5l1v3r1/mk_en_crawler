ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer approved a law on Tuesday (5 August) that would grant amnesty to Kurdish rebels who lay down their arms.
The government estimates that about 2,000 fighters are likely to surrender under the legislation, which also provides for reduced prison terms for individuals who took part in armed action.
The measure does not apply to the leaders of the rebel movement.

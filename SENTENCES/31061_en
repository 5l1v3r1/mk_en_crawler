SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Hundreds of tobacco growers blocked an international road near the border with Greece on Wednesday (January 5th), protesting the government-set prices for their crops.
Farmers claim they should get an average of 3.12 euros per kg of tobacco instead of the 2.32 euros they are being paid.

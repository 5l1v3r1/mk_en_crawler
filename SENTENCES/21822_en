BELGRADE, Serbia -- UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier and Serbian government representatives agreed on Wednesday (July 23rd) to launch talks on UNMIK's reconfiguration.
At a meeting with Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic and Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic, Zannier confirmed that UNMIK will continue to work neutrally and in full compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244.
He also pointed out that the most important goal is to maintain peace and stability in the region.
Jeremic and Bogdanovic reiterated Serbia's stance that any reconfiguration requires confirmation by the UN Security Council, demanding observance of the rights of the Serb minority in Kosovo and preservation of Serbia's territorial integrity and sovereignty.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is working to transfer most of UNMIK's powers to EULEX, the new EU-led mission in Kosovo.
As part of that effort, UNMIK announced on Wednesday that it will stop issuing travel documents to Kosovo citizens, now that the government has announced plans to begin issuing passports next month.

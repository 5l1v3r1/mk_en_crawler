PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UN Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon is aware of the Kosovo Albanian leaders' aspirations to gain independence after December 10th, UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker told a press conference in Pristina on Wednesday (November 7th).
He added that UNMIK supports the work of the international troika mediating the talks.
Ruecker urged international forces in Kosovo to be prepared for any outcome of the status talks but did not answer a question about what he or his administration would do if Kosovo independence is declared by December 10th.
Instead, he urged Kosovo Serbs to participate in the November 17th parliamentary election, despite calls from Belgrade to boycott it.
In other news Wednesday, a new poll by the local Kosovo Index agency suggests 75% of people in the province support the unilateral declaration of independence.
The number jumps to 90% if the US and the EU back the declaration.
Also Wednesday, Kosovo's negotiating team kicked off a tour of European capitals, seeking support for the province's independence.
The first stop was Portugal, which currently holds the EU's rotating presidency.

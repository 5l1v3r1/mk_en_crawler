PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The ruling Democratic Party (PDK) urged President Fatmir Sejdiu on Thursday (December 17th) to persuade his party to recognise the results of the recent local elections. 
His Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) has disputed the preliminary results of the vote in four municipalities where a second round was held on December 13th, arguing those results were manipulated. 
PDK deputy leader Hajredin Kuci said Sejdiu should intervene and make the LDK accept the decisions of the Central Election Commission. 
But under the constitution, Sejdiu was forced to "freeze" his post as LDK leader after he was elected president in February 2006.

TIRANA, Albania -- The defence ministry plans to destroy 20,000 tonnes of old ammunition by the end of the year, local media reported on Saturday (October 23rd). 
The dismantling process, under the guidelines of an action plan, is being conducted at three official locations. 
Starting next year, the process will be ramped up, to destroy all old ammunition by 2013. 
In March 2008, 26 people died and hundreds were injured as a result of an explosion in an unsecured ammunition depot just outside Tirana.

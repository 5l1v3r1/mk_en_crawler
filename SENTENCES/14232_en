BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu on Thursday (12 January) urged the government to borrow some 30 billion euros by 2013 to fund new highways and rural development.
He said the country is due to get the same amount from the EU in 2007-2013.
Basescu said the plan was feasible in view of Romania's low foreign debt.
The government already plans to invest the proceeds from ongoing privatisation in fixing roads, schools and hospitals.
Basescu praised the goal of EU accession in 2007, but insisted the government must focus on other issues as well, such as infrastructure.

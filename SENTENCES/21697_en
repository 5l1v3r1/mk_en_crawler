PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government's report on its first 100 days in office and its 2008-2011 development programme sparked heated debate in parliament Monday (April 21st).
The opposition criticised the latter for failing to include any timeline for proposed projects.
The government also absorbed criticism for operating without a programme, as its four-year platform became public only last week, more than three months after the general elections.
Addressing MPs, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said the main goals would be status implementation, economic growth, good governance and the fight against poverty.

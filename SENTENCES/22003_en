LONDON, United Kingdom -- Foreign Secretary David Miliband on Thursday (November 20th) welcomed the future of Kosovo "in the European family" during a meeting with the young country's President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci in London.
Miliband hailed the officials' commitment to support the deployment of the EU-led mission in Kosovo, EULEX, stressing that the deployment is a crucial stage in the country's development.
Thaci reiterated Pristina's opposition to the six-point plan for deployment proposed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
He said Kosovo has its own four-point plan that envisions deployment in all areas, including in Serb-dominated ones.
In other news, Kosovo police arrested three people Wednesday in connection with the blast at the International Civilian Office in Pristina a week ago.
On Thursday, officials described them as German nationals who were visiting Kosovo.

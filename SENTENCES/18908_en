SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The country's main opposition parties, the Social Democratic Alliance for Macedonia (SDSM) and the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), are again skipping a meeting of party leaders that Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski scheduled for Friday (January 5th). 
In an exchange of letters Thursday, SDSM leader Radmila Sekerinska said she would participate only if the government withdraws draft amendments of the electoral code, prepared without input from the opposition. 
Gruevski says he cannot withdraw a bill that has not even been approved by the cabinet, let alone forwarded to parliament. 
Sekerinska and DUI leader Ali Ahmeti refused to attend a similar meeting of party leaders held in late December.
In other news, the Defence Ministry held a ceremony Friday to send off 126 Macedonian troops joining NATO's Afghanistan mission. 
This is the second rotation; 90 soldiers already are deployed there.

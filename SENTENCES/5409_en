Award-winning poet Ivana Simic Bodrozic published her first novel Hotel Zagorje this spring. 
It immediately became a literary sensation in the country.
"It is the best war story ever written in Croatia," critics wrote, complimenting her literary style that renders a powerful yet touching story with ease.
SETimes talked with Bodrozic, a young mother of two, about the success of her first novel.

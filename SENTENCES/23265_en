SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The ethnic Albanian party Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) set a deadline for its coalition partner VMRO-DPMNE to resolve the name dispute with Greece and move the country's stalled Euro-Atlantic integration process ahead by the end of the year.
If not, the Albanians will look for new alternatives, DUI member Teuta Arifi told the local Alsat M TV channel Thursday (May 28th).
She warned that any attempt to change Macedonia's course towards EU and NATO integration is dangerous.
Greece has blocked Macedonia's NATO bid over the two countries' long-standing name dispute.
Opinion polls show that ethnic Albanians are more willing to compromise than Macedonians, who link the country's name with their identity.
Separately Thursday, DUI leader Ali Ahmeti said the ruling coalition is stable and his party will not quit the government.
His comments came after Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu cancelled his visit to Macedonia amid reports suggesting he would not be received with state honours.

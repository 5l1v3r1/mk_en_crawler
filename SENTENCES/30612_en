BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania has met all performance criteria and targets, the IMF said in an official statement Monday (May 9th) at the end of the first review mission under the new 5 billion-euro two-year precautionary stand-by agreement. 
The second tranche, worth about 475m euros, will therefore become available to the country after approval by the IMF Board. 
The cabinet reached the fiscal targets, but reform in state-controlled companies is critical in order to eliminate their arrears and to reduce subsidies. 
The IMF suggested that private management in these money-losing companies should be involved to restructure, close or privatise them. 
The IMF mission concluded that the banking sector remains stable, well-capitalised and liquid.

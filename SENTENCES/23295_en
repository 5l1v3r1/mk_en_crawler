SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) wraps up a two-day meeting in Sarajevo on Tuesday (June 30th).
Senior diplomats representing the countries and organisations overseeing peace-implementation in BiH are holding talks with the main political leaders.
Discussions focus on delays in implementing key reforms, problems related to state and military property and progress towards Euro-Atlantic integration.
The Steering Board is also assessing progress towards fulfilling the conditions for the Office of the High Representative's (OHR) transition into the Office of the EU's Special Representative.
Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik wants the OHR closed down and said RS considers any future use of the high representative's Bonn powers unacceptable.
Sulejman Tihic, leader of the Party of Democratic Action, warned diplomats that in the current political situation, closing down the OHR could lead to blockade of state institutions and tensions that could threaten peace.

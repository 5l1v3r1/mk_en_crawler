TIRANA, Albania -- An explosion Wednesday (October 7th) at a hotel in Golem, near the port city of Durres, injured five students from Kosovo, two of them seriously.
A heating device triggered the early morning blast, which heavily damaged interior walls on the second floor and collapsed one balcony, due to substandard construction.
Police are questioning the owner and five hotel employees.
About 60 students had been staying at the hotel this week.

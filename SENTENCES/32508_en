PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Radio B92 reported Tuesday (11 March) that Montenegro has agreed to allow representatives of Serbia to occupy two key cabinet seats in the new federal government. 
Sources say that, for the sake of compromise, the Montenegrin ruling parties agreed to offer the defence and foreign affairs ministries to Serbia. 
By law, both seats are not to be held by any single republic in the federation. 
However, Montenegro is reportedly satisfied that the deputy head of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists, Svetozar Marovic, was elected president and prime minister.

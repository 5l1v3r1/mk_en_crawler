BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The Brussels-based International Crisis Group issued a report Tuesday (3 December) calling for sanctions against Yugoslavia if it fails to get to the bottom of the scandal involving sales of military hardware to Iraq.
The report concluded that President Vojislav Kostunica and Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic should have known about the transactions, and blamed their rivalry for the slow pace of reform.
"The disclosures ...
show that civilian control over the military is still absent, that connections between criminal, military and political elements are extensive." Both Yugoslav and Serbian authorities played down the importance of the report.
Kostunica dismissed it, saying an NGO is not in a position to make such accusations.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- An estimated 1,000 people protested on Thursday (October 1st) against the IMF and the World Bank annual meetings being held in Istanbul.
Organised by the trade unions and leftist political parties, flag-waving demonstrators marched down Istiklat Boulevard amid tight security before dispersing peacefully.
The meetings begin next week, but are preceded by a series of events and conferences.
On Thursday, a young Turkish student threw his shoe at IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who was giving a lecture at Bilgi University.
The student was briefly detained.

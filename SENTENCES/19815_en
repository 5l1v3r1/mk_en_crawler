ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ali Babacan and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice talked by phone Wednesday evening (December 19th) about Turkey's cross-border operation in northern Iraq, which targeted terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) camps.
Babacan reportedly thanked Rice for intelligence information provided by the United States and stressed the only purpose of the incursion was to fight the PKK.
He pledged that Turkey respects Iraq's territorial integrity and has no interest in its natural resources.
Rice agreed that while intelligence co-operation is good, the situation in Iraq remains sensitive.
Following airstrikes Sunday, hundreds of Turkish ground troops crossed the border late Tuesday to hunt for PKK militants.
Senior Turkish officials suggest the army is prepared to conduct more raids as needed.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Personal reasons are said to be behind the suicide of the former head of the archive of the National Intelligence Service (NIS) and incumbent NIS volunteer official Bozhidar Doychev last Wednesday (November 15th). 
He was found dead at his desk in the NIS building, with the gun nearby. 
Word of the suicide was concealed for over 24 hours, sparking reports of a coverup. 
Doychev kept the files of Bulgaria's Communist-era secret police, information that was scheduled for release within weeks.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- UN special envoy for Kosovo status talks Martti Ahtisaari met with Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and Serbian-Montenegrin Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic in Belgrade on Thursday (24 November).
Ahtisaari reiterated the principles of the Contact Group on the Kosovo issue, saying that status negotiations are UN-led and that there are no deadlines for their conclusion.
Kostunica presented Ahtisaari with the resolution on Kosovo recently adopted by the Serbian Parliament, and informed him that Serbia has formed its negotiations team.
The team will be headed by Kostunica and Serbian President Boris Tadic, and includes Draskovic, representatives of Kosovo Serbs and the advisers of the president and prime minister.
Thomas Fleiner, a professor at the University of Fribourg Law School, will be the permanent adviser.
In related news, Austrian President Heinz Fischer expressed his confidence that the group led by Ahtisaari will do an excellent job of calming tensions in Kosovo and preparing the grounds for solving the status issue.
Fisher's comments came after his meeting with his Serbian-Montenegrin counterpart, Svetozar Marovic, on Thursday.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Foreign and EU Integration Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic said on Tuesday (5 September) that the country is very close to NATO membership. 
In a speech to the International Summer School organised by the Croatian Atlantic Council on Sipan Island, she said Zagreb has made considerable progress in implementing political and defence reforms, and in fulfilling the legislative and security criteria for NATO entry. 
Croatia expects to get a clear signal regarding its membership bid during NATO's November summit in Riga.

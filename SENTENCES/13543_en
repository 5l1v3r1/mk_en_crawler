ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan dismissed on Wednesday (21 December) the possibility of lowering the current 10 per cent election threshold in the country.
A proposal to cut the threshold to some 7 per cent or 8 per cent was discussed during a meeting Tuesday between President Ahmet Necdet Sezer and leading representatives of the business community.
Erdogan, leader of the ruling Justice and Development Party, said the status quo should be preserved, so the political situation remains stable as Turkey proceeds with EU membership talks.

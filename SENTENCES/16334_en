MALA RECICA, Macedonia -- Ali Ahmeti, leader of the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), said on Thursday (10 August) that his party would not accept the role of opposition. 
In a press statement, Ahmeti urged VMRO-DPMNE leader and Prime Minister-designate Nikola Gruevski to reconsider the decision to exclude DUI from the new cabinet, if Gruevski wants to be "a premier of all citizens in Macedonia". 
Ahmeti insists that Gruevski's decision is a violation of the Ohrid Peace Accords, as DUI won the majority of ethnic Albanian votes in the 5 July parliamentary elections. 
VMRO-DPMNE denies any violation of Ohrid, since the Democratic Party of Albanians is part of the new coalition government.

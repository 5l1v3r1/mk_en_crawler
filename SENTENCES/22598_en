ZAGREB, Croatia -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn kicked off a two-day visit to Zagreb on Wednesday (November 12th) to encourage Croatia to implement reforms needed to complete EU accession talks. 
Discussions will focus on relations between Croatia and the bloc in light of the European Commission's recent progress report on the country, as well as on the possible schedule of talks, which are expected to end in 2009. 
Rehn will meet with Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, President Stipe Mesic and other senior officials.
In other news, Britain extradited to Croatia on Tuesday a Croatian Serb wanted for war crimes committed during the 1991-1995 war. 
In 1993, Croatia sentenced Damir Travica in absentia to 15 years in prison for the murder of a family of four in Ervenik, Croatia. 
The court also convicted him of persecution of civilians and destruction of property from May 1991 to February 1992 in the same region. 
According to the British Home Office's records, Travica entered the country with a false passport in 1995 and was arrested in November 2002. 
He spent the ensuing years appealing Croatia's long-standing extradition request.

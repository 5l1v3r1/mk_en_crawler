PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Officials in Pristina say they will not engage in any talks with Belgrade without mediation by the United States. 
A week after the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution that opens the door to talks, no format or timeline has been set. 
The resolution foresees the EU playing a lead role in facilitating the talks. 
Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said on Thursday (September 16th) that the role of the United States in all Kosovo-related processes is irreplaceable. 
Opposition representatives also support Washington's role in talks with Belgrade. 
Officials reiterated however that talks will not include status or territory, rather technical issues of mutual interest.

LONDON, United Kingdom -- The UN announced on Tuesday (November 10th) that Britain is "formally renewing" its offer to hand over half of its sovereign territory in Cyprus to speed up settlement of the long-standing Cypriot issue.
In a statement, the UN office in Nicosia said London is ready to give up a plot of around 117sq km based on two conditions -- leaders of the Turkish and Greek communities devise a plan to reunify the divided island through negotiations and secure the support of the majority of people living in the north and in the south with formal ratification by both sides.
Cyprus was a British colony until 1960.
Britain maintains control over about 3% or 254sq km of the island.
Cypriot President Demetris Christofias is meeting in London on Wednesday with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday (October 31st) ruled out the option of holding parliamentary elections ahead of those scheduled for 2011. 
"From now on, elections will be held at set dates, with possible variations of a month or two," Erdogan told journalists in Istanbul, in response to media reports suggesting the government is looking to hold elections a year early. 
Analysts have said it is a possibility, given anticipated economic growth next year. 
The economic crisis this year has forced the government to increase spending by about 10%, amid high unemployment.

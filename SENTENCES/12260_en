ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said Sunday (12 December) that his conservative New Democracy party would nominate Socialist Karolos Papoulias as its candidate in the March presidential election. 
Papoulias, 75, was foreign minister in Socialist governments in 1985-1989 and 1993-1996. 
He was a member of parliament between 1977 and 2000. 
Socialist opposition leader George Papandreou welcomed Karamanlis' decision and said it was a sign of "Greek unity ... 
and a consensus that is needed for the presidency." (ANA - 13/12/04; AFP - 12/12/04)

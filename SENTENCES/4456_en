Bulgarians are Europe's unhappiest people, according to the EU's Second European Quality of Life Survey whose results were reported on Wednesday (March 25th).
The Dublin-based research agency Eurofound conducted the survey from September 2007 to February 2008.
It includes the responses of 35,000 people in the 27 EU member states, in the EU-candidate countries -- Croatia, Macedonia and Turkey -- and in Norway.
The Bulgarians hit the bottom of the list with a score of 5 for happiness and 5.8 for life satisfaction on a five-to-ten scale.
The Macedonians came just ahead by rating happiness at 6.3 and life satisfaction at 5.2.
These scores are well below the EU average of 7.5 for happiness and 7 for life satisfaction.
The 12 nations that joined the EU since 2004 -- termed "NMS12" -- scored an average of 7.2 for happiness and 6.5 for life satisfaction.
According to the survey, the Danes are Europe's happiest people.
The surveyors explain that happiness is an emotionally driven category, while life satisfaction relates to conditions such as income and employment status.
The results are not surprising.
Bulgaria has the lowest per capita GDP within the Union at 37% of the EU average, the survey said.
Household income in Bulgaria is 34% of the EU average.
Turkey and Macedonia have lowest per capita GDP overall.
However, household income in Turkey is slightly higher than in Bulgaria and Romania, amounting to 35% of the EU average.
In addition, "considerable income disparities emerge within countries", Eurofound said.
It listed Turkey and Macedonia as having highest income inequality.
"The total income received by the 20% most affluent people is about ten times higher than that received by the 20% of the population with the lowest income," it said.
Income inequality is lowest in Denmark, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Sweden.
The income level is related to other factors, such as employment status, education level, health status, age, gender, family size and composition.
"Unemployed people in the EU have equivalised household income amounting to only about half of that of employed and self-employed persons," surveyors explained.
"In the NMS12, jobless people receive an average 60% of the employed persons' average income." In the EU-candidate countries that proportion is about two-thirds.
Over 80% of the citizens of EU member states named health as a key criterion for quality of life.
More than two-thirds rated their health as very good or good, 24% viewed it as fair, and 9% as bad or very bad.
The higher percentages of people who rated their health as bad or very bad are all in the NMS12 and in the EU-candidate countries:
Lithuania 20%, Hungary 19%, Croatia 19% and Bulgaria 15%.
Respondents from the Nordic states and the Netherlands expressed the highest levels of trust in other people in their country.
Respondents in Cyprus reported lowest levels of trust.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The public debate on Serbia's draft national strategy for EU accession was completed Saturday (28 May), according to Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus.
The strategy outlines all measures to be implemented by 2010, when Serbia-Montenegro hopes to enter the Union.
The experience of other countries on the road to EU membership was incorporated in the process, said Labus.
The document was forwarded to the Council for European Integration for review and moves next month to parliament.
In other news, Belgrade's Special Co-ordinator for Kosovo, Nebojsa Covic, took issue Friday with UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen's presentation to the UN Security Council in New York.
Covic rejected Jessen-Petersen's generally positive assessment concerning the freedom of movement of Kosovo Serbs and progress in refugee returns.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- An Appeals Chamber of the Court of BiH has turned down Croatia's request for the extradition of politician Branimir Glavas, local media reported on Sunday (November 1st).
Judges concluded that Glavas can not be transferred to Zagreb because he holds Bosnian citizenship as well, and the two countries have no extradition agreement.
Glavas fled to BiH in May to avoid serving a ten-year sentence in Croatia for war crimes.

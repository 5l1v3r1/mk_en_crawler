BUCHAREST, Romania -- The High Court of Justice decided on Monday (May 11th) to postpone until June 29th the trial of former Economy Minister Codrut Seres and former Communication and IT Minister Zsolt Nagy on corruption charges.
The court delayed the hearing as some of the six defendants still lack defence attorneys.
Seres faces charges of treason and provision of classified commercial information related to the sale of state-owned companies.
Nagy allegedly allowed the leak of classified information and facilitated illegal privatisation deals between May 2005 and November 2006.
In other news, courts across Romania struggled to function for two hours Monday during a warning strike by civil servants.
They are demanding pay hikes and extra pay for extra hours.

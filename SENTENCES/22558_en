TIRANA, Albania -- Two simultaneous protests are planned for Sunday (August 10th) over the recognition of original property rights in the southern coastal town of Himara, local media reported.
One group, the Bregdeti Association, claims to have original documents for valuable coastal property.
The other group, led by Mayor Vasil Bollano, a member of the Greek minority in Himara, will protest on behalf of legal owners of the land and the rights of his community.
Some accuse him of abusing his position to forge the property documents for personal gain.
The unresolved property issues and lack of infrastructure have stymied tourism in Himara and the surrounding area.

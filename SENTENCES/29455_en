SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Sofia City Court on Wednesday (June 30th) sentenced Mario Nikolov, a local businessman and contributor to the Bulgarian Socialist Party, to 12 years in prison for organising a criminal group and committing fraud with SAPARD funds.
The case is among those being followed by the European Commission (EC) to assess the quality of the local judiciary.
A total of seven people, including Nikolov and his wife, were convicted of draining 7.5m euros in SAPARD funds.
Associates in Germany have already been sentenced in the case.
Nikolov was sentenced separately for money laundering in late March, while co-defendant Lyudmil Stoykov was acquitted.

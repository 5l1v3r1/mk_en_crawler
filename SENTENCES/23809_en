BUCHAREST, Romania -- The main opposition National Liberal Party (PNL) plans to file a no-confidence vote against the government over amendments to the penal and civil codes.
Party leader Crin Antonescu said on Sunday (June 21st) the PNL decided to act after the government announced it will endorse the draft laws.
But other policies are under PNL scrutiny as well.
"This will be a vote of censure on the entire activity of the government during the last six months," Antonescu said.
The most important amendments to the penal code concern bribery and conflicts of interest.
NGOs and other groups had criticised the amendment process for largely excluding public debate.

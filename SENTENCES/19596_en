PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Kosovo's outgoing prime minister, Agim Ceku, said on Monday (December 24th) that he remains resolved to create a new political party after he leaves office. 
Ceku's announcement negated speculation that he may join the Kosovo Reformist Party (ORA), which surfaced Sunday after ORA leader Veton Surroi stepped down. 
"I want to remain in Kosovo all the way through, to take part in the processes and be at Kosovo's disposal," Ceku said. 
He plans to step down from office in January when Hashim Thaci, who won the November 17th parliamentary elections, is expected to form the new government.
In other news, UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker will report to the UN Security Council on January 8th and 9th, Russian Ambassador to the UN Vitaly Churkin said Monday. 
Ruecker was expected to address the council this month, but was delayed due to the Council's agenda.

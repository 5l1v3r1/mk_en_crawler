BELGRADE, Serbia -- Washington and Moscow are holding talks to iron out their differences over a proposed plan for the future of Kosovo, the US ambassador to Belgrade said on Wednesday (April 11th). 
Michael Polt told reporters that the UN Security Council could adopt a resolution on Kosovo in late spring or early summer. 
The United States, he added, is talking about the plan with all other Security Council members, as well as with the other members of the international Contact Group for Kosovo -- Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia.
Also on Wednesday, UNMIK chief Joachim Rucker said the UN could wrap up its presence in Kosovo within 120 days of the adoption of a Security Council resolution on the province's future. 
If the plan drafted by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari is adopted, UNMIK would transfer most of its powers and operations to the Kosovo government and would be succeeded by an EU mission.
